Conventional hightemperature treatments often exceed the melting point of lithium metal, while mechanical alloying through high-energy ball milling struggles to produce a uniform interfacial coating. The magnetron sputtering offers a form of physical vapor deposition that can be conducted at room temperature with an inert atmosphere, providing a promising solution to address these challenges and depositing a uniform HEA interphase on lithium metal surfaces. The specific components of the HEA interphase can be further precisely manipulated, providing a promising strategy for effectively regulating the the Li<sup>+</sup> plating/stripping process.\n\nHerein, HEA interphase was rationally constructed on a lithium metal surface using magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The HEA interphase, denoted as AZCNF, exhibits controllable properties owing to the cocktail effect of various elements (Al, Zn, Co, Ni, and Fe). The abundant lithiophilic sites effectively regulate Li<sup>+</sup> flux distribution and facilitate Li<sup>+</sup> deposition. Additionally, the magnetic properties of AZCNF provide horizontal Lorentz force, effectively inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. Moreover, the anti-corrosion properties and high mechanical strength contribute to a highly stable anode/electrolyte interphase, effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth and associated corrosion. As a result, lithium anodes modified with AZCNF demonstrate exceptional stability in Li<sup>+</sup> stripping/plating cycling for over 4000 h at 2 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Moreover, the AZCNF-Li||LFP battery exhibits capacity retention of nearly 90% with a coulombic efficiency of 99.7% after 300 cycles at 1 C. Thus, the construction of a HEA interphase on the Li metal surface offers a novel approach to investigating the high-entropy regulation mechanism of Li<sup>+</sup> transport and deposition for stable Li metal batteries.\n\n## **2. Results and Discussion**\n\nA uniform HEA interphase was deposited onto the lithium metal surface using direct-current magnetron sputtering of an AZCNF target at room temperature within an argon atmosphere (**Figure 1**[a\\)](page-3-0) the activation energy for the AZCNF high-entropy interphase is 27.82 kJ mol<sup>−</sup>1, lower than that of the unmodified interphase (29.31 kJ mol<sup>−</sup>1), indicating improved facilitation of Li<sup>+</sup> migration on the HEA. The initial deposition curve (Figure [2i\\)](#page-3-0) for the unmodified Cu||Li and AZCNF-Cu||Li half-cells was conducted at 1 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 1 mAh cm<sup>−</sup>2. AZCNF-Cu||Li exhibits a significantly smaller overpotential (80.3 mV) compared to unmodified Cu||Li (237.8 mV), indicating a reduced nucleation barrier for Li<sup>+</sup> deposition due to the lithiophilic properties. Concurrently, multiphysics simulation is employed to simulate Li<sup>+</sup> concentration distribution during Li<sup>+</sup> deposition processes.[\\[39\\]](#page-9-0) The model depicts spatial distribution and dynamic changes in the cell system, visually representing Li<sup>+</sup> flux and electric field distribution. While unmodified Li leads to obvious accumulation of Li<sup>+</sup> at localized high-current density regions, resulting in nonuniform Li<sup>+</sup> deposition (Figure [2j\\)](#page-3-0), the AZCNF high-entropy interphase, with enhanced lithophilicity, effectively reduces local current density, ensuring uniform distribution of electric field and Li<sup>+</sup> flux (Figure [2k\\)](#page-3-0).\n\nThe cell performance of the AZCNF-modified Li anode was investigated and illustrated in **Figure(page-5-0) illustrates the Coulombic efficiency (CE) distributions of unmodified Cu||Li and AZCNF-Cu||Li at a current density of 2 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm<sup>−</sup>2. The Li||Cu half-cell with the high-entropy interphase maintains consistently high CE at 97.5% over 280 cycles. In contrast, the CE of the unmodified Li||Cu half-cell markedly declined after a mere 150 cycles. The AZCNF-Cu||Li cell consistently maintains a smaller overpotential of ≈67.3 mV compared to the 144.2 mV of the Li||Cu half-cell after 150 cycles (Figures S15 and S16, Supporting Information), showcasing the enhanced stability of the highentropy interphase and its excellent reversibility. The modified Aurbach method was used to calculate the specific CEs of these Li||Cu cells, where the Li anode with high-entropy interphase exhibits 98.7%, compared to 98.2% for bare Li (Figure S17, Supporting Information). The rate performance of the symmetrical cell was evaluated across various current density ranges (Figure [3c\\)](#page-5-0). With increasing current density, the cell with AZCNF-modified Li anode showed stable rate performance even at a high current density of 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. However, the voltage of the unmodified lithium cell failed at 2 mA cm-2 after 137 h, possibly due to lithium dendrite penetration through the separator.\n\nIn the long cycling test conducted at a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm<sup>−</sup>2, the unmodified lithium anode cell exhibited significant polarization voltage after 570 h. In contrast, the cell with AZCNF-modified lithium anode demonstrated robust cycle stability for over 4000 h, with notably reduced polarization voltage compared to the unmodified lithium anode cell (Figure [3d\\)](page-5-0) and the comparative analysis of charge transfer resistance (Rct) values are presented in Figure [3h.](#page-5-0) The semicircular impedance gradually decreased during the discharge stages, resulting in a gradual reduction in ionic conductivity. This reduction can be attributed to the continuous stripping of lithium metal from the surface. The impedance decreased to 44 and 64 ohms for the AZCNFmodified Li||AZCNF-modified Li and the Li||Li symmetric batteries, respectively. The interphase impedance of the AZCNFmodified Li cell was lower than that of the unmodified Li cell, indicating that the lithiophilic AZCNF effectively enhances surface ion transport capabilities and ensures stable Li plating/stripping behavior.\n\nThe in situ optical microscope was employed to visually observe the evolution of lithium dendrite growth and confirm the efficacy of the AZCNF high-entropy interphase in suppressing lithium dendrites.\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n## \na) The ionic conductivity of AZCNF interphase with varying sputtering durations; b) The CE of Li||Cu half-cell using the unmodified Li and AZCNF-Li at 2 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and 1 mAh cm<sup>−</sup>2; c) Rate performance of the symmetrical cell at current densities ranging from 0.2 to 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2; d,e) The cycling stability of symmetrical cell at different current densities.

Morphological changes of the lithium anode after 100 cycles are observed in Figure [4c,](#page-6-0) where numerous mossy lithium dendrites form on the surface of the unmodified lithium anode, resulting in severe pulverization. In contrast, the surface of AZCNF-modified Li appears even and exhibits a smooth morphology with no signs of pulverization (Figure [4d\\)](#page-6-0), demonstrating the substantial protective impact of the AZCNF high-entropy interphase on lithium metal.\n\nTo comprehensively elucidate the interfacial components, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth analysis was employed to characterize the interphase of AZCNF-modified Li anode after cycling.\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n## \nIn situ optical microscopy of Li<sup>+</sup> deposition process on a) unmodified Li and b) AZCNF-Li; SEM images of c) unmodified Li and d) AZCNF-Li anodes after 100 cycles at current density of 1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and areal capacity of 1 mAh cm<sup>−</sup>2; e) Schematic diagram of AZCNF HEA interphase; f) C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, Li 1s XPS spectra of the AZCNF-Li interphase at different etching times.\n\nTo further validate the chemical composition alterations beneath the surface, a high-resolution XPS depth analysis of AZCNF-modified Li was conducted with different etching times. The carbon content significantly diminishes upon additional etching, confirming the presence of an organic layer atop the SEI comprising ROCO2Li, ROLi, and Li2CO3 (Figures S19– S21, Supporting Information). The presence of Li─F and Li─N suggests the formation of LiF/Li3N SEI facilitated by TFSI<sup>−</sup> anions and adsorbed Li<sup>+</sup>. The inner layer predominantly consists of Li, N, O, and metal atoms, with their proportions remaining constant. Figure S19 (Supporting Information) illustrates the XPS analysis conducted on AZCNF-modified Li with varying etching times, revealing the presence of Al, Zn, Co, Ni, and Fe at concentrations of 0.89, 0.22, 0.47, 0.38, and 0.69 at %, respectively. The metal bonds observed in the XPS spectra of N 1s, Li 1s, and O 1s further validate the presence of an alloy layer beneath the SEI layers (Figure 4f; Figure S22, Supporting Information). These XPS results validate the in situ formation of an organic/metal alloy double-layer SEI on the AZCNF interphase as illustrated in Figure 4e, where the underlying high-entropy alloy promotes the uniform distribution of Li<sup>+</sup>, and the top organic layer enhances SEI toughness, ensuring consistent cycling stability of the lithium metal anode. In addition, SEM-EDS and XRD analysis of the high entropy interphase were conducted after Li plating/stripping. The similar elemental composition and structure indicate that the AZCNF interphase remains stable without significant changes (Figures S23–S26, Supporting Information).\n\nTo assess the potential applicability of the AZCNF-modified Li anode, a cell comprising the AZCNF-modified Li anode and LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode was constructed. **Figure(#page-7-0)**a depicts the extended cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Li||LFP cell at 1C (1C = 170 mA g<sup>−</sup>1). The AZCNF-modified Li||LFP cell maintains a high discharge specific capacity of 130 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> even after 300 cycles, with an 88% capacity retention rate and an average CE exceeding 99.7%.\n<span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n## \na) Cycling performance and b) rate performance of Li||LFP cell assembled with unmodified Li and AZCNF-Li anode and LFP cathode; c) Voltage profiles of AZCNF-Li||LFP cell at different rates; d) Cycling performance and corresponding e) voltage profiles of AZCNF-Li||LFP cell with high LFP cathode loading; f) Cycling performance of the AZCNF-Li||LFP pouch cell at 0.5 C. The inset shows the optical photos of the pouch cell; g) The optical photo of the pouch cell powering LED lights.\n\n68.1% and a CE slightly above 99.3%. Furthermore, the unmodified Li||LFP charge/discharge curve displays higher polarization compared to the AZCNF-modified Li||LFP (Figure S27, Supporting Information) across various cycles, potentially attributed to its inferior capability in inhibiting lithium dendrite formation. The rate capability of the assembled AZCNF-modified Li||LFP cell demonstrates high discharge specific capacities of ≈152.8, 150.2, 143.6, 132, 122.4, and 115.5 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 C, respectively, and the capacity fully recuperates after returning the current density to 0.1 C. In contrast, the discharge-specific capacity of the unmodified Li||LFP diminishes rapidly as the current density increases, highlighting the deficient ionic conductivity of unmodified Li. Furthermore, the charge-discharge curve of AZCNF-modified Li||LFP demonstrates a smaller polarization voltage at various current densities, compared to unmodified Li||LFP (Figure S28, Supporting Information), suggesting accelerated electrochemical reaction kinetics consistent with the symmetrical cell results. These enhanced performances effectively demonstrate that the AZCNF high-entropy interphase can protect the lithium metal anode.\n\nMeanwhile, the HEA interphase demonstrated a significant effect under high cathode loading (11.5 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2), effectively improving the cycling stability of the battery. This improvement is evidenced by a capacity retention rate of 81.57% after 300 cycles in Figure 5d,e. To further exemplify the practical application of the AZCNF-modified Li anode, an AZCNF-modified Li||LFP pouch cell with an N/P ratio of 3.74 was assembled for electrochemical testing. The initial capacity of the AZCNF-modified Li||LFP cell <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>exhibits 140.5 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.4 C, and the capacity remains stable at 120.7 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> over the following 50 cycles, with a capacity retention of 85.9% (Figure [5f\\)](# **3. Conclusion**\n\nAn amorphous HEA interphase was successfully created on the surface of lithium metal through room-temperature magnetron sputtering. The multifunctional interphase, with enhanced lithiophilic and magnetic properties, was achieved through the cocktail effect of the HEA, improving the regulation of Li<sup>+</sup> stripping/plating behavior in lithium metal anodes. The enhanced mechanical and anti-corrosion properties of the HEA effectively suppressed dendrite growth and ensured stable Li<sup>+</sup> deposition. Therefore, the assembled AZCNF-Li symmetrical cell demonstrated long-term stability over 4000 h at 2 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 1 mAh cm<sup>−</sup>2, while maintaining an average CE of 99.7% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study presents a novel approach to the roomtemperature formation of HEA interphase directly on lithium metal surfaces, offering a unique high-entropy regulation strategy for creating stable lithium metal batteries.\n\n"

#### **Abstract**

Sulfide solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with superior ionic conductivity and processability are highly promising candidates for constructing all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). However, their practical applications are limited by their intrinsic air instability and serious interfacial incompatibility. Herein, a novel glass-ceramic electrolyte Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 was synthesized by co-doping Li3PS4 with Bi and I for high-performance ASSLMBs. Owing to the strong Bi‒S bonds that are thermodynamically stable to water, increased unit cell volume and Li<sup>+</sup> concentration caused by P5<sup>+</sup> substitution with Bi3<sup>+</sup>, and the in situ formed robust solid electrolyte interphase layer LiI at lithium surface, the asprepared Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 SSE achieved excellent air stability with a H2S concentration of only 0.205 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> (after 300 min of air exposure), outperforming Li3PS4 (0.632 cm<sup>3</sup> g−<sup>1</sup> ) and the most reported sulfide SSEs, together with high ionic conductivity of 4.05 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> . Furthermore, the Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 effectively improved lithium metal stability. With this SSE, an ultralong cyclability of 700 h at 0.1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> was realized in a lithium symmetrical cell. Moreover, the Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18-based ASSLMBs with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode achieved ultrastable capacity retention rate of 95.8% after 300 cycles at 0.1 C.

## **1 INTRODUCTION**

All-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) represent a promising next-generation battery technology owing to their high energy density and superior safety characteristics in comparison to conventional lithium-ion batteries utilizing organic electrolytes[.1](#page-8-0) As a vital component of ASSLMBs, solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), including oxide, sulfide, and polymer SSEs, have attracted extensive attention and made remarkable breakthroughs over the past decades.[2–5](#page-8-0) Among them, sulfide-based glass-ceramic SSEs such as Li3PS4 have shown great promise for large-scale commercial application due to their straightforward preparation process and excellent ductility, facilitating tight solid‒solid contact through simple cold pressing[.6–11](#page-8-0) However, there are several key issues that are obstructing their development and practical application of sulfide SSEs in ASSLMBs, and the noteworthy one is their low ionic conductivity due to the disordered lattice structures, which limit the overall electrochemical performance of the battery. Additionally, severe side reactions occur between sulfide SSEs and lithium metal anodes, resulting in interfacial incompatibility, lithium dendrite formation, and eventual short-circuiting battery[.12–14](#page-8-0) Moreover, due to the hydrolyzation and generation of H2S toward moisture, the poor air stability of sulfide SSEs usually results in the structure/property degradation and increased fabrication costs[.3,15–20](#page-8-0)

Currently, several effective strategies have been developed to conquer these challenges in glass-ceramic sulfide

This work provides reliable strategy for designing advanced sulfide SSEs for commercial applications in ASSLMBs.

> SSEs. Heterovalent element substitution is a typical and effective method to improve the ionic conductivity of SSEs[.21–25](#page-9-0) For instance, Rajagopal et al. partially replaced the P5<sup>+</sup> with larger atomic radius and higher polarization of Sb5+, resulting in an improvement in ionic conductivity of Li7P3S11 from 1.40 to 2.55 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> . [26](#page-9-0) Meanwhile, hard and soft acids and bases theory has been employed by the strategies of partially or completely replacing the hard acid P5<sup>+</sup> with soft acid ions, and replacing S2<sup>−</sup> with hard base ions to improve the air stability of SSEs[.23–25](#page-9-0) Liu et al. used hard acid Zn2<sup>+</sup> and hard base ions O2‒ to partially replace P5<sup>+</sup> and S2<sup>−</sup>, respectively, which in turn enhanced air stability (exposure time 180 min, H2S release 0.018 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> ) of Li3PS4. [27](#page-9-0) Besides, the interface issues between SSEs and lithium metal anodes have been studied to realize their compatibility. In particular, the halide-rich sulfide SSEs can effectively suppress the side reactions and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites through the in situ formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer during battery operation[.1,22](#page-8-0) For instance, Li5.7PS4.7Cl1.3 achieved ASSLMBs with high reversible capacities and stable cyclability due to the formation of a LiCl-rich interface[.13](#page-9-0) Despite great progress, it remains a significant challenge to develop an advanced sulfide SSE with superior ionic conductivity, high air stability, and lithium anode compatibility for achieving ASSLMBs with exceptional performance[.28–32](#page-9-0)

> In this work, we report the synthesis of novel glassceramic Li3<sup>+</sup>2*<sup>x</sup>*P1<sup>−</sup>*x*Bi*x*S4<sup>−</sup>1.5*<sup>x</sup>*I3*<sup>x</sup>* (*x* = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) SSEs by co-doping Li3PS4 with BiI3 for

high-performance ASSLMBs. Benefiting from the strong affinity of Bi3<sup>+</sup> toward S2−, enlarged lattice volume, high Li<sup>+</sup> ion concentration, and in situ formed artificial LiI SEI layer between the lithium metal anode and the SSE, the resulting Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 possesses excellent air stability, high ionic conductivity (4.05 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> ), as well as enhanced lithium metal interface compatibility. As a result, the symmetric lithium metal cells using Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 achieved superior dendrite suppression capability up to a high critical current density (CCD) of 0.9 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and ultralong cyclability of 700 h at 0.1 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Moreover, the as-assembled ASSLMBs presented outstanding cycling stability (95.8% capacity retention after 300 cycles) and rate capability (169 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> at 0.05 C, 87 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> at 0.5 C), showcasing their promising applications for the next-generation high-energy-density ASSLMBs.

## **2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

As shown in Figures [1A](#page-3-0) and S1, a series of Li3<sup>+</sup>2*<sup>x</sup>*P1<sup>−</sup>*x*Bi*x*S4<sup>−</sup>1.5*<sup>x</sup>*I3*<sup>x</sup>* (*x* = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) SSEs were synthesized by ball milling and annealing of Li2S, P2S5, and BiI3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to determine the effect of Bi and I co-doping amount on the structure of the SSEs (Figure [1B\)](#page-3-0). The intensity of the crystalline peak of Li3PS4 at 31.1◦ gradually weakens until it disappears from *x* = 0.04. In contrast, the peak at 32.05◦ for LiBiS2 appears, while the characteristic peak of BiI3 is not found in the XRD patterns. The overall structure remains relatively unchanged, suggesting successful co-doping of Bi and I into the Li3PS4. Moreover, the Raman spectra provide further insights into the effect of Bi and I co-doping on the Li3PS4. As shown in Figure [1C,](#page-3-0) a characteristic peak at 418 cm−<sup>1</sup> corresponds to the PS4 <sup>3</sup><sup>−</sup> tetrahedra, while no peak splitting or new group formation is observed, indicating that the Bi and I co-doping solely influences the P‒S bond without altering the overall structure of PS4 <sup>3</sup>−. Thus, the model of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 can be constructed (Figure S2).

Taking Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 as a representative, the chemical bonding information was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The S 2p spectrum of Li3PS4 can be fitted into two distinct peaks, corresponding to P‒S‒Li (160.5 and 161.8 eV) and P = S bonds (161.1 and 162.4 eV), respectively (Figure [1D\)](#page-3-0)[.14](#page-9-0) The P 2p spectrum peaks of Li3PS4 appear at 131.4 and 132.4 eV owing to the typical PS4 <sup>3</sup><sup>−</sup> (Figure [1E\)](#page-3-0). In the case of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18, except the peaks corresponding to P = S and P‒S‒Li (161 and 162.7 eV), an additional peak primarily arises from the Bi 4f peak, and Bi‒S peak is observed[.14](#page-9-0) Additionally, the increased peak intensity at 162.2 eV is attributed to the overlap of P‒S and Bi‒S peaks, resulting from Bi doping. No discernible difference in this peak between the two SEEs is observed in the Li 1s spectrum (Figure S3). However, one of the sulfur atoms in the PS4 <sup>3</sup><sup>−</sup> unit, originally presenting in Li3PS4, undergoes the substitution with one I atom. This substitution, denoted as PI*<sup>x</sup>* (132.8 eV), is clearly visible in Figure [1E.](#page-3-0) Moreover, the I 3d spectrum exhibits two peaks at 618 and 630 eV (Figure S4), further confirming the doping of I into Li3PS4. The morphology of SSEs is presented in Figures [1F](#page-3-0) and S5, and both the Li3PS4 and Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 electrolyte particles exhibit irregular shapes with sizes ranging from 10 to 20 µm. The energy dispersive spectroscopy elemental profile of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 confirmed the uniformly distributed P, S, Bi, and I in the electrolyte particles (Figure [1G\)](#page-3-0), indicating the co-doping of both Bi and I into Li3PS4.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to evaluate the ionic conductivity of the as-prepared Li3<sup>+</sup>2*<sup>x</sup>*P1<sup>−</sup>*x*Bi*x*S4<sup>−</sup>1.5*<sup>x</sup>*I3*<sup>x</sup>* (*x* = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) SSEs. It is evident that Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 (*x* = 0.06) shows the optimal ionic conductivity of 4.05 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> , which is one order of magnitude higher than that of Li3PS4 (0.24 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> , Figure [2A\)](#page-4-0). Furthermore, the calculated activation energy (*E*a) of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 is as low as 0.252 eV (Figure [2B,C\)](#page-4-0)[.33](#page-9-0) The high ionic conductivity with low activation barrier of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 can be attributed to the synergy of increased Li<sup>+</sup> concentration, weakened charge interaction between part of Li<sup>+</sup> and S2<sup>−</sup>, and anion site disorder induced by the insertion of I−. [14,26](#page-9-0) However, high amount of BiI3 (*x* = 0.08) tends to induce the formation of impurity phases such as LiI, resulting in the obstructed Li<sup>+</sup> migration and a significant increase in the activation energy (*E*<sup>a</sup> = 0.269 eV). In addition, from the direct current polarization curves, the Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 electrolyte exhibits the lower electronic conductivity of 1.0 × 10−<sup>8</sup> S cm−<sup>1</sup> compared with Li3PS4 (6.6 × 10−<sup>8</sup> S cm−<sup>1</sup> ) (Figure [2D\)](#page-4-0), which facilitates to prevent dendrite formation on the Li metal anode[.14](#page-9-0) Moreover, differential thermal analysis of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 was conducted with a heating rate of 10◦C/min in an argon environment (Figure [2E\)](#page-4-0), in which the crystallization temperature of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 is determined to be 228◦C. A highly crystalline SSEs can be obtained after annealing at 230◦C for 4 h (Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18-230) (Figure S6). However, the EIS plot of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18-230 shows a high impedance of 174 Ω and a low ionic conductivity of only 0.51 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> compared to the glass-ceramic SSEs annealed at 210◦C (Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18-210) (4.05 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> , Figure S7). The enhanced ionic conductivity of glass-ceramic phase is likely due to the self-organization

of microcrystalline glasses into heterogeneous nanostructured domains during the solid-phase reaction[.34](#page-9-0) It is worth noting that the low annealing temperature of 210◦C achieving impressive ionic conductivity, which is obviously lower than the processing temperatures of common SSEs[.3,5,10](#page-8-0) Thus, the synthesis cost can be significantly reduced, endowing Li3+2*x*P1−*x*Bi*x*S4−1.5*x*I3*x*-210 a promising choice for ASSLMBs (Figure [2F\)](#page-4-0)[.35](#page-9-0)

To evaluate the lithium dendrite suppression ability of the SSEs, the Li|Li3+2*x*P1−*x*Bi*x*S4−1.5*x*I3*x*|Li symmetric cells were assembled. Figure S8 shows the voltage curves of lithium plating and stripping, and the initial current density is 0.1 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, with the gradual increase in the current density. From the comparison, a sudden voltage drop occurs for Li|Li3PS4|Li symmetric cell (Figure S8a), indicating a CCD value of 0.25 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> for Li3PS4. In a sharp contrast, the CCD value of Li|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18|Li symmetric cells reaches a maximum value of 0.9 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> (Figure S8d), obviously higher than those of Li|Li3.04P0.98Bi0.02S3.97I0.06|Li (0.25 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), Li|Li3.08P0.96Bi0.04S3.94I0.12|Li (0.20 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), and Li|Li3.16P0.92Bi0.08S3.88I0.24|Li (0.40 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) (Figure S8b‒e), which is attributed to its intrinsic low electronic conductivity and high interface stability between Li metal and SSEs[.36](#page-9-0) The long-term cyclability was also examined by Li metal symmetric cells at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and a capacity of 0.1 mAh cm−<sup>2</sup> (Figures [3A](#page-5-0) and S8f). The Li|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18|Li symmetric cell maintains an ultra-stable overpotential of 13 mV without short circuiting for 700 h (Figures [3A‒D](#page-5-0) and S9c,d). However, the Li|Li3PS4|Li cell experiences a significant detectable overpotential alteration only after

225 h owing to its poor Li compatibility (Figure S9a,b). Additionally, the Li|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18|Li symmetric cell can cycle steadily at a high current density of 0.25 mA cm‒2 (Figure S10). This indicates that the doping of Bi3<sup>+</sup> can inhibit the reaction between electrolyte and lithium dendrites. Moreover, the linear sweep voltammetry profiles from open-circuit voltage to 0 V of Li|SSEs|SSEs/C cells at 0.1 mV s−<sup>1</sup> were conducted to evaluate the electrochemical stability of the SSEs with lithium metal anode. Both SSEs started to decrease near the open-circuit voltage, and a significant increase in the specific current with a high integral reduction current (0.11768 VA g−<sup>1</sup> ) was observed for the Li3PS4. However, the reduction potential of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 slightly increased (2.197 V) with an integral current of only 0.08508 A g−<sup>1</sup> , indicating the superior Li compatibility of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 (Figure S11). The chemical stability of Li metal and Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 SSEs was further examined by XPS measurement. As shown in Figure [3E,F,](#page-5-0) distinct Li2S (159.8 eV), reduced P (130.8 eV), and Li3P (127 and 128.5 eV) peaks appear after 100 cycles at the Li|Li3PS4 interface, indicating a severe reduction of Li3PS4 by Li metal (Figure S12). However, a negligible amount of Li2S and Li3P with a low-intensity signal is detected on the Li|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 interface, along with a stable

Li‒Bi alloy formation (Figure S12a), suggesting that the co-doping of Bi and I significantly enhances interfacial compatibility with Li metal[.14](#page-9-0) Additionally, the increased amount of LiI (630.2 and 618.8 eV) after cycling effectively passivates the active Li metal and inhibits the growth of Li dendrites (Figures [3G,](#page-5-0) S12b, and S4)[.37](#page-9-0)

To validate the air stability of Li3<sup>+</sup>2*<sup>x</sup>*P1<sup>−</sup>*x*Bi*x*S4<sup>−</sup>1.5*<sup>x</sup>*I3*x*, this SSE was placed in a sealed container at a temperature of 25◦C and a humidity of 35%. The stability of SSE in the air was determined by monitoring the amount of H2S released from SSEs at different time by an online H2S detector (Figure [4A\)](#page-6-0). It is found that Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 shows minimal change with the H2S concentration of only 0.205 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> after 300 min, after which H2S concentration remains constant thenceforth. In contrast, Li3PS4 exhibits a higher concentration of 0.632 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> at the same time, and the steep slope of the curve indicates a faster H2S release rate. Additionally, it is disclosed that Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 maintains its lamellar shape even after 300 min of exposure to humid air, whereas Li3PS4 experiences severe structural collapse under the same condition, demonstrating the uniqueness of Bi and I co-doping in improving air stability of this sulfide SSE (Figure S13). In addition, structural changes in the SSEs were examined via XRD tests after 20 min

of exposure to moist air. Impressively, the XRD peaks of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 remain almost unchanged compared to the pristine sample, indicating that the doping of Bi significantly improves the hydrolysis resistance of Li3PS4-based SSEs. However, a change in the peak shape and the appearance of several new impurity peaks can be observed in the XRD pattern of Li3PS4 (Figure [4B\)](#page-6-0), suggesting partial structural and compositional change of PS4 3− induced by hydrolysis. Notably, the exceptionally high air stability of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 (0.205 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> ) is superior to that of the most reported representative air-stable sulfide SSEs (Table S3), such as Li6.988P2.994Nb0.2S10.934O0.6 (0.489 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> ),[29](#page-9-0) Li7P2.9Sb0.1S10.75O0.25 (1.02 cm<sup>3</sup> g−<sup>1</sup> ),[38](#page-9-0) Li7P2.9Ce0.2S10.9Cl0.3 (3.12 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> ),[39](#page-9-0) Li4SnS4 (0.25 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> ),[40](#page-9-0) and Li6.3P0.9Cu0.1S4.9Cl1.1 (0.49 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> )[.41](#page-9-0) Therefore, the partial replacement of the hard acid P with soft acid Bi can greatly enhance the hydrolysis resistance of Li3PS4-based SSEs, demonstrating its high potential for practical application (Figure [4C\)](#page-6-0).

To insightfully understand the improved air stability of Bi-doped Li3PS4, the density generalized function theory calculation was employed to assess both the water hydrolysis reaction energy (∆*E*hy) and adsorption energy (∆*E*ad) (Figure [4D\)](#page-6-0). The hydrolysis reaction of sulfide SSEs typically involves PS4 structural units reaction with H2O. In the case of the Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18, two sulfurcontaining structural units (PS4 and BiS4), along with the sulfur-containing structural unit PS3O generated after the hydrolysis reaction, are formed when considering the substitution of Bi at the P-position. Notably, the PS4 has a relatively low ∆*E*hy (−2.56 eV) and ∆*E*ad (−0.33 eV), implying its facile reaction with H2O (Tables S1 and S2).

thermodynamically unfavorable (Figure 4C), which is consistent with previous experimental results on the enhanced air stability of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18.

To evaluate the applicability of SSEs, the as-synthesized Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 and Li3PS4 SSEs were assembled into ASSLMBs using Nb2O5-coated LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811@Nb2O5) cathode and Li metal anode. Li10GeP2S12 SSEs (LGPS) are used as catholytes to ensure sufficient ionic conductivity (Figures [5A](#page-7-0) and S14). The cells were initially cycled at a constant current of 0.1 C (1 C = 200 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> ) in the voltage range of 3.0‒4.3 V at 60◦C. Figure S15 exhibits the typical charge-discharge voltage curves of the ASSLMBs. The initial discharge capacity of ASSLMBs with Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 SSE is 163.6 mAh g‒1 with a high coulombic efficiency of 79.5%. Importantly, a high capacity retention rate of 86.8% is maintained after 80 cycles. By contrast, as for the battery with the Li3PS4, the capacity is only 77 mAh g‒1 with a low capacity retention of 60.3% after 15 cycles (Figures [5B](#page-7-0) and S16). Moreover, a significant voltage polarization with a low initial coulombic efficiency of only 55.35% is observed. Furthermore, the discharge capacities of the NCM811@Nb2O5|LGPS|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18|Li cell are 169, 136, 115, 105, and 87 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 C (Figure [5C,D\)](#page-7-0), respectively, and the capacity can recover to 140 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> when the current density shifts back to 0.1 C, suggesting excellent rate capability of the Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 electrolyte-based ASSLMBs. Besides, the cyclability of ASSLMBs was also measured at room temperature. As depicted in Figures [5E](#page-7-0) and S17, the NCM811@Nb2O5|LGPS|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18|Li cell shows a reversible capacity of 111 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> and impressive capacity retention of 95.8% after 300 cycles at 0.1 C, which is superior to those of most reported sulfidebased ASSLMBs, such as NCM622|Li6PS5Cl‒Li2ZrCl6|Li (0.3 C, 70 cycles, capacity retention 87.10%)[,42](#page-9-0) NCM532@LNO|Li6P0.925Sb0.075S5Cl|Li (0.2 C, 60 cycles, capacity retention 82.60%),[43](#page-9-0) and NCM523@LNO|Li6.04P0.98Bi0.02S4.97O0.03Cl|Li (0.1 C, 60 cycles, capacity retention 88.60%) (Tables S4)[.44](#page-9-0)

Subsequently, an in situ impedance test was conducted on the ASSLMBs to elucidate the underlying electrochemical distinctions. The charge and discharge processes were examined at various cut-off voltages. During the charging process, the increase in the cut-off voltages results in a higher total impedance for both

batteries (Figures 5F and S18a). In the discharge process, the total impedances of both battery setups significantly increase at shallower discharge depths (Figures 5G and S18b), aligning with findings from previous studies[.45](#page-9-0) It is evident that NCM811@Nb2O5|LGPS|Li3PS4|Li maintains a high initial impedance, and the impedance of the battery is significantly increased during the subsequent charge and discharge process. In contrast, NCM811@Nb2O5LGPS|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18|Li exhibited a lower initial impedance (265 Ω), attributed to the higher ionic conductivity of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18. Additionally, as the depth of subsequent charge and discharge processes increases, the Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18-based battery sustains lower impedance due to the formation of a stable SEI between SSE and Li metal without serious side reactions. To gain more intuitive understanding of resistance changes of the battery during different states of charge (SOC) and states of discharge (SOD) preprocess, the distribution of relaxation time curves was analyzed.[44](#page-9-0) In terms of time constant, the bulk resistance (*R*SE-bulk) of the solid electrolyte layer is distributed between 10−<sup>7</sup> and 10−<sup>6</sup> s, and Li3PS4 shows higher bulk resistance than that of Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18, corresponding to its larger initial impedance. The grain boundary impedance between the solid electrolyte particles is roughly distributed between 10−<sup>6</sup> and 10−<sup>5</sup> s, and these two batteries maintain low impedance. The impedance of SEI falls in the range of 10−<sup>4</sup> to 10−<sup>3</sup> s (Figures 5F and S18a). Compared to the NCM811@Nb2O5|LGPS|Li3PS4|Li, which has a high impedance, the SEI impedance of NCM811@Nb2O5|LGPS|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18|Li remains extremely low (5.3‒10.1 Ω) during the charge and discharge processes (Figure [5F,G\)](#page-7-0). This is mainly attributed to the formation of a stable SEI layer, further demonstrating excellent interfacial compatibility of Li|Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 during long-term cycling[.46](#page-10-0)

## **3 CONCLUSION**

In summary, we report an air-stable Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 glass-ceramic SSE obtained by co-doping Li3PS4 with Bi and I for high-performance ASSLMBs. Owing to the increased Li<sup>+</sup> concentration, weakened electronegativity between Li<sup>+</sup> and S2<sup>−</sup>, and anion site-disorder induced from I, the resulting SSE shows greatly enhanced ionic conductivity of 4.05 mS cm−<sup>1</sup> . Furthermore, the introduction of BiI also improved the Li dendrite suppression capability and air stability induced from the in situ formed robust SEI (LiI and Li‒Bi alloy) and strong covalent bonding of Bi‒S bonds. Consequently, the Li symmetric cell-based Li3.12P0.94Bi0.06S3.91I0.18 SSEs shows an ultrahigh CCD value of 0.9 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and ultralong cyclability of 700 h at 0.1 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The corresponding ASSLMBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 111 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> , and remain 95.8% of the initial capacity after 300 cycles at 0.1 C. This work demonstrates that the Bi and I co-doping strategy is a reliable direction to develop air-stable sulfide-based SSEs for ASSLMBs with high energy density and long cyclability.

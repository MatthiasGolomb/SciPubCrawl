#### **First principles modeling of the interface between a solid state lithium thiophosphate electrolyte and a lithium metal anode**

N. A. W. Holzwarth and N. D. Lepley Department of Physics, Wake Forest University Winston-Salem, NC 27109, USA

 Recently, there has been progress in improving the conductivity and stability of solid electrolytes such as Li3PS4.[1] We report the results of first principles computer modeling studies of ideal Li3PS4 electrolyte interfaces with metallic Li anodes.

 For a variety of interface configurations, computer modeling studies show that Li3PS4 surfaces are structurally and chemically altered by the presence of Li metal. On the other hand, experiments have shown [1] that an electrochemical cell of Li/Li3PS4 /Li can be cycled many times. One possible explanation of the apparent stability of the Li3PS4 electrolyte/Li metal interface, is that a stable thin buffer layer is formed during the first few cycles. In order to computationally explore this possibility, we modeled a "thin film" buffer layer of Li2S on the surface of the electrolyte. Using first principles techniques described in previous work,[2] stable electrolyte-buffer layer configurations were found. Results for the idealized configurations indicate that a thin film of Li2S can provide a protective buffer layer to stabilize the interface between the Li3PS4 electrolytes and Li metal anodes.

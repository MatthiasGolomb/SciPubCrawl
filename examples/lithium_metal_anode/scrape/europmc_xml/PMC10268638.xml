electrolytes
(SPEs) often require the use of a solvent, which would lead to a complicated
process and potential safety hazards. Therefore, it is urgent to develop
a solvent-free in situ method to produce SPEs with good processability
and excellent compatibility. Herein, a series of polyaspartate polyurea-based
SPEs (PAEPU-based SPEs) with abundant <strike>(</strike>PO)<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>(EO)<italic><sub>y</sub></italic>(PO<strike>)</strike><italic><sub>z</sub></italic> segments and cross-linked
structures were developed by systematically regulating the molar ratios
of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and isophorone diisocyanate trimer
(tri-IPDI) in the polymer backbone and LiTFSI concentrations via an
in situ polymerization method, which gave rise to good interfacial
compatibility. Furthermore, the in situ-prepared PAEPU-SPE@D<sub>15</sub> based on the IPDI/tri-IPDI molar ratio of 2:1 and 15 wt % LiTFSI
exhibits an improved ionic conductivity of 6.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> S/cm at 30 &#x000b0;C and could reach 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> orders
of magnitude when the temperature was above 40 &#x000b0;C. The Li|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery based on PAEPU-SPE@D<sub>15</sub> had a wide electrochemical
stability window of 5.18 V, demonstrating a superior interface compatibility
toward LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and the lithium metal anode, exhibited a
high discharge capacity of 145.7 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the
100th cycle and a capacity retention of 96.8%, and retained a coulombic
efficiency of above 98.0%. These results showed that the PAEPU-SPE@D<sub>15</sub> system displayed a stable cycle performance, excellent rate
performance, and high safety compared with PEO systems, indicating
that the PAEPU-based SPE system may play a crucial role in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51904343</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Funds for Creative Research Groups of Hunan province</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">NA</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020JJ1007</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hebei Provincial School science and technology cooperation development fund support project</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">NA</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020030477-2</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100019081</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019RS3002</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hebei University</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100008047</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YWF11</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100003787</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>E2021208031</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100003787</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B2021208069</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100003787</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>225A4404D</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>52174287</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5210011286</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao2c07349</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao2c07349</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) have brought astonishing advancements
and transformations in portable electronics and, more recently, electric
vehicles during the past several decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> With
the rapidly expanding market of electric vehicles, storage systems
with high energy density are in strong demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> However, there are some serious
safety issues such as short circuits, leakage, and combustion, even
explosions, derived from the dendrite growth in liquid electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Motivated by this challenge, many types of research such as solid-state
inorganic electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have
drawn significant attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> The former mainly includes sulfide-based electrolytes and oxide-based
electrolytes, which are brittle and have high interfacial resistance
owing to poor contact with electrodes. In contrast, SPEs, blessed
with a high flexibility and more safety, enable the application of
a high-capacity Li&#x02013;metal anode in which the possibility of
internal short-circuiting by the penetration of dendritic Li can be
suppressed. Consequently, SPEs may be the ultimate path to the batteries
of the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></p><p>Most polymers have been recently exploited
to dissolve lithium
salts in these polymers for constructing SPEs, such as poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF),
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and so on, in order to effectively
enhance the performance of solid polymer electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Especially, the SPE based on PEO is the most extensively investigated
of polymer hosts for an efficient Li-salt dissolvability through the
interaction of its ether oxygen bonds with cations. For all of the
above reasons, numerous strategies have been reported to improve the
ion conductivities of SPEs, including blocking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and grafting modification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> adding plasticizers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> polymer blending,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> or forming the cross-networking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> Besides, many
polymers containing abundant EO structure units have also been studied
as matrices of SPEs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> In particular, the preparation methods of solid polymer electrolytes
can influence the interface impedance. In addition to solution casting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> phase transformation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> and electrostatic spinning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> many researchers also often use in situ polymerization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> light curing methods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> and the scalable tape-casting
method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> to prepare solid polymer electrolytes.
Zhao&#x02019;s research group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> added the
polymer matrix cellulose acetate (CA), the cross-linking agent poly(ethylene
glycol diacrylate) (PEGDA), and the initiator AIBN to the liquid electrolyte,
which consists of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>),
ethylene carbonate (EC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC); then, the layered
boron nitride (BN) filler was added to the above mixture, and a cross-linked
gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was prepared by in situ thermal polymerization.
The cross-linked GPE exhibits good mechanical and electrochemical
properties, with an ionic conductivity of 8.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 30 &#x000b0;C and an electrochemical stability
window of 5.5 V. Drews et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> reported
that the PIL brush-type GPE with PEtOx side chain was prepared by
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of a cationic vinylimidazolium-terminated
poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) macromonomer and a multifunctional
acrylic cross-linking agent dissolved in an organic electrolyte (LP30).
In situ and ex situ preparation methods are used according to different
characterizations, and the PIL brush GPE has good ionic conductivity,
thermal properties, and electrochemical stability. Notwithstanding
the organic solvents used in some systems of these gel electrolytes
will be removed in subsequent operations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> the residual solvents may lead to side reactions with the electrodes.
Apart from that, the residual organic solvents also increase the risk
when working at higher temperatures, leading to safety issues that
cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a solvent-free
solid electrolyte with EO structure.</p><p>Polyaspartate polyurea
(PAEPU) is a kind of polymer rich in the
ether oxygen group with good viscoelasticity and processing flexibility.
The abundant ether oxygen groups endow it with a similar conduction
mechanism to that of PEO. In addition, the raw materials are cheap
and easy to obtain, and the preparation process of PAEPU is simple
and does not need any organic solvent. These merits provide PAEPU
the potential for use as a matrix of SPEs.</p><p>Herein, a solvent-free
cross-linked PAEPU-based electrolyte with
polyaspartic ester (PAE) and polyisocyanates as the main components
was prepared by the in situ thermal polymerization method. Previously,
the product of PAE and polyisocyanates was mostly used in the adhesive
field,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> but its use as an electrolyte has been scarcely reported.
However, the PAEPU-based SPE membrane is expected to function as a
novel electrolyte due to the following features: (i) the abundant
ether oxygen bonds and low crystallinity are in favor of the transport
of Li<sup>+</sup>; (ii) formation of an integrated interface by in
situ polymerization and strong adhesion to both electrodes; and (iii)
the flexible and elastic properties can be tuned to accommodate the
volume change originating from the anode. Besides, we are interested
in a polymer matrix with a different cross-linking density; consequently,
five different mole ratios of difunctional (isophorone diisocyanate
(IPDI)) and trifunctional diisocyanate (isophorone diisocyanated trimer
(tri-IPDI)), respectively, abbreviated as PAEPU-SPE@R<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>, are employed in this study. Here, R refers to A,
B, C, D, and E, which reflect the different mole ratios of IPDI to
tri-IPDI (the ratios are 0:1, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1, respectively),
and n refers to the mass concentrations (0, 5, 15, and 25 wt %) of
LiTFSI, which are based on the mass of PAE. The thermal and electrochemical
properties of the solvent-free solid-state polymer electrolyte were
systematically studied. The results show that the PAEPU-based SPE
has good stability and a wide electrochemical stability window, and
there is low interface impedance between the electrode and electrolyte
due to the in situ polymerization method. Beyond the obvious benefits
already discussed, the electrolytes show outstanding comprehensive
properties, and the cells assembled with the electrolytes exhibit
superior electrochemical performances.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>Polyetheramine (ED2003 <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub> &#x02248; 2000) was purchased from Shandong

The lithium-ion transmission can be more intuitively understood through
the XRD pattern. In order to find out the reason for the improved
Li<sup>+</sup> conduction, XRD was carried out on the PAE membrane,
PAEPU-SPE@R<sub>15</sub> (R = A, B, C, D, E), with different molar
ratios of IPDI to tri-IPDI and PAEPU-SPE@D<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 0, 5, 15, 25) and different concentrations
of LiTFSI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). It can be seen from <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> that the diffraction peaks for the crystalline PEO chain
segments in PAE are located at 19.1 and 23.3&#x000b0;; nevertheless,
the diffraction peaks of PAEPU-SPE@R<sub>15</sub> and PAEPU-SPE@D<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> are widened and become diffusion peaks due
to the cross-linking structure in PAEPU-based SPE, which restricts
the formation of crystallization, creating more amorphous regions
with the increase in molar ratio of tri-IPDI to IPDI or LiTFSI content.
Furthermore, there are no diffraction peaks at 2&#x003b8; of 19.1 and
23.3&#x000b0; for PAEPU-SPE@R<sub>15</sub> and PAEPU-SPE@D<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>, respectively; this may be because the intense diffraction
peaks of PAEPU-based SPE mask the diffraction peaks at 19.1 and 23.3&#x000b0;.

temperature for PAEPU-based SPEs with different molar ratios of the

can be seen that the melting temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) and glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) gradually reduced from PAEPU-SPE@B<sub>15</sub> to PAEPU-SPE@E<sub>15</sub> with the increase in the molar ratios of IPDI to tri-IPDI,
indicating that the cross-linking disrupted the crystallization tendency
of PAEPU-based SPEs. Nevertheless, PAEPU-SPE@A<sub>15</sub> displayed
the lowest <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of &#x02212;44.4 &#x000b0;C
and <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 25 &#x000b0;C. It may be that there
was tri-IPDI only, resulting in the viscosity increasing rapidly at
the beginning of the reaction, which hinders the movement of chain
segments and monomers to restrain the consequent reaction between
PAE and tri-IPDI to affect the mechanical strength of PAEPU-based
SPEs. Moreover, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b shows that the dosage of LiTFSI affects the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>.

the ions in LiTFSI and PEO chain segments. Especially, at 25 wt %
of LiTFSI, the crystallization peak disappeared completely. This observation
heralds a completely disrupt crystallization of PEO chain segments.
As a result, the chain segment is more active, facilitating lithium-ion
transfer and achieving higher ionic conductivity. In addition, the

eliminating the use of solvents. We systematically investigated the
mechanics, thermal transition, and transport behaviors of PAEPU-based
SPEs by varying the molar ratios of IPDI to tri-IPDI and LiTFSI concentrations
and identified trends in the viscoelasticity, thermal transition,
and ionic conductivity with polymer composition. The SPE displays
tunable mechanical properties and ionic conductivity, excellent thermal
stability (<italic>T</italic><sub>d,5</sub> &#x0003e; 300 &#x000b0;C), and
a
low glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> &#x0003c;
&#x02212;40 &#x000b0;C). Additionally, at the IPDI/tri-IPDI molar ratio
of 2:1 and 15 wt % LiTFSI, an optimum combination was observed in
the PAEPU-based SPE system, which was used to investigate the electrochemical
properties. Compared to PEO/LiTFSI, the PAEPU-based SPE displayed
a higher ionic conductivity of 6.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> S
cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 30 &#x000b0;C and could reach 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> orders of magnitude when the temperature was above 40 &#x000b0;C, with
a better electrochemical stability window of 5.18 V and interface
stability with lithium metal. In addition, the capacity retention
rate of the Li/PAEPU-SPE@D<sub>15</sub>/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> half-cell
was 96.8% after 100 cycles, and in the rate test, the capacity recovery
rate could reach 97.9%. The characteristics of a good interface compatibility
between the electrodes and electrolyte as well as a reversible battery
cycle make the solvent-free and in situ PAEPU-based SPEs one of the
most promising electrolytes for next-generation all-solid-state batteries
with flexible, wearable, and highly improved safety as well as economic
and environmental benefits.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-2" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information

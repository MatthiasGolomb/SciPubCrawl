electrolytes (CSEs) have been developed rapidly
in recent years owing to their high electrochemical stability, low
cost, and easy processing characteristics. Most CSEs, however, require
high temperatures or flammable liquid solvents to exhibit their acceptable
electrochemical performance. Room-temperature all-solid-state batteries
without liquid electrolytes are still unsatisfactory and under development.
Herein, we have prepared a composite solid electrolyte with excellent
performance using a polymer electrolyte poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene)
and an inorganic electrolyte Li<sub>6.4</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.4</sub>Ta<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. With the assistance of lithium
salts and plasticizers, the prepared CSE achieves a high ionic conductivity
of 4.05 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at room temperature. The Li/CSE/Li symmetric cell can be stably
cycled for more than 1000 h at 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> without short
circuits. The all-solid-state lithium metal battery using a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode displays a high discharge capacity of 148.1 mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and a capacity retention of 90.21% after 100 cycles.
Moreover, the high electrochemical window up to 4.7 V of the CSE makes
it suitable for high-voltage service environments. The all-solid-state
battery using a lithium nickel-manganate cathode shows a high discharge
specific capacity of 197.85 mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with good
cycle performance. This work might guide the improvement of future
CSEs and the exploration of flexible all-solid-state lithium metal
batteries.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11905283</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People''s Republic of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100002855</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0405600</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao2c01338</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao2c01338</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) are considered to be one of the most
promising batteries for next-generation electric vehicles and plug-in
hybrid vehicles owing to the advantages of their high energy density,
high efficiency, long cycle life, and environmental friendliness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> These stringent and increasing needs put forward higher requirements
for the energy density and safety performance of LIBs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> However, traditional lithium-ion batteries often suffer from limited
capacities, inadequate electrochemical stabilities, and serious safety
problems owing to the use of volatile and flammable liquid electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Compared with traditional liquid batteries, all-solid-state
batteries
have attracted great attention due to their potential advantages of
high weights and volume energy densities, wide operating temperature
ranges, long cycle life, and excellent safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> The current
mainstream solid electrolytes can be mainly classified into polymer
solid electrolytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> sulfide solid electrolytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and oxide solid electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Among them, solid garnet
oxide electrolyte Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZO) gains increasing attention because of its high ionic
conductivity at room temperature (&#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> S
cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) and wide electrochemical stability window
(&#x0003e;5 V).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> However, the rigidity nature of LLZO limits its processing
characteristics and causes poor interfacial contact between solid-state
electrolytes and electrodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Moreover, lithium dendrites can
still dilapidate oxide solid electrolytes due to the inhomogeneous
dissolution and deposition of lithium, causing a severe short circuit
of the battery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup></p><p>The excellent stability and flexibility of
polymer solid electrolytes
can play a good complementary role to LLZO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> which stimulates intensive interest
in the corresponding composite solid-state electrolytes (CSEs). Among
polymer solid electrolytes, poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene)
(PVDF-HFP) is chosen owing to its slightly higher ionic conductivity,
good thermal stability, and amorphous phase (-HFP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> In CSEs, for one thing, PVDF-HFP
can act as an excellent mechanical support for LLZO nanoparticles
with excellent flexibility, which can significantly improve electrolyte/electrode
interfacial contact and help inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> On the other hand, the introduction of LLZO can build new lithium-ion
transmission pathways, which can greatly improve the lithium-ion conduction
of polymer electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> LLZO particles and the anion can also reduce the
double-layer electric field between the lithium metal and the electrolyte
to inhibit the electrochemical decomposition of PVDF-HFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup></p><p>The CSEs built up by PVDF-HFP and LLZO are expected to combine
their advantages and overcome the disadvantages of each other, facilitating
the promising performance of the all-solid-state lithium batteries
(ASSLBs) at room temperature. In this work, we used PVDF-HFP as the
matrix and combined it with a small amount of Ta-doped LLZO (LLZTO,
Li<sub>6.4</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.4</sub>Ta<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) nanoparticles. We also added a certain amount of succinonitrile
(SN) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) to improve
the performance of CSEs. The CSEs show high lithium-ion conductivity,
low interfacial resistance, and good stability toward lithium metal.
In addition, we applied the CSEs in Li|LFP (lithium iron phosphate)
and Li|LNMO (lithium nickel manganese oxide) cells, which delivered
excellent electrochemical properties and cycle performance without
liquid electrolytes at room temperature. These results indicate the
extraordinary electrochemical capabilities of this CSE and its promising
applications in high-energy all-solid-state lithium metal batteries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Preparation of the Composite
Solid-State Electrolytes</title><p>In order to obtain the optimal ratio
of the composite solid-state
electrolyte, we systematically studied the effects of different additive
contents on the ionic conductivity. PVDF-HFP (Sigma-Aldrich, Mw &#x0223c;
400,000), as a frame structure, was first dissolved in dimethylformamide
(DMF) solution at 0.2 g/mL by magnetically stirring for 1 h at 80
&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, only LiTFSI with different mass fractions from
20 to 80% was added. The mixtures were magnetically stirred for 2
h at room temperature. Then, the slurry was casted on the Teflon mold
(19 mm diameter round) and kept at room temperature for 12 h. To obtain
a dense membrane, the obtained solid membrane was dried at 60 &#x000b0;C
for 8 h. For the next step, the ratio of PVDF-HFP:LiTFSI was fixed
at 6:4, which exhibits the highest ionic conductivity, and then SN
with different mass fractions from 5 to 30% was added in the slurry.
The mixed slurry was magnetically stirred at 60 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, and
then the membrane preparation processes were repeated. Finally, on
the basis of the optimal ratio for PVDF-HFP:LiTFSI:SN fixed at 6:4:2.5,
LLZTO was dissolved in a small amount of DMF by ultrasonic dispersion
and then added into the slurry. The mass fraction range for LLZTO
was 6&#x02013;18%. The mixtures were magnetically stirred for 2 h and
were fabricated into membranes using the same method. After obtaining
the optimal mass ratio of the four substances, the preparation processes
of CSEs were further optimized and are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. The thickness of the prepared CSE is about

was magnetically stirred for another 2 h and casted onto Al foil,
which was subsequently dried at 80 &#x000b0;C for 20 h. The CSE@LFP cathode
was finally made into a 12 mm-diameter disc with an areal mass loading

to evaluate the stability of the solid electrolyte toward Li metal.

electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical linear polarization

10<sup>&#x02013;9</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at room temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> To increase the ionic conductivity of CSEs, the effects of different
additive ratios were systematically investigated. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a shows the variations of the
ionic conductivity with different LiTFSI, SN, and LLZTO contents.
We first synthesized PVDF-HFP-based solid gel polymer electrolytes
(GPE) containing 20&#x02013;80 wt % LiTFSI without SN and LLZTO. The
concentration of lithium salt mainly affects the distribution of charge
carriers and the long-range migration ability of lithium ions in the
polymer. When the concentration of lithium salt is maintained at the
low standard, it can be fully solubilized by PVDF-HFP, providing free
lithium ions as charge carriers, which increases with lithium salt
content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> However, with the increase in lithium content
to a certain extent, the solubilization effect is limited, and the
electrostatic interactions between Li<sup>+</sup> and TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup> become significant, which reduce the number of effective carriers
and the ionic conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> Moreover,
lithium salt compresses the space for free chain segment movement
of the polymer and reduces the film-forming ability to the extent
that the slurry cannot form a film when the content of lithium salt
is too high. Thus, when the optimal weight ratio was adjusted to PVDF-HFP:LiTFSI
= 6:4 (labeled as GPE-a), the highest ionic conductivity of 3.28 &#x000d7;
10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> S&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was reached.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) Ionic

and further added plasticizers to reduce the crystallinity of the
polymer, which could enhance the chain segment motion of the polymer
to facilitate the migration of lithium ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> SN is chosen as the plasticizer owing to its ability to weaken the
van der Waals forces of the PVDF-HFP macromolecules and the hydrogen
bonds between the chain segments. As shown in the X-ray diffraction
patterns in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b, the peak intensity of PVDF-HFP is significantly weakened after
the introduction of SN. The morphology in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>d confirms that the plasticizer causes the
disappearance of the large-sized PVDF-HFP crystals. SN also possesses
a strong polar &#x02212;C&#x02261;N groups, which can promote the dissolution
and dissociation of lithium salts through intermolecular interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> However, an excessive percentage of plasticizer not only weakens
the polymer viscosity but may also drive toward partial loss of plastic-crystal
order locally and more complex phenomena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> The highest ionic conductivity of 1.18 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was achieved when SN was added around
20 wt %, and the corresponding PVDF-HFP:LiTFSI:SN is 6:4:2.5 (labeled
as GPE-b).</p><p>Finally, we fixed PVDF-HFP:LiTFSI:SN = 6:4:2.5 and
added LLZTO
to further enhance the ionic conductivity. When 9.1 wt % LLZTO is
added, the highest ionic conductivity of 4.05 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> is achieved (labeled as CSE). The
resulting composite electrolyte membrane is flexible and can be cut
into desired shapes, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c. The SEM images and EDS elemental mappings
of the membrane are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>d,e; microsized LLZTO particles are uniformly distributed
in the CSE, providing continuous jump sites for Li<sup>+</sup>. The
interfaces between PVDF-HFP and LLZTO also create high-speed lithium
ion transmission channels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> Thus, the
ability of long-range migration of lithium ions is significantly improved.
However, the uniformly distributed LLZTO powders are agglomerated
with the further increase in inorganic fillers, leading to the disconnection
of consecutive lithium-ion channels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> Therefore,
the optimal composition of CSE was determined as 43.6 wt % PVDF-HFP,
29.1 wt % LiTFSI, 18.2 wt % SN, and 9.1 wt % LLZTO.</p><p>As shown
in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a, the improvement
of ionic conductivity may be attributed to the
synergistic interaction of uniformly distributed amorphous PVDF-HFP,
lithium salt, SN, and macrosized LLZTO. To investigate the partial
interactions of different groups in the membrane, FTIR analysis was
performed. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b shows the FTIR spectra of PVDF-HFP, which displays significant
peaks at 1400, 1170, 1072, 873, 835, 511, and 480 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. The peaks at 873 and 835 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> can be assigned
as the amorphous phase (&#x003b2;-phase) of PVDF-HFP, and the others
are related to the crystalline phase (&#x003b1;-phase).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> After the introduction of LiTFSI, a new peak that appears
at 1652 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> can be assigned to the interaction
of the C&#x02013;H group and C&#x02013;F group. The peaks at 574 and
1350 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> are related to the N-CO-O symmetric stretching
and asymmetric SO<sub>2</sub> stretching modes, respectively. The
peaks at 613 and 1135 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> illustrate the interaction
of Li<sup>+</sup> with CF<sub>2</sub> and CF<sub>3</sub>. There is
a red-shift of the C&#x02013;F group from 1170 to 1180 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> mainly because the free Li<sup>+</sup> inhibits the formation of
hydrogen bonds between the groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> The newly
formed interaction between functional groups suggests that new transport
behaviors of lithium ions appear, while the similarity of the polymer&#x02019;s
spectra indicates that the original skeleton of the polymer matrix
is still retained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(a) Schematic diagram

is also one of the important parameters to evaluate solid-state electrolytes,
which can be determined using a Li/electrolyte/SS cell. The electrochemical
window of polymer electrolytes is generally not adequate for commercial
cathode materials, but the introduction of additives is valid to improve
this situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> The CV curves of GPE-a
containing only lithium salts and polymers are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c01338/suppl_file/ao2c01338_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>, which exhibits poor electrochemical
stability and strong redox side reactions under applied voltage. In
addition, the response current from GPE-a was the smallest among all
samples, which is related to its extremely poor conductivity. The
inherently huge impedance and the polarization impedance during the
test combine to result in a very small response current. Also, the
trend of the test current shows an obvious increase for most of the
time, and thus it is difficult for us to identify the position of
a specific redox peak. In contrast, smooth platforms and exact peak
positions can be observed in CV records of GPE-b and CSE. As shown
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c01338/suppl_file/ao2c01338_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>, the addition of SN enhances
intermolecular interactions and greatly reduces the side reactions.
The addition of LLZTO in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c further modulates the chemical environment of polymers
and lithium salts, reducing the oxidation peak between 3 and 4 V.
By adding SN and LLZTO, the electrochemical windows of the CSEs can
be enhanced to 4.52 and 4.70 V in the LSV curves, respectively (shown
in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>d), which
is extremely suitable for using with most commercial cathode materials.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of the CSE membrane on the growth of lithium
dendrites is studied by galvanostatic cycling of the Li/CSE/Li symmetric
cell at step-increased current densities. Before the addition of LLZTO
particles, the critical current density of the electrolyte reaches
1.0 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c01338/suppl_file/ao2c01338_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>). As shown
in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a, the critical
current density of the CSE with LLZTO significantly increases to 1.5
mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, after cycling at current densities ranging
from 0.1 to 1.9 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, the symmetric cell still maintains
good stability at 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, indicating that the composite
electrolyte has excellent recovery performance. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c01338/suppl_file/ao2c01338_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link> shows the EIS results after cycling at different
step currents, demonstrating that the addition of LLZTO significantly
improved the stability of the electrolyte. The voltage as well as
the cell resistance is expected to drop suddenly if the formation
of Li dendrites is uncontrollable over long cycles, indicating the
short circuit of the cell. Further experiments have shown that the
Li/CSE/Li symmetric cells can be stably cycled at 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for more than 1000 h without a short circuit (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b) and over 400 h even at a high current
density of 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c01338/suppl_file/ao2c01338_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>). The results confirm that the Li dendrite growth has been considerably
restrained. The gradual increase in voltage indicates an increase
in resistance, which may be related to the continuous generation of
a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at high current densities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> In conclusion, the prepared composite solid-state
electrolytes have good stability toward a lithium metal anode.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>(a) Galvanostatic

performance and stability
of CSEs, we assembled all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLBs)
to further evaluate their performance and practical applications.
As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>c, the coin cell with the CSE@LFP cathode and Li metal anode was
cycled over a cutoff voltage ranging from 2.0 to 3.8 V. The initial
discharge specific capacity is around 116.5 mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 0.1 C. After an activation process in the next few cycles accompanied
by the formation and conversion of the interfacial layer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> a high discharge specific capacity of 148.1
mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with &#x0223c;100% Coulombic efficiency
is achieved. The excellent Coulombic efficiency proves that the embedding
and deembedding of active Li<sup>+</sup> in the electrode material
is highly reversible. The capacity retention is about 90.21% after
100 cycles and 80.2% after 150 cycles. The capacity fading may be
caused by the accumulation of SEI passivation layers and the possible
structural and phase changes of the LFP during long-term cycles. The
charge and discharge curves in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>d show that the ASSLB has a smooth voltage plateau
and a small overpotential of 0.1 V. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>e displays the rate performance of the ASSLB;
the reversible capacity decreases slightly with the increase in charge/discharge
C-rate and maintains a discharge capacity over 100 mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> even at 0.5 C. The excellent rate performance can
be attributed to the extremely good ionic conductivity and the high
migration number of lithium ions. When the current density returns
to 0.1 C, the reversible capacity recovers well and remains stable,
indicating that the electrolyte/electrode interface has a good electrochemical
stability during rapid charge and discharge processes.</p><p>In order
to verify the operation capability of the CSE at high
voltage, the ASSLBs using the high-voltage CSE@LNMO cathode and lithium
metal anode were assembled. Unfortunately, as can be seen from <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c01338/suppl_file/ao2c01338_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>, irreversible redox reactions occur
continuously when the Li/CSE/CSE@LNMO cell is charged to 4.8 V. Thus,
the electrochemical performance of the cell is set in the voltage
range from 2 to 4.5 V at 0.1 C, which is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>a,b. Consistent with the Li/CSE/CSE@LFP
cell, the Li/CSE/CSE@LNMO cell also suffers from a short-term activation
process and then can be stably cycled with the contribution of good
interfacial compatibility. The discharge specific capacity is up to
197.85 mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with a capacity retention rate
over 90% after 30 cycles. The decay of cell capacity is also related
to the change of the LNMO structure and the increase in polarization.
In addition, the high Coulombic efficiency (&#x0223c;100%) throughout
the cycling test reflects the excellent charge-transfer reversibility
through the electrode/electrolyte interface. In conclusion, the ASSLBs
work well and may have a good application prospect.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>(a) Cycling performance

solid electrolyte with low
crystallinity, uniform phase distribution, and excellent performance
by using the polymer electrolyte PVDF-HFP as the matrix, succinonitrile
as the plasticizer, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide as the
Li salt, and Li<sub>6.4</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.4</sub>Ta<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>12</sub> as the active filler. After a systematic
exploration, we determine the optimal composition of the CSEs as 43.6%
PVDF-HFP, 29.1% LiTFSI, 18.2% SN, and 9.1% LLZTO by mass fraction.
The CSEs possess an ionic conductivity up to 4.05 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at room temperature and an electrochemical
stability window up to 4.7 V. The Li/CSE/Li symmetric cell shows a
high critical current density up to 1.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and can
be continuously cycled for more than 1000 h at 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> with a flat voltage plateau and low overpotential. The ASSLBs using
the LFP cathode displays a high discharge capacity of 148.1 mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with &#x0223c;100% Coulombic efficiency and a capacity
retention of 90.21% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the CSEs were shown
to be capable of serving ASSLBs in high voltage environments. Thus,
it is believed that the high-performance PVDF-HFP-based CSEs with
excellent interfacial compatibility is one of the most satisfactory
choices for room-temperature all-solid-state lithium metal batteries.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting

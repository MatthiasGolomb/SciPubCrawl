high Li<sup>+</sup> ionic conductivity, achieving 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, but it is prone to react
with electrode
active materials during the sintering process. LISICON-type Li<sub>3.5</sub>Ge<sub>0.5</sub>V<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LGVO) has
the advantage of less reactivity with the electrode active material
during the sintering process, but its ionic conductivity is on the
order of 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. In this
study, these two solid electrolytes are combined as a multilayer solid
electrolyte sheet, where 2 &#x003bc;m thick LGVO films are coated on
LLZ sheets to utilize the advantages of these two solid electrolytes.
These two solid electrolytes adhere well through Ge diffusion without
significant interfacial resistance. The LLZ&#x02013;LGVO multilayer
is combined with a LiCoO<sub>2</sub> positive electrode and a lithium
metal anode through annealing at 700 &#x000b0;C. The resultant all-solid-state
battery can undergo repeated charge&#x02013;discharge reactions for
over 100 cycles at 25 or 60 &#x000b0;C. The LGVO coating suppresses the
increases in the resistance from the solid electrolyte and interfacial
resistance induced by annealing by ca. 1/40. As with sulfide-based
all-solid-state batteries, function sharing of solid electrolytes
will be a promising method for developing advanced oxide-based all-solid-state
batteries through a sintering process.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>solid-state battery</kwd><kwd>interface</kwd><kwd>solid electrolyte</kwd><kwd>Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub></kwd><kwd>aerosol deposition</kwd><kwd>sintering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001691</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19H05813</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100009027</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJAL1301</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>am2c10853</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>am2c10853</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxide-based all-solid-state batteries
(Ox-SSBs) are attracting
attention as candidates for next-generation rechargeable batteries
that can realize high energy density while maintaining safety and
reliability. Thin-film-type Ox-SSBs with a few mA h sizes were commercialized
approximately 20 years ago, where positive electrode, solid electrolyte,
and negative electrode materials were sequentially piled up by vapor
deposition processes such as RF sputtering and vacuum evaporation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> In recent years, multilayer-type Ox-SSBs have been commercialized
by applying multilayer ceramic capacitor technology, where both electrodes
and the solid electrolyte are cosintered,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> and
some of them obtain capacities over 20 mA h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Because most oxide-based solid electrolytes, especially those with
high Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity, are hard and fragile crystalline
ceramics, such a sintering process is one of the practical ways to
develop advanced Ox-SSBs.</p><p>A severe problem accompanying the
preparation of Ox-SSBs through
the sintering process is the side reactions between the electrode
and solid electrolyte. These side reactions provide a large interfacial
resistance in many cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Among the various oxide-based
solid electrolytes, garnet-structured Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZ) has been examined through experimental
and theoretical approaches because of its high ionic conductivity
close to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at
room temperature in addition to its stability against Li metal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> However, LLZ highly reacts with many electrode active materials
during the sintering process. For example, when a LiCoO<sub>2</sub> (LCO) cathode is sintered with LLZ at 700 &#x000b0;C, La<sub>2</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub> is formed as a byproduct at the interface, and the
interfacial resistance seriously increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>An effective way to compensate for the disadvantages of a
solid
electrolyte is to combine the solid electrolyte with another solid
electrolyte. Such function sharing of solid electrolytes has been
commonly examined in sulfide-based SSBs from the viewpoint of suppressing
side reactions in charge&#x02013;discharge reactions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> reducing space charge layer formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> or extending the potential window of solid electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In the case of Ox-SSBs, NASICON-type Li<sub>1+<italic>x</italic></sub>Al<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Ti<sub>2&#x02013;<italic>x</italic></sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (LATP), which is unstable
with Li metal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> is combined with lithium phosphorus
oxynitride glass electrolyte (LiPON), which is stable with Li metal
by forming a multilayer-mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and then, Li plating&#x02013;stripping reactions
are realized on LiPON/LATP multilayers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The concept
of function sharing of solid electrolytes will be extended to reduce
the reactivity of the electrode/solid electrolyte interface during
the sintering process, that is, combining LLZ with another solid electrolyte
with less reactivity with electrode materials during the sintering
process. Several reports apply Li<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> (LBO)
with a lower melting point of approximately 700 &#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> as the combined solid electrolyte. Ohta et al. fabricated a LCO&#x02013;LBO
composite layer on a sintered Nb-doped LLZ substrate by a screen printing
method and then annealed it at 700 &#x000b0;C for 1 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> The composite electrode ca. 10 &#x003bc;m in thickness can
undergo repeated stable charge&#x02013;discharge reactions. The application
of LBO also has advantages in realizing a well-adhered electrode-solid
electrolyte interface and then developing bulk-type Ox-SSBs using
powder electrode materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> However, the ionic
conductivity of LBO has been reported to be 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at room temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> This ionic conductivity is improved to 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> by Li<sub>2+<italic>x</italic></sub>C<sub>1&#x02013;<italic>x</italic></sub>B<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>O<sub>3</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> but the ionic conductivity is still 2 orders of magnitude
smaller than that of LLZ. Replacing LBO with another material with
higher ionic conductivity is a better approach to reduce the Ohmic
resistance of solid electrolytes. Okumura et al. developed bulk-type
Ox-SSBs by spark plasma sintering, combining LISICON-type Li<sub>3.5</sub>Ge<sub>0.5</sub>V<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LGVO) with LiNi<sub>1/3</sub>Co<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>1/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCM111).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> LGVO is stable with various LiCoO<sub>2</sub>-type electrodes, including NCM111, under sintering at 700 &#x000b0;C,
and the resultant Ox-SSBs can undergo repeated stable charge&#x02013;discharge
reactions. The ionic conductivity of LGVO is close to 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at room temperature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> which is 1 order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity
than that of LBO but smaller than that of LLZ. Therefore, placing
a thin layer of LGVO as a protective layer against side reactions
on LLZ, in addition to reducing the total Ohmic resistance of the
resultant function sharing solid electrolyte, will be useful.</p><p>In this work, we prepared LGVO-coated LLZ substrates and investigated
whether this kind of function sharing solid electrolyte is effective
in suppressing the interfacial reactivity under sintering and then
providing a low-resistivity interface. Here, a crystalline LGVO thin
film with ca. 2 &#x003bc;m thickness was prepared on an LLZ substrate
by aerosol deposition (AD), and the LLZ&#x02013;LGVO multilayer was
annealed at different temperatures. Here, AD is a room-temperature
ceramic coating technology, and it has been applied to prepare various
coating materials, such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, LCO, and electrode-solid electrolyte composite layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Then, a LCO thin film was prepared on the LGVO side of the LLZ&#x02013;LGVO
multilayer using AD and annealed at 700 &#x000b0;C. Finally, the resultant
LLZ&#x02013;LGVO/LCO was combined with a lithium metal anode, and an
Ox-SSB, Li/LLZ/LGVO/LCO, was prepared. We will show that the LLZ&#x02013;LGVO
multilayer provides a well-adhered low-resistivity interface through
Ge diffusion by annealing at 700&#x02013;900 &#x000b0;C. The 2 &#x003bc;m
LGVO coatings effectively reduce the resistance from the solid electrolyte
and interfacial resistance by ca. 1/40 compared to the noncoated Ox-SSB.
An Ox-SSB using the LLZ&#x02013;LGVO multilayer can undergo repeated
stable charge&#x02013;discharge reactions for over 100 cycles.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Preparation of LGVO Powder for AD</title><p>LGVO powder for AD

the mixture was pressed into pellets at a pressure of 360 MPa and
sintered at 700 &#x000b0;C for 12 h in O<sub>2</sub>. The Li<sub>4</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> powder was prepared by mixing LiOH&#x02013;H<sub>2</sub>O powder (&#x0003e;99.0%, Nacalai Tesque) and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> powder

550 &#x000b0;C for 12 h in O<sub>2</sub>. The resultant Li<sub>4</sub>GeO<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> powders were mixed
in an agate mortar at a molar ratio of 1:1, then formed into pellets
at a pressure of 360 MPa and sintered at 700 &#x000b0;C for 12 h in O<sub>2</sub> to obtain LGVO pellets. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were carried out at 25 &#x000b0;C by applying an alternating
current (AC) amplitude of 10 mV (500 kHz to 100 mHz) to check the
ionic conductivity of pelletized LGVO. The LGVO pellets were ground
in a planetary ball mill (P-5, Fritsch) at a rotational speed of 100
rpm for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere. After removing large particles through
a 100 &#x003bc;m mesh sieve, starting powders for AD were prepared.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (SU8030, Hitachi

impurities such as Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and polishing dust
were removed by acid etching (immersion in 1 mol dm<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> HCl dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O, washing with H<sub>2</sub>O, and

LLZ substrates were set in a vacuum evacuated AD chamber, and they
were fixed to a substrate holder so that the deposition area was a
rectangular shape of 8 &#x000d7; 10 mm (deposition area: 0.8 cm<sup>2</sup>). The starting powder amount for AD was 2 g. The powders were stored
in the AD vessel maintained at 150 &#x000b0;C during deposition. The
carrier gas of Ar flowed into the vessel at 15 L min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and the resultant aerosol was sprayed onto the substrate through
a nozzle. During AD, the substrate was moved back and forth without
heating. After AD, substrates were transferred into an Ar-filled glovebox,
and the surface dust generated during AD was wiped off using a blower
and wiping paper. The resultant LLZ&#x02013;LGVO multilayers were annealed
at 700, 900, or 1050 &#x000b0;C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. These
annealed multilayers are denoted ML-700, ML-900, and ML-1050, respectively,

surface and cross-section textures were observed by FE-SEM, and element
distributions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) (X-max, Horiba Ltd.) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. Crystallinity
variations of the MLs with annealing were evaluated using XRD. The
ionic conductivities of both the MLs and the polished LLZ substrate
were measured by EIS. The measurement cells were blocking electrode
cells, where Au thin films (3 mm in diameter) were deposited on both
sides of these substrates by RF sputtering after polishing the LLZ
surface with SiC polishing paper (#400). Cross-sectional TEM specimens
were prepared using a focused ion beam (JIB-4501, JEOL Ltd). Their

by vacuum evaporation with an area 7 mm in diameter after polishing
the LLZ surface with a SiC polishing paper (#400) in an Ar-filled

film does not peel off from the LLZ substrate. The LLZ region of both
ML-AP and ML-700 is porous and densified in ML-900 and ML-1050. As
mentioned in the experimental section, the LLZ substrates used in
these MLs were acid-etched to remove surface impurities. This acid
etching provided a porous LLZ region around the substrate, but such
a porous region appeared to be densified with sintering over 900 &#x000b0;C.
This densification is caused by the sintering of LLZ itself (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c10853/suppl_file/am2c10853_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>), and Ge diffusion from LGVO, as described

The averaged Ge/V ratio (N3) of ML-AP is 0.99, which is almost consistent
with the ideal ratio (1.00). In contrast, MLs with annealing over
700 &#x000b0;C exhibit decreased average Ge/V ratio to 0.79&#x02013;0.90,
indicating that LGVO reacts with LLZ with Ge diffusion. This reactive
sintering will work as a driving force for generating a well-adhered
interface, which will reasonably explain the in-plane growth of LGVO
on LLZ with annealing. It has been reported that Ge can be doped into
LLZ and occupy Li or La sites depending on the doping amount.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> The appropriate amount of Ge doping of less
than 1 wt % forms a solid solution with a cubic phase in addition
to improving the ionic conductivity, while an excess amount of Ge
doping of over 1 wt % provides tetragonal-phase LLZ, detected as (024)
peak splitting, in addition to the appearance of impurity diffraction
peaks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> The XRD patterns from both ML-700
and ML-900 do not show such peak splitting or impurity peaks, as shown
in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>. Therefore,
the amount of Ge diffusion inside LLZ is expected to be in the solid
solution range (less than 1 wt %). Both Ge L&#x003b1; and V K&#x003b1;
signals are observed in most of the areas on the MLs, but some areas
are shown as a dark color, where the La L&#x003b1; signal from the LLZ
substrate appears strong. These results indicate that LGVO films are
formed almost uniformly on the LLZ substrates on a microscale, but
they may not be coated or may be coated in a thinner state on part
of the MLs on the macroscale.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a&#x02013;d) Surface and (e&#x02013;f) cross-sectional

site,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> the wide-range distribution of
Ge may be explained by Ge diffusion through the Li<sup>+</sup> conduction
pathway. This wide-range diffusion, not condensed around the interface,
is consistent with the reduction in the Ge/V ratio induced by annealing
in the EDX measurements. V appears to be present in the LLZ region
from the EDX image, but this is because the V K&#x003b1; signal overlaps

a broad diffraction pattern from the LGVO film in addition to diffraction
peaks from the LLZ substrate. The broad diffraction pattern from the
LGVO film is attributed to the crystallinity degradation by AD. In
the cases of ML-700 and ML-900, the diffraction peaks from the LGVO
film appear sharp, indicating that the crystallinity of the LGVO film
has recovered. Although Ge diffusion inside LLZ was suggested by EDX

DE1-R slightly increases from 13.2 &#x003a9; (after the 5th cycle) to
19.2 &#x003a9; (after the 136th cycle) with cycling, which is attributed
to the formation of a partially disconnected Li/LLZ interface region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> DE2-R increases ca. two times from 46.9 &#x003a9;
(after the 5th cycle) to 109 &#x003a9; (after the 136th cycle). As shown
in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>, the discharge
capacity slightly decreases with the cycles. This increased interfacial
resistance at LGVO/LCO will contribute to the degradation and rise
of <italic>R</italic><sub>int</sub> with cycling. A plausible mechanism
for the increasing DE2-R is the formation of a disconnected LGVO/LCO
interface originating from the volume change of LCO at 3.0&#x02013;4.2
V (ca. 2%) during the charge&#x02013;discharge reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> An effective way to reduce this degradation will be to replace LCO

capacity of 26 &#x003bc;A h cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> was observed, and
the Coulombic efficiency was 67.5%. The discharge capacity after the
second cycle was ca. 50 &#x003bc;A h cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>, comparable
to those of the annealed Ox-SSB without LGVO (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>a) and the Ox-SSB using ML-900. In contrast,
the Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle was ca. 90% for the Ox-SSB
with ML-900 and decreased to 67&#x02013;68% in Ox-SSBs without LGVO
regardless of annealing. The difference in the irreversible capacity
in the first cycle may arise from the anodic instability of LLZ,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> and LGVO may have a superior anodic stability to LLZ. When the oxidation
of LLZ occurs during the first charging reaction, the interface will
be modified to a stabilized state at the voltage, similar to SEI formation
on a graphite anode in a lithium-ion battery. After the stabilization
of the interface, the later charging reaction will not entail any
irreversible capacity under the same charging voltage. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>f shows the EIS spectra recorded
after the fifth cycle (60 &#x000b0;C) at 3.0 and 4.0 V. The potential-independent
high-frequency intercept with the real axis and <italic>R</italic><sub>int</sub> were 50 and 70 &#x003a9;, respectively. These values
were comparable to those of the Ox-SSB with ML-900 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>c) but 2 orders of magnitude
smaller than those of the sintered Ox-SSB without LGVO coating (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>d). These results
clarify that the porosity of the LLZ does not influence the drastic
increase in the cell resistance and that annealing of LLZ/LCO induces
an increase in the cell resistance. In other words, the 2 &#x003bc;m
thick LGVO coating effectively suppresses the side reactions at LLZ/LCO
and then inhibits the increase in the resistance induced by sintering.</p><p><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>g summarizes
the properties of the LLZ/LCO interface with LGVO coating and annealing.
The LLZ/LCO interface without annealing has low resistivity. Once
LLZ/LCO is annealed, the materials react with each other, and a high-resistivity
interface is generated. The LGVO layer reacts with LLZ through Ge
diffusion induced by annealing, but LLZ/LGVO has low resistivity.
In contrast, LGVO/LCO is a low-reactivity and low-resistivity interface,
and LLZ/LGVO/LCO provides a totally low-resistivity interface. These
results indicate that one strategy to realize a low-resistivity LLZ/LCO
interface by the sintering process is to insert a coating layer such
as LGVO at the interface. Another strategy will be to develop the
interface at lower temperatures, which may require low-temperature
process technology such as AD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We applied the concept of function sharing
of a solid electrolyte
to an oxide-based all-solid-state oxide battery (Ox-SSB) prepared
by sintering processes similar to ML ceramic capacitors technology.
We prepared an LLZ&#x02013;LGVO ML solid electrolyte sheet where a
2 &#x003bc;m thick LGVO film was coated on one side of the LLZ substrate
by AD. The ML obtained a total ionic conductivity of 6.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 25 &#x000b0;C and was stable
up to 900 &#x000b0;C. These two solid electrolytes were well-densified
through Ge diffusion and did not provide large interfacial resistance.
MLs annealed at 900 &#x000b0;C (ML-900) were applied to develop Ox-SSBs
(Li/ML-900/LCO) through sintering at 700 &#x000b0;C. The LGVO coating
suppressed the increases in the resistance from the solid electrolyte
and interfacial resistance induced by annealing by ca. 1/40. Additionally,
the LGVO/LCO interfacial resistivity was decreased to as low as 145
&#x003a9; cm<sup>2</sup> at 25 &#x000b0;C. Here, a 2 &#x003bc;m coating of
LGVO is a tunable parameter in the field of ML ceramic capacitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> Because the LLZ sheet has been successfully
prepared by the tape casting method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> we
can expect that the LLZ&#x02013;LGVO ML will possibly be prepared through
ML ceramic capacitors technology. Of course, the application of LGVO
as a coating material may be another choice to develop better performance
bulk-type Ox-SSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> by reducing the Ohmic
resistance in the composite electrode.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting

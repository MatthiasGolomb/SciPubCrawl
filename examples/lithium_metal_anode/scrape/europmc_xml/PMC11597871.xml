Introduction</title><p>With the increasing demand for wearable electronic products and portable devices, the development and design of flexible batteries have attracted extensive attention in recent years [<xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Traditional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) usually lack sufficient mechanical flexibility to stretch, bend, and fold, thus making it difficult to achieve practical applications in the corresponding flexible electronic products [<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, it is imperative to develop flexible, lightweight, and deformable energy storage devices. Currently, the main issues with flexible LIBs are: (i) electrode and electrolyte materials lack flexibility, leading to poor interlayer contact. During the battery bending process, active materials are easy to detach from the current collector, resulting in electrode cracking and battery performance degradation; (ii) The design of flexible battery packs is not sufficiently adaptable, and the individual cells within the pack suffer from low energy density. This inadequacy fails to meet the requirements for flexible deformation and high battery performance in practical applications; (iii) The large-scale production cost of flexible LIBs is high, and there is an urgent need to develop simple, rapid, and low-cost battery packaging processes for flexible electrodes and electrolytes. Therefore, the flexible structural design of battery packs is highly necessary (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In order to overcome the above issues, the main strategies for developing flexible batteries at present include researching flexible battery materials, applying advanced material manufacturing processes, and designing flexible battery structures.</p><p>The basic strategy for the research and development of materials for flexible LIBs has been focused on the use of novel materials to enhance the mechanical flexibility of the battery components. The usual strategy is to replace rigid battery components with flexible electrode materials. For example, carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), carbon cloth (CC), or graphene derivatives are utilized as the electrode current collectors due to their high flexibility and high electronic conductivity [<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The lithium metal anode can be modified to achieve superior mechanical flexibility by employing simple processing techniques or incorporating flexible 3D porous materials. In traditional LIBs, liquid electrolytes with high conductivity and good compatibility with the electrodes are typically used, along with polymer separators to prevent short circuits between the positive and negative electrodes [<xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, considering that flexible electronic products require frequent bending during use, the use of liquid electrolytes is likely to result in electrolyte leakage and separator displacement, leading to potential safety hazards [<xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, in the selection and research of electrolyte materials for flexible batteries, solid-state electrolytes (SSE) are more suitable for flexible lithium batteries, offering greater safety and reliability compared to liquid electrolytes [<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, the utilization of advanced processing technology can also effectively improve the mechanical flexibility and interlayer contact of flexible battery materials. For example, 3D printing technology (3DP), electrospinning technology, coating and spraying, Electrophoretic deposition (EPD), etc., can effectively achieve a strong adhesion of active materials and current collectors to realize the integration of battery layers [<xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Ultimately, the structure of flexible batteries is crucial to accelerate the commercial applications of flexible electronic products. The current flexible battery structure is mainly classified according to the spatial structure, including one-dimensional battery structure (linear, cable and fiber type), two-dimensional battery structure (island and grid type), and three-dimensional battery structure (snake, origami, and spine type) [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At present, many researchers have carried out structural bionics based on the flexible materials existing in reality and have built flexible structure batteries with the characteristics of stretchable bending and folding deformation [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>With these considerations, this work first reviews the research progress of flexible battery component materials, including the development and application of carbon-based materials and the strategies for and studies of flexible lithium metal anodes and electrolytes. Advanced flexible material processing technologies and typical flexible structure batteries are summarized and analyzed. Finally, strategies are provided for industry to realize the practical applications of flexible lithium-based batteries, and new insights are provided for future research.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nanomaterials-14-01856"><title>2. Flexible Materials for Flexible LIBs</title><p>Compared with traditional LIBs, flexible batteries require flexible components, including flexible electrodes, separators, and electrolytes. <xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the structure and composition of conventional and flexible lithium batteries. Compared with the components of ordinary batteries, flexible electrodes are usually made of a flexible conductive film substrate with functional positive and negative electrode slurries. The electrolyte, on the other hand, uses a flexible solid-state electrolyte to improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of the battery. The selection of electrode and electrolyte materials directly determines whether the flexible battery can achieve excellent electrochemical performance under different strains, which is the core issue for the realization of functionalized flexible battery. Here, the research status and flexible modification strategies of flexible carbon-based materials, lithium-based anodes, and solid-state electrolyte materials are introduced in detail.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-nanomaterials-14-01856"><title>2.1. Flexible Carbon-Based Materials</title><p>Flexible carbon-based materials with high specific surface area, high conductivity, and ideal chemical stability are widely used for the preparation of flexible electrodes [<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The main carbon-based electrode materials used for flexible LIBs are CNTs, graphene, CNFs, and CC [<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The flexible carbon-based materials themselves can be embedded with a certain amount of Li<sup>+</sup> to be used directly as anodes or combined with other active substances to form freestanding electrodes. Moreover, they can be used in flexible current collectors, so flexible carbon-based materials can effectively avoid the use of conductive additives, adhesives, and some rigid current collectors, and realize the significant improvement of electrode flexibility [<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1dot1-nanomaterials-14-01856"><title>2.1.1. Carbon Nanotube Electrodes for Flexible LIBs</title><p>CNTs are promising one-dimensional carbon materials for flexible electrodes due to their large specific surface area, low density, chemical stability, high electrical conductivity, and mechanical flexibility [<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, a large number of studies have focused on their use as active lithium storage materials and supporting substrates.</p><p>Flexible electrode materials usually need to be combined with active materials and flexible substrates to obtain high mechanical and electrochemical properties. High specific capacity Si, Ge, Sn [<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and transition metal oxides (TMOs) [<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have attracted attention as promising anode active materials for LIBs. Although these high-performance candidates can replace conventional graphite anodes as high-capacity electrode actives [<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], they still suffer from some inherent defects (e.g., poor electrical conductivity) that greatly limit their future practical applications. The electrochemical performance of TMOs can be greatly improved by shrinking them to the nanoscale level and constructing layered hybrid electrodes with carbon matrix. Guo et al. successfully synthesized a series of MnO<sub>x</sub>/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanocomposites with different compositions and morphologies by adjusting the additive amount of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surfaces of MWCNTs and allowing the binary manganese oxide nanosheets to grow perpendicularly and homogeneously over the oxidized MWCNTs (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a) [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similarly, Wang et al. employed a novel Floating catalyst premixed ethanol flame (FCPEF) approach by injecting ethanol/ferrocene/thiophene (EFT) solution into an evaporator for gasification, which was then carried by Ar and O<sub>2</sub> into a low-pressure pre-mixed ethanol flame (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH-O<sub>2</sub>-Ar), and finally in situ synthesized single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) network decorated with a carbon-encapsulated Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (C@Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SWCNT) membrane (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b) [<xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The interconnected conductive network of SWCNT improved the transport of Li<sup>+</sup> and electrolyte penetration and buffered the volume changes of anode during lithiation/delithiation. As a result, C@Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SWCNT exhibited a high capacity (1294.7 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 50 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and a high cycling stability (563.7 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 200 cycles at 2 A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) when used as a freestanding anode for LIBs. In addition, Guo et al. proposed a bimetallic Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>-silicate@CNTs flexible thin-film electrode by using CNTs to bridge and interconnect Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>-silicate nanosheets, which overcame the problem of the low number of redox pairs and poor conductivity of the conventional silicate material. [<xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] This electrode structure provided suitable channels for the rapid transport of lithium ions and electrons, ensuring a high flexibility of electrode materials.</p><p>Similarly, CNTs with high electrical conductivity can play an equally important role in forming cathodes with active materials for LIBs with excellent electrochemical properties. Li et al. assembled a full battery with lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/CNTs/CNFs as the cathode and lithium titanate (LTO)/CNTs/CNFs as the anode [<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CNTs enhanced the conductivity of the electrodes by forming a 3D conductive network, while a dual conductive network of electrons and stress release was formed in the entanglement of CNFs with the active material, which provided a strong guarantee for the maintenance of the performance of the flexible electrode. In addition, the use of directional freezing-assisted 3DP was able to produce well-oriented directional pore structures, which significantly shortened the ion transfer path in the vertical direction. These measures improved the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. The assembled full cell showed a high energy density (15.2 mWh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and a high power density (75.9 mWh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), which provided a feasible preparation solution of high energy density flexible LIBs with dynamically stabilized power output.</p><p>The metal foil current collector is a very heavy electrochemically inert component that does not contribute to the capacity and reduces the overall energy density of the battery [<xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, metal foils have smooth surfaces with low yield strains [<xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and weak adhesion to the electrode materials during mechanical bending, leading to a fast capacity attenuation and poor rate performance [<xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Studies have shown that lighter carbon nanotube current collectors can improve the mechanical stability, adhesion strength and wettability of active materials, and their interconnection networks can maintain high conductivity when bent. To fabricate a highly conductive MWCNT coated paper, Ventrapragada et al. [<xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] developed an additive-free and roll-to-roll spraying process coating CNTs onto commercial cellulose-based paper. Subsequently, MWCNT coated paper was tested as current collectors for LFP LIBs. As a result, the area capacity of the LFP coated paper carbon nanotube cathode was increased by about 17% compared to that of the aluminum-based LFP cathode, and the assembled LIBs exhibited a high energy density of 460 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a power density of 250 W kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Sharma et al. prepared a novel polar current collector by depositing a thin layer of carbon nanotube and polymer paste on aligned CFs (CF-CNT-P) [<xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The CNTs provided a uniform current density, while the carbon fibers (CFs) improved the electronic conductivity and mechanical strength of the CF-CNT-P (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c) and the polymer enhanced the adhesion of the active materials coating to the current collectors. When compared to deposition on conventional Al foils current collectors, the constructed NCM622 cells using CF-CNT-P composites as the cathode current collectors exhibited a lower charge transfer resistance, higher rate performance, and higher cycling stability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-nanomaterials-14-01856"><title>2.1.2. Graphene-Based Electrodes for Flexible LIBs</title><p>Graphene has a variety of industrial applications for flexible displays, electronics, energy storage systems, etc. [<xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The fabrication of graphene-based electrodes to build flexible batteries has received much attention, including metal-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and metal-air batteries [<xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Carbon atoms within graphene materials are bonded and tightly stacked in a sp2 hybridized manner to form a single-atom layer structure with a special hexagonal crystal shape [<xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The honeycomb structure of 2D graphene is a promising substrate for flexible electrodes, because of its light weight, excellent electrical conductivity, and superior mechanical stability [<xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned earlier, TMOs are promising anode materials for LIBs. However, due to the low conductivity and the large volumetric expansion in charge/discharge progresses, the TMOs-based electrodes tend to exhibit fast capacity attenuations in long-term cycling. Combining TMOs nanostructures with carbonaceous materials is an effective method to improve electrical conductivity and buffer the volume change. Ma et al. successfully synthesized uniformly distributed TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites (TNGC) (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d) by a simple sol-gel static self-assembly method and alkali heat treatment [<xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The nanorod structure of TiO<sub>2</sub> can provide shortened diffusion distance for Li<sup>+</sup> and the rGO network can greatly increase the electrical conductivity of the TNGC and prevent the overgrowth of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Zhao et al. formed a conductive network by growing uniformly small Fe<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (FVO) on rGO (FVO/rGO) via solvent heat treatment and subsequent calcination [<xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The FVO/rGO composites anode exhibited a high initial capacity of 1013.7 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and maintained a stable capacity of 500 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 300 cycles in LFP LIBs (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>e). In addition, Nguyen et al. synthesized a few-layer NbSe<sub>2</sub>@graphene (FLNG) composite by wet ball milling (WBM) (wet ball milled NbSe<sub>2</sub>@graphene or WBMNG) (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>f) [<xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The results for the WBMNG/Li half-cell showed a highly stable cyclic performance (~700 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 1000 cycles) and excellent rate performance (~76% capacity retention at 10 A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> compared to the capacity at 0.1 A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), suggesting that it can also serve as a new promising anode for LIBs due to its excellent electrochemical properties.</p><p>LiNi<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>(1&#x02212;x&#x02212;y)</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathodes with higher nickel content, such as LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC811), have high specific capacity but serious safety and cycle life issues [<xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Setyawati et al. added graphene to the NMC811 by simple solid-state mixing and subsequently assembled 18,650 cylindrical cells with commercial graphite anode [<xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As a result, the graphene-modified NMC cathode material showed a capacity retention of 95.83% at 1 C after 100 cycles, which was only 92.27% of the graphene-free NMC. Moreover, the highest temperature recorded during charging and discharging processes was only 46.52 &#x000b0;C at 5 C. Organic cathode materials have received increasing attention in LIBs due to their abundance, environmental friendliness, high specific capacity, low cost, and flexibility. However, their poor electrochemical performance due to their inherent low conductivity and high solubility in polar organic electrolytes has hindered their application. Sui et al. loaded 4,8-dihydrobenzo (1,2-b:4,5-b&#x02019;) dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDT) into the nanopores of 3D graphene to prepare BDT/3D graphene composites by a simple impregnation method [<xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Due to the excellent domain-limiting effect of the nanopores and the strong &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interactions with BDT, 3D graphene avoided the dissolution of BDT in the electrolyte. Additionally, graphene networks can provide a highly conductive framework with a large number of interconnected pores.

Although surface functionalization and atomic doping can improve the electrochemical performance of pure CNFs electrodes, the specific capacity and capacitance of CNFs are still unable to meet the growing requirements of the flexible electrochemical energy storage (EES) [<xref rid="B46-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, CNFs also need to be combined with other electrochemically active materials to obtain the ideal composite electrodes with high flexibility and high energy density. Huang et al. successfully prepared three-dimensional monolithic flexible composite anodes consisting of CF coated with N-doped porous exfoliated CF, NiO, and carbon quantum dots (CD) (CF/ECF/NiO/CD) [<xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Subsequently, a 45.0 cm<sup>2</sup> soft-pack full battery using commercial NCM cathode was designed and delivered a high areal capacity (41.33 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), volumetric capacity (413.3 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>), and mass capacity (134.5 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) at high current density of 5 mA. The multi-shell (CF/ECF/NiO/CD) exhibits excellent lithium storage performance as a negative electrode material for LIBs half-cells. Savignac et al. utilized CF waste from the aerospace industry to fabricate electrodes [<xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. They first surface treated the recycled CFs and then dispersed them homogeneously in an active material consisting of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) using an easily scalable one-pot process. The resulting LiFePO<sub>4</sub>-based freestanding electrodes (FSEs) showed a total electrode capacity of 141 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and an energy density of 468 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> due to the absence of current collectors and avoided high costs at the same time. CNFs can also be used to construct flexible current collectors.

The Li-S full battery equipped with Li@Cu/Cu<sub>3</sub>P-N-CNFs anode achieved a long lifetime and excellent electrochemical performance at a low N/P (about 2:1) and a high sulfur loading capacity (4.1 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). Chen et al. employed ion exchange to synthesize carbon-coated NiO nanosheet arrays on the CF surface of a flexible 3D porous CC [<xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The effective carbon coating can not only enhance the electron transfer kinetics and structural integrity of the electrode, but also buffer the repeated volume change of NiO during cycling progresses. Even at a high mass loading of 4 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, C@IENiOCC still possessed an excellent area capacity of 3.08 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and a high initial coulombic efficiency of 91.2%.

Different carbon-based materials have their own advantages and disadvantages; for example, CNFs can provide enough space to support the active substance, alleviate the volume expansion of the active material during cycling, and can also promote electron transfer. However, its functional content is low, which makes the binding force between the active substance and the nano-CF weak. Therefore, morphology engineering can improve the lithium storage capacity and cycle stability of carbon-based composites by constructing a micron-sized 3D structure composed of nanostructured units. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research on the morphology, interface structure, loading of active substances, and adaptation between active substances and carbon-based materials to ensure that the composite electrode has both high flexibility and high energy density.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nanomaterials-14-01856"><title>2.2. Flexible Lithium-Based Anodes</title><p>Despite the significant advantages of LMBs in terms of energy density, the use of lithium metal for flexible lithium anodes faces some obstacles: (1) the random growth of lithium dendrites and large volume changes during charging/discharging, which cause the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface resulting in a reduction of CE, even in the short-circuit of the battery; (2) lithium metals&#x02019; own mechanical flexibility is insufficient, and the electrode material is prone to cracking under stress, exacerbating the uneven deposition of lithium and ultimately reducing the electrochemical performance of the electrode [<xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

Flexible Lithium Hosts</title><p>The realization of flexible lithium hosts mainly starts from two aspects: the first is to directly improve the mechanical flexibility of lithium metal. For example, simply processing lithium metal anodes into lithium foils and wires can indeed provide a certain degree of flexibility when LMBs are subjected to slight mechanical deformation, but there are still problems such as dendrite formation, low yield strength, and poor fatigue resistance [<xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Gao et al. designed flexible and stable lithium-metal composite yarns (LMCY) by fast capillary filling of molten lithium into metallic carbon yarns that were used to fabricate high energy density and long-lasting linear LMBs (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a) [<xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As a result, LMCY displayed excellent electrochemical cycling stability, mechanical strength, flexibility, and durability. The foldable LFP||Li full battery obtained by matching LMCY with LFP had a volumetric energy density of more than 290 Wh L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and a capacity retention rate of more than 50% after 750 charge/discharge cycles.</p><p>The second is the development of composite lithium metal anode (CLMA) materials. Through the intervention of doping lithophilic components to regulate the lithium metal deposition process, uniform lithium deposition/stripping can be realized and the formation of lithium dendrites can be suppressed. At the same time, the composite of lithium metal and flexible 3D porous material forms a high specific surface area and porous structure, which can reduce the local current density, buffer the volume change, and improve the electrode flexibility. For example, lithium metal anodes based on 3D carbon-based fabrics present a promising strategy for achieving high-performance flexible lithium metal batteries (LMBs) [<xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Li et al. utilized a lithophilic Au layer with a simple modification to the bottom of the CFs (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b) to direct the directional deposition of Li onto the bottom of the CFs to achieve a favorable lithium-free anode/diaphragm interface, while the porous skeleton in the upper part of the CFs provides a large space to buffer the volume expansion of lithium metal [<xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The cycle life of the resulting composite lithium metal anode was doubled compared to conventional top-deposited lithium metal. Qian et al. designed a 3D flexible MXene@Au host via depositing an ultrafine and robust Au layer on MXene paper by ion sputtering [<xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The Au layer acted as a lithium nucleating agent to ensure uniform lithium deposition and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. The results showed that the LMBs with LFP cathode had a superior capacity retention rate of 98.47% even after 200 cycles (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c). Wang et al. synthesized freestanding, lightweight, and flexible MXene membranes through inducing the assembly of MXene dispersions containing trace amounts of CNFs via rotary vaporization technique (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d) [<xref rid="B58-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The interlocking between MXene sheets and microspheres significantly enhanced the toughness of the MXene film and prevented the restacking of MXene. In addition, the MXene nanosheets, with abundant polar functional groups, exhibited good lithium affinity, enabling uniform Li deposition, while the highly conductive network facilitated rapid charge transfer. The composite lithium film was extremely robust, capable of bending significantly and returning to its original state without cracking. Benefiting from these advantages, the flexible mixed lithium anode, when paired with a flexible LiFePO<sub>4</sub>/cellulose nanofiber (LFP@CNF) cathode, enabled the construction of fully flexible LMBs with high specific capacity and excellent stability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-nanomaterials-14-01856"><title>2.2.2. Flexible Interfaces</title><p>The unstable interface (inhomogeneous interfacial composition and morphology) formed between the lithium metal anode and electrolyte of LMBs leads to an inhomogeneous surface current distribution. Li<sup>+</sup> tends to deposit at high current density sites and induces dendrite growth. Due to its high reactivity, Li metal spontaneously reacts with organic components in the electrolyte to form brittle solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li surface. The cracks generated by SEI rupture further and can lead to increased current density and dendrite problems due to its inability to withstand large volume changes during Li deposition/stripping. With the crushing and fracturing of the dendrites, &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; lithium is formed, which hinders the rapid transport of Li<sup>+</sup> and further increases the interfacial impedance. This ultimately leads to reduced CE and limited cycle life of LMBs. Therefore, enabling ideal high performance flexible LMBs demands regulating the uniform deposition/stripping of lithium and suppressing the growth of dendrites. It is a very important strategy to design and fabricate highly stable and flexible electrode/electrolyte interfaces.</p><p>Several strategies have been used to design and construct electrochemically stable and mechanically flexible SEI to regulate uniform Li deposition and achieve long cycle life. In situ modification is an effective strategy to build stable interfaces by changing electrolyte components such as additives, salts, and solvents so as to form a homogeneous passivated SEI on the lithium metal surface. Ci et al. utilized the facile reduction reaction between Zn and GO solution sputtered onto the Li<sub>1.5</sub>Al<sub>0.5</sub>Ge<sub>0.5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (LAGP) surface at room temperature to in situ prepare a rGO/ZnO (GZO) flexible film to modify the LAGP/Li interface (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>e). The flexible layered rGO film improves the interfacial contact, ZnO homogenizes the Li+ flux, and the GZO flexible film prevents side reactions between the lithium metal anode and LAGP. Consequently, the LFP/Li full cell with GZO@LAGP exhibits a high capacity retention ratio of 93.8% after 100 cycles under 0.5 C at 25 &#x02103; [<xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Another common strategy is the ectopic interfacial modification, which minimizes the contact between lithium metal and electrolyte by constructing a passivation layer on the surface of the lithium metal anode, reducing the side reactions. Li et al. constructed a double-layer artificial SEI on metallic lithium based on a spray quenching method. The upper layer consisted of a flexible organic component, while the lower layer contained a large amount of LiF and lithophilic zinc nanoparticles. The zinc nanoparticles regulated the Li<sup>+</sup> flux through lithophilic sites. The fluorinated interfacial layer exhibited significant stability, effectively protecting lithium from the corrosive electrolyte and suppressing dendrite growth [<xref rid="B60-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. As a result, the improved lithium electrode was stable for more than 400 cycles in a symmetric cell at a current density of 3 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Zhang et al. designed a unique interface with flexible tent-like nano-cavities using a simple self-assembly method to achieve a reversible lithium metal anode and reduce electrolyte interference (<xref rid="nanomaterials-14-01856-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f). The Zn-O-C bonds exhibited excellent affinity for lithium metal and acted as lithophilic sites to guide uniform nucleation within the nano-cavities. Meanwhile, the flexible tent-like interface provided greater space to accommodate lithium deposition and restricted the plating/stripping process within the nano-cavities, facilitating dendrite-free lithium deposition. The flexible rGO layer enhanced the mechanical flexibility of the tent-like interface. As a result, the full cell assembled with LFP cathode exhibited excellent long-term cycling stability and rate capability, maintaining a high capacity of 94.6% after 3000 cycles at 5 C [<xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><fig position="anchor" id="nanomaterials-14-01856-f004"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Flexible lithium anode materials and their properties.

Helical Structured Flexible Battery</title><p>In addition to the above-mentioned typical types of flexible batteries, the design of helical structure flexible batteries has also attracted widespread attention. Meng et al. designed a flexible lithium battery inspired by the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double helix structure.

Cable-Type Batteries</title><p>In the flexible battery structure, flexible 1D batteries with unique advantages such as miniaturization, adaptability, and weaveability have prominent commercial application prospects. Among them, cable-based LIBs may provide a necessary breakthrough for wearable electronics due to their excellent mechanical flexibility [<xref rid="B118-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Since the cable-based flexible battery has a coaxial structure, the battery components need to be completed under special processing and preparation techniques, such as 3DP and electrochemical deposition technology, so that the electrodes and electrolyte can be coaxial aligned. Zhao et al. used 3DP technology to prepare flexible Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/rGO fiber electrodes by using reduced graphene-based printing inks. Due to the high specific surface area of the reduced rGO, a 3D conductive network is constructed inside the fiber electrode, which enhances the electronic conductivity and ion mobility. The prepared fiber electrode not only exhibits excellent mechanical properties (35% elongation at break) but also excellent electrochemical properties (83% capacity retention after 100 cycles) [<xref rid="B77-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Similarly, Ling et al. used rapid ink extrusion to introduce pyrrole-modified reduced rGO, which led to the assembly of CNTs and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) to form a robust, conductive, and agglomerate-free 3D network for linear loading of the active material. The assembled cable-type battery provides excellent cycling stability (93.9%/1 C/100 cycles) and highly stable power output (e.g., 94.8%/1 C/1000 bending cycles) in different deformation states [<xref rid="B119-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>].</p><p>In addition, cable-based LIBs usually use fibrous or two-dimensional carbon materials with good mechanical properties and continuous electronic conduction to prepare flexible electrodes so that the active materials can better adhere to the carbon materials to adapt to the deformation of cable-type batteries in practical applications [<xref rid="B120-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Hoshide et al. prepared current collectors with excellent mechanical toughness by regular packing and in situ hybridization of two-dimensional titanium oxide nanosheets with reduced rGO. Compared to most fiber electrodes, this new electrode offers significant advantages: a high linear density of active material, maximum exposure of active sites, and a stacked configuration with nanochannels between sheet structures. These properties confer excellent mechanical flexibility and electrochemical properties on fiber batteries with new electrodes, including high linear capacity, superior rate capability, and vastly improved cycling stability [<xref rid="B121-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>].</p><p>Of course, the design of the flexible battery structure not only includes the flexible design of a single battery directly, but also the flexible interface mode for the unit battery, and the combination and integration of rigid and flexible batteries. The &#x0201c;cell-to-bod (CTB) structure battery&#x0201d; for electric vehicles is a new type of battery design and integration, in which the battery cells are directly integrated into the body or chassis structure [<xref rid="B122-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>,<xref rid="B123-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. In 2022, Build Your Dreams (BYD) released its CTB technology to address next-generation battery pack design and system-level integration needs. The battery pack is designed with a sandwich structure and consists of an upper cover, BYD&#x02019;s signature blade battery cell, and an underbody protective disc, which significantly improves the integration level and increases the volume utilization rate to 66%. This integrated battery-body structure enhances overall structural strength and significantly reduces invasive damage under frontal, small overlap, and sidebar impacts [<xref rid="B123-nanomaterials-14-01856" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="anchor" id="nanomaterials-14-01856-t004"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">nanomaterials-14-01856-t004_Table 4</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Study on flexible battery designed with different flexible structures.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Structure</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Electrode Materials</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wear-and-Tear Life</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ultimate Deformation State </th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Joint-inspired structure</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Graphite&#x02016;LiCoO<sub>2</sub></td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maintain a discharge capacity of 135.9 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> without capacity fading with a torsional angle of 45&#x000b0;

Summary and Prospect</title><p>This review provides a detailed overview of flexible batteries, covering aspects from the preparation and modification of battery materials to the fabrication processes of advanced flexible materials and to the structural design of flexible batteries. It discusses the key issues in realizing the preparation of flexible batteries. Although significant research progress has been made in flexible batteries, there remains considerable room for development in the commercialization of high-performance flexible lithium batteries. The future development of flexible batteries includes the following aspects:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>Integrated Design of Flexible Battery Materials. This can enhance the closeness of interlayer contact to reduce the negative issues arising from battery deformation. For example, the active material can be grown in situ on the surface of the current collector or be integrated with the current collector using a casting method. Therefore, in future, we expect to see more integrated and seamless design of electrodes, electrolytes, and package housings.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>Simplification and cost-effectiveness of battery processes. At present, the preparation process of flexible batteries includes the preparation of electrode and electrolyte materials and the packaging and assembly of batteries. These preparation processes will inevitably lead to the complexity of the preparation process and increase the operating cost of mechanical equipment. For example, many simple and easy-to-operate technologies such as coating and printing can be used to produce flexible battery materials on a large scale.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>Development of multifunctional flexible batteries. Flexible electronic products may be able to meet the demands of deformation in different directions, such as folding, bending, and stretching at the same time in the practical application process, but current flexible batteries, whether they are made using electrode material or the battery structure design, find it difficult to meet the needs of various deformations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop flexible batteries that can achieve multiple deformations.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(4)</label><p>Establishing a comprehensive evaluation system for flexible batteries. Establish standards for flexible batteries from materials to performance and provide standards and comparison templates for researchers to develop flexible battery performance. It is mainly the mechanical propertiesand electrochemical performance during deformation of flexible electrode materials that require attention.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

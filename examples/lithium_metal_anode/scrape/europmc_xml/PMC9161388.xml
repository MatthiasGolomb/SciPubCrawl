of lithium secondary batteries with
a high energy density and shape flexibility are essential for flexible
and wearable electronics. In this study, we fabricated a high-voltage
(5 V class) flexible lithium polymer battery using a lithium nickel
manganese oxide (LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)
cathode. A LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-hybridized
gel polymer cathode (GPC) and a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membrane,
both containing a sulfolane (SL)-based highly concentrated electrolyte
(HCE), enabled the fabrication of a polymer battery by simple lamination
with a metallic lithium anode, where the injection of the electrolyte
solution was not required. GPC with high flexibility has a hierarchically
continuous three-dimensional porous architecture, which is advantageous
for forming continuous ion-conduction paths. The GPE membrane has
significant ionic conductivity enough for reliable capacity delivery.
Therefore, the fabricated lithium polymer pouch cells demonstrated
excellent capacity retention under continuous deformation conditions.
This study provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of scalable
and flexible 5 V class batteries using GPC and GPE containing SL-based
HCE.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100009027</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJAL1301</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao2c00861</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao2c00861</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Rapid
technological innovation and growing market demand for flexible
electronic devices, such as roll-up displays, wearable electronic
products, and smart electronics, require the development of reliable
and highly effective power sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) have been established as state-of-the-art power sources
for portable electronics. In recent decades, significant progress
has been achieved in the fabrication of flexible LIBs based on custom-designed
materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> In particular, electrodes based on advanced carbon-based
materials, such as carbon nanotubes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> nanofibers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> and graphene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> are used for flexibility. However, for practical
applications, viable production processes using procurable and economical
materials are of great importance. Concomitantly, the attainable energy
density of the fabricated flexible LIBs determines their application
prospects.</p><p>Cobalt-free spinel structured lithium nickel manganese
oxide (LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LNMO) is a
potential cathode
owing to its ultrahigh working voltage of 4.7 V versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup>, a large theoretical capacity of 147 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>,
and a relatively low cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Based on the mass of the active material, LNMO can provide a high
energy density of 690 Wh kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which is 20% and
30% higher than that of conventional cathode materials, LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> However, the application of this cathode material for practical
energy storage is challenging and stymied by the decomposition of
conventional carbonate-based electrolyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> In particular, the carbonate-based electrolytes suffer from oxidative
decomposition at operating voltages above 4.4 V, which leads to fading
cyclic performance and safety concerns of LIBs. Furthermore, LiPF<sub>6</sub> easily decomposes to form HF in the presence of water at
a high voltage. Trace amounts of HF may accelerate the dissolution
of the transition metal, causing a structural collapse of the LNMO
electrode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Therefore, selecting a suitable
electrolyte is crucial for the practical application of LNMO-based
batteries.</p><p>Ionic liquids (ILs) are defined as molten salts having
melting
points lower than 100 &#x000b0;C. Due to their characteristic properties
such as nonvolatility, high thermal stability, and high ionic conductivity,
well-designed ILs could meet the rigorous demands/criteria of electrolyte
applications in Li/Na-ion batteries, Li-sulfur batteries, Li-oxygen
batteries, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> We previously reported
that equimolar mixtures of Li salts and certain glymes form room temperature
liquids with high thermal and electrochemical stabilities, low flammability,
and a negligible vapor pressure similar to typical ILs, classified
as solvate ionic liquids (SILs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> The glyme-based SILs exhibit
several remarkable properties, in addition to IL-resembling properties,
such as oxidation stability enhancement of the solvent (glymes) by
coordinating with Li<sup>+</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> low
solubility toward ionic materials owing to the negligible activity
of free solvent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> and unique electrochemical
reactions due to the instability of the solvate ions, as observed
reversible electrochemical intercalation of graphite in the absence
of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) forms such as ethylene carbonate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Subsequently, the concept of SILs has been extended
to highly concentrated electrolytes (HCEs) with unique physicochemical
properties using Li salts and various solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> In certain
HCEs, significant electrochemical phenomena are reported, including
high reversibility of lithium deposition/stripping without lithium
dendrite formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> and fast electrochemical
reactions of electrode active materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Among HCEs, sulfolane (SL)-based HCEs exhibit unconventionally high
Li<sup>+</sup>-transference number owing to the highest diffusivity
of Li<sup>+</sup> among the chemical species in the electrolytes (Li<sup>+</sup>, anion, and SL), which indicates a significant contribution
of the Li<sup>+</sup> hopping conduction by the ligand (anion and
SL) exchange reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> The SL-based HCEs have
been successfully applied in Li-LiCoO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> and Li-sulfur cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> The high oxidative stability
of SL effectuates the SL-based HCEs suitable for electrolytes of high-voltage
cathode materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> Further, the main capacity fading mechanism of LNMO-based LIBs is
the oxidative decomposition of the electrolytes; however, for LIBs
using high-nickel LiNi<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Mn<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>Co<sub><italic>z</italic></sub>O<sub>2</sub>, another
high-voltage cathode material, solvation-driven degradation mechanism
by the dissolution of the transition metals is predominant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, we fabricated a gel polymer
cathode (GPC) by incorporating
an SL-based HCE and a fluorinated polymer into a LNMO cathode. The
electrochemical performance of GPC demonstrated favorable cyclability
and rate capability. Furthermore, a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE)
membrane was successfully prepared by combining a SL-based HCE and
a fluorinated polymer, which exhibited favorable mechanical stability.
Considering the advantages of GPC and GPE, a high output voltage pouch
cell (&#x0223c;4.7 V) was fabricated by laminating them using a lithium
metal anode. The cell delivered stable discharge capacities under
continuous bending, which demonstrated its high flexibility. The flexible
battery utilizing GPC and GPE may provide a new perspective for future
wearable electronics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>LNMO powder was synthesized

The initial specific discharge capacity at 0.1 C was 128 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. With an increase in the current density to 0.2 and
0.5 C, a decrease in plateau voltage was observed with discharge capacities
of 120 and 90 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively. However, the
capacity contributions of the Ni<sup>2+/4+</sup> plateaus were high,
and the well-defined Mn<sup>3+/4+</sup> plateaus under a high current
density represented the stable structure of the GPC. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b displays the rate capability
of the cell, indicating the stable cycling performance of GPC at different

Remarkably, when the current density returned to 0.1 C, 99% of the
original capacity was recovered, indicating the resilience of the
GPC. In addition, the high stability and robustness of for long-term
cycling are crucial for GPC. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements

test mainly comes from the oxidative
stability of [Li(SL)<sub>2</sub>][TFSA]. As described in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="other">Introduction</xref>, most solvents are coordinated to Li<sup>+</sup>, and trace amounts of free (uncoordinated) solvents remain
in HCEs. The HOMO level of the Li<sup>+</sup>-coordinated solvents
tends to decrease because of the strong positive electric potential
of the Li<sup>+</sup> ion, leading to the enhancement of the oxidation
stability of the coordinated solvent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Meanwhile, SL-based electrolytes have relatively high oxidation
stabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> We previously reported the liquid structures of [Li(SL)<sub>2</sub>][TFSA],<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> where the two oxygen atoms
of the SL sulfonyl group coordinated to two different neighboring
Li ions and TFSA anions form ionic clusters with Li ions, in other
words, the SL- and anion-bridged, chainlike Li-ion coordination structure.
Therefore, the Li<sup>+</sup>-coordinated SL should exhibit higher
oxidation stability than the free SL that is known to be antioxidative.
To confirm the change in the electronic state of SL owing to the coordination
with Li<sup>+</sup>, the optimized structures of SL and SL-(Li[TFSA])<sub>2</sub> complex were calculated. The initial geometries of the complexes
used for geometry optimization were prepared based on their crystal
structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> As shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c00861/suppl_file/ao2c00861_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>, the two oxygen atoms of SL are coordinated to different
Li<sup>+</sup> ions in the optimized structure (B3LYP/6-311G** level).
The optimized structure in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c00861/suppl_file/ao2c00861_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link> is
similar to that of the crystalline SL-Li[TFSA] complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> The HOMO energy levels of SL were calculated
for the isolated SL molecule and the SL-(Li[TFSA])<sub>2</sub> complex
at the B3LYP/6-311G** level using the optimized structures at the
same level, and the results are summarized in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c00861/suppl_file/ao2c00861_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>. As was the case in the glyme&#x02013;LiTFSA complexes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> a distinct decrease was observed in the HOMO
energy levels of SL by the coordination to Li<sup>+</sup> (compared
with the uncoordinated free solvent). As Li<sup>+</sup> has a positive
charge, the electric potential around the SL coordinated to Li<sup>+</sup> is high. The high electric potential stabilizes the electrons
of SL, resulting in a low HOMO energy level. The lowering of the HOMO
energy level leads to a favorable oxidation stability.</p><p>However,
the SL-based HCEs are reductively unstable in contact
with Li metal, as revealed by first-principles molecular dynamics
simulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> We demonstrated that SL
was reductively decomposed to generate tetrahydrothiophene and concurrently
formed Li<sub>2</sub>O on the anode surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> However, the Coulombic efficiency approached nearly 100% when the
cycle number increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c), suggesting that an effective SEI was formed during the
initial cycles, preventing further reductive decomposition of the
electrolyte in the extended cycles. In this experiment, thick GA55
separators were used, where a large amount of electrolyte was preserved.
A large amount of electrolyte in GA55 may contribute to the formation
of the SEI and to the high cycling performance shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>HCE-Based

Although the membrane exhibited more rumples and wrinkles after extended

states (flat, 90&#x000b0;, and 180&#x000b0; bending and rolling). Nyquist
plots of the flexible pouch cells with different bending states measured

The first semicircle from high frequency to midfrequency, denoted
as the parallel combination of R2 and CPE1 (100 Hz to 100 kHz), originates
from the interfacial impedance at the Li metal anode|GPE. Similar
semicircles at a similar characteristic frequency were observed for
a Li|GPE|Li symmetrical cell and a Li|GPE|LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> The second semicircle from midfrequency to low
frequency, denoted as the parallel combination of R3 and CPE2 (1&#x02013;100
Hz), could be attributed to the charge transfer processes between
the LNMO active particle and the electrolyte, as seen at the GPE|LiCoO<sub>2</sub> interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> The low-frequency
spur can be attributed to the diffusion-limiting impedance, designated
by Ws1. A comparison of the EIS spectra of the cells under different
bending conditions showed that the interfacial resistances (R1 and
R2) were almost constant, verifying the strong adhesion between the
current collector/GPC coating layer/GPE/Li anode interfaces. In addition,
the electrolyte resistance (R1) remained unchanged, which also supported
stable interfaces. These results support that the intimate contact
between the electrolyte, LNMO particles, and conductive carbon through
the PVDF binder may have been formed by this simple solution-based
preparation method, which ensures a stable ionic/electronic conductivity
for the electrode.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>(a) Nyquist plots of the flexible cell under different

the actual current enhanced from 0.18 to 0.73 mA owing to the increase

GPE, and lithium metal anode could be bent for more than 500 bending
cycles between 0 and 90&#x000b0; without any apparent capacity decay,
as implied by the lack of morphological change and because of the

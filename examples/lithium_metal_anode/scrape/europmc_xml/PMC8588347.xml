Introduction</title><p>Commercial Li-ion batteries with an oxide intercalation cathode, a liquid organic electrolyte, a polymer separator, and a carbon-based anode have been widely used and developed in recent years. It has been generally accepted that next-generation secondary batteries must have an improved energy density and a minimized volume/weight ratio to promote the development of portable electronic devices and electrical vehicles that can operate longer on a single charge [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among the many secondary battery chemistries proposed to take the reins from Li-ion batteries, lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are one of the most promising candidates owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), high energy density (2500 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), low cost, and nontoxicity [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These attributes have made LSBs one of the most investigated systems in academic and industrial research laboratories. Standard LSBs operate on the electrochemical redox conversion of elemental sulfur, which delivers an ultrahigh theoretical energy density. Elemental sulfur combines with Li ions during discharge and is reduced to long-chain polysulfides (Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>x</sub> (4 &#x02264; x &#x02264; 8)) before ultimately being converted into short-chain Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/Li<sub>2</sub>S at the end of the discharge process. However, LSBs cycled under practical conditions exhibit energy density and cycling stability far below theoretical expectations.</p><p>Li&#x02013;S cells have many intrinsic limitations that have been elaborately investigated and reviewed in previous literature [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Specifically, the energy density and cyclability of Li&#x02013;S coin cells are limited by (1) loading and utilization of sulfur active material in the cathode composite, (2) polysulfide dissolution and shuttling in liquid electrolytes, (3) electrolyte depletion and interfacial degradation, and (4) dendritic lithium growth and the evolution of &#x0201c;dead Li&#x0201d;. Furthermore, the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of Li&#x02013;S cells explored in the research community are restricted by excessive usage of electrolyte and lithium metal during experimentation. Studies on these issues bring new understanding to the drawbacks of scaling small-scale cells used in research laboratories to large industrial-scale Li&#x02013;S pouch cells [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many of the aforementioned difficulties of the Li&#x02013;S system are exacerbated when moving to lean electrolyte (low E/S ratio) and limited Li anode reservoir conditions; Li&#x02013;S pouch cells cycled under these protocols suffer from much faster capacity degradation (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, the gravimetric energy density and cycling stability of large-scale Li&#x02013;S pouch cells are significantly affected by sulfur active material mass loading, volumetric cell expansion, electrolyte depletion, thermal release, and the Li metal anode during practical operation (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Optimization of Li&#x02013;S battery performance under low E/S ratio conditions is typically performed with coin cells or small pouch cells. A plethora of strategies are being pursued to develop larger Li&#x02013;S pouch cells that can satisfy all of the target parameters for commercialization&#x02014;70% loading and 80% utilization of sulfur active material in cathode composite, an E/S ratio of 3 &#x003bc;L mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 3-fold lithium excess, and long-term stability [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The bulk of these approaches related to sulfur cathode construction (host design, compaction density, thickness), electrolyte (type, additives, amount), separator design (thermal management, functionalization), and engineering the Li metal anode (deposition homogenization, protection) are summarized in <xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. In this work, we review each of these concepts and evaluate their validity in addressing the intrinsic problem in the Li&#x02013;S pouch cell system operating under realistic conditions that they were designed to resolve.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-26-06341"><title>2. Li&#x02013;S Pouch Cell Cathodes</title><p>Sulfur and the final discharge product of the Li&#x02013;S battery, Li<sub>2</sub>S, are both electronic insulators. This property of the cathode active materials is one of the primary reasons for capacity degradation in Li&#x02013;S batteries upon extended cycling (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, the sulfur active material experiences a volume change of about 80% during conversion to Li<sub>2</sub>S, resulting in the physical contact loss between the active material and the electronically conductive additives in the cathode composite [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Poor compaction and electrolyte swelling in the cathode also trigger active material loss and electrolyte consumption. The precipitation of sulfur species causes compression strain&#x02013;stress of the slurry during coating, which requires a cathode composite of varying thickness to overcome. Therefore, strategies to enhance sulfur loading and utilization and compaction of the cathode are crucial objectives in accelerating the industrial realization of Li&#x02013;S pouch cells. <xref rid="sec2dot1-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1</xref> details advanced strategies focused on building robust hierarchical conductive hosts for a cathode composite with high S loading, limited volume change, and low electrolyte consumption [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

Design of Cathode Composite Architecture</title><p>To increase sulfur loading and mitigate the effects of active material volume change in the cathode composite, nanosized sulfur is usually embedded in a porous host. This host is typically macroporous or mesoporous, providing a high surface area that allows for high loading of the active material as well as Li<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductive agents. Nanopores in the host material are also effective in anchoring soluble polysulfide species at the cathode side, helping to alleviate the effect of polysulfide shuttling and active material loss. Recent advancements have allowed for the fabrication of 1D, 2D, and 3D hierarchical conductive matrices for the encapsulation of sulfur to serve as cathode composites in large-scale Li&#x02013;S pouch cells. Various electronically conductive carbon materials&#x02014;such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], graphene [<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and carbon nanofibers (CNFs)&#x02014;have been proposed as cost-effective host structures to combat the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur for scaling Li&#x02013;S batteries to pouch cells with satisfactory cycling performance [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Carbon and CoS nanotubes with sufficient lumen space enable highly loaded sulfur cathodes with a highly electronically conductive network and robust architecture for efficient active material utilization [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The strong capillarity effect and chemisorption within the inner walls of the nanotubes immobilize the polysulfides and promote their redox kinetics. As a result, Li&#x02013;S pouch cells utilizing this approach exhibited an initial capacity of 1330 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and an areal capacity of 5.05 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Subsequent cycling showed the discharge capacity remaining steady at 1060 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (4.03 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) for 200 cycles under bending&#x02013;unbending conditions, demonstrating the mechanical flexibility and stable cyclability of this scheme. Zhang et al. designed a 2D carbon host that consisted of graphitic carbon nanocages (GCNs) uniformly distributed on a graphene sheet backbone [<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The graphitic nanoshells served as highly efficient electrochemical nanoreactors having excellent electronic conductivity and structural stability, which accelerate the kinetics of electron movement and prevent the diffusion of polysulfides, while the underlying graphene sheet served as the electronic pathway between each graphite shell. Pouch cells assembled with this cathode architecture and a sulfur loading of &#x02248;77 wt% exhibited a capacity of &#x02248;1 Ah. Hu et al. reported a hybrid graphene foam&#x02013;reduced graphene oxide nested hierarchical network with nanosized sulfur composite cathode (GF&#x02013;rGO/S) [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This composite contains a 3D interconnected framework of graphene foam which provides high electrical conductivity and a porous structure that has sufficient space to house sulfur active material, a large surface area, and a short Li<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transfer pathway. Additionally, the rGO sheets of the GF&#x02013;rGO/S composite provide anchoring sites for polysulfides that help prevent the shuttling effect. A pouch cell consisting of the GF&#x02013;rGO/S cathode composite with a sulfur loading of 85.7 wt% (10 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and a cathode area of 10 cm<sup>2</sup> delivered a specific capacity of 1235 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a current density of 0.01 C.</p><p>These examples serve to illustrate that material/configuration design is a fruitful pathway to increase active material mass loading/utilization and suppress the detriments of active material volume change during cycling via simultaneously providing high-specific-areal space and regulating polysulfide shuttling in Li&#x02013;S pouch cells. Moreover, a common theme among these examples is the structural stability of the cathode composite enabling high sulfur loadings in pouch cells operated under realistic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-26-06341"><title>2.2. Cathode Compaction</title><p>In the past decade, carbon-based materials have been widely used in S cathodes, but various problems of carbon have also hindered the commercialization of lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries. Carbon-based material with a high specific surface area can serve as a superior host for sulfur, and it will also increase the interfacial resistance inside the electrode, and its lower mass density will seriously reduce the volumetric energy density of the battery [<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, the carbon material must be in a reasonable specific surface area (porosity) range [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Besides, by tuning the morphology of the carbon host, the interfacial resistance can be reduced and the packed structure can be realized. However, carbon materials that do not contribute to the capacity will jeopardize the energy density of the pouch cell.</p><p>Pouch cells with high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities require active-material dense electrodes. This factor causes concern over porosity and the amount of non-redox-active agents in the sulfur cathode composites [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B37-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. High-porosity conductive carbon additives and matrices in the cathode allow for high sulfur loading and effective electrochemical operation; however, they also cause additional electrolyte adsorption and the formation of more parasitic precipitates, which lead to cathode passivation and electrolyte depletion. Having a compact sulfur cathode is expected to restrain sulfur segregation, decrease electrolyte consumption, and reduce the mass-transfer resistance of polysulfide species in the cathode layer. Recent studies have shown that the compaction density of the cathode can be improved by adjusting the electrode compositions and employing external stacking pressure; the right-hand side of <xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows a schematic summary of these strategies.</p><p>Li et al. [<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] introduced Chevrel-phase Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> into the cathode composite to form a hybrid intercalation&#x02013;conversion cathode that effectively increases the tap density of the composite in pouch cells. The Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> offers an electronic matrix as good as carbon, greatly decreasing the necessary carbon content from ~30 wt% in traditional C/S<sub>8</sub> cathodes to ~10 wt% to achieve the required electronic pathway in the cathode composite. Reducing the amount of carbon in the cathode composite for this system has the added benefit of decreasing the thickness of the electrode while maintaining its homogeneous morphology. The uniformly dispersed Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> allowed for the overall packing density of the cathode with a sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> to double and the amount of required electrolyte to be minimized owing to the reduced porosity of the electrode (from ~70% to 55 vol%). Ah-level pouch cells with this hybrid cathode and a low E/S ratio exhibited gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 366 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 581 Wh L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. The metal compound with high tap density, which can reduce volume variation and contribute capacity during charge and discharge, is a superior substrate for the conductive agent of next-generation Li&#x02013;S batteries [<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A metal compound with reasonable porosity, high tap density, excellent conductivity, and reversible capacity in the voltage range is the main basis for the design of the next generation of S cathodes. In detail, reasonable porosity and high tap density mean that the volume change can be alleviated, but the overall energy density is not reduced. Excellent electrical conductivity is an indispensable condition for metal compounds to replace carbon materials because free internal charge transfer is necessary for sulfur cathodes. The reversible capacity of some metal compounds can further increase the theoretical specific capacity of the sulfur cathode, which is not available in carbon materials.</p><p>Additional critical issues concerning the compaction of a cathode having a high sulfur content are the maintenance of adequate physical contact with the current collector during cycling and its resiliency to severe mechanical stress such as bending, rolling, folding, or the localized stress induced by the volume expansion of sulfur during cycling in a pouch cell. Alleviating these issues requires multifunctional binders to be added to the cathode composite. Conductive polymers&#x02014;including aqueous and nonaqueous binders such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI), and poly(3,4-(ethylenedioxy)thiophene) (PEDOT)&#x02014;have been widely used to mechanically stabilize the sulfur cathode from contact loss and aid in preventing polysulfide release [<xref rid="B38-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A 3D-network electronically conductive binder with strong interchain interactions was introduced in a sulfur cathode by Liu et al. to ensure a mechanically robust electrode with a high sulfur loading [<xref rid="B39-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The 3D-network binder has a high adhesive force and a high tolerance to volume change, allowing the use of cathode with high sulfur loading. A prototype cell having a cathode with 19.8 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> sulfur delivered an areal capacity of 26.4 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> owing to the reduced modulus and hardness of the N&#x02013;GG&#x02013;XG binder. Moreover, this cell showed improved capacity retention, maintaining a capacity of 724 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> after 150 cycles at 0.5 C, and outstanding rate capability, having a capacity as high as 737 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a 5 C rate. These improved performance metrics are attributed to the effective binding of oxygen-containing functional groups in the biopolymer to the polysulfide species formed during cycling [<xref rid="B39-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A water-based dual-cross-linked polymer binder (PACEC) was designed to maintain a compact electrode while aiding in preventing the shuttle effect of the cathode (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The enhanced adhesion strength and remarkable LiS<sub>x</sub> adsorption of PACEC allowed for a sulfur loading of 14.8 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> in a crack-free cathode composite. Pouch cells with a cross-sectional electrode area of 6 cm<sup>2</sup> and 177% lithium achieved a capacity of 6.5 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.74% per cycle [<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Volume expansion perpendicular to the face of the cathode in the pouch cells during cycling has been measured with a laser thickness gauge [<xref rid="B40-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. External pressure was used to achieve a highly compact cathode during cycling (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Maiga et al. systematically studied the performance of Li&#x02013;S pouch cells under various pressures ranging from 0 to 600 kg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> [<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The results showed that a pressurized cathode with 90 wt% sulfur loading was able to deliver an initial energy density of 11.7 mWh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and retain 8.4 mWh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> after 900 cycles at a 0.2 C rate under 600 kg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of pressure. Even at a high areal sulfur-loading of 15.125 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, an areal energy density of 19.24 mWh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> was obtained. This value is 1.7 times larger than that of a commercial Li-ion battery. Using stack pressure during cycling offers a facile method to enable high-areal-capacity sulfur cathodes, which enhances the commercial viability of Li&#x02013;S batteries. <xref rid="molecules-26-06341-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes effective cathode architectures for practical Li&#x02013;S pouch cells. These strategies are still in their infancy and require additional development before they are industrially applicable. A cathode configuration must consist of at least 70 wt% sulfur to be commercially viable. Thus, the remaining weight of the cathode composite should consist of 10&#x02013;15 wt% host material, 10&#x02013;15 wt% conductive agent, and 3&#x02013;5 wt% binder. These ranges provide a rough framework that can be adjusted based on the required application. In addition to a proper cathode architecture, operating pressure and current density should be given careful consideration for a Li&#x02013;S pouch cell to obtain optimal electrochemical performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-26-06341"><title>3. Electrolytes for Li&#x02013;S Pouch Cells</title><p>The electrolyte not only provides ionic transport between the two electrodes in a Li&#x02013;S battery but also serves as a reaction medium for the conversion of the sulfur species within the cathode.

A pouch cell with a sulfur loading of 2 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and a Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>-coated PP separator exhibited a specific capacity of 1185 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and remained stable for 30 cycles.</p><p>Studies have shown that single atoms with 100% reaction efficiency can catalyze the reaction kinetics of intermediates in a Li&#x02013;S battery. Niu et al. prepared a nitrogen-doped graphene with an Ni&#x02013;N<sub>4</sub> structure (Ni@NG) on the separator [<xref rid="B83-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In this scheme, the Ni atoms acted as active sites for adsorbing polysulfides (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) to form S<sub>x</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup> Ni&#x02013;N bonds. Meanwhile, charge transfer between the oxidized Ni atoms and the polysulfide species accelerated the redox conversion of polysulfides, improving the utilization of active sulfur species. A pouch cell assembled with this Ni@NG separator exhibited a high initial capacity of 1301.0 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 0.1 C rate and 580.8 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3.0 C rate. After 200 cycles at a 1 C rate, the cell retained 80.5% of its capacity.</p><p>Aside from PP/PE separator coatings, metal&#x02013;organic frameworks (MOFs) with intramolecular pores are unique materials that can act as molecular sieves to selectively block polysulfide migration from the cathode to the anode in a Li&#x02013;S cell (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). A flexible MOF@PVDF&#x02013;HFP separator proposed by Zhou et al. showed improved mechanical properties and the ability to block polysulfide migration [<xref rid="B74-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Pouch-type Li&#x02013;S cells with a sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> were assembled with this MOF@PVDF&#x02013;HFP separator; they delivered an initial capacity of 1269 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and retained a capacity of 936 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 200 cycles.</p><p><xref rid="molecules-26-06341-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarizes the performance of Li&#x02013;S pouch cells with the aforementioned separator strategies. Casting a functional coating on a traditional polyolefin separator or using an MOF-based separator are the two most promising strategies for improving the safety of Li&#x02013;S pouch cells while enhancing their electrochemical performance and thermal characteristics. Carbon-based polyolefin separator coatings provide a high thermal conductivity and facilitate fast heat dissipation in the cell. MOF-based separators are exceptional at sieving polysulfide anions to prevent their migration to the anode. Each of these approaches also provides the added benefit of improving the mechanical properties of the separator, which aids in preventing lithium dendrite growth. These findings have sparked investigation into separator engineering specifically for Li&#x02013;S pouch cells and its effect on cell safety. Further research into each of these aspects of separator design is necessary before they can be applied commercially.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-molecules-26-06341"><title>5. Strategies for the Lithium Metal Anode</title><p>Polysulfide shuttling is the main cause of failure in coin cells. However, the lithium metal anode is the primary cause of failure in pouch cells [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B90-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. At large current densities, the deposition of mossy Li and volume expansion during plating&#x02013;stripping damage the interface contact, which induces greater cell polarization. These factors ultimately deteriorate the performance of the pouch cell during extended cycling. It is common to use a large excess of lithium in a Li&#x02013;S battery. However, the formation and shuttling of polysulfide species can cause the formation of a thick SEI and severe lithium anode corrosion. Upon expansion and contraction of the lithium metal anode during cycling, the SEI layer is easily damaged and results in the formation of a new SEI where fresh lithium metal is exposed by the cracks. SEI phases are intrinsically electronic insulators. This property often leads to the deposition of &#x0201c;dead Li&#x0201d;. The loss of active lithium metal from the anode and the high resistance of the SEI layer contributes to the low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling performance of large-scale Li&#x02013;S cells. Current strategies aim to homogenize Li<sup>+</sup> deposition, reduce &#x0201c;dead Li&#x0201d;, and restrain the parasitic corrosion of the lithium metal anode by using lithium deposition hosts and artificial protective layers on the surface of the anode (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B73-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B91-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p><sec id="sec5dot1-molecules-26-06341"><title>5.1. Hosts for Metallic Lithium Deposition</title><p>Localized electric fields and concentration polarizations are the primary cause of uneven lithium deposition and lithium dendrite formation at the anode side [<xref rid="B92-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Therefore, homogenizing the electric field at the electrolyte&#x02013;anode interface is crucial to enable uniform Li<sup>+</sup> ion deposition during cycling. Host structures are an ideal way to accomplish this task while having the added benefit of being able to mitigate metallic lithium volume expansion and tailor lithium nucleation sites within the host architecture [<xref rid="B93-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Regulating these two factors is an effective way to inhibit the growth of mossy Li in Li&#x02013;S cells (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Lightweight nanomaterials that are porous enough to serve as a host for plated lithium metal and provide fast electron transfer are highly recommended for stabilizing the lithium metal anode in Li&#x02013;S pouch cells.</p><p>For instance, flexible carbonaceous materials with a high specific surface area fit the requirements of an efficient lithium metal host. The porosity and high electronic conductivity provide a large deposition surface and uniform lithium nucleation sites. He et al. proposed a flexible CoNi nanoparticle-embedded porous conductive scaffold (CoNi@PNCFs) as a deposition host for a Li&#x02013;S pouch cell anode [<xref rid="B73-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The porous scaffold and CoNi nanoparticles in CoNi@PNCFs provide abundant nucleation sites and a uniform electric field to yield a homogeneous local current density for Li plating (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Luo et al. designed a mechanically robust r-GO-based anode for Li&#x02013;S pouch cells that is tolerant to extreme bending. The r-GO served as a support for lithium metal deposition and had a more evenly distributed current density during lithium plating&#x02013;stripping [<xref rid="B94-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. As a result, mossy Li deposition and corrosion due to polysulfide species were halted. The Li&#x02013;S pouch cell using the rGO/Li anode delivered a capacity around 900 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and maintained stable operation for over 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> while the cell was bent.</p><p>Providing a flexible host matrix for a lithium anode is a promising strategy for achieving structural stability while accommodating the volume change incurred during Li stripping&#x02013;plating. A host with a high active surface area and nucleation sites of equal energy can help to unify the local electric field and decrease the probability of Li dendrite growth at the anode.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot2-molecules-26-06341"><title>5.2. Artificial Protective Layer</title><p>When mossy lithium and dendritic lithium form, they are quickly oxidized in the presence of an organic electrolyte and dissolved polysulfides. This process, which generates new SEI on the exposed lithium metal anode, continues indefinitely to deplete the electrolyte and results in a thick interphase layer that enables the formation of &#x0201c;dead Li&#x0201d;. This issue becomes more severe in Li&#x02013;S cells with high sulfur loading under lean electrolyte conditions where the high-concentration polysulfide species add an additional contribution to the SEI layer formation by shuttling to the anode and corroding the lithium metal [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A mechanically robust protection layer on the lithium metal surface is a proposed strategy to alleviate these issues. Various inorganic and organic materials (such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>3</sub>N, LiPON, polymer) have been deposited on the surface of lithium metal to form a high-quality artificial protective layer in Li metal batteries. Herein, facile and economical approaches to this strategy are discussed for Li&#x02013;S pouch cells with a high sulfur loading and low E/S ratio.</p><p>For example, an ultrathin layer of Mg deposited on Li metal can form a Li-rich alloy that has a low charge transfer energy barrier and only a moderate surface reactivity during cycling [<xref rid="B95-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Lithium metal is able to uniformly plate&#x02013;strip through this Li<sub>x</sub>Mg layer, which has a morphology that remains stable under repeated cycling. This thin alloy layer also inhibits the side reactions between the anode and electrolyte components, especially polysulfide species. Researchers have also developed in situ electrochemical deposition strategies to form stable artificial interphase layers on a lithium metal anode. Manthiram et al. stabilized Li deposition by introducing tellurium (Te) as an additive in a cell with limited lithium in the anode and a low E/S ratio [<xref rid="B91-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The in situ formed tellurium and sulfide-rich SEI film on the lithium surface significantly improved the reversibility of Li plating&#x02013;stripping. Specifically, during the lithiation process, Te can form a novel bilayer SEI consisting of Li<sub>2</sub>TeS<sub>3</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>Te on the anode surface (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This SEI layer provides a lower Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion barrier energy that helps the homogeneous deposition of lithium. Interfacial and charge-transfer resistances are also lowered with this strategy, which mitigates electrolyte decomposition and enhances interfacial stability at the anode. A large-area pouch cell (39 cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) with this Te additive operating under lean electrolyte conditions (4.5 &#x003bc;L mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and a cathode sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> showed enhanced cycling stability.</p><p>Artificial protective layers have also been used to control the mechanical integrity of the anode&#x02013;electrolyte interface. Some of the fabricated artificial layers have successfully enabled intimate contact with lithium metal while remaining chemically compatible with the reactive Li metal anode. Wen et al. proposed a composite protective layer (CPL) with LAGP (Li<sub>1.5</sub>Al<sub>0.5</sub>Ge<sub>1.5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) for this purpose [<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The LAGP CPL effectively inhibits the lithium metal corrosion from polysulfides and also suppresses the growth of lithium dendrites owing to its high Young&#x02019;s modulus (<xref rid="molecules-26-06341-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). A pouch cell with this LAGP CPL retained &#x0223c;74% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles at a 0.5 C rate. A protective layer consisting of Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> and its derivatives was developed by Wen et al. [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The facile Li<sup>+</sup> transfer and soft&#x02013;glassy nature of Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> made the artificial SEI layer able to mitigate the negative effects of anode volume change during cycling and enhance the interfacial stability during Li<sup>+</sup> plating. A pouch cell with a sulfur loading of 3.8~4.2 g cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and a LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free electrolyte delivered a discharge capacity of 803 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 20 cycles and a stable Coulombic efficiency.</p><p>The use of lithium metal anodes for soft-pack batteries faces a very difficult challenge. For uniform and sustainable lithium plating&#x02013;stripping over extended cycling, there must be uniform lithium nucleation sites and uniform electric field strength, and the generation of mossy or dendritic lithium must be suppressed. These requirements can be met through specific strategies for tailoring the anode structure and surface, such as using a host structure that can house metallic lithium within its pore space or through the construction of a stable artificial interfacial layer on the surface of the lithium metal anode that promotes uniform lithium plating&#x02013;stripping and inhibits the occurrence of parasitic side reactions. Each of these approaches can effectively enable a lithium metal anode in a small-sized pouch cell. It is worth noting that the stability of lithium anodes differs greatly between small-current coin cell-type batteries and high-current pouch cells. One must pay close attention to the behavior of lithium anodes under various current densities in large-sized pouch cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6-molecules-26-06341"><title>6. Safety Concerns</title><p>The safety of pouch cells is a comprehensive problem, and the main obstacles come from Li dendrites and thermal management. The uneven electric field distribution and the sluggish Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion rate cause the extreme growth of lithium dendrites in the vertical direction and the short circuit [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The problem of Li dendrites can be solved in the following ways: (1) accelerating the diffusion rate of lithium ions on the anode and inhibiting lithium dendrites, including the construction of robust artificial SEI and the modification of lithiophilic materials; (2) using lithiophilic and conductive materials to homogenize the electric field strength and promote the uniform plating of lithium metal; and (3) improving the mechanical strength of the separator and resisting the puncture of Li dendrites. As for the safety issues caused by thermal runaway, separator modification is believed to be able to effectively alleviate thermal runaway [<xref rid="B82-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Because PP and PE have poor thermal conductivity, they lead to heat accumulation, which is especially obvious in the presence of dendrites. The development of a new type of membrane with better fireproofing also has a bright future, because it can avoid the use of PP and PE membranes [<xref rid="B96-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In addition, replacing the electrolyte system or adding thermally stable additives to the electrolyte can also avoid safety problems caused by thermal runaway; for example, electrolytes with high boiling points and high flash points can be used as replacements, or flame retardants can be added [<xref rid="B56-molecules-26-06341" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. At present, there is little research in this direction for Li&#x02013;S batteries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7-molecules-26-06341"><title>7. Conclusions and Perspectives</title><p>The main challenges of Li&#x02013;S pouch cells have been outlined, and promising strategies for overcoming each of these issues have been summarized. To obtain a Li&#x02013;S pouch cell with efficient electrochemical performance and a long cycle-life, the polysulfide shuttling effect and the problems related to the lithium metal anode must be addressed. Additionally, there is still work to be done on the cathode side in terms of active material utilization and sulfur loading before industrially relevant gravimetric and volumetric energy densities can be realized. Well-designed structures for cathode and anode materials can provide stable hosts for sulfur active material and lithium metal deposition, respectively. The design of matrix architectures for the sulfur cathode and lithium metal anode are still in their initial stages. To further this field, the needs to be a unified approach to assessing the commercial relevance of such cell design parameters as cathode densification, host swelling with electrolyte injection, thermal simulation, and stack pressure. A protective artificial interfacial layer on the lithium metal anode surface can effectively suppress lithium dendrite nucleation, inhibit parasitic side reactions, and limit the need for excess lithium metal and electrolyte. This crucial feature of this approach directly increases the energy density of Li&#x02013;S pouch cells by reducing the weight and volume of components in the cell. Key properties for an ex situ or/and in situ prepared SEI, including composition, mechanical strength, (electro)chemical properties, density, thickness, and electronic/ionic conductivity, are not systematic and should be assessed and characterized in a cell with a low E/S ratio. Further, our scientific understanding of their role and their commercial feasibility in large-scale Li&#x02013;S pouch cells should be noted. In addition, the investigation of electrolytes should be carefully designed with careful attention given to such parameters as ionic conductivity, electrolyte uptake, and the compatibility of the cathode/anode with thermal safety improvement. Adding functional additives or employing novel liquid- or solid-state electrolytes that can enable lean electrolyte conditions while having a large electrochemical window and stable interfacial compatibility would be a significant step forward in enabling practical Li&#x02013;S pouch cells. Separators are of note for Li&#x02013;S batteries because they can directly restrict the shuttling of polysulfide species. Their porosity, mechanical and thermal properties, electrolyte uptake, and volume expansion rate with electrolyte should not be neglected when assessing the safety factors of Li&#x02013;S pouch cells.</p><p>The realization of large-scale Li&#x02013;S pouch cells with a high energy density and a long cycle-life is a complex topic with many factors and mechanisms to contemplate. Sulfur utilization, cathode densification, electrolyte volume, lithium amount, interfacial design, electrode architecture, external stack pressure, operating parameters, and safety need to be carefully considered based on the desired commercial application for such cells. Future work on solving these issues is a key step towards reaching commercial Li&#x02013;S pouch cells for a sustainable future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, W.Z. and L.D.; methodology, H.S., Z.C., and L.D.; investigation, S.L. and A.Z.; data curation, A.Z.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, W.Z.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, W.Z. and S.L.; supervision, H.S., Z.C., and L.D.; project administration, L.D.; funding acquisition, L.D.

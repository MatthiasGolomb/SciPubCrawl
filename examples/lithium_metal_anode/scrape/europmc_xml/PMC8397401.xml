and high-voltage operation are key metrics for advanced,
solid-state energy storage devices to power low- or zero-emission
HEV or EV vehicles. In this study, we propose the modification of
single-ion conducting polyelectrolytes by designing novel block copolymers,
which combine one block responsible for high ionic conductivity and
the second block for improved mechanical properties and outstanding
electrochemical stability. To synthesize such block copolymers, the
ring opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC)
monomer by the RAFT-agent having a terminal hydroxyl group is used.
It allows for the preparation of a poly(carbonate) macro-RAFT precursor
that is subsequently applied in RAFT copolymerization of lithium 1-[3-(methacryloyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate. The resulting
single-ion conducting block copolymers show improved viscoelastic
properties, good thermal stability (<italic>T</italic><sub>onset</sub> up to 155 &#x000b0;C), sufficient ionic conductivity (up to 3.7 &#x000d7;
10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 70 &#x000b0;C), and
high lithium-ion transference number (0.91) to enable high power.
Excellent plating/stripping ability with resistance to dendrite growth
and outstanding electrochemical stability window (exceeding 4.8 V
vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li at 70 &#x000b0;C) are also achieved, along with
enhanced compatibility with composite cathodes, both LiNiMnCoO<sub>2</sub> &#x02013; NMC and LiFePO<sub>4</sub> &#x02013; LFP, as well
as the lithium metal anode. Lab-scale truly solid-state Li/LFP and
Li/NMC lithium-metal cells assembled with the single-ion copolymer
electrolyte demonstrate reversible and very stable cycling at 70 &#x000b0;C
delivering high specific capacity (up to 145 and 118 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively, at a C/20 rate) and proper operation even at a higher
current regime. Remarkably, the addition of a little amount of propylene
carbonate (&#x0223c;8 wt %) allows for stable, highly reversible cycling
at a higher C-rate. These results represent an excellent achievement
for a truly single-ion conducting solid-state polymer electrolyte,
placing the obtained ionic block copolymers on top of polyelectrolytes
with highest electrochemical stability and potentially enabling safe,
practical Li-metal cells operating at high-voltage.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100010661</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>730957</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ma1c00981</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ma1c00981</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The global rechargeable
battery market is forecasted to reach 250
billion euros per year by 2025, around 60% of which is committed for
the advanced materials market and the rest is for investments in manufacturing
capacity, R&#x00026;D, and other supporting activities. The growth in
electrification of modern society in the next decade will mainly be
driven by the irreversible move toward decarbonization in many critical
sectors, and batteries are identified as high-performance systems
to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation
sector, stabilize the power grid, and support a wide range of strategic
industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> With such a rising demand
across all application areas, there is an industrial pull to manufacture
high-quality batteries providing enhanced energy/power densities,
safety, and low-cost, along with a long cycle life and calendar lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are key technology
due to their high
energy density, lightweight, fast charge/discharge, and long lifetime.
Typical electrolytes for commercial LiBs are liquids or gels, soaked
in a porous plastic layer, acting both as a storage reservoir and
electronic separator of positive and negative electrodes. The two
main advantages of liquid electrolytes are high ionic conductivity
and excellent wetting properties of the active material particles
that account for rather fast ionic diffusion in the bulk and low charge-transfer
interfacial resistance. However, liquid electrolytes suffer from relatively
high reactivity and thermodynamic instability at the electrode/electrolyte
interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> This is even more problematic with lithium
metal: its volumetric changes, induced by the formation of high-surface-area
lithium, account for the generation of an unstable solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI) and related dendrite growth, which affect the cycling
performances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> In addition, any voltage
(overcharge) or temperature (overheating during high power use) fluctuations
often correspond to cell instability and safety problems (fire breakout,
gas evolution, depressurization of the battery case, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Solid-state battery technology has recently gathered considerable
attention from world-leading companies (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Dyson)
and remains among the most promising solutions to power the next generation
of electric vehicles including commercial and light duty vehicles,
buses, and trucks due to the advantages in terms of energy density,
safety, and processability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> In the last
decade, Blue Solutions has demonstrated the technical viability of
the LMP battery in car sharing services, city buses, and stationary
electrical storage. These demonstrations were particularly impressive
in hot climates where LiB-based systems typically suffer from premature
capacity fading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><p>The scientific
community is very active in finding the best truly
solid-state polymer electrolyte (SPE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The task is still very challenging, and meeting safety and performance
requirements is presently the key hurdle to be overcome to enable
widespread commercialization of next-generation solid-state LiBs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Among SPEs, a new class of polyelectrolytes, namely, &#x0201c;single
ion conducting polyelectrolytes&#x0201d; (SICPs), has deserved considerable
attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> SICPs are composed of a polymer backbone bearing covalently bonded
anionic functional groups along with free-to-move lithium counter
ions responsible for cation mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Because of the single-ion nature, their lithium transference number
values approach unity, with remarkable benefits to the electrochemical
performance, as Li<sup>+</sup> ions are predominantly engaged in the
redox reaction while anions remain relatively inactive. The characteristics
of such electrolyte materials in terms of ionic conductivity, Li<sup>+</sup> ion transference number (<italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup>), electrochemical stability, flexibility, and processability
are strictly related to the type of polymer backbone, nature, and
charge delocalization of anchored anions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Early reports on SICPs obtained via free radical polymerization
were mainly focused on monomers bearing strongly coordinating anions,
such as carboxylates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> and sulfonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Further, the family of SICPs was expanded with
polyelectrolytes bearing borate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> phosphate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> 1,2,3-triazolate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> aluminate ([Al(OR)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), and thioaluminate
([Al(SR)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) anions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> However, the real breakthrough in terms of the increase
of ionic conductivity was achieved after the introduction of weakly
coordinating and highly delocalized anions structurally similar to
the well-known bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) ion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> The introduction of the TFSI or fluorosulfonylimide (FSI)-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> anchored anions allowed a 2 to 3 order of magnitude
increase in the ionic conductivity of SICPs in comparison with those
bearing sulfonate and borate anions. Despite the rather weak coordination
between the anions and the lithium cations, the glass transition temperatures
(<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) of such homopolymers were still relatively
high (&#x0003e;90 &#x000b0;C). Thus, the next improvement was attained either
by the copolymerization of ionic monomers with neutral ones having
long flexible oxyethylene segments, such as poly(ethylene glycol)
methyl ether methacrylate (PEGM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> or by the
synthesis of triblock copolymers, growing the ionic blocks from central
polyethylene oxide blocks with variable molar masses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> Both these approaches allowed for lowering the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of SICPs and, thus, for enhancing their ionic conductivity
to a higher level (up to 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 25 &#x000b0;C).</p><p>Apart from ionic conductivity and Li<sup>+</sup> transference number,
other fundamental features of SICPs include a wide electrochemical
stability window and compatibility with the active materials, particularly
lithium metal. The electrochemical stability defines the potential
interval where the polyelectrolyte remains stable to the electrochemical
reactions occurring at the interface with the electrodes. While the
presence of ethylene oxide (EO) units tends to decrease the glass
transition of SICPs and, consequently, to increase the ionic conductivity,
it generally restricts the electrochemical stability of such polyelectrolytes
vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li in the range of 4.0&#x02013;4.5 V.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> The promotion of high-voltage stability in poly(ethylene
carbonate)/Li salt polymer electrolytes in comparison with PEO/Li
salt systems was demonstrated previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> Mecerreyes
and co-workers have recently applied the same approach to SICPs consisting
of a combination of -EO- and carbonate units in a single polymer backbone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Such introduction of carbonate groups allowed
an increase in electrochemical stability of SICPs up to 4.9 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li at 70 &#x000b0;C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup></p><p>Several
examples of solid-state SICP electrolytes delivering excellent
results on the anode side have been already reported to date;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> conversely, the long-term stability with high-voltage
cathodes (e.g., lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide&#x02013;NMC at
low Co content or Li-rich NMC) is still compromised due to the limited
electrochemical stability at anodic voltage values above 4.5 V vs
Li<sup>+</sup>/Li. To the best of our knowledge, the only SICP successfully
tested with a high voltage NMC-based cathode in a lab-scale cell was
the abovementioned polyelectrolyte having the poly(ethylene oxide
carbonate) main chain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Its single Li-ion
conducting features along with high voltage stability resulted in
good performances of NMC-based half cells at a C/20 rate and 70 &#x000b0;C
in the 2.8&#x02013;4.2 V range. Notwithstanding the promising cycling
results in NMC-based half cells with SICP derived from poly(ethylene
oxide carbonate),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> the Li metal anode
required a special pretreatment with 2 M solution of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
(LiFSI) in dimethoxyethane. This was explained by the failure of the
SICP electrolyte to form a highly conductive SEI layer under the defined
cycling conditions. Such a limitation can be overcome by the design
of an SICP macromolecular architecture that will lead to the formation
of a Li metal/electrolyte interface in which carbonate units will
form the predominant domain. Previously, it was shown that the synthesis
of SICPs in the form of block copolymers may lead to the desired phase
separation and even to an increase in ionic conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup></p><p>In this work, we focused on the development of novel poly[(ionic
liquid)-<italic>b</italic>-(carbonate)] block copolymers (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref></xref>) with single Li-ion
conducting features, showing greatly enhanced performance toward the
state of the art of solid-state electrolyte systems, chiefly in terms
of electrochemical stability and compatibility with both high voltage
cathodes (NMC) and lithium metal anode, which resulted in reversible
cycling near theoretical capacity in lab-scale Li-metal cells. Moreover,
the addition of the polycarbonate block to the poly(ionic liquid)
resulted in the significant enhancement of the mechanical properties
of the resultant block copolymer electrolytes. For this purpose, the
reported approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> consisting of the utilization
of the RAFT-agent having a terminal hydroxyl group as a dual initiator
was applied, which allowed the subsequent realization of ring opening
polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) monomer and reversible
addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of methacrylic
monomers. In the first step, ROP of TMC was exploited using 4-cyano-4-(dodecylsulfanylthiocarbonyl)sulfanylpentanol
(CDP) as the initiator and 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU)
as the catalyst for the preparation of the poly(carbonate)-based macro-RAFT
precursor (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref></xref>). It was further utilized in the second step for the synthesis of
different series of block copolymers comprising lithium 1-[3-(methacryloyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
(LiMTFSI) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGM)
via RAFT polymerization. The resulting block copolymer electrolytes
showed significantly improved mechanical properties (3 to 4 order
of magnitude increase in storage moduli, at both 25 and 70 &#x000b0;C,
compared to random copolymer based on LiMTFSI and PEGM), high oxidative
stability (&#x02265;4.8 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li at 70 &#x000b0;C), enhanced
compatibility with the composite cathode components (NMC, LFP, electronic
conductive additives) as well as the lithium metal anode, high Li-ion
transport to enable high power, and excellent plating/stripping ability
with resistance to dendrite growth.</p><fig id="sch1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title>Synthetic Route for

elaborating a new metal-free green method, which uses various alcohols
(benzyl alcohol, glycerol, propane-1,3-diol, etc.) as initiators and
highly basic amines (1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene

scan rate (0.1 mV s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) allowed for the detection
of the faint reduction process, which was correlated with a small
current flow just above 1 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, whereas the peak
at about 1.5 V was likely ascribed to the decomposition of some electrolyte
components, thus forming a passivating layer toward the lithium metal
electrode, as well as to the reduction of some traces of side products
from the synthesis. Well-defined and highly reversible lithium plating/stripping
processes are clearly observable, as for the highly reversible couple
of reduction/oxidation peaks between &#x02212;0.5 and 0.5 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, which confirms the efficient transfer of lithium ions
through the polymer network and at the polymer electrolyte/electrode
interface. In the following anodic scan toward higher potential values,
the possible oxidation of the electrolyte was ruled out, as for the
absence of any detrimental oxidative processes below 4.2 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li. The oxidation peak starting at above 4.2 V and closing
at about 5 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li in the first anodic scan was likely
associated with the partial decomposition of ethylene oxide containing
moieties in the polymer electrolyte. During the successive cycles,
the intensity of the peaks largely decreased, which makes it difficult
to identify any appreciable oxidative currents up to 5.5 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li. In general, the anodic decomposition of an electrolyte

the wide ESW (up to 5.5 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li at 70 &#x000b0;C). This

As detailed in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c00981/suppl_file/ma1c00981_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>, the LFP-based electrode
with a reasonably high active material loading of 4.17 mg cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> was obtained in the form of a catholyte using the same copoly8 as
the active binder. The aim is to provide an ionically conducting interface
between the SICP and the active material particles to enhance their
&#x0201c;wettability&#x0201d; in the bulk of the electrode and to decrease
the ion diffusion resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Actually, unlike conventional batteries with
liquid electrolytes, where the ion conduction inside the cathode is
assured by homogeneous wetting of the electrolyte through the porosity
of the composite electrode, in solid-state cells, the ionic conduction
is often limited to the contact area at the interface with the SPE.
To ensure proper drying, the obtained catholyte films were treated
under high vacuum at 60 &#x000b0;C and stored for 48 h in a dry glove
box prior to cell assembly. The cell was assembled using the neat
copoly8 as the electrolyte without any further treatment of the electrodes
or any plasticizers/enhancers (e.g., solvents, salts). The electrochemical
behavior of the solid-state lab-scale cell (70 &#x000b0;C and C/20 rate,
based on the theoretical specific capacity of the LFP active material)
is shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>a. It delivered stable and efficient charge/discharge cycling (&#x0003e;145

at the first cycle, which corresponds to &#x0003e;91% of the practical
specific
capacity output (158 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at C/20) provided by
the commercial LFP used as the active material when cycled with a
standard LP30 liquid electrolyte. Excellent cycling stability and
capacity retention were demonstrated upon prolonged cycling, with
a very limited (&#x02264;2%) specific capacity drop after 10 cycles,
and outstandingly high Coulombic efficiency (CE) approaching 100%
during the whole cycling test. This is actually a remarkable result,
particularly considering the active material loading, which is definitely
high for a lab-scale polymer electrolyte cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref></sup> and not too far from standard commercial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup> The excellent CE confirms the reversibility of the Li<sup>+</sup> ion intercalation process and the stability of the obtained
single-ion block polyelectrolyte. Very interestingly, no loss and
even no gradual decrease of specific capacity during initial cycling
were observed, which also accounts for the purity of the sample, its
stability toward oxidation/reduction, compatibility with both electrode
materials, and the formation of a stable passivation layer at the
electrode/electrolyte interface. The remarkable electrochemical performance
in terms of high capacity output and capacity retention after more
than 50 consecutive charge/discharge cycles at a C/20 rate is likely
ascribed to the efficient ion conduction in the polymer electrolyte
separator and the favorable charge transport at the electrode/electrolyte
interface in the cell. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>b shows highly reversible and stable constant current potential

flat profiles with a sharp voltage drop at the end of the redox reaction

that polarization behavior during ion insertion/diffusion at the cathode/SICP

of 0.4 V, which is not negligible. The main cause of the voltage drop
(overpotential) was assigned to the relatively low ionic conductivity
and the intrinsic high bulk resistance of the polyelectrolyte. It
is worth noticing here that the thickness of the electrolyte used
in this proof-of-concept cell (&#x0223c;100 &#x003bc;m) might have negatively
affected the ion diffusion between the cathode and anode throughout

profiles at C/20 and C/10 rates (d) of the Li/copoly8/NMC cell.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ma1c00981_0009" id="gr8" position="float"/></fig><p>We can assume that increasing the conductive carbon
loading in
the electrode may mitigate the overpotential issue; however, the optimization
of the electrode formulation was beyond the scope of this work, which
was indeed to show a proof-of-concept. Nonetheless, the voltage drop
decreased while cycling (&#x0003c;0.3 V after 5 cycles), which accounts
for a sort of activation of materials and amelioration of the interface
while cycling due to the enhanced characteristics of the electrolyte.</p><p>With the purpose of confirming the excellent electrochemical stability
at anodic potential values exceeding 4.8 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, copoly8
was further assembled in a lab-scale lithium cell prototype with a
lithium metal negative electrode (anode) and a commercial LiNiMnCoO<sub>2</sub> (NMC) as the active material at the positive electrode in
a Li/copoly8/NMC configuration. The NMC-based cathode at a relatively
high loading of 4.32 mg cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> was again obtained
in the form of a catholyte using copoly8 as the active binder as detailed
in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c00981/suppl_file/ma1c00981_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>. The electrochemical
behavior of the solid-state lab-scale cell was first studied in the
voltage range between 3 and 4.3 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li (70 &#x000b0;C,
C/20 and C/10 constant current rates, based on the theoretical specific
capacity of the NMC active material). The solid-state NMC-based cell
delivered initial specific charge capacity values of 145 and 124 mAh
g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> after 1 and 6 cycles, respectively, at a C/20
rate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>c). Thus,
no drastic capacity fade during initial cycling was observed, with
a CE improving cycle-by-cycle (exceeding 95% after 5 cycles). Doubling
the current rate to C/10, the specific discharge capacity delivered
by the cell was still close to 50 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with only
a slight overpotential increase compared to the potential vs specific
capacity profile obtained at a lower rate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>d). This behavior was ascribed to the clear
limitations associated with the internal resistance of the cell, as
already observed for the LFP-based cell, mainly affected by the relatively
high intrinsic resistance of the polyelectrolyte and the not engineered
interface between the binder and the active material.</p><p>Again,
we stress here that optimization in this respect was beyond
the scope of this paper. Nonetheless, the proof-of-concept high-voltage
cell demonstrated very good cycling stability, as confirmed by the
almost complete specific capacity recovery while reducing the current
rate to C/20 after 30 cycles and enhanced CE exceeding 97%. Yet, it
is important to remark the performance of this proof-of-concept cell,
being to our knowledge the first example of neat polycarbonate-based
SICP operating in a truly solid-state Li-metal configuration with
a high-energy 4 V-class NMC electrode without any performance enhancers,
additives like plasticizers, and/or surface electrode treatment.</p><p>To support even more the high voltage stability of newly developed
copoly8, a new Li/copoly8/NMC cell was assembled, which was stressed
up to 4.8 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li (70 &#x000b0;C, C/20 rate), while stepwise
increasing the anodic voltage limit from 4.3 to 4.8 V by 0.1 V every
2 reversible constant current charge/discharge cycles. Representative
potential vs specific capacity profiles extracted from the galvanostatic
cycling test are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c00981/suppl_file/ma1c00981_si_001.pdf">Figure S17</ext-link> in
the Supporting Information. A clear charge profile typical of lithium
ion extraction was detected up to 4.8 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, thus
confirming the very high voltage stability and cycling performance
of the newly developed SICP.</p><p>As already demonstrated in a previous
work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> the cross-linking technique allows
the synthesis of SPE
with embedded plasticizer components such as solvents and/or oligomers,
enhancing cycling performance without detrimentally compromising the
thermal stability of the polymer electrolyte and, thus, the safety
of the final device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Following the same
route, but without drastically altering the identity of this work,
an additional Li/copoly8-PC/LFP lab-scale cell was assembled (the
amount of PC was fixed at below 8 wt % with respect to the total mass
of the polyelectrolyte in the cell). The results of the constant-current
cycling test are shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>. It is well evident that the new cell showed an outstandingly
reduced capacity drop compared to the previous LFP-based truly solid-state
cell while doubling the current regime to C/10 and even up to C/5
without any remarkable drop of specific capacity. Moreover, the voltage
profiles remained flat and stable with very limited overpotential
at the C/20 rate, which accounts for a greatly reduced electrode/electrolyte
resistance, as shown in the inset of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>. The overpotential increased while cycling
at C/5, but still, the profile remained flat with no sign of enhanced
sloping of the curve and very limited polarization, thus accounting
for the largely enhanced ion conduction in the polymer electrolyte
separator and the more favorable charge transport between the electrodes
and the electrolyte in the new cell even with a very limited amount
of added plasticizer.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Galvanostatic cycling behavior at C/20, C/10, and C/5

solid-state polyelectrolytes
based on poly(carbonate)-<italic>b</italic>-poly(ionic liquid) with
single Li<sup>+</sup> ion conducting features. The single-ion conducting
polyelectrolytes were purposely modified by designing novel block
copolymers that combine one block responsible for high ionic conductivity
and the second block for improved mechanical properties and outstanding
electrochemical stability. Such ionic block copolymers were obtained
by subsequent ring opening polymerization (ROP) and reversible addition-fragment
chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization techniques. At first, trimethylene
carbonate monomer was polymerized by ROP, using a RAFT-agent having
a hydroxyl terminal group, and in the second step, the prepared poly(carbonate)-based
macro-RAFT precursor was used for random RAFT (co)polymerization of
lithium 1-[3-(methacryloyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
(LiM) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate. Materials
were thoroughly characterized from the physicochemical viewpoint with
a complete bunch of techniques.</p><p>The new generation of SICPs,
namely, poly[TMC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>-<italic>b</italic>-(LiM<italic><sub>m</sub></italic>-<italic>r</italic>-PEGM<italic><sub>k</sub></italic>)] block copolymers,
differs from the previously reported single-ion conducting block copolymer
electrolytes reported by our group by the presence of poly(TMC) block.
Remarkably, while maintaining sufficient ionic conductivity and high
lithium-ion transference number (0.91), the poly(TMC) block imparted
outstanding electrochemical stability up to &#x0223c;5 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li at 70 &#x000b0;C and significantly enhanced the viscoelastic
properties of poly[TMC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>-<italic>b</italic>-(LiM<italic><sub>m</sub></italic>-<italic>r</italic>-PEGM<italic><sub>k</sub></italic>)] block copolymers. The novel block copolymers
demonstrated ionic conductivities up to 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> and 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at
25 and 70 &#x000b0;C, respectively. Such a reasonably high level of ionic
conductivity for an SICP was explained by several factors, including
(i) the presence of oxyethylene fragments, which significantly improve
the solubility of ionic species and facilitate their dissociation,
(ii) the two low <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> enabling motion of
polymer chains, and (iii) the nanophase separation of the cast films
responsible for mechanical integrity and effective prevention of dendrite
growth.</p><p>The proof-of-concept lab-scale truly solid-state Li-metal
cells
assembled with such novel ionic block copolymers using both standard
LFP and high voltage NMC-based composite electrodes at relatively
high active material loading provided excellent performances in terms
of high specific capacity output, stability, and reversible cycling
even up to 4.8 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li. This is one of the most relevant
results so far among the literature reports on truly solid-state single-ion
conducting systems, which postulates the implementation of this family
of polyelectrolytes in next-generation advanced, all-solid Li-metal
batteries, conceived for high energy and/or power applications at
enhanced safety.</p><p>Further improvements should include the enhancement
of polyelectrolyte
neat ionic conductivity and the engineering of effective electrode/electrolyte
interfaces, along with the realization of self-standing films for
ease of designing, processing, and device scale-up. However, the comprehensive
study carried out in this work on the novel materials and innovative
approach, including the nonconventional use of the hydroxyl-terminated
RAFT agent, opens up new promising paths on the dynamics of dual ROP-RAFT
polymerization and will largely support the scientific community on
the development of safe, electrochemically stable polycarbonate-based
solid-state electrolytes allowing advanced Li-metal based battery
technologies to intrude the HEV/EV market in the next decade.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting

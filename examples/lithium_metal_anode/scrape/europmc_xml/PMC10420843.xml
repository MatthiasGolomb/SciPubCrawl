However, the problems associated with this technology are numerous.

Keeping in mind the necessity for greener materials in future energy storage solutions, in this work an innovative lithium protective membrane is prepared based on chitosan, a polysaccharide obtained from the deacetylation reaction of chitin.

Introduction</title><p>The growing need for clean energy production and storage due to global warming has prompted research into cleaner and more efficient energy storage solutions. While Li-ion secondary batteries have literally revolutionized our lives since their first commercialization in 1991, they are now reaching their theoretical energy density and therefore won&#x02019;t represent a viable solution for the much-needed energy transition. A possible groundbreaking answer could arrive from the next generation of metal-oxygen batteries (MOBs), directly using atmospheric oxygen as active material [<xref rid="B1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among those, one of the most promising technologies currently under study is the lithium&#x02013;oxygen battery (LOB), thanks to its high energy density, theoretically around 3500 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> based on the formation of lithium peroxide [<xref rid="B3-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This high energy density can be explained by the low metallic lithium density and low standard reduction potential (E&#x000b0; = &#x02212;3.04 V) [<xref rid="B5-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite such impressive but theoretical energy storage abilities, LOBs are still far from practical applications because of their severe side reactions, which provoke high overpotential and thus limit their cycling life [<xref rid="B6-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In particular, looking at the anode side, the low cycling stability can be attributed to the intrinsic instability of lithium metal, causing dendrite nucleation and growth upon cycling, which tend to form dead lithium, continuously consume solvent to form a fresh passivation layer, and can eventually result in short circuits [<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, it is worth noting that, compared to other Li-metal batteries, the issues associated with metallic lithium in LOBs are actually worsened by the presence of reactive oxygen species, leading to severe corrosion phenomena [<xref rid="B3-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a matter of fact, the intrinsic corrosion induced by O<sub>2</sub> as well as discharge intermediates, especially the superoxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and the peroxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup> radical anions in the electrolyte, leads to LOB&#x02019;s inferior reversibility [<xref rid="B10-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These elements indicate that an efficient anode protection strategy, helping to mitigate these issues, could represent a solution to reaching LOBs higher performances [<xref rid="B12-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To this end, different roads have been followed, such as lithium pretreatment [<xref rid="B10-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], electrolyte additives to generate in situ a stabler solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) [<xref rid="B7-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], inorganic protective layers [<xref rid="B13-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], polymer layers [<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or composite layers [<xref rid="B3-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, no definitive solution has been encountered yet, as each envisioned road has its drawbacks. For example, inorganic conductive layers are usually too fragile and expensive for practical uses, and electrolyte additives cannot control the physical strength of the artificial SEI and therefore cannot efficiently prevent dendrite formation at high current densities and capacities [<xref rid="B15-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Regarding polymer or composite protective layers, most solutions reported in the literature use fluoropolymer-based membranes, such as Nafion [<xref rid="B14-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) [<xref rid="B6-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However more and more research in the battery field is looking towards the substitution of fluorinated compounds by greener solutions. Therefore, keeping in mind the objective of developing a future technology, attention should be focused not only on system performance but also on material sustainability [<xref rid="B16-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Within the battery research area, different works have been carried out to replace existing materials with bio-renewable ones, such as binders obtained from polysaccharides [<xref rid="B17-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], vegetable oils [<xref rid="B18-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], or carbons obtained from green waste [<xref rid="B20-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, few of these papers concern materials for LOBs.</p><p>Herein, we focused on the second most abundant polymer in nature, after cellulose, which is chitin [<xref rid="B21-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. More precisely, chitosan, derived from the deacetylation of chitin, has been commercially manufactured from shrimp and crab shells for years and has a wide field of applications [<xref rid="B22-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition to being a green and biorenewable polymer, medical and pharmaceutical studies have demonstrated its interesting antioxidant properties, in particular its high superoxide radical scavenging activity [<xref rid="B22-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B26-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As a matter of fact, chitosan presents one amino group and two hydroxyl groups in each of its monosaccharide construction units. While the hydroxyl can react with free radicals in a typical H-abstraction reaction [<xref rid="B29-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the amino groups can react with free radicals to form additional stable macroradicals, according to the free radical theory. Therefore, the active amino and hydroxyl groups in the polysaccharide are at the origin of the scavenging ability of chitosan [<xref rid="B30-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This peculiarity is here exploited for the first time in LOBs, where the O<sub>2</sub> excess condition generally provokes the formation of excess superoxide radicals, which in turn accelerate electrolyte decomposition, thus clogging the porous electrode and impeding further O<sub>2</sub> access while passivating the lithium surface. In addition, thanks to their high polarity, the same chitosan functional groups should enhance lithium salt dissociation [<xref rid="B31-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], thus improving the Li<sup>+</sup> cation mobility and reducing the concentration polarization, which is one of the reported causes of dendrite nucleation [<xref rid="B33-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, in this work, chitosan molecules were methacrylated in water through a simple one-step reaction and then cross-linked by UV-induced radical polymerization. The obtained membranes were successively activated in a liquid electrolyte (LiTFSI 0.5 M in DMSO) and used as an innovative lithium protection layer. The cells prepared with protected lithium were able to perform more than 40 cycles at 0.1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, at a fixed capacity of 0.5 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, under a constant O<sub>2</sub> flow of 4 mL min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, at room temperature, retaining 100% coulombic efficiency. This is actually more than twice the lifespan of a similar cell containing bare metallic lithium, which failed in the same testing conditions after 19 cycles. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-15-03182"><title>2.

Physico-Chemical Characterizations</title><p>The methacrylation reaction of medium- and low-molecular-weight chitosan, illustrated in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-sch001" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>, was performed following previous works reported in the literature [<xref rid="B36-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to verify the occurrence of the methacrylation reaction. The corresponding spectra are reported in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a,b. In both cases, the peak at 1620 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, corresponding to C=C stretching, confirms the successful methacrylation reaction of chitosan. More precisely, on the chitosan molecule, this reaction can happen both on the hydroxyl and the amine groups. This is indeed verified, for both samples, by the presence of ester bonds (peak at 1710 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and CO-NH bonds (peak at 3091 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) [<xref rid="B38-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Once it was confirmed that chitosan was successfully methacrylated, it was possible to obtain chitosan membranes through photo-initiated radical polymerization. To this end, as a first step, photo-rheology was performed to assess the curing time as well as the storage modulus of the polymers obtained from medium- and low-molecular-weight methacrylated chitosan solubilized in water. To do so, 2 wt % of chitosan was dispersed in an aqueous solution of acetic acid (2%) before adding the photoinitiator (2 wt% with respect to chitosan). The measurement was performed, monitoring the storage modulus evolution during irradiation time. Indeed, for both samples, a very sharp initial G&#x02019; increase can be observed from the UV irradiation (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c), showing the fast kinetics of the UV-Curing reaction [<xref rid="B40-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In both cases, a plateau was reached after approximately 350 s, but the storage modulus reached by the medium molecular weight sample (CHMA M<sub>MW</sub>) was more than 4 times higher than the one reached by the low molecular weight sample (CHMA L<sub>MW</sub>), with 4.7 kPa and 0.93 kPa, respectively, indicating a probably higher crosslinking density than the first one.</p><p>After assessing the very high reactivity of the methacrylated chitosan under UV irradiation, similar precursor solutions were cast into circular silicon molds and exposed to UV lights for 7 min. The obtained membranes are transparent, self-standing, and flexible, as can be seen in <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>, and their average thickness is 200 &#x000b5;m. Thermal resistance was studied through thermogravimetric analysis; the results are reported in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d. Both samples have quite similar behavior, with one main weight loss between 200 and 500 &#x000b0;C caused by the breaking of chitosan chains and the formation of volatile compounds [<xref rid="B41-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The degradation temperature is slightly higher for UV-Cured samples obtained from medium molecular weight chitosan compared to the samples obtained from low molecular weight chitosan. Interestingly, no noticeable weight loss occurs between 25 and 200 &#x000b0;C, thus confirming the absence of adsorbed water in the samples and therefore the efficiency of the drying process. This is indeed a critical parameter, as chitosan is quite hydrophilic and metallic lithium reacts strongly with water.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-15-03182"><title>3.2. Electrochemical Characterizations </title><p>For these samples to be used as metallic lithium protection, in addition to being free of water traces, they must also allow for efficient and uniform Li ion conduction. To this end, the obtained membranes were immersed in a commercial liquid electrolyte (0.5 M LiTFSI in DMSO), and the liquid electrolyte uptake (LEU) was assessed as a function of the immersion time. The obtained results are reported in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a. Both samples present a quick uptake in the first 200 min of the test, illustrating the good compatibility between the polymer matrix and the selected liquid electrolyte. The swelling process is quicker and more efficient, reaching 300% of LEU for the membrane obtained from low molecular weight chitosan and 250% for the one obtained from medium molecular weight chitosan. This is in good agreement with the results obtained from the photo-rheology test, where the medium-molecular-weight methacrylated chitosan showed a higher modulus upon irradiation, probably attributable to a higher crosslinking density. As a matter of fact, the lower crosslinking density of the low molecular weight chitosan implies a major freedom of the polymer chains that can easily create free space to accommodate higher amounts of liquid electrolyte.</p><p>To further verify the interfacial stability between metallic lithium and the activated membranes, symmetric cells were assembled by sandwiching them between two Li foils. Such cells were left at OCV and room temperature, and their impedances were checked regularly through EIS for 2 months. The obtained results are reported in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c,d and the corresponding equivalent circuit diagram is in <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>. For both cells, the impedance spectra show a combination of two resistive processes, observable as two semi-circles with different diameters. The diameter of the semi-circle at higher frequencies represents the SEI resistance (R<sub>SEI</sub>), while the diameter of the semi-circle at lower frequencies represents the charge transfer resistance (R<sub>CT</sub>) [<xref rid="B42-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The total interfacial resistance, which is the sum of R<sub>SEI</sub> and R<sub>CT</sub> [<xref rid="B32-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], initially increases for both cells, indicating the growth of the SEI layer on both lithium interfaces, before interfacial stabilization is reached, both for medium and low molecular weight chitosan membranes [<xref rid="B43-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Interestingly, though, the EIS profiles are quite different between the two cells, and while the R<sub>SEI</sub> values are quite similar, around 150 &#x02126;, the R<sub>CT</sub> value is much higher for CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> compared to CHMA L<sub>MW</sub>, indicating a more difficult charge transfer reaction in the second case. One explanation can be linked to the mechanical properties of the two membranes; indeed, as demonstrated by the photo-rheology test (see <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c), the membrane obtained from the UV curing of low molecular weight chitosan is softer than the other one, thus allowing for a much better contact with the surface of lithium and, therefore, a decreased interfacial resistance, resulting in a minor R<sub>CT</sub>.</p><p>In addition to good interfacial stability at OCV, it is important to assess the membrane&#x02019;s resistance to oxidative degradation at higher potential. To this end, LSV was performed between 2.5 and 5 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. As can be seen in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b, the DMSO-based liquid electrolyte starts oxidizing at a relatively low potential (around 3.25 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) when it is supported by a commercial glass fiber separator (GF + LE), even if this phenomenon is quite limited as the corresponding residual current is very small [<xref rid="B44-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, the entrapment of the same liquid electrolyte in the polymer matrix seems to slow down the process and protect it from oxidation up to potentials higher than 4.5 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, probably thanks to the strong interaction between the polymer matrix and the absorbed electrolyte [<xref rid="B32-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Once the stability of the protective membranes was assessed, both at OCV and at higher potentials, and thanks to their excellent swelling abilities, it was possible to assess their ionic conductivities through EIS, performed on symmetric cells (SS|Membrane|SS), at different temperatures. The results obtained with CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> and CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> were compared to a symmetric cell assembled with a commercial glass fiber separator impregnated with the same liquid electrolyte (0.5 M LiTFSI in DMSO). As can be seen in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a, while the membrane conductivities are below those of GF + LE, the order of magnitude is still the same and, in both cases, superior to 1 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at room temperature, with 1.9 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the medium molecular weight sample and 2.2 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the low molecular weight one. Such a small difference could be explained once more by the higher crosslinking density of the medium molecular weight sample, which restricted the segmental motion of the polymer chains and therefore the Li ion motion.</p><p>While the previous measurement assessed the global ionic conductivity, including both anions and cations movements, the lithium transference number allows us to specifically understand the fraction of electric current transported by the cation Li<sup>+</sup>. This parameter is fundamental for an efficient metallic lithium protection layer; indeed, the closer <italic toggle="yes">t<sub>Li+</sub></italic> is to a unitary value, the lower the concentration gradient across the layer will be, thus reducing the anion accumulation at the interface with the electrodes [<xref rid="B45-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Such charge accumulation near the lithium surface has been widely demonstrated in the literature to be one of the primary causes of dendrite nucleation and growth [<xref rid="B33-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Such impressive results can be explained by the large presence, on the chitosan molecules, of highly polar hydroxyl and amine groups, which enhance lithium salt dissociation [<xref rid="B31-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as well as by the strong ability of C=O groups from the methacrylic functionalities to withdraw electrons and restrict the mobility of the anion [<xref rid="B43-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B46-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Lithium-ion transport kinetics upon the protective membranes, as well as the interfacial stability upon cycling, were further investigated by galvanostatic Li plating and stripping on symmetric Li|membrane|Li cells at a current density of 0.1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> with a limited capacity of 0.1 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. The obtained results were compared to those of a symmetric cell containing a glass fiber separator soaked with the same liquid electrolyte. As can be seen in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a&#x02013;c, the obtained profiles differ quite a lot between the chitosan-based membranes and the glass fiber cells (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c). Looking in particular at the &#x0201c;End of Charge&#x0201d; potential (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d), it is possible to see that this last one presents, initially, an important overvoltage that is then able to stabilize after more than 200h. On the contrary, the overvoltage of the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> and CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> is quite small right from the beginning thanks to the uniform Li ion transport through the GPEs as well as the enhanced interfacial stability towards lithium metal [<xref rid="B42-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. After 300 cycles, the stability of the CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> membrane is inferior compared to the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> one. This is probably linked to the higher crosslinking density of the first one, resulting in poorer interfacial contact and, upon cycling, the formation of a less stable and more resistive interface. This is further corroborated by the results of the interfacial stability characterization (see <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c,d), where it was seen that CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> had a far higher R<sub>ct</sub> compared to CHMA L<sub>MW</sub>.</p><p>Focusing on the potential profiles between 500 and 550 h (insets in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a&#x02013;c), while the profiles for the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> protected Li have a perfectly regular and reproducible shape, with a symmetric overpotential between &#x02212;0.025 and +0.025 V, confirming the formation of a stable interface with lithium, the profiles for the CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> protected Li are less symmetrical, with a pointier shape in the negative potentials. This is in line with the higher R<sub>ct</sub> value between this membrane and lithium, making the plating and stripping of Li more difficult across the interface [<xref rid="B47-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interestingly, such a phenomenon seems to be worse for one interface relative to the other, explaining the non-symmetrical profile. Last but not least, the profiles of the bare Li cell are much less regular, with a fluctuating over-voltage and, for the last cycles reported, a noisy behavior. This confirms the formation of a less stable interface and a more resistive SEI with the probable presence of dead Li, hindering the Li plating and stripping processes [<xref rid="B49-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-polymers-15-03182"><title>3.3. Lithium-Oxygen Cells Performance</title><p>Galvanostatic discharge tests were performed, from OCV down to 2.0 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, at a current density of 0.1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, to assess the full discharge capacity of a cell containing bare lithium as an anode and two cells containing protected lithium (namely with CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> and CHMA M<sub>MW</sub>). The cells were assembled with a commercial gas diffusion layer as a cathode, a glass fiber separator impregnated with liquid electrolyte (0.5 M LiTFSI in DMSO), and either bare Li metal or protected Li metal as an anode. The cells were kept under a constant O<sub>2</sub> flow of 4 mL min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The results reported on <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a show that both cells with protected lithium were able to discharge for a longer time compared to the cell with bare lithium, reaching areal capacities of 8 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for the CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> protected Li and 12.5 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> protected Li, which is more than twice the areal capacity achieved by bare Li with 5.8 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Previous works demonstrated that degradation products generated by DMSO decomposition, caused by prolonged contact with Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in particular in long discharge conditions, could be found both on the anode (in the SEI layer) and on the cathode surfaces [<xref rid="B50-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This usually results in an abrupt potential drop, ending the discharge process. Here it is possible to observe how the studied protecting membranes are indeed able to efficiently slow down such phenomena. While the characterization of the Li metal anode is quite difficult due to its high reactivity, the characterization of the cathode surface is quite easier. Therefore, to verify our previous assessment, the three cells were disassembled in a glovebox after a full discharge, and their surface composition and morphology were studied by XRD and FESEM, respectively. As can be seen from the FESEM micrographs reported in <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b&#x02013;d, the morphologies of the three cathode surfaces are quite different. While for the bare Li cell large crystals are clearly visible (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b), for the two Li protected cells the discharge products assume a more &#x0201c;film-like&#x0201d; morphology (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c,d), with an absence of large crystalline structures, particularly in the case of the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> cell (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c). The XRD spectra of the three cathodes (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>e) show similar peaks, corresponding to Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the typical discharge product of Li-O<sub>2</sub> cells, and LiOH, confirming our previous hypothesis regarding DMSO decomposition. The real difference between the three spectra regards the peaks shapes; while the peaks of the bare Li cell cathode are quite narrow, the ones of the two protected Li cells are wider, which could actually confirm the presence of much smaller crystals with a reduced degree of crystallinity [<xref rid="B53-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], confirming what can be observed through FESEM. Interestingly, for the CHMA M<sub>MW</sub>-protected Li cell, the discharge products layer on the cathode surface seems much thicker (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>d), while at the same time the discharge plateau is slightly lower than for the other two cells (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a), denoting a higher cell polarization. This could be explained both by the higher R<sub>ct</sub> previously assessed and by the higher cathode passivation and clogging observed through FESEM. For these reasons, CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> was not further characterized, and attention was focused exclusively on the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> protective layer.</p><p>In order to assess the reversibility of such discharge products, the bare Li and the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> protected Li cells were submitted to a full recharge process, meaning that after the previously described discharge, the cells were recharged at 0.1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> up to 4.5 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li. The corresponding voltage profiles are reported in <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S3b</xref>. After the potential cutoff was reached, the cells were disassembled in a glovebox, and the cathode surface morphologies were checked again by FESEM (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S3c,d</xref>). Comparing the recharged cathode morphologies to the surface of a pristine GDL (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S3a</xref>), it is possible to observe that the cathode from the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> cell recovers its initial appearance, showing no residual discharge products, while the cathode from the bare Li cell is covered by residual degradation products, thus confirming the higher reversibility of the cell containing a protected anode. Indeed, it was previously reported in the literature that the &#x0201c;film-like&#x0201d; discharge product morphology has the advantage of a higher contact area between the surface of the cathode and the discharge products, enhancing the transfer of electrons and therefore the reversibility of such products [<xref rid="B54-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>In order to verify such assessment over long cycling conditions, a bare lithium cell and a CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> protected lithium cell were assembled as reported before and cycled at 0.1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, at a limited capacity of 0.5 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> between 2.2 and 4.4 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, under a constant oxygen flow of 4 mL min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Observing the charge/discharge capacities in function of the cycle number, it is possible to see that the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub>-protected lithium cell is able to perform more than 40 cycles with a 100% coulombic efficiency (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>b), while the bare Li cell fails after 19 cycles and presents a much more fluctuating coulombic efficiency (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a).</p><p>The cycling profiles of the two cells are reported in <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>. While the profiles of the cell containing unprotected Li seem to present two recharge plateaus, one at 3.35 V and one around 4.0 V (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S4a</xref>), from the first cycle, these are not clearly visible for the cell with protected Li, where the overvoltage is overall smaller (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="app">Figure S4b</xref>). The two plateaus could actually be attributable to Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduction and parasitic product reduction, in particular Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> [<xref rid="B59-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], respectively. To better understand this overvoltage and its influence on cycling performances, <xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>c reports the end of charge voltage in function of the cycle number, allowing one to understand if the recharge step ended because of the time limit, therefore reaching the fixed capacity value, or because of the potential limit, thus ending the recharge because of the cell polarization before reaching the fixed capacity. For the bare Li cell, it is interesting to note that for cycles 1, 3, 4, and 5, the potential cut-off is reached before the fixed capacity is completed, indicating a non-negligible cell polarization right from the beginning, as already observed in the lithium plating and striping test (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c,d). This is confirmed by Coulombic efficiency values inferior to 100% for the corresponding cycles (<xref rid="polymers-15-03182-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a). Successively, the cell polarization decreases, probably thanks to the formation of a stabler interface with lithium, and the fixed capacity is attained while the end of charge potential (EoCP) remains smaller. Finally, after cycle 18, the cut-off voltage is reached again, and the cell fails after cycle 19th. For the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub>-protected Li cell, the EoCP of the first cycle is quite small, then it increases for the following 5 cycles before reaching a stable value of around 4.25 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li maintained up to cycle 39, demonstrating the stability of the interface between the protective membrane and the lithium. On cycle 40, the EoCP rises to 4.35 V, and on cycle 41, the cut-off potential is reached before the fixed capacity. Another difference between the two cells behavior is that, regarding the bare Li cell, the increased polarization in recharge corresponds to a failing in discharge from cycle 18th, which might be explained by the cathode pores clogging due to the accumulation of irreversible parasitic products and blocking the O<sub>2</sub> flow. This phenomenon is not verified in the protected lithium cell, where the fixed capacity is always reached in discharge, even for cycles 40 and 41, indicating that, even with a lower coulombic efficiency, this cell could still cycle. In other words, the cathode failing is probably the reason for the impaired discharge process in the bare lithium cell, suggesting, as already observed in other studies, that efficient anode protection has a great impact on the cathode reactions as well [<xref rid="B3-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>A plausible hypothesis to explain the beneficial role of chitosan-based membranes on lithium metal protection in Li-O<sub>2</sub> cells could be found in medical and pharmaceutical research. Indeed, different groups [<xref rid="B60-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] studied the antioxidant properties of chitosan and its free radical scavenging ability. Interestingly, R. Xing et al. [<xref rid="B61-polymers-15-03182" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] investigated the correlation between chitosan molecular weight and its superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, demonstrating that low molecular weight had stronger scavenging effects. Therefore, one proposed explanation could be that the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> membrane is able to scavenge the excess superoxide radicals formed during the discharge process, thus slowing down the associated degradation mechanisms such as electrolyte and cathodic carbon degradation. As a matter of fact, the bare Li cell presents the Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> recharge plateau from the first cycle, probably because of carbon/electrolyte degradation from the first cycle on. Such a second plateau remains much less obvious in the protected Li cell, thus corroborating our hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-polymers-15-03182"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this work, a natural polymer, chitosan, was selected as a building block for a new lithium metal protection membrane designed for the highly oxidative conditions linked to the lithium-oxygen battery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that chitosan&#x02019;s antioxidant properties have been exploited to protect lithium metal in lithium-oxygen batteries. In particular, a low-molecular-weight and a medium-molecular-weight chitosan were methacrylated in a one-step reaction in water. Successively, the methacrylated chitosans were cross-linked via a fast, cheap, and green photopolymerization process, obtaining CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> and CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> membranes. Photo-rheological characterization indicated that the CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> membrane reached a higher storage modulus, probably explained by a higher cross-linking density. Both membranes possess high ionic conductivities and Li transference numbers at room temperature. However, the effects of the different mechanical properties were seen on the interfacial stability test, where the R<sub>ct</sub> of CHMA M<sub>MW</sub> in a symmetric Li|Li cell was higher than the one of CHMA L<sub>MW</sub>, probably due to poorer interfacial contact with metallic lithium. This also resulted in poorer lithium plating and stripping stability, with a much higher polarization after 300h as well as a lower full discharge capacity in full cell configuration. Focusing therefore on the CHMA L<sub>MW</sub> protective layer, its ability to slow down different degradation phenomena was verified, first by cathode post-mortem analysis, after full discharge and full recharge testing, allowing to assess the formation of more reversible discharge products. Secondly, it was verified in long cycling conditions where the lithium-protected cell demonstrated twice the lifespan of the bare Li one. Therefore, chitosan antioxidant properties, summed up with enhanced Li salt dissociation and thus better Li ion transport kinetics, effectively allow for interface stabilization with the anode as well as reduced degradation processes and therefore longer cycling life.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

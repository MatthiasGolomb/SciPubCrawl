In this work, we have shown an effective additive 1-adamantanecarbonitrile, which contributes to the excellent performance of the poly(ethylene oxide)-based electrolytes. Owing to the strong interaction of the 1-Adamantanecarbonitrile to the polymer matrix and anions, the coordination of the Li<sup>+</sup>-EO is weakened, and the binding effect of anions is strengthened, thereby improving the Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity and the electrochemical stability. The diamond building block on the surface of the lithium anode can suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. Importantly, the 1-Adamantanecarbonitrile also regulates the formation of LiF in the solid electrolyte interface and cathode electrolyte interface, which contributes to the interfacial stability (especially at high voltages) and protects the electrodes, enabling all-solid-state batteries to cycle at high voltages for long periods of time. Therefore, the Li/Li symmetric cell undergoes long-term lithium plating/stripping for more than 2000&#x000a0;h. 1-Adamantanecarbonitrile-poly(ethylene oxide)-based LFP/Li and 4.3&#x000a0;V Ni<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Li all-solid-state batteries achieved stable cycles for 1000 times, with capacity retention rates reaching 85% and 80%, respectively.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="40820_2024_1415_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/></p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40820-024-01415-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>1-Adamantanecarbonitrile (ADCN)</kwd><kwd>Poly (ethylene oxide)</kwd><kwd>All-solid-state batteries</kwd><kwd>Interfacial stability</kwd><kwd>High voltage</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">All-solid-state lithium polymer batteries combined with solid electrolytes to replace the liquid electrolytes and separators of traditional lithium-ion batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] are regarded as the potential candidates for the next-generation energy storage applications due to their attractive advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These virtues include but not limited to (1) highly thermal stability, composed of an intrinsically safe solid polymer electrolyte that is non-leakable, toxic and flammable, (2) excellent flexibility and processability, (3) relative suitability for lithium metal anodes with mechanical compatibility and improving the energy density, and (4) separated by SPEs, crosstalk behaviors can be effectively suppressed, prolonging the cycling-life. Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), as the core part of the battery, largely determines the performance of the battery. PEO-based SPEs have industrial dominance and excellent processing applicability, and have been widely commercialized in the fields of electric vehicle batteries and large-scale energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One of the main shortcomings is the limited conductivity of Li<sup>+</sup> (10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> S&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at room temperature), have been partially overcome and improved to 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> S&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at near-room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], tamed by a second phase adding (liquid, ceramic, and polymer composite), salt engineering or additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Although the PEO-based electrolyte is relatively suitable for lithium metal anodes, lithium dendrite growth and side reactions will still occur at the electrolyte/lithium metal anode interface after long-term cycling, leading to interface degradation and performance deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To suppress this degeneration, various SPE-enhancing strategies have been applied, such as cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], fluorination of polymer matrix, and addition of oxides, inert or conductive ceramics, salts, MOFs, nanodiamonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] into the electrolyte membranes. Impressively, by introducing high-modulus and inactive nanodiamonds into the electrolyte membranes, the lifetime of lithium symmetric batteries is effectively increased, and the dendrite growth is significantly suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, these effective strategies may only act on the anode without contributing to the stability of the cathode interface. Furthermore, the addition of the second phase may lead to the heterogeneity of the electrolyte membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Another serious challenge is the unstable nature of the PEO-based electrolytes at high voltage (&#x0003e;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Polymer electrolytes are thought to degenerate under high voltage, producing parasitic reactions. This serious drawback makes them difficult to couple to the high voltage cathodes (&#x0003e;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;V), such as nickel-rich, lithium-rich and spinel. In addition, it is reported that PEO-based SPEs have difficulty passivating the nickel-rich layered cathodes LiNi<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Mn<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>Co<sub><italic>z</italic></sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCM, <italic>x</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.5, <italic>x</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>y</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>z</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), which are regarded as the promising cathodes for high-energy batteries applied in EVs. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to improve the intrinsic and interfacial stability of the SPEs, such as cathode materials-coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], salt-engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], dual-layered design and polymer composition adjustment of the SPEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], enabling the all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) coupled with the NCM cathodes to cycle to 4.2&#x02013;4.4&#x000a0;V. Unfortunately, the lifetime of NCM/Li ASSBs remains elusive due to severe interfacial degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Moreover, most of the approaches focus on one-sided interface, hardly meeting the demand of the long-term cycling for the ASSBs, which require both interfaces of the anode/SPE and cathode/SPE are compatible.</p><p id="Par6">1-adamantanecarbonitrile (ADCN), as an important intermediate for valuable drugs, contains a stable &#x0201c;building blocks&#x0201d;&#x02014;C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>- used to synthesize diamond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and the high voltage-stabilized functional group -CN. It is worth noting that succinonitrile (CN(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CN) is widely used to plasticize PEO-based electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, ADCN is also added to the polymer as a stabilizer to protect the polymer from ultraviolet radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Inspired by the research on nanodiamond additive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we adopted ADCN as an additive to enhance SPE and improve the cycling performance of the ASSBs. 1-Adamantanecarbonitrile dissolves well in SPE, whereas adamantane is difficult to dissolve. The ADCN can also act as plasticizer to improve ion transport in SPEs. The &#x02018;molecular diamond block&#x02019; C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>- enhances the stability of the SPEs, thereby triggering the growth of a stable SEI and inhibiting the lithium dendrite growth of lithium dendrites. In addition, the CN- group-based ADCN will stabilize the cathode/SPE interface, thereby achieving stable cycling of NCM/Li ASSBs. Therefore, the ADCN-enhanced PEO-based electrolyte exhibits an improved ionic conductivity of 1.44&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> mS&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, which is 7 times higher than the baseline SPE. As a result, long-term lithium deposition/stripping over 2000&#x000a0;h can be achieved for Li/Li batteries assembled using ADCN-based SPE. In addition, ASSB was used in conjunction with LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and ADCN-incorporated PEO-based electrolyte to achieve stable cycling at 0.3 C at 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1000 times with a capacity retention of 85%. Impressively, the high voltage 4.3&#x000a0;V NCM/ ADCN-SPE /Li ASSB exhibits excellent cycling capability (1000, 80%). Therefore, our work demonstrates an effective approach to enhance interfacial stability on both anodic and cathodic sides mediated by SPE, thereby enabling long-term stable cycling of high voltage ASSBs using PEO-based electrolytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of the PEO-Based SPEs</title><p id="Par8">Preparation of the PEO-Based SPEs: The membrane were prepared by a classic solvent-casting approach. 1&#x000a0;g PEO (Mw &#x02248; 600,000) and 0.466&#x000a0;g LiTFSI were dissolved in&#x02009;~&#x02009;22&#x000a0;mL anhydrous acetonitrile (AN, Aladdin) and strongly stirred at room temperature overnight to generate a homogeneous solution.

The bands around 2900&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> can be assigned to the C&#x02013;H stretching, which is so sensitive to the extent of LiTFSI complexation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. It can be observed that the baseline SPE exhibit doublet peaks, suggesting the existence of salt-based crystalline-like structure. After adding the ADCN, the doublet peaks disappear and immerges into one peak. This phenomenon can be attributed to the strong interaction of the ADCN with the LiTFSI, fostering the association of the salt. Furthermore, the peaks at 720&#x02013;760&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>e) can be divided into free TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion components and aggregated ion pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It is obvious that the aggregated ion-pairs component is enhanced upon addition of ADCN, which highlights the significant interaction of ADCN-TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. Among the four samples, LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2 showed the highest content of aggregated ion pairs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> XRD patents, <bold>b</bold> FTIR spectra (3000&#x02013;2800&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>and 1180&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), <bold>c</bold> Arrhenius plots, <bold>d</bold> DSC profiles of SPE membrane, <bold>e</bold> High-resolution solid-state <sup>6</sup>Li MAS NMR spectra and <bold>f</bold> LSV plots of the of the various SPE membranes (1&#x000a0;mV&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40820_2024_1415_Fig1_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">The Arrhenius plot, shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, reveals the improvement of the ionic conductivity of SPEs by using different amounts of ADCN. The ionic conductivity of SPE is significantly enhanced due to the obvious interaction of ADCN-LITFSI-PEO. The conductivity of the SPE (LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-1) with the addition of only 1 wt% is significantly enhanced compared to that of baseline. In SPEs, the ionic conductivity with the addition of 5 wt% (LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2) ADCN presented the highest 0.144&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> mS&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), which was 7 times higher than the baseline SPE at the same temperature. However, a high content of 10 wt% leads to a decrease in ionic conductivity, which may be due to the inhibition of ion transport by incompletely incorporated particles. Owing to the interaction of ADCN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d), the <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>, and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for the Bi-based SPEs reduce. Among them, LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2 possesses the lowest <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> (ratio of crystalline) (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), revealing the high content of amorphous part. The ADCN may act as the plasticizer, decreasing the crystalline and thus improving the Li<sup>+</sup> ion-transport. Nevertheless, since the uncomplete dissolution of the ADCN with high content, the effect would be weakened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The mechanical strength is another essential metric. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>f, the tensile strength of the baseline is 1.3&#x000a0;MPa. With the addition of ADCN, the strengths have been enhanced. This enhancement may be attributed to the molecular interactions of the ADCN with &#x02013;EO&#x02013; units, which crosslinks the polymer matrix. Among them, the LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/AdCN-2 has the highest mechanical strength, reaching 5.1&#x000a0;MPa. The typical membranes of LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub> and LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2 are also explored by the <sup>6</sup>Li NMR spectra (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). The peaks can be fitted into the two parts, which are the Li<sup>+</sup> coordinated by PEO/TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (red peaks) and the more free Li<sup>+</sup> (blue peaks), respectively. The results present the higher content of the mobile-Li<sup>+</sup> part (blue peak, 70.70%) for the LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2, while the LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub> only contains that of 52.44% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. An obvious peak-up-field-shifting for the LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2 compared to the LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub> demonstrates the decreasing of the interaction between Li<sup>+</sup> and polymer matrix, thus freeing more Li<sup>+</sup> ions in the SPE. These results agree with that of the FTIR. Due to the strong "binding" effect of ADCN-TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, free Li<sup>+</sup> can be released well. Therefore, the typical Li<sup>+</sup> transference number (<italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup>) of LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2 is as high as 0.38 compared with the baseline of 0.25, indicating lower anion migration capability in ADCN-based electrolytes (Fig. S2). Furthermore, since ADCN stabilizes the anion, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f) shows a significant improvement in anode stability from 4.5&#x000a0;V for baseline to 5.0&#x02013;5.5&#x000a0;V for the ADCN-based electrolytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, these excellent advantages of the ADCN-based electrolytes demonstrate their potential application in lithium metal ASSBs. It will be interesting to evaluate the performance of symmetric cells (such as Li/SPE/Li) and asymmetric cells (e.g., ASSB) containing ADCN-based SPEs, which will be presented in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Li Metal/Li Metal Symmetric Cell Performance</title><p id="Par15">To further investigate the anodic compatibility of SPEs with lithium metal anodes, the membranes were sandwiched in symmetric Li/SPE/Li cells and evaluated at 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

This excellent performance may originate from the dendrite suppression ability and compatible interface of ADCN-based electrolytes.

This can be attributed to the higher strength of the membrane and interfacial stability. In fact, the SEM image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, inset) shows that after long-term cycling, the surface of the decomposed lithium anode based on ADCN is smooth and dense without any cracks and dendritic structures, while the cyclic lithium anode based on LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub> showed cavities and mossy structures, indicating poor interfacial compatibility (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, inset).

LiF is mainly originated from the decomposition of the LiTFSI, especially, F is from the -CF<sub>3</sub> of the LiTFSI.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Dissociated energy of LiTFSI before and after adding ADCN</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40820_2024_1415_Fig6_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig><fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Proposed decomposing processes of the LiTFSI and LiTFSI&#x02009;+&#x02009;ADCN systems</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40820_2024_1415_Fig7_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par22">The formation of LiF in our system comes from Li<sup>+</sup> and F<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, which are decomposed by the LiTFSI, and the F<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mainly originates from the -CF<sub>3</sub> group. In order to explore the possible impact of the ADCN additive on the formation of LiF in lithium salts, SEI and CEI, the energy required for a LiTFSI molecule to gradually detach one Li<sup>+</sup> ion, one F<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ion and then &#x02013;CF<sub>2</sub> group before and after adding ADCN was calculated.</p><p id="Par23">The calculation results show that after adding ADCN, when ADCN and LiTFSI molecules are closed to each other but not yet connected, the energy required for a LiTFSI molecule to detach from a Li<sup>+</sup> ion is reduced from 3.99 to 3.89&#x000a0;eV, and the energy required to detach an F<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ion is decreased from 9.33 to 8.83&#x000a0;eV. This shows that ADCN promotes the decomposition of Li<sup>+</sup> and F<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions in LiTFSI, which is beneficial to the formation of LiF in SEI and CEI (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">In particular, we also found that when the &#x02013;CN end of ADCN is connected to LiTFSI, if an F<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ion first detaches from LiTFSI, the energy required to further detach a CF<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> from LiTFSI is reduced by 2.63&#x000a0;eV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It is shown that the presence of ADCN contributes to the further decomposition of -CF<sub>3</sub> in LiTFSI, so more F<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions can combine with free Li<sup>+</sup> ions to form LiF. And the generated LiF-rich CEI and SEI can significantly protect the lithium anode and cathode, respectively, enabling long-term longevity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par25">In summary, we have demonstrated an effective additive, ADCN, which contributes to the excellent performance of the PEO-based electrolytes. Due to the strong mediation of the ADCN to the polymer matrix and anions, the coordination of the Li<sup>+</sup>-EO is weakened, and the bondage of anion is enhanced, which helps to improve Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity and electrochemical stability. More importantly, the ADCN can promote the formation of LiF in the SEI and CEI, and the Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> in CEI, which is beneficial to the interfacial stability and enables long-term cycling of LFP/Li and high voltage NCM811/Li. Therefore, the Li/Li symmetric cell can with stand long-term lithium plating/stripping for more than 2000&#x000a0;h. The 1000-long-term-cycle of LFP/ LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2/Li and 4.3&#x000a0;V NMC811/ LiTFSI/P(EO)<sub>14</sub>/ADCN-2/Li ASSBs can be achieved, with an impressive capacity retention of 85% and 80%, respectively. Compared to the former solutions of one-sided interface, hardly meets the demand of the long-term cycling for the ASSBs. Our work addressed on both interfaces of the anode/SPE and cathode/SPE, making them compatible.</p><p id="Par26">Therefore, our work provides a potential avenue for designing high-performance ASSBs with long span life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40820_2024_1415_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 1139 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 22209012).</p></ack><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par31">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A polymer electrolyte with a thermally induced interfacial ion-blocking function enables safety-enhanced lithium metal batteries</article-title><source>eScience</source><year>2022</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>201</fpage><lpage>208</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.esci.2022.03.001</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Enhanced electrochemical performance of poly(ethylene oxide) composite polymer electrolyte via incorporating lithiated covalent organic framework</article-title><source>Trans.

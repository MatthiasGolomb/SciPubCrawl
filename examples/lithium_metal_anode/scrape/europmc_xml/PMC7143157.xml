The mixed electrolyte is based on the ionic liquid (IL) (EMI/TFSI/LiTFSI) and organic solvents EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>). The effect of electrolyte type on the electrochemical performance of a LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode and a SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite anode in lithium anode (or cathode) half-cells was also investigated. The results demonstrated that the addition of 5 wt.% succinonitrile (SN) resulted in enhanced ionic conductivity of a 60% EMI-TFSI 40% EC/DMC MOILE from ~14 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to ~26 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at room temperature. Additionally, at a temperature of 100 &#x000b0;C, an increase in ionic conductivity from ~38 to ~69 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was observed for the MOILE with 5 wt% SN. The improvement in the ionic conductivity is attributed to the high polarity of SN and its ability to dissolve various types of salts such as LiTFSI. The galvanostatic charge/discharge results showed that the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode with the MOILE (without SN) exhibited a 39% specific capacity loss at the 50th cycle while the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode in the MOILE with 5 wt.% SN showed a decrease in specific capacity of only 14%. The addition of 5 wt.% SN to the MOILE with a SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-fiber anode resulted in improved cycling performance and rate capability of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-membrane anode in lithium anode half-cells. Based on the results reported in this work, a new avenue and promising outcome for the future use of MOILEs with SN in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can be opened.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ionic liquids</kwd><kwd>succinonitrile</kwd><kwd>electrolyte</kwd><kwd>lithium ion batteries</kwd><kwd>composite fibers</kwd><kwd>mixtures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-membranes-10-00045"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in electronic devices ever since their successful commercialization by Sony in 1991 and Asahi Kasei and Toshiba in 1992 [<xref rid="B1-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The conventional electrolyte used in LIBs is based on lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>) salt dissolved in volatile organic solvents; typically, these are mixtures of carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) [<xref rid="B3-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These combinations enhance desired properties in electrolytes. For example, EC has a high dielectric constant that promotes salt dissolution, and the addition of DMC to these organic solvents can lower the melting point and viscosity of the combined EC/DMC organic liquid electrolyte (OLE) [<xref rid="B5-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite the high ionic conductivity and Li-ion diffusivity of OLEs during the charge/discharge cycles in LIBs, they face serious safety concerns due to their high flammability and volatility [<xref rid="B6-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Such safety hazards can lead to thermal runaway and serious consequences [<xref rid="B7-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, incidents involving violent battery ignitions have caught the general public&#x02019;s attention, and this concern has increased even more with the application of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and power grid storage devices [<xref rid="B9-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Because ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are non-flammable, non-volatile, and conductive, they possess safety advantages over OLEs and have been studied as electrolytes in rechargeable LIBs [<xref rid="B10-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ILEs tend to be electrochemically and thermally stable, potentially allowing use of high voltage cathodes and safe operation at high temperatures. Nonetheless, ILEs face many challenges including larger viscosity, which increases significantly with decreasing temperature, crystallization at low temperatures, and large, strongly temperature-dependent interfacial impedance at both the cathode and anode. All of these issues are tied to the fact that the ILE-based Li-ion cells that have been developed to date operate only at elevated temperatures and at relatively low charging/discharging rates [<xref rid="B10-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The high viscosity of ILEs typically results in a decreased total ionic conductivity at room temperature. Most important for electrolyte performance is to maximize the conductivity carried by the Li+ (cation), i.e., the product of total conductivity and transference number [<xref rid="B12-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, it has been observed in both experiments and simulations that Li+ mobility increases more rapidly with dilution with an organic solvent than do the mobilities of the RTIL anion and especially cation, resulting in a higher transference number [<xref rid="B13-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We note the further complication that the ability of a low viscosity solvent to dissolve lithium salt and transport Li<sup>+</sup> does not necessarily imply improved electrolyte performance [<xref rid="B15-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>A novel approach based on mixing organic solvents with ILEs has been used to improve the ionic conductivity of ILEs in Li-ion cells with the aim to offer combined advantages of OLs and ILEs such as decreased viscosity, higher Li+ diffusion/mobility, (i.e., improved conductivity), and, under appropriate volume ratios, better safety factors [<xref rid="B6-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An increased tolerance to higher operational temperatures is beneficial not only because batteries are less likely to experience thermal runaway, but also because it enables specialty applications that require very low (&#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C to &#x02212;40 &#x000b0;C) or high (100 &#x000b0;C) temperatures; electrolyte crystallization can be prevented at lower working temperature conditions by modifying the IL solvent, while battery performance at higher temperature can be achieved by adding different lithium salts to ILs [<xref rid="B17-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several IL/Li salt systems have been employed as electrolytes in Li-ion batteries, but the number of ILEs that have been demonstrated as effective in operating cells is limited. Since demonstrating reasonable conductivity of an ILE (commonly done) and reasonable electrochemical stability (less commonly undertaken) are not sufficient to ensure reliable operation of a battery, a number of other issues such as interfacial defects must be considered. As a result, the number of operating batteries based on ILEs is less extensive than might be expected, given the huge number of anode/cathode and electrolyte combinations possible [<xref rid="B11-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B18-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p><p>The most common anion investigated for ILEs is bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (TFSI), while the most common cations are alkylimidazoliums, tetraalkylammoniums, and alkylpryrrolidiniums (e.g., pyr13 and pyr14) [<xref rid="B11-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (EMI-TFSI) has been used with Li salt as an electrolyte for LIBs due to its low viscosity compared to other ILEs [<xref rid="B21-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, a LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode in a (EMI/TFSI + LiTFSI) electrolyte delivered higher discharge capacity at room temperature than in the EMIBF<sub>4</sub> + LiBF<sub>4</sub> system [<xref rid="B21-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. EMI-TSFI is employed here as an IL due to its good conductivity (8.7&#x02013;9.1 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 25 &#x000b0;C), low viscosity (33&#x02013;34 cP), and low melting point (&#x02212;15 &#x000b0;C) [<xref rid="B17-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, it has been found that EMI-TSFI with LiTSFI can increase the ionic conductivity and decrease the viscosity of the electrolyte, while no flammability was observed for compositions with IL (EMI-TSFI) wt% of 40% or more in EC&#x02013;DEC&#x02013;VC&#x02013;1M LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolytes at increased temperatures [<xref rid="B21-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. </p><p>Reversible capacities of up to 155 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 128 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> have been reported for Li-ion full cells with EMI-TSFI and EC/DMC MOILEs using LiFePO<sub>4</sub> as the cathode with a graphite anode, and a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode with a Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> anode, respectively [<xref rid="B22-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nonetheless, the addition of non-ionic organic additives such as succinonitrile (SN) to the electrolyte can improve the ionic conductivity of ILEs and the overall electrochemical performance of the Li-ion cell [<xref rid="B1-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B23-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. SN can dissolve different types of salts such as LiTFSI, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiN(CN)<sub>2</sub>, Ba(TFSI)<sub>2</sub>, Pb(TSFI)<sub>2</sub>, La(TSFI)<sub>2</sub>, Ag(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>), and Cu(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) [<xref rid="B24-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. SN has been frequently used as a solid electrolyte in LIBs [<xref rid="B24-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but limited results have been reported on the use of SN with OLEs and ILEs in LIBs [<xref rid="B29-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For example, the addition of SN to a polymer electrolyte (PEO-LiTFSI, P(VDFHFP)&#x02013; LiTFSI, and P(VDF-HFP)&#x02013;LiBETI) resulted in improved ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte and favorable mechanical properties [<xref rid="B30-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. SN has been recently used as a functional additive to improve the thermal stability and broaden the oxidation electrochemical window of an OLE in lithium cathode half-cells containing a LNMO cathode. The results showed that the addition of SN to the electrolyte solution lead to a remarkably improved cycling stability, which was due to the formation of an electronically conductive film on the cathode [<xref rid="B29-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. SN was also used as an additive to improve the thermal stability of ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolytes in LIBs. This work showed that SN can suppress parasitic reactions between the positive electrode (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) and the organic liquid electrolyte, because the nitrogen ion in the nitrile functional group (&#x02013;CN) in SN has a lone pair of electrons leading to a strong bond with the transition metal ions on the cathode. It was also reported that the addition of SN resulted in a suppression of electrolyte decomposition in commercial cells [<xref rid="B30-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The authors also suggested that SN can react with transition metal ions in the electrolyte to form metal ion compounds preventing their reduction on the negative electrode surface, which would compromise the SEI surface. This work focuses on the investigation of the electrochemical properties of EMI-TFSI-LiTFSI electrolytes in lithium anode (or cathode) half-cells using either a cathode or an anode [<xref rid="B31-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. OLE (EC/DMC 1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>), ILE (EMI-TFSI), and MOILE were used with a commercial cathode, LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, and a SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-fiber anode in lithium anode half-cells to investigate the effect of electrolyte type on the electrochemical performance. The effects of temperature and SN additive on the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performance of MOILEs were investigated by conducting charge/discharge and impedance measurements on the lithium anode (or cathode) half-cells with commercial cathode materials. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-membranes-10-00045"><title>2.

Electrolyte Preparation</title><p>1-Ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI), was synthesized by reacting HPLC water with a 1:1 LiTFSI:EMI-Br molar ratio mixture. This solution was stirred for 24 h in an oil bath at 70 &#x000b0;C. After the reaction took place, an aqueous layer and an ionic liquid (EMI-TFSI) rich layer were formed, and the solution was extracted from the oil bath. Once the solution was cooled to room temperature, the EMI-TFSI was separated from its aqueous counterpart and decanted into a separator funnel. HPLC water was poured into the separator funnel and mixed with the EMI-TFSI. The mixture was left to rest until the two layers were formed again. The EMI-TFSI layer was once again removed. This process was repeated two more times. Then, the EMI-TFSI was placed in a 500 mL round bottom flask to be dissolved with a sufficient amount of DCM. The dissolved EMI-TSFI was decanted into a chromatography column in order to filter any remaining impurities. The chromatography column contained one inch of sand, followed by silica oxide fully covering the remaining of the column up to the beginning of reservoir. The collected solution was then placed in a rotavap to remove the solvent (DCM) from the EMI-TSFI. Finally, the obtained EMI-TSFI was placed in a vacuum oven at 100 &#x000b0;C for 48 h to remove any water and excess DCM. The purity of the synthesized IL electrolyte was confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy.</p><p>The organic liquid electrolyte was prepared in a glove box (MBRAUN, Garching, Germany) with a controlled argon atmosphere.

The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte was determined using coin cells with two stainless steel blocking electrodes filled with the electrolyte. For accurate measurements of the ionic conductivity, a Teflon spacer was placed between the stainless-steel electrodes to hold the electrolyte inside the cell. The sample (electrolyte) preparation was conducted in an argon-filled glove box. The cell was then taken outside the glove box and inserted in the heating chamber.

Ionic Conductivity Measurement of Electrolytes at Different Temperature</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the ionic conductivity of the ILE and MOILEs as a function of temperature. The ILE was prepared from LiTFSI salt dissolved in 100% EMI-TFSI while the MOILE was prepared by dissolving LiTFSI salt in 60% EMI-TFSI and 40% EC/DMC, with and without the addition of 5% SN. The results show that the ILE (100% EMI-TFSI) delivered an ionic conductivity ~5 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at room temperature, which is lower than that for the MOILE (60% EMI-TFSI and 40% EC/DMC) (~14 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). It is also clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f005">Figure 5</xref> that the ionic conductivity of the three electrolytes increases with increasing temperature. The MOILE with 5% SN shows the highest ionic conductivity at 100 &#x000b0;C (70 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) among these three electrolytes. Despite its lower conductivity at room temperature, the ILE ionic conductivity increased significantly as the temperature was increased. At 150 &#x000b0;C, the ILE conductivity was ~30 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. This behavior is expected since the viscosity of ILEs tends to decrease with increasing temperature. The addition of 40% organic liquid, EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic> ratio), to 1 M LiTFSI in 60% EMI-TFSI resulted in an increased ionic conductivity of ~14 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at room temperature while the MOILE with the addition of 5 wt% SN exhibited the highest room temperature ionic conductivity of ~26 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Note here that the ionic conductivity of the OLE (EC/DMC/LiTFSI) is not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f005">Figure 5</xref> since there are data available in the literature on LiTFSI in binary EC/DMC mixtures. In fact, LiTFSI salt in EC/DMC binary system shows a higher ionic conductivity than that for ILE and MOILE. For example, results reported by Dahbi et al. showed that the LiTFSI in EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic> ratio), which is the same OLE used in the present work, exhibited an ionic conductivity of 8.6 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>1</sup> at 25 &#x000b0;C.

Electrochemical Performance of A LiCoO<sub>2</sub> Electrode in Lithium Cathode Half-Cells</title><p>The commercial LiCoO<sub>2</sub> electrode was employed in lithium cathode half-cells with a single-coated lithium foil to investigate its electrochemical performance. The MOILE with and without 5 wt% SN was used with the commercial LiCoO<sub>2</sub>. The purpose was to evaluate the behavior of the MOILEs in high voltage cathode materials such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, which has a larger voltage range than LiFePO<sub>4</sub>. LiCoO<sub>2</sub> still dominates the portable electronics market due to its high voltage plateau and easy synthesis compared to LiFePO<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid="B38-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments were performed for 50 cycles at different temperatures and at a current density of 100 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,b shows the charge/discharge profiles at 60 &#x000b0;C and at 100 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of the commercial LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode in MOILEs without SN and with 5 wt% SN, respectively. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode in the MOILE without SN maintained a consistent specific capacity of 148 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> up to the 10th cycle. However, significant irreversibilities were observed at the 25th and 50th cycles. After 50 cycles, the cathode delivered a discharge capacity of 91 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, indicating a capacity retention of 61.5% at a current density of 100 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The discharge capacity retention is equal to the capacity after the 50th cycle divided by the capacity at the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle (i.e., 61.5% = (100&#x02013;38.5)%). On the other hand, the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode in the MOILE with SN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f006">Figure 6</xref>b) exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 150 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 100 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and after the 50th cycle, the discharge capacity reached a value of 129 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> indicative of acceptable capacity retention of 86%. The improvement in the electrochemical performance of the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode is attributed to the effect of the SN additive on the ILE, and to the high conductivity of MOILEs at high temperature (60 &#x000b0;C). The high volatility and evaporation (high vapor pressure) of DMC at high temperature might influence the ionic conductivity of electrolytes containing a high percentage of DMC, thus affecting the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The effect of DMC on the ionic conductivity of MOILEs was not investigated since the amount of DMC in MOILEs is only 20% (1 M LITFSI in 1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic> EC/DMC) and this should affect the performance of the electrode only slightly. However, results reported in the literature show that the ionic conductivity of 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in DMC remains significant (i.e., 9 mS&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) at 55 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B39-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

This might be caused by a decrease in active material (lithium) on the current collector after the 25th cycle. Another important factor that could affect this loss in capacity of the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode is that the corrosion of the Al current collector on the cathode side by the TFSI, thereby contributing to the loss of active material from the Al current collector [<xref rid="B41-membranes-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Although the capacity is stable within the first twenty cycles, the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode in the MOILE without SN suffered from a steady loss in specific capacity after 20 cycles. In contrast, the same cathode in the MOILE with 5 wt% SN maintained a stable specific capacity for the first 20 cycles; there was a slight decrease in capacity between 20th and 30th cycles, while thereafter the cathode maintained a constant capacity of ~129 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.

The cycle performance of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite electrode was evaluated by conducing galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments at room temperature and at a current density of 100 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The voltage range for lithium anode half-cells tested with the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-fiber anode was 0.05&#x02013;3 V (versus Li+/Li). The SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-fiber anode with the 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) electrolyte showed an initial discharge capacity of 785 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

It is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f009">Figure 9</xref>a,b that the discharge and charge capacities of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-fiber anode in the MOILE with 5 wt% SN are higher than in the OLE. The improvement in the specific capacity of the composite-membrane anode was attributed to the addition of the high polarity SN to the MOILE and its ability to dissolve the LiTFSI salt, which resulted in enhanced ionic conductivity and improved cycling stability of the electrode in the MOILE. The SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-membrane anode in MOILE with 5 wt.% SN shows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f009">Figure 9</xref>b) improved cycling stability and capacity retention after the 2nd cycle. </p><p>The rate performance of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite fibers was further evaluated by conducting current rate (or rate capability) experiments on the lithium anode half-cells at different current densities between 50 and 500 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite fibers were cycled ten times at current densities of 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, and then again at the initial value of 50 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The results exemplify the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite anode&#x02019;s ability to perform at higher current densities, as well as demonstrating the capacity recovery after being cycled from high to low current density. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-10-00045-f010">Figure 10</xref> shows the rate performance (charge capacity vs cycle number at different current densities) of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite-fiber anode in the OLE and in the MOILE with 5 wt.% SN. As expected, the composite-fiber anode delivered a higher specific charge capacity at lower current density, and vice versa. At 50 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup><sub>,</sub> the specific capacity decreased after 10 cycles to 418 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for the Li-ion cell cycled with the 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) electrolyte, but only to 579 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for the 1 M LiTFSI in 60% EMI-TFSI 40% EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) with 5 wt% SN electrolytes. This can be attributed to the stresses and strains caused by the high-volume change of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite fibers after repeated charge/discharge cycles. At a current density of 100 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the charge capacity was stable at ~315 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) and at ~441 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 1 M LiTFSI in 60% EMI-TFSI 40% EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) 5 wt% SN. The SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite anode in the MOILE with 5 wt% SN had a higher percentage increase in specific capacity with 25% at 100 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 23% at 200 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 30% at 400 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and 1% at 500 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, compared to 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>). However, after cycling back to 50 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite fibers with 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DMC (1:1 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) had less specific charge capacity than with the MOILE with 5 wt% SN. However, the SnO<sub>2</sub> electrode in both electrolytes (OLE and MOILE with SN) shows relatively low capacity at higher current density. Thus, the improvement in the charge capacity of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C composite anode with MOILE and SN can be attributed to the high Li-ion conductivity and diffusion caused by the addition of SN to the ionic liquid electrolyte. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-membranes-10-00045"><title>4.

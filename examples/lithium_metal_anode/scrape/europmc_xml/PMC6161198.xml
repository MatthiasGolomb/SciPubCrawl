Introduction</title><p>Large-scale applications such as automotive, stationary, deep-sea drilling devices need batteries to be capable of operating safely at medium-high temperatures with very good performance and cycle life; i.e., without appreciable degradation phenomena. In addition, even devices generally operating around room temperature could be accidentally subjected to prolonged overheating, thus requiring high thermal stability. In this scenario, electrolytes play a key role.</p><p>Rechargeable lithium batteries are an excellent choice as advanced electrochemical energy storage systems due to their high energy density and cycle life [<xref rid="B1-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recently published manuscripts report that ion conducting polymer membranes, realized through common materials and up-scalable processes, can act as electrolyte separators for rechargeable lithium battery systems. J.R. Nair et al. [<xref rid="B3-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] have prepared methacrylic-based PEs, reinforced with both cellulose hand-sheets and nanosize cellulose fibers, by UV-induced free radical photo-polymerization. Similarly, rigid&#x02013;flexible composite electrolyte membranes, based on poly(ethyl <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-cyanoacrylate) and cellulose backbone, have been prepared through an in-situ polymerization process by P. Hu et al. [<xref rid="B4-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These cross-linking techniques, also successfully proposed for Na<sup>+</sup> conducting PEs [<xref rid="B5-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], have shown short processing times, easy up-scalability and eco-compatibility, and have enabled gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with wide electrochemical stability windows and high room temperature ionic conductivity in combination with good mechanical properties to be obtained. Poly(vinylidene difluoride)-based GPEs were obtained via the phase-inversion method [<xref rid="B6-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The use of nano-clay filler and pore-forming agent, i.e., poly(vinylpyrrolidone), was seen to significantly improve the electrolyte uptake and the ion transport properties. H. Li et al. [<xref rid="B7-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have combined the advantages of GPEs with those of ceramic conductors to prepare sandwiched structure composite electrolytes with enhanced electrochemical performance. Reviews of GPE systems, addressed to Li/S [<xref rid="B8-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Li-ion [<xref rid="B9-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] battery systems, were recently published.</p><p>However, commercial lithium-ion batteries, even employing GPEs, do not behave well at medium-high temperatures as the organic electrolyte quickly degrades above 50 &#x000b0;C, thus irreversibly ageing the electrochemical device [<xref rid="B10-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this scenario, the development of solvent-free polymer electrolytes is undoubtedly appealing from safety and engineering points of view and opens new perspectives to applications in electrochemical devices [<xref rid="B8-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, polymer electrolytes (PEs) can be easily and cheaply manufactured into low thicknesses (&#x0003c;100 &#x003bc;m) and shapes not allowed for supported liquid electrolytes, offering a new concept of solvent-free, all-solid-state, thin-layer, flexible (both mechanically and in design), robust, lithium polymer batteries (LPBs). Finally, PEs play a second role in composite electrodes as binders and ionic conductors [<xref rid="B18-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the realization of all-solid-state lithium battery systems has been prevented so far by the low ionic conductivity of PEs, especially at ambient temperature.

The IL-free sample exhibits a weight loss above 180 &#x000b0;C, whereas the addition of the ionic liquid component results in thermal stability increase up to 220 &#x000b0;C. It should be noted that PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI is seen to be thermally stable up 290 &#x000b0;C. Therefore, we can reasonably hypothesize that the ionic liquid, properly incorporated within the polymer host, is able to protect the PEO chains by thermal degradation. Something similar was previously observed in other PEO electrolytes [<xref rid="B41-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], in which the IL agent, suitably dispersed through the polymeric matrix, was seen to prevent the oxidation of the polymer host above 4 V (vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li&#x000b0;).</p><p>The effect of the incorporation of the PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI ionic liquid on the ion transport properties of the polymer electrolyte is summarized in <xref rid="membranes-08-00041-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A remarkable conductivity increase is observed, especially at ambient temperature and below. For instance, the P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> sample shows ion conduction values three and two orders of magnitude higher than that of the IL-free sample at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C and 20 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B31-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B33-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], respectively. More than 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> S&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are exhibited at 20 &#x000b0;C, this is of interest for applications in practical devices and commonly not approached in polymer electrolyte membranes. These results support faster ion conduction through the PEO electrolyte due both to a much larger content of the amorphous phase, in agreement with the DSC data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, and to the enhanced mobility of the Li<sup>+</sup> cations resulting from the presence of PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI; i.e., the addition of ionic liquid results in large anion excess with respect to the lithium cations. Therefore, the strength of the Li<sup>+</sup>&#x022ef;Anion<sup>&#x02212;</sup> interaction reduces the role of the PEO chains in the coordination of the lithium cations, e.g., as a result from the competition with the PEO&#x022ef;Li<sup>+</sup> interactions [<xref rid="B24-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Therefore, the electrochemical stability window (ESW) of the P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> electrolyte system was investigated as a function of the temperature. The results, reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f002">Figure 2</xref> as linear sweep voltammetry curves, evince only a moderate, even if progressive, reduction of the ESW on passing from 20 to 80 &#x000b0;C. In particular, the anodic stability (related to oxidation processes of the electrolyte) detected at 80 &#x000b0;C differs by just 200 mV with respect to that recorded at 20 &#x000b0;C. Conversely, no practical variation is observed on the cathodic side with the temperature increase, displaying massive electrolyte reduction well below 0 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li&#x000b0;, which allows lithium plating also at 80 &#x000b0;C. A very low current flow (&#x0003c;25 &#x003bc;A&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) is observed up to the anodic breakdown voltage, thus supporting the high purity of the P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> sample. On the cathodic verse, three weak (&#x02264;20 &#x000b5;A&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) features, progressively evinced with the temperature increase, are observed around 1.5 V, 0.9 V and 0.5 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li&#x000b0;, respectively. Results previously reported in the literature [<xref rid="B44-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] suggest that the peaks located at 1.5 V and 0.5 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li&#x000b0; are ascribable to the Li<sup>+</sup> cation intercalation process into the native Ni<sub>x</sub>O film onto the nickel working electrode surface, whereas the feature at 0.9 V is likely due to impurities, i.e., probably water [<xref rid="B45-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. To summarize, the P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> electrolyte is allowed to successfully operate at medium-high temperatures.</p><p>The compatibility with the lithium anode is a key parameter for applications as electrolyte separators in Li metal polymer batteries. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f003">Figure 3</xref> compares the impedance plots of Li/P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>/Li and Li/P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>/Li cells obtained at different temperatures. The AC responses are constituted by a semicircle, taking into account the overall Li/polymer electrolyte interfacial resistance (i.e., charge transfer + passive layer) [<xref rid="B38-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], whereas the high frequency intercept with the real axis is associated with that of the electrolyte bulk [<xref rid="B38-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It should be noted that, at 20 &#x000b0;C (panel a), the IL-free electrolyte shows a partial semicircle at high-medium frequencies, due to the relatively low conductivity of the sample P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> [<xref rid="B31-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Finally, the inclined straight-line, observed at low frequencies, is attributed to diffusive phenomena through the electrolyte (Warburg contribution) [<xref rid="B38-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The impedance plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f003">Figure 3</xref> clearly confirm how the incorporation of ionic liquid results in a significant decrease of the electrolyte resistance, especially from room to medium temperature, in agreement with the conductivity data reported in <xref rid="membranes-08-00041-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. However, a gain, even if moderate, in interface resistance is also detected. For instance, the P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> sample shows, at the interface with Li metal, a resistance of 10&#x02013;11% lower (i.e., from 830 to 750 cm<sup>2</sup> at 20 &#x000b0;C and from 7.0 to 6.3 cm<sup>2</sup> at 80 &#x000b0;C) than that of the IL-free electrolyte (<xref rid="membranes-08-00041-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), in the whole investigated temperature range (20&#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C). We can hypothesize that the ionic liquid improves the Li<sup>+</sup> cation mobility at the electrolyte/lithium interface.</p><p>Applications such as in automotives, smart grids, etc. require high power and for energy to be readily available; this means that this requires the battery system to be feasibly discharged and charged at high current rates without significantly depleting its performance. For instance, the increase of the current rate promotes the diffusive phenomena within the battery, thus lowering the content of the stored/delivered energy. In electrochemical cells, the redox process kinetics are generally much faster than the active species diffusion through the electrolyte separator. By increasing the current value, the matter transferring process becomes more and more predominant with respect to those at the interfaces with the electrodes. When the current flow through the cell achieves a limiting value, J<sub>L</sub> (diffusion limiting current), the electrochemical processes are fully governed by the ion diffusion from the electrolyte bulk to the electrode surface and vice versa. Therefore, J<sub>L</sub> is a key parameter for evaluating the feasibility of an electrolyte at high current rates. The limiting current value was determined as reported in Materials and Methods. For instance, linear sweep voltammetry tests were run (at 0.01 mV&#x000b7;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) on symmetrical Li/P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>/Li and Li/P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>/Li cells at temperatures ranging from 40 to 80 &#x000b0;C. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f004">Figure 4</xref> plots the current density values, recorded during the potentiodynamic measurements, as a function of the cell overvoltage. After an initial step increase, in which the electrolyte membrane shows a quasi-ohmic behavior, the current density is seen to progressively level off, likely associated with the establishment of a concentration gradient within the electrolyte membrane [<xref rid="B46-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], around a time-stable value. Such a behavior indicates that the current density through the cell has reached the limiting value (J<sub>L</sub>), e.g., the ion conduction processes inside the electrolyte membrane are governed by diffusion phenomena (the concentration gradient extends through the overall electrolyte thickness). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f004">Figure 4</xref>, it is shown how the J<sub>L</sub> value remarkably increases with the operating cell temperature but is not affected by the presence of PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI, i.e., from 0.13&#x02013;017 to 1.2&#x02013;2.0 mA&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (about one order of magnitude) in passing from 40 to 80 &#x000b0;C for both the IL-free (panel a) and the IL-containing (panel b) electrolyte. Therefore, the ionic liquid does not seem to reduce the diffusive phenomena through the PEO electrolyte. However, the current density of the P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> sample, upon achieving the limiting value, quickly shows an abrupt feature during the potentiodynamic measurements at 60 &#x000b0;C and 80 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). This behavior, repeatedly confirmed by several (potentiodynamic) tests carried out on different Li/P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>/Li cells and never observed in the P(EO)<sub>1</sub>(LiTFSI)<sub>0.1</sub>(PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI)<sub>0.1</sub> sample, is ascribable to dendrite growth onto the Li electrode at current rates above 1 mA&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f004">Figure 4</xref>a suggest that the IL-free electrolyte is not able to sustain high current rates. Conversely, the ionic liquid plays a key role in improving the compatibility at the interface with the lithium anode, in particular when the cell is subjected to high current rates instead of in an open circuit condition as plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It is a plausible hypothesis that PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI behaves as a protective agent towards the Li metal electrode, allowing the running of charge/discharge cycling tests at a high current density without appreciable degradation phenomena of the lithium anode. Once more, this confirms the beneficial effect resulting from ionic liquid incorporation on battery performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-membranes-08-00041"><title>3.2.

This behavior&#x02014;i.e., supporting electron conduction through the composite electrode&#x02014;suggests the establishment of a three-dimensional network (percolation) formed by LiFePO<sub>4</sub> particles and, therefore, electronic continuous pathways through the composite cathode [<xref rid="B37-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It should be noted that the as-received active material is provided as superficially carbon-coated; this supports the not-very-low electronic resistance (given by the AC plot intercept with the real axis at low frequencies [<xref rid="B38-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) of the composite cathode (i.e., pure LiFePO<sub>4</sub> material exhibits very low electronic conductivity [<xref rid="B47-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). The addition of KJB carbon around 3&#x02013;4 wt. % results in a remarkable reduction of the semicircle diameter and a shifting of the low frequency intercept with the real axis towards smaller impedance values, highlighting a decrease of the electronic resistance of the cathode. At a KJB content equal to 6 wt. %, the semicircle practically reduces to a quasi-single point on the real axis, indicating that the electronic conductivity is largely overcome with respect to the ionic one (the electron and ion conductions through the polymer electrolyte are in parallel) of the polymer electrolyte incorporated within the electrode. In such a condition, the electronic resistance of the composite cathode is given by the distance of the &#x0201c;spot&#x0201d; response intercept with the real axis from the origin of the axes [<xref rid="B38-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f005">Figure 5</xref>b illustrates the electronic conductivity of the composite LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode as a function of the carbon content.

Conversely, very modest capacities, i.e., from 8 to 14% of the theoretical value, are obtained when the current rate is increased up to 0.8C&#x02013;1C. From the data illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-08-00041-f007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="membranes-08-00041-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, it is evident how, at medium-high temperatures, the PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI-incorporating lithium polymer batteries behave much better in terms of their delivered capacity and cycling performance than the IL-free ones. For instance, the addition of suitable ionic liquid is able to largely improve the performance of the LPBs not only at ambient or near ambient conditions, as previously reported in the literature [<xref rid="B18-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-membranes-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but even at medium-high temperatures. Therefore, the PEO-LiTFSI-PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI Li<sup>+</sup>-conducting membranes are very promising candidates as electrolyte separator systems for all-solid-state lithium polymer batteries operating around 100 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-membranes-08-00041"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>PEO-LiTFSI Li<sup>+</sup>-conducting membranes, containing the PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI ionic liquid, were prepared and studied to be addressed as electrolyte separators for all-solid-state lithium polymer batteries operating at medium-high temperatures. A solvent-free procedure was designed to prepare the PEO-LiTFSI-PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI electrolytes. These ternary systems have shown remarkably improved thermal, ion transport and interfacial properties with respect to the ionic liquid-free electrolytes. Wide electrochemical stability was observed even at medium-high operating temperatures. In particular, the ionic liquid-based PEO electrolytes are able to sustain high current rates without any appreciable lithium anode degradation, which is not allowed in binary ionic liquid-free, PEO-LiTFSI systems, thus enabling their use in battery systems operating at 80 &#x000b0;C or above and high current rates. Battery tests carried out at 80 &#x000b0;C in Li/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> polymeric systems have shown excellent cycling behavior and capability retention at high current rates, e.g., more than 93.6% of the theoretical capacity (i.e., 99.5% of the initial value) is still delivered after 100 cycles run at 1C with a coulombic efficiency close 100%. This performance largely exceeds that of analogous, ionic liquid-free, polymer lithium batteries at the same operating conditions, nominating the PEO-LiTFSI-PYR<sub>14</sub>TFSI ternary system as an electrolyte separator for medium-high temperature lithium polymer batteries. It is worth highlighting the absence of dendrite growth on the Li anode during prolonged cycling tests even at high current rates, which is very often not observed in lithium metal polymer batteries.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>G.B.A. and S.P. conceived and designed the experiments; G.-T.K. and M.C. performed the experiments; G.-T.K. and G.B.A. analyzed the data; G.B.A. wrote the paper.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-membranes-08-00041"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Notter</surname><given-names>D.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gauch</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Widmer</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>W&#x000e4;ger</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Stamp</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zah</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Althaus</surname><given-names>H.-J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Contribution of Li-ion batteries to the environmental impact of electric vehicles</article-title><source>Environ.

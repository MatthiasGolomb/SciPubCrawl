However, the lithium metal will irreversibly react with the electrolyte during the first cycling process, forming an uneven and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, which results in the non-uniform deposition of Li ions and thus the formation of lithium dendrites. This could cause a battery short circuit, resulting in safety hazards such as thermal runaway. In addition, the continuous rupture and repair of the SEIs during the repeated charge/discharge processes will constantly consume the active lithium, which leads to a significant decrease in battery capacity. An effective strategy to address these challenges is to design and construct ideal artificial SEIs on the surface of the lithium metal anode.

Introduction</title><p>In recent years, the market demand for vehicle electrification, equipment automation, and renewable energy harvesting has increased exponentially, significantly promoting the research of high-energy-density batteries. Lithium metal batteries (LMBs), especially lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries and lithium&#x02013;oxygen batteries, have been considered as one of the most promising high-capacity battery systems because the lithium metal anode (LMA) has an ultra-high theoretical capacity (3860 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and low electrochemical potential (&#x02212;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) [<xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the realization of LMAs still faces a series of challenges, including the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites [<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the formation of &#x0201c;dead lithium&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], infinite volume changes [<xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and unstable SEI [<xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When in contact with the electrolyte, the lithium metal will spontaneously react with it, gradually forming an intrinsic SEI on the lithium surface. Unfortunately, this natural SEI is unstable and easily destroyed during the cycle processes [<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, the lithium ions are more inclined to gather in the SEI cracks, resulting in the uneven deposition of Li ions and thus the formation of lithium dendrites, which may cause short circuits in the batteries. At the same time, the rupture and repair process of SEI requires continuous consumption of active lithium and electrolytes, resulting in rapid capacity decay and final cell failure [<xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the side reaction of lithium metal with moisture and other gases in the air poses another challenge, leading to the formation of many unpredictable multi-component oxide layers on the surface of lithium. To cope with this challenge, the assembly process of LMBs requires an absolutely water-free and oxygen-free environment, thus increasing the cost of battery assembly in the large-scale manufacturing process [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In view of the above problems, the most feasible strategy is to actively construct an artificial protective layer on the surface of lithium metal to inhibit the dendrites growth and reduce the side reactions with electrolyte or gases in the air.</p><p>Some companies have made significant progress in the solution of stabilizing the SEI in liquid electrolytes. For example, Prologium Technology demonstrated its fourth-generation lithium ceramic battery system at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025, which uses all-inorganic electrolyte technology to completely eliminate organic components and increase inorganic components from 90% to 100%. This technology not only improves the energy density, charging speed, and low-temperature reliability of the battery but also significantly enhances the safety. In addition, SES AI Corporation has also successfully achieved a stable SEI in liquid electrolyte through its hybrid lithium metal battery technology. The hybrid lithium metal battery of SES performs well in terms of energy density and cycle life. The technology maintains the use of liquid electrolytes by introducing lithium metal anodes into the traditional lithium-ion battery structure. Through innovative technologies and materials, these companies have provided viable solutions for the commercial application of lithium metal batteries and promoted the development of the entire industry.</p><p>As early as 1979, the term &#x0201c;solid electrolyte interphase&#x0201d; was introduced by Peled [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to describe the protective layer that impedes the ongoing interactions between the non-aqueous electrolyte and the alkali metal anode. In addition, the term &#x0201c;solid electrolyte&#x0201d; is employed to describe both its physical state and functionality, as the film exhibits characteristics akin to those of a solid-state electrolyte, including ionic conductivity and electronic insulation. The introduction of the term &#x0201c;interphase&#x0201d; brought forth a significant concept, indicating that this film exists as an autonomous phase, which serves as an intermediary between the electrolyte and lithium metal. Subsequently, the term &#x0201c;SEI&#x0201d; was widely adopted to denote analogous interphases formed in diverse anode materials, such as graphite, silicon (Si), lithium, etc. [<xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This paper reviews the modeling progress, application research, existing challenges, and future development directions of SEIs in lithium metal batteries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nanomaterials-15-00554"><title>2. SEI Formation Mechanism</title><p>The formation mechanism of SEIs in LMBs is a complex multi-step process involving the interaction between the electrode surface and electrolyte. In the production and manufacture of batteries, the SEI is naturally formed during the initial charging and discharging process without artificial induction. Specifically, the solvent, lithium salts, and additives in the electrolyte are reduced on the lithium anode surface to form an SEI in LMBs. These reactions usually involve both the organic matter in the electrolyte and active lithium metal, forming a protective layer to prevent further side reactions. The reduction reaction for each electrolyte component varies based on its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) below the Fermi level of the anode, as proposed by Goodenough [<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). If the LUMO of the electrolyte is lower than the Fermi level of lithium, the electrons will be transferred to the electrolyte, resulting in a reduction reaction of the electrolyte molecules to decompose into products such as lithium salts (LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, etc.) and organic compounds, which accumulate on the surface of the lithium metal anode to form a SEI. It is important to note that this explanation solely focuses on the chemical reactions associated with the formation of SEIs, while the actual battery internal reactions involve complex conditions influenced by factors such as voltage, temperature, pressure, and so on [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>After understanding the underlying chemical reaction mechanism behind the formation of SEIs, the next step is to study the specific formation process of SEIs during cycling and their impact on the battery performance. The formation process of the SEI on the lithium metal anode usually occurs during the first charge&#x02013;discharge process of the battery [<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. When the battery starts to work, the surface of the lithium metal anode is in contact with the electrolyte. Under the action of voltage, the solvent and salt in the electrolyte undergo a reduction reaction. Solvents in the electrolyte, such as ethylene carbonate (EC) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC), are reduced on the surface of lithium metal and decomposed into lithium salts (such as LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and organic compounds. These products form a thin and dense solid layer covering the surface of lithium metal, which plays a protective role. The formation of the SEI can prevent the electrolyte from further reacting with the lithium metal, thereby reducing side reactions and corrosion of the lithium metal. In addition, the SEI can effectively isolate the direct contact between the lithium metal and the electrolyte, slow down the decomposition of the electrolyte, and maintain the stability and long life of the battery. It is challenging to precisely determine the thickness of SEIs because they exist in the electrolyte solutions. However, scientists have found that it is possible to provide an approximate estimation of the average thickness of SEI between the active substance and electrolyte via ionic impedance technology, which ranges from nanometers to hundreds of nanometers [<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This layer acts as an insulator for electrons while providing a highly conductive pathway for lithium ions [<xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which brings both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, a dense and complete SEI can significantly weaken electron tunneling, thereby preventing the further depletion of electrolytes and protecting the lithium anode from further damage caused by solvent molecules. On the other hand, the formation and growth of SEIs consume active lithium as well as the materials present in the electrolyte solution, resulting in a series of problems such as increased battery impedance, a decrease in coulombic efficiency, and the attenuation of battery capacity [<xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. At the same time, the uneven deposition of Li<sup>+</sup> in the cracks of SEI leads to the formation of lithium dendrites, which may puncture the separator and cause a short circuit in the batteries, resulting in safety hazards such as thermal runaway. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to understand the formation mechanism, stability, and influencing factors of the SEI [<xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with the aim of improving the battery performance. Indeed, the electrode&#x02013;electrolyte interphase layers exist not only on the anodes but also on the cathode. The layer formed on the surface of the positive electrode is known as the cathode&#x02013;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, which also increases the interphase impedance and slightly reduces the reversible cycle capacity [<xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This review focuses on the SEIs on the surface of lithium metal anodes.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-nanomaterials-15-00554"><title>3. Overview of SEI Modeling Development</title><p>Researchers have experienced a long process of understanding the SEIs because of their complex compositions. The understanding of this protective layer on the negative electrodes originated from its observation on lithium metal immersed in a non-aqueous electrolyte in 1979 by Peled [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the same year, Peled introduced the concept of SEI, which is a protective layer of electronic insulation while forming an ion conduction between the electrode and the electrolyte, playing a similar role to a solid electrolyte. Over two decades of observation and summary, the model was fully enriched and improved by Peled [<xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in 1997 and by Aurbach et al. [<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in 1999. Even today, the SEI remains &#x0201c;the most important but least understood component&#x0201d; in rechargeable LMBs because of the complex chemical reactions that occur during its formation process and inadequate measurement of their physical properties [<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Owing to the intricate reaction between the electrolyte and the electrode surface, there is no comprehensive and systematic theory for the formation and growth of SEIs. The extremely short time scale of the electrochemical reactions associated with SEI makes it challenging to experimentally observe its formation. Without the experimental data as a basis, the difficulty of mathematical theoretical modeling is greatly increased, and it will be more difficult to uncover the secrets of the SEIs. However, some experimental techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) [<xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [<xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [<xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and isotope labeling are developing rapidly, which can be employed to investigate the structure and composition of the SEIs. Additionally, the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) [<xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) [<xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] are powerful techniques for studying the formation, composition, and properties of SEIs. The EQCM detects the mass changes and mechanical properties of the SEIs by monitoring frequency changes in the electrode coating, while the ToF-SIMS utilizes chemical analysis with high spatial resolution to reveal the detailed composition and structure of the SEIs. The combined use of these two techniques can provide a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of the SEIs, which can help optimize the electrochemical performances of batteries. With the development of computer technology, the theoretical calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) [<xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], molecular dynamics (MD) [<xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and phase-field models (PFM) [<xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have been increasingly utilized in SEI research. Therefore, there are two main approaches to studying the SEI: the experimental methods primarily focus on exploring its structure and detecting its composition, while the theoretical calculations are more inclined towards investigating the initial formation mechanism of the SEI and predicting its properties.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-nanomaterials-15-00554"><title>3.1. Development of Composition and Structure Model for SEI</title><p>As mentioned in <xref rid="sec2-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="sec">Section 2</xref>, the composition of SEI is complex, involving the occurrence of multiple side reactions and the participation of many uncertain components. The reduction reaction of the electrolyte generates various products, including inorganic salts, organic substances, and gases. These solid byproducts gradually contribute to the growth of SEI during battery operation. Therefore, it is difficult but also very important to study the components of SEI and establish a model that can reflect its components.</p><p>The formation and composition of SEI have been extensively investigated in recent decades because of its ability to identify the factors that affect the SEI and provide valuable insights for improving battery performance. However, it is challenging to observe the continuous evolution of the SEI formation and growth under experimental conditions due to the complexity of battery structure and reactions. Consequently, theoretical calculations such as DFT and MD play a significant role in understanding the development of SEI. However, for the growth of lithium dendrites, to further study such problems and provide theoretical guidance for the construction of the SEI, the phase-field modeling (PFM) is a part that cannot be ignored. In recent years, there have been many frontier reports [<xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] in this direction, which have made significant contributions to solving the problem of lithium dendrite growth.</p><p>Takenaka conducted simulations by using a combination of Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics techniques to investigate the reduction process of electrolytes, particularly ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) [<xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The layer adjacent to the graphite anode is mainly composed of inorganic compounds, such as Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and LiF. Instead, the outer layer consists of organic substances, such as lithium ethyl carbonate (LiEC), dilithium butylene dicarbonate (Li<sub>2</sub>BDC), or lithium phthalocyanine (LiPC). The SEI formed by EC reduction had a denser structure than that formed by PC reduction. Traditional force fields used in MD simulations, including the Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potentials for Atomistic Simulation Studies (COMPASS) [<xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and universal force field (UFF) [<xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] models, have some limitations because they cannot accurately simulate the formation and breakage of chemical bonds during the reaction processes. However, with the introduction of the Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) reaction force field [<xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], it is now possible to more realistically simulate these chemical transformations within MD simulations by considering the interactions between molecules and atoms. Bedrov [<xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] studied the EC reduction reactions by using the ReaxFF force field and identified the presence of (CH<sub>2</sub>OCO<sub>2</sub>Li)<sub>2</sub> as one of the products (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a,b). By analyzing the energy curve (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a), the key steps in the reaction process, such as adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion, can be identified. This is of great significance for understanding the reaction mechanism and optimizing the reaction conditions. At the same time, the contour map (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b) clearly shows the energy changes at each position in the R1 and R2 opening process in c-EC<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/Li<sup>+</sup>, which helps to determine the energy barrier and reaction heat of the reaction so as to understand the difficulty and thermodynamic stability of the reaction. Subsequent studies have also employed this method to investigate EC reduction reactions with similar results [<xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c,d). <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c is the test device they studied, and <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d is the reaction process they tested out, as well as the barrier information of each step. The ReaxFF force field provides a detailed understanding of EC reduction reactions at the atomic level, allowing researchers to identify specific products. Although it works well in controlled simulations, the ReaxFF force field may not fully capture the complexity of EC reduction in a real-world battery environment, where there are so many interacting components. Yu [<xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] employed DFT and MD methods to investigate the impact of excess electrons on EC molecules. Their findings revealed that the distribution of electrons becomes localized during dimer formation, resulting in the breakage of C-O bonds and the subsequent production of CO<sub>2</sub><sup>3&#x02212;</sup> ions. The electrolytes used in these experiments are highly complex because of the presence of numerous additives that play a vital role in the formation and growth of SEIs. In another investigation conducted by Wang&#x02019;s group, both the reduction mechanism of EC and the influence of adding vinylene carbonate (VC) on SEI formation [<xref rid="B52-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] were explored by utilizing theoretical calculations based on DFT. The results indicated that the VC initiated a reduction reaction prior to EC, forming a protective layer to prevent excessive reduction in the electrolyte. Ushirogata [<xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] utilized the DFT-MD method to investigate the role of VC additives, and the results indicated that VC could replace EC for reduction (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>e). <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>e shows that VC has a good substitutability by replacing VC with EC in the decomposition of the anion radical reaction route and results. The DFT-MD method can simulate the reduction reaction process of the VC additive in lithium-ion batteries from the atomic and electronic levels and accurately reveal the specific mechanism of its replacement of EC for reduction, which is helpful to deeply understand how VC forms an SEI film on the negative surface of the battery. At the same time, the method can simulate the behavior of VC under different voltage and temperature conditions, predict its stability and reactivity in the actual battery environment, and provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the battery performance. However, the selection of parameters such as base group and functional in DFT calculation has a significant impact on the accuracy of the results, and the force field parameters in MD simulation also need to be carefully handled, and unreasonable parameter selection may lead to wrong conclusions, which is also the shortcoming of the DFT-MD method. Kevin et al. [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] also studied the modification of SEI through fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and found that FEC triggers a reaction leading to the formation of LiF, which enhances the structural stability of SEI. Cresce [<xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] employed an atomic force microscope (AFM) to investigate the in situ formation process of SEI in the graphite negative electrode (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>f). The force&#x02013;distance curve (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>f) of the SEI can determine the thickness and mechanical properties of the SEI. Illustrations provide an enlarged view for more accurate measurement of thickness. The dotted line represents the behavior of the probe on the surface without SEI before the formation of SEI as a comparison. AFM can be measured in situ under the actual working conditions of the battery to monitor the dynamic changes in the SEI in real time, which helps to understand the behavior of the SEI under different electrochemical conditions. However, AFM has high requirements for the flatness and cleanliness of the sample surface, and the roughness of the graphite negative surface or pollutants may affect the imaging quality and accuracy of AFM. The SEI exhibits a distinct layered structure, consisting of a soft polymer-like outer layer and a hard inorganic salt inner layer. This structural composition was also confirmed by ex situ XPS analysis. Zhang [<xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] applied focused ion beam (FIB) to detect the growth and development of the SEI. Initially, the thickness of SEI was measured to be approximately 450&#x02013;980 nm, displaying a highly uneven surface with non-uniform composition. After multiple charge&#x02013;discharge cycles, the surface gradually became smoother. However, numerous cracks emerged with a significant increase in the organic matter content, resulting in an overall increase in the SEI thickness to approximately 1200 nm. To further investigate the structural characteristics of SEI, numerous researchers have examined its surface by using AFM [<xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], which can distinguish between the SEI and negative substrate based on their distinct mechanical properties. The structure of SEI can be categorized into two layers: a loose, porous organic outer layer and a dense inorganic inner layer [<xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Lu [<xref rid="B63-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] employed an isotope labeling method to analyze the structure of SEI. They initially formed an SEI by using an electrolyte containing <sup>7</sup>LiClO<sub>4</sub> and subsequently immersed it in an electrolyte containing <sup>6</sup>LiBF<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>g,h). In <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>g, the depth distribution of the isotope ratios of <sup>6</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> and <sup>7</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in the SEI formed by <sup>7</sup>LiClO<sub>4</sub> in the <sup>6</sup>LiBF<sub>4</sub> electrolyte at different immersion times (30 s, 3 min, and 15 min) was studied by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In the distribution map (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>h), the area with a higher ion signal is shown as a brighter area in the map, which helps to visualize the distribution of different ions in the SEI. In the map, the content and distribution of each ion at different depths can be clearly seen. This is helpful to understand the formation process of SEI and the transport behavior of lithium ions. The isotope labeling method has the advantages of accurate structural analysis and dynamic change monitoring. However, in the actual battery operating environment, complex electrochemical reactions and multi-component interactions may cause the behavior of labeled isotopes to deviate from the ideal situation, affecting the accuracy and interpretability of the results. Their findings revealed that the diffusion process allows the electrolyte to easily penetrate below 5 nm of the SEI surface while only allowing <sup>6</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> to pass through the inner layer. This experimental evidence further confirmed the double-layered nature of the SEI.</p><p>The above describes the researchers&#x02019; exploration process of SEI components. By using these advanced methods and detection equipment, researchers have initially modeled the composition and structure of SEIs. The first SEI model was proposed by Peled [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and is shown in <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a. This particular model assumes that the SEI is a single crystal similar to a lithium-ion conductor. And then Peled proposed in 1983 that SEI has a double-layer structure model, with a dense inner layer near the Li metal side and a porous outer layer near the electrolyte side. However, the subsequent experimental investigations have demonstrated that the structure of SEI is much more intricate and dynamic than originally assumed. By using Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, and XPS techniques, Aurbach [<xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] made a significant discovery on the chemical composition of SEI. Their findings revealed that the SEI was composed of a combination of diverse organic and inorganic species. Consequently, they proposed the new double-layer model, suggesting that the SEI consists of an inner layer rich in inorganic components (in contact with the lithium metal) and an outer layer abundant in organic substances (in contact with the electrolyte), as illustrated in <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b. It is speculated that the inorganic compounds, such as LiF and Li<sub>2</sub>O, exhibit greater chemical stability against lithium than the organic compounds. As a result, they tended to accumulate on the lithium surface. For example, Zhou et al. [<xref rid="B64-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] utilized operando liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry to detect that the SEI formed in a Li bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI)-DME electrolyte consists of a thin, compact, and continuous layer rich in Li<sub>2</sub>O, along with an outer layer composed of loosely connected oligomers/polymers.</p><p>Subsequently, the mosaic model was proposed as an improvement on the layered model [<xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The mosaic model builds upon the concept that the SEI consists of both dense inner and porous outer layers, indicating that each component forms a distinct microphase, which together creates a mosaic-like structure within the SEI and is similar to Aurbach&#x02019;s research. A visual representation of this concept is shown in <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c. The mosaic model became widely accepted as the leading theory for explaining the structure of SEIs, mainly because it aligns well with the XPS results, ionic conductivity measurements, and the logical ranking of the chemical stability of different SEI species in relation to lithium [<xref rid="B63-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, recent observations from the cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) have posed challenges to the generally accepted layered mosaic model [<xref rid="B65-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. According to literature report [<xref rid="B66-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], it has been confirmed that the SEI primarily consists of an amorphous phase, regardless of the type of electrolyte used in the batteries. Furthermore, there is no significant accumulation of crystalline microphases on the surface of lithium metal. In certain instances, these crystalline microphases are randomly dispersed within the SEI, while in other cases, they tend to concentrate predominantly on the outer layer [<xref rid="B67-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The cryo-TEM observation reveals that the SEI structure bears resemblance to the famous &#x0201c;plum pudding model&#x0201d; (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>d), with the amorphous phase resembling the pudding and the embedded crystalline microphases resembling plums [<xref rid="B68-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><fig position="anchor" id="nanomaterials-15-00554-f003"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Models of SEI.

Development of SEI Growth Prediction Model</title><p>In recent years, several emerging mathematical models have been developed for predicting the growth and formation of the SEI. Liu [<xref rid="B69-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] established a model combining the formation of lithium dendrites with SEI (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a). The growth of dendrites affects the curvature and stretching of the SEI film layer, thereby influencing its evolution. Meanwhile, the growth of SEI alters the resistance in the battery and the reactive current density in the circuit, thus affecting the formation and growth of lithium dendrites. The effects of current density, SEI resistivity, defects, and inhomogeneity of the lithium metal surface on the formation and growth of lithium dendrites were studied by using this mathematical model. In addition, their research can be extended to explore various other phenomena associated with the simultaneous growth of SEI and dendrites. These studies provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of dendrite growth and facilitate the improvement of SEI design strategies.</p><p>Liu [<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] presented an electro-chemo-mechanical model (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b) that combines the electrochemical kinetics and mechanical behavior to investigate the design of artificial SEIs for uniform lithium electrodeposition. The model is based on a modified Butler&#x02013;Volmer equation, incorporating the coupling potential, mechanical stress, and Li-ion concentration fields to describe the interfacial dynamics between the SEI and the lithium metal anode. The model is implemented by using a phase-field approach and applied to a structured substrate covered with an SEI. This framework allows for an independent evaluation of the SEI&#x02019;s ionic conductivity and Young&#x02019;s modulus, highlighting their crucial roles in governing the morphology and uniformity of Li electrodeposition. The predictions based on this model are validated by the experimental data in the literature [<xref rid="B70-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], providing a comprehensive understanding for optimizing artificial SEIs in LMBs.

[<xref rid="B76-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] elucidates the interphase evolution mechanism concerning the impact of thermal distribution on the SEI using a thermal distribution evolution model. Initially, the effect of SEI&#x02019;s diffusivity on its thermal distribution was investigated by varying the SEI diffusion coefficient. The results demonstrate that when the ratio of SEI diffusion coefficient to electrolyte diffusion coefficient is 5, the growth of lithium dendrites is minimized, and the temperature gradient at the dendritic tip remains relatively low. This coefficient is influenced by the electrolyte composition, especially by the ions, as discussed below. Subsequently, the influence of cation and anion diffusion coefficients on the thermal distribution within the SEI is explored by changing the diffusion rates of ions through the SEI. It is found that when the SEI&#x02019;s diffusivity relative to the electrolyte is low, the anions play a significant role in modulating the heat distribution within the SEI, exhibiting a threshold effect. Specifically, an increase in the anion diffusion coefficient within a certain range leads to a reduction in the temperature gradient, while surpassing this range results in an elevated temperature distribution. Finally, the introduction of anisotropy in the SEI structure facilitates the lateral growth of lithium dendrites and reduces the temperature gradient at the dendrite tip, promoting a more uniform thermal distribution in the SEI. These findings provide critical insights into the design of SEI and offer guidance for enhancing the performance and stability of LMBs.</p><p>Perez-Beltran [<xref rid="B77-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] presented a detailed mechanistic model for the formation of the SEI and the electrochemical plating and stripping of lithium ions on a lithium metal anode during cycling by using a first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) approach (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c). The LiFSI-F5DEE electrolyte system, which consists of a 1.2 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt dissolved in a fluorinated ether solvent, 1-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)ethane (F5DEE), was used as the research object. The findings reveal that the SEI&#x02019;s composition and structure are strongly influenced by the aggregation of organic and inorganic components, which compete for dominance. The grain boundaries between different inorganic SEI phases, such as LiF and Li<sub>2</sub>O, are identified to be faster pathways for lithium-ion transport, enhancing the overall conductivity of the SEI. Additionally, the efficiency of lithium reduction during plating decreases over time due to the densification of the SEI and stronger ionic interactions within the inorganic bulk phase. The simulated SEI evolution well agrees with the experimental observations, providing a predictive framework for future studies on SEI formation and electrolyte design.

The numerical solution of the governing equations enables the prediction of the solvent concentration distribution, SEI thickness, and capacity loss.

Their research explored a larger scale in terms of length and time compared with the similar studies conducted by using molecular dynamics simulations. This model, which combines the multiscale kMC and continuum approaches, demonstrates the presence of a SEI primarily composed of LiF on top of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and Li after 1 &#x000b5;s. The formation of this SEI can be attributed to the intricate interactions between various electrolyte components and the salt decomposition processes. Additionally, they observed that a more fragmented SEI with a certain organic content was formed when the local concentration of Li ions was low. Conversely, increasing the salt concentration leads to a faster passivation process on the lithium metal surface. These findings provide valuable insights for designing SEIs on the lithium metal surface and represent an important advancement towards the knowledge-based engineering of SEIs.</p><p>In general, the rational use of mathematical models can provide a better prediction of the various properties of the SEI and optimize the experimental schemes. Therefore, it is of great significance to combine the mathematical modeling with the research of SEI in LMBs, that is, to combine theory with practice to obtain twice the result with half the effort. Although there are some differences between the SEIs of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and LMBs, the SEI mathematical models of LIBs and LMBs have many similarities. Firstly, the SEI formation process is critical for both battery systems, involving the electrochemical reactions and material diffusion. For example, Wagner-Henke [<xref rid="B79-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and Phul [<xref rid="B80-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] both referred to the growth process of SEIs and the effect of potential decline on capacity decay from the perspective of two different types of batteries, respectively, suggesting that the SEI&#x02019;s mathematical model can be used in both types of batteries to predict and analyze the growth and performance of SEI. In addition, the structure and composition of SEIs are also similar in both LIBs and LMBs. Adenusi [<xref rid="B81-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and Tan [<xref rid="B82-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] highlighted the multilayer structure and dynamic changes in the SEI in both lithium-ion batteries and lithium metal batteries, which are critical to understanding the mechanism of the SEI model and improving the cyclic stability and safety of batteries. In addition, Tan [<xref rid="B83-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] reported that the multilayer structural model of SEI has been widely adopted in the study of graphite anode surfaces, which is also applicable in the lithium metal anodes. The SEI mathematical models of LIBs and LMBs have many similarities in research, including the formation process, the structural composition, and the establishment method of the mathematical model. These common points provide an important theoretical basis for an in-depth understanding of the performance and optimal design for these two types of batteries.</p><p>This section introduces the development of structural and mathematical models of the SEIs and their application scenarios and ranges. There is no doubt that they have made significant contributions to the development of this field [<xref rid="B84-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The above discussion is based on the liquid electrolyte batteries, but the formation of SEI in liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes is fundamentally different. In the liquid electrolyte batteries, the SEI is usually formed by the reaction of the electrode material and the electrolyte at the solid&#x02013;liquid phase interphase and has the characteristics of a solid electrolyte, which is an electronic insulator but an excellent conductor of Li<sup>+</sup>. While in the solid electrolyte batteries, the formation of SEI involves more complex chemical and electrochemical reactions, and its structure and composition may be dynamic and complex [<xref rid="B86-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Therefore, relatively little research has been performed on the research of SEI models in the solid-state LMBs. Recently, Li [<xref rid="B87-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] developed a mathematical model that integrates the physical and chemical processes that form dendrites. In addition, the model provides a new insight that exchanging certain properties in a new electrolyte can slow down or even completely inhibit dendrite formation, which makes an important contribution to the SEI modeling of LMBs with solid electrolytes. A better understanding of the growth process of lithium dendrites in solid-state batteries will help us to build a stable SEI to avoid the growth of lithium dendrites. Using MD simulations guided by machine learning potential, Ren et al. [<xref rid="B88-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] studied the formation and growth mechanism of SEI at the atomic level. It identifies four stages of evolution: rapid ion diffusion, nucleation, Li<sub>2</sub>S growth, and stability. These insights into the formation of SEI are critical to improving the durability of all-solid-state batteries (ASBs), especially at the interphase between lithium metal and solid electrolyte. Because the research of Ru et al. is based on the specific solid electrolyte, whether it can be extended to other solid electrolytes remains to be studied. But there is no doubt that the model helps to optimize battery performance and life by understanding the kinetic and thermodynamic processes that control the development of SEI. There are also other studies [<xref rid="B88-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] of SEI films in all-solid-state batteries; however, the solid electrolyte protective layer still needs a lot of research and exploration.</p><p>However, the degree of alienation of each model is increasing, and the background is very different, so the realization of practical applications will be relatively distant. Therefore, determining whether the model can be applied to actual production is a huge challenge. The emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology has certain advantages in the mathematical models [<xref rid="B89-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="B90-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="B92-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="B93-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], which can improve accuracy and simplicity. At present, there are also some studies [<xref rid="B94-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,<xref rid="B95-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] in this field, which is the trend of future development. The research and development of LMBs and their materials is essentially a process of exploring scientific problems based on the basic physics theories. The application of theoretical simulations to explore the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the energy and matter conversion in the process of energy storage can effectively improve the design of SEIs for LMBs. Through physical basis and theoretical simulation, the structure-activity relationship can be optimized, the practical problems in production and use can be solved, and thus a reliable and valuable theoretical basis can be provided. Regardless of the mathematical model, its root is to solve the interaction potential function between the atoms or units. Owing to the evolution of computational methods at different physical scales, the gradually emerging empirical and modified parameters in computational physics models affect the accuracy of the simulation results and the efficiency of the calculation process. With the increase in simulation data [<xref rid="B96-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] and attention to computational efficiency, the introduction of machine learning has realized the need to balance high efficiency and throughput.

Through the utilization of FTIR and XPS, they found that the SEIs formed in electrolytes with lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>) dissolved in organic carbonate solvents were composed of various species, including lithium semicarbonates (ROCO<sub>2</sub>Li), lithium dicarbonates ((ROCO<sub>2</sub>Li)<sub>2</sub>), LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and a small quantity of lithium fluorophosphate (LiPO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>y</sub>) [<xref rid="B105-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. And a large number of subsequent studies have also discovered that LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> are indispensable components for the electrochemical cycling of lithium batteries in PC or EC electrolytes [<xref rid="B106-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The following is an overview of the latest research on inorganic SEIs.</p><p>Zhou et al. [<xref rid="B107-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] employed a CF<sub>4</sub> plasma technology to introduce an artificial fluoride-rich SEI on the surface of the lithium metal anode (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a). The stability of the electrode can be enhanced by the high mechanical strength of the LiF-rich SEI while reducing the ratio of cracks. In addition, uniform nucleation was guided by lower diffusion, achieving the purpose of inhibiting lithium dendrites. The Li||Li symmetric battery consisting of F-Li exhibited stable cycling performance for 1700 h (at a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and a capacity of 1 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and 1400 h (at a current density of 2 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and a capacity of 2 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), with minimal overpotentials observed at approximately 13 mV and 80 mV, respectively (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b). Coincidentally, Han et al. [<xref rid="B108-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] also conducted in-depth research on the ability of LiF to prevent electron tunneling, further confirming the significance of the LIF-rich interphase protective layer.</p><p>In the study conducted by Xia et al. [<xref rid="B109-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], they successfully achieved both volumetric accommodation and stable SEI by utilizing a metal-free fluorinated carbon fibers (FCF) host, which was prepared via a simple one-step fluorination method. By using the molten lithium infusion technique, they fabricated a highly stable SEI dominated by LiF on the FCF host. Unlike previous approaches involving fluorinated electrolytes, additives, fluorinated salts, or pre-reactions of lithium foil with polymeric fluorine donors, the thin and uniform LiF-dominant SEI formed mainly from the FCF host plays a crucial role in regulating homogeneous lithium nucleation and enabling efficient charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interphase. <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c illustrates the preparation process of FCF-hosted lithium and the mechanisms of lithium deposition on the different types of LMAs. It also elucidates the formation mechanism by which LiF is predominantly present in the SEI, provides insights into how lithium is deposited onto the LMAs with the SEIs with or without LiF, and shows structural and morphological changes during this process. The LMA hosted by FCF exhibited improved coulombic efficiency (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>d), uniform lithium deposition, and excellent stability during high-rate cycling for over 100 h at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and 1 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Additionally, when combined with cathodes such as LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, sulfur, or thick LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, the full cells demonstrated enhanced rate capabilities and prolonged cycling durability, even under low electrolyte conditions. This study confirms the practical applicability of utilizing FCF to host lithium and presents an innovative approach for cost-effective and high-performance lithium metal batteries.</p><p>Yang et al. [<xref rid="B110-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] employed a straightforward method involving InCl<sub>3</sub> to polymerize 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and construct a stable LiF/LiCl/LiIn hybrid SEI. This was confirmed by analyzing the XPS data and observing the structure using cryo-TEM. Additionally, DFT calculations and finite element simulations (FES) were conducted to validate the excellent insulating properties of electrons as well as the efficient transport capabilities of lithium ions exhibited by this hybrid SEI. Furthermore, it was observed that the interfacial electric field demonstrated an evenly distributed potential and facilitated a higher flux of lithium ions, resulting in the uniform deposition of lithium without dendrite formation. The application of this LiF/LiCl/LiIn hybrid SEI in the Li||Li symmetric batteries showcased consistent cycling performance over 2000 h without any instances of short circuits at a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Moreover, this hybrid SEI also displayed exceptional rate capability and remarkable stability during cycling tests with LiFePO<sub>4</sub>/Li batteries, achieving a high specific capacity of 123.5 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a 10 C rate.</p><p>Lin et al. [<xref rid="B111-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] reported for the first time the utilization of a tetrahydrochloride form of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine with high amine content (BHCL) to effectively control the solvent sheath and construct a LiCl-rich inorganic SEI (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>e). BHCL possesses four amine groups with a high donor number, enabling its strong coordination with lithium ions and involvement in the electric double layer near the lithium metal. Subsequently, the chloride ions attached to the amine group penetrate the solvent sheath and decompose to generate an inorganic SEI abundant in LiCl. The Li||Li symmetric battery with modifications of this SEI demonstrated stable cycling for more than 2500 h at a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, while maintaining an overpotential of approximately 45 mV (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>f). The performance of both the Li||Cu and Li||LFP cells also showed significant improvement.</p><p>Beichel et al. [<xref rid="B112-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] successfully utilized fluorinated organic Br&#x000f8;nsted acid HBFEP to modify the surface of lithium metal, enhancing its cycling performance in rechargeable batteries. By immersing the lithium anode into a diluted solution of phosphoric acid derivative (CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(O)OH (HBFEP) with a concentration of 0.05 to 0.20 M, an artificial SEI was formed on the surface of lithium metal. Subsequently, HBFEP reacts with the lithium surface, resulting in the formation of lithium salt (LiBFEP), which acts as an inorganic coordination polymer capable of conducting lithium ions. In addition, this film possesses self-healing properties owing to its ability to break and reform ionic bonds when the lithium volume expands during cycling. The Li||Li symmetric battery with HBFEP-modified lithium electrodes exhibits a significant increase in cycle lifetime, ranging from three to nearly four times longer at 0.1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. This suggests that the LiBFEP-enriched layer acts as a protective barrier, facilitating lithium-ion conduction between the lithium electrode and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing the rechargeability of the lithium electrodes.</p><p>Although the current research direction is mainly LiF (the main components of SEI are shown in <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>g), Zeng et al. [<xref rid="B113-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] designed a super-coordinated co-solvated diluent, 2, 3-difluoroethoxy-benzene (DFEB), to control the solvation structure so that the diluent and anion participate in the formation and growth of SEI. It is customized for the lithium metal anode with Li<sub>2</sub>O, which is rich in inorganic SEI. They also found that high-concentration electrolytes (HCEs, typically lithium salt concentrations above 3 M) and localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) can effectively improve the long-term cycling performance of LMBs. Then, they assembled the DFEB into a lithium battery in the environment of LHCEs (DFEB-LHCE), in which DFEB participates in the first solvated shell and collaborates with FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to form a Li<sub>2</sub>O-dominated inorganic-rich SEI, while the LIF-dominated SEI was formed in LHCE where the traditional diluents do not participate in the solvated structure. Owing to this unique SEI structure, a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.58%, low nucleation overpotential, and dense uniform lithium deposition were achieved in the Li||Cu half-cells. As a result, the formation of lithium dendrites in the lithium symmetric batteries can be effectively inhibited by the non-in situ and in situ lithium deposition morphology observations. More importantly, in full cells with LFP, NCM811, and sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) as cathodes, DFEB-LHCE can achieve a more stable long-cycle performance, and the Li||LFP full battery using DFEB-LHCE maintained 85% of its capacity after 650 cycles with a stable CE of 99.9%. Moreover, the 1.5 Ah lithium metal soft-pack battery using DFEB-LHCE still exhibited an excellent capacity retention rate of 89% and an average CE of 99.93% after 250 cycles. This work reveals the superiority of the Li<sub>2</sub>O-dominated SEI in stabilizing lithium metal anodes and provides a new perspective for customizing the composition of the SEI by regulating the solvation structure through co-solvation diluents. Furthermore, the DFEB-LHCE exhibited exceptional lithium compatibility and interfacial stability, as evidenced by its minimal polarization voltage of approximately 65 mV and consistent cycling performance for a duration of 1000 h with negligible fluctuations (<xref rid="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>h).</p><fig position="anchor" id="nanomaterials-15-00554-f005"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effects of different organic components on lithium metal batteries and SEI synthesis diagram.

Swastik [<xref rid="B106-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] has reported unconventional advancements in the transport capability of lithium ions and mechanical stability within amorphous structures of crucial sub-SEI components, such as LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, using first-principles calculations. The density functional theory based on first principles was employed by Xu et al. [<xref rid="B116-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of artificial SEIs composed of lithium halides (LiF, LiCl, LiBr, LiI). The surfaces were examined for the adsorption and migration behavior of lithium ions while analyzing and comparing the structural stability, mechanical properties, and electronic insulation properties of the SEIs. Furthermore, a study was conducted on the adsorption and migration behavior of lithium ions on these surfaces. Ultimately, it was observed that among these films, LiF exhibited exceptional stability in both body and surface structures. It also demonstrates a stable interphase structure with lithium metal, along with superior mechanical properties, electronic insulation capabilities, and inhibition potential against lithium dendrite growth. Consequently, it can be concluded that LiF serves as an ideal artificial SEI for applications involving lithium metal. Many current studies [<xref rid="B117-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] on artificial SEIs contain LiF components, which shows the importance of LiF. However, Xu et al. [<xref rid="B118-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] developed an interphase of the SEI dominated by inorganic CsFSI without LiF, further proving that LiF is not necessary for an artificial SEI. Hobold [<xref rid="B119-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] also compared two SEIs containing Li<sub>2</sub>O and LiF under certain conditions and found that the SEI containing Li<sub>2</sub>O showed better battery performance.

This offers a promising approach towards the real-world implementation of lithium metal batteries with enhanced efficiency and an extended lifespan. In the lithium symmetric batteries, the power time can exceed 1000 h at different current densities.</p><p>Deng et al. [<xref rid="B132-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] prepared the YF3-doped PAN-based carbon nanofibers (YF3-PAN-CNFs) using a one-step method for lithium metal batteries for the first time. The as-prepared porous CNFs (PCNFs) possess a complex network structure, which promotes infiltration of the liquid electrolyte. As a result, it not only greatly enhances the compatibility between the separator and anode when the coated side is in close proximity to the LMAs but also facilitates the swift transmission of lithium ions and electrons. In addition, the vertical and horizontal twists of the internal pores caused by the disordered arrangement of fibers extend the growth channel of lithium dendrites to a certain extent, avoiding direct piercing of the separator. Moreover, the doped YF3 can provide abundant chemically active sites, and thus the reaction kinetics can be accelerated effectively. As a result, the utilization of a PAN-based CNF-modified separator led to an increase in the cycle time of the symmetrical battery. Moreover, it consistently exhibited a diminished overpotential throughout the 500 h cycles. It is important to mention that YF3-PAN-1 and YF3-PAN-2 (YF3-PAN-1 and YF3-PAN-1 were named according to different experimental methods) demonstrated a voltage distribution pattern similar to that of the PAN-based CNF-modified separator. However, their voltage polarization amplitudes were comparatively smaller than that of the pure PAN-based CNF-modified separator. These findings imply that by applying a layer of CNFs coating on the separator, there is a notable expansion in the growth channel for lithium dendrites and a reduced likelihood of puncturing caused by these dendrites [<xref rid="B138-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>].</p><p>Li et al.

As the reaction proceeds at the core&#x02013;shell boundary, the reacted core generates a tensile circumference direction stress on the shell surface, which may cause cracks on the material surface and affect the cyclic stability of the battery. In contrast, the process of lithium under diffusion-controlled mechanisms, such as those observed in amorphous silicon and magnesium, where the diffusion of lithium ions forms a progressive concentration gradient without forming sharp phase boundaries, usually produces circumferent compressive stresses at the surface, a mechanism that helps maintain the structural integrity of the material. Therefore, depending on the lithium dynamics of the negative electrode material, the stress caused by diffusion can be significantly different, thereby determining the mechanical stability of the material. In recent years, based on these principles, researchers have devoted themselves to developing new negative electrode materials and design strategies (i.e., alloyed SEI) to optimize the stress distribution during the lithium process, improve the safety and cycle stability of the battery, and use advanced characterization techniques and computational simulations to better understand the mechanical behavior of the material and predict and control the stress changes during the battery charging and discharging processes.

However, whether LiF actually contributes to the formation of an effective SEI has been questioned by other studies and needs further verification [<xref rid="B83-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Many studies have shown that SEIs containing LiF have excellent ion transport capabilities and enhance the conductivity of lithium ions, but there are still few studies on whether LiF really plays a role, and further verification is needed. For organic/inorganic composite SEI, its performance exceeds that of a single inorganic or organic layer. This SEI dynamically combines the respective advantages of inorganic and organic protective layers while avoiding their disadvantages. This composite structure not only improves the mechanical properties of the interphase but also enhances the inhibition effect on lithium dendrites, thus significantly improving the cycle performance and stability of the battery. The key research mechanism is the transport effect of lithium ions and insulation performance of the electronic tunnel. For the alloy SEI, the SEI lithium mainly focuses on the in situ reaction to form the alloy layer. Compared with other types of SEI films, the production process is relatively simple, and the main performance advantage lies in the high mechanical strength achieved by utilizing defects in the alloy layer. Some metals have certain solubility in lithium metal and react easily to form solid solutions. The surface layers of these solid solutions have a high degree of matching with the crystal structure of lithium metal, which provides a buffer effect for subsequent lithium deposition and effectively reduces the nucleation barrier. It also provides a fast lithium-ion transport channel, which can effectively guide the uniform deposition of lithium metal.

In the aspect of computational simulation, MD simulation and DFT [<xref rid="B163-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,<xref rid="B164-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] calculations are used to study the interaction between lithium ions and electrolyte molecules, the reaction process, and the growth mechanism of SEI from the atomic scale and to predict its stability and composition. (b) Explore novel inorganic, organic, and composite SEI materials to further improve the performance and safety of LMBs. Inorganic materials such as LiF [<xref rid="B165-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>] and metal phosphates can enhance the mechanical stability and chemical inertness of SEI and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. Organic materials such as fluorine-containing organics and polymers can improve the flexibility and ionic conductivity of SEI and reduce the transmission impedance. Composite materials can comprehensively improve the performance of SEI by combining the advantages of inorganic and organic materials, such as multi-layer structure design or nanocomposite technology. (c) Optimize the electrolyte additives and solvents to achieve a more stable SEI. In terms of additives, such as composite additives of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and BSTFA, they can balance the organic and inorganic components of SEI, inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites, and improve battery performance [<xref rid="B166-nanomaterials-15-00554" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. In terms of solvents, selecting a suitable solvent system, such as a solvent containing siloxane, can form an SEI rich in organic components, reduce the transmission and desolvation impedance, and improve the low-temperature performance of the battery. At the same time, the comprehensive performance of SEI can be further improved by optimizing the combination of additives and solvents. (d) By combining the mathematical models with the experimental results, continuously optimize the models to better predict the performance of actual battery systems. Firstly, based on the battery characteristics and application scenarios (such as accuracy requirements or real-time requirements), the adaptation model (such as the electrochemical model to analyze the microscopic mechanism and the equivalent circuit model for real-time control) is selected. After evaluating the predictive ability of the model through cross-validation and independent testing, the parameters and structure are iteratively optimized by combining sensitivity analysis and a multi-objective optimization algorithm. The verified model is embedded into the battery management system (BMS) or digital twin platform to realize performance prediction and safety control. Finally, the actual operation data are collected by sensors to form a dynamic closed loop of &#x02019;deployment&#x02013;feedback&#x02013;calibration&#x02019;, which continuously improves the applicability and reliability of the model under complex working conditions. (e) Employ the AI and machine learning technology to monitor and manage battery status in real time and extend battery life. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to monitor and manage battery status in real time can accurately evaluate the battery &#x02019;s state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and remaining useful life (RUL). By analyzing the trend of battery data mode, predicting faults in advance, dynamically adjusting charging strategies and energy distribution, and preventing harmful behaviors such as overcharging and overdischarging, the battery can always work in the best state, thereby prolonging battery life and improving the safety and reliability of the battery system. In addition, it is undeniable that the use of solid electrolytes is one of the effective strategies to solve the problems existing in lithium metal batteries. Therefore, how to establish a reasonable SEI model of solid electrolyte and explore the artificial SEIs that can be used in solid electrolytes will also become one of the future research hotspots. The chemical stability, interface contact change, and microstructure of solid electrolyte will affect the formation, stability, and ion conductivity of SEI. In the next generation of battery chemistry, the changes in new electrolyte materials, electrode materials, and battery chemical systems will also affect the formation and evolution of SEI. These factors work together to determine the interface stability and battery performance.</p><p>In the solid electrolyte system, there are unique challenges in the SEI research of lithium metal batteries: insufficient solid-state interface contact leads to non-uniform growth of SEI and high interface impedance, and the dynamic evolution mechanism (such as chemical compatibility between solid electrolyte and lithium metal, stress-induced ion transport heterogeneity) is not clear; there is a lack of multi-physical field coupling models for solid-state systems (such as interface stress-electrochemical synergistic effect, the effect of solid electrolyte grain boundaries on SEI composition) and cross-scale in situ characterization techniques (such as atomic-scale dynamic observation of solid electrolyte/lithium interface); in addition, the solid-state composite SEI design (such as the synergistic passivation of inorganic solid electrolyte and artificial interface layer) faces problems such as poor mechanical compatibility (interfacial peeling under cyclic volume deformation), high cost of large-scale preparation and insufficient long-term stability verification, which restrict the practical process of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries.</p><p>After considering the impact of SEI performance, the pros and cons of economic trade-offs cannot be ignored. The development of new electrolyte materials or additives to optimize SEI performance may increase the cost of raw materials. For example, the use of new materials such as solid electrolytes or ionic liquids is usually more expensive than traditional liquid electrolytes, which affects the overall manufacturing cost of the battery. In order to form a stable SEI, it may be necessary to improve the manufacturing process of the battery, such as adding pretreatment steps or using special coating technology, which will increase the complexity and cost of the production process. By optimizing the SEI, the cycle stability of the battery can be significantly improved, and the capacity loss during each charge and discharge process can be reduced. For example, in lithium-ion batteries, stable SEI can inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites and reduce the corrosion and pulverization of electrode materials, thereby prolonging the cycle life of the battery and reducing the replacement cost. Although optimizing the SEI may increase the initial investment cost, by significantly extending the battery life, the cost can be shared over the entire life cycle of the battery, thereby improving the economy. For example, in electric vehicles, battery packs using high-performance SEI technology, although more expensive to manufacture, can reduce the frequency of battery replacement and reduce the long-term use cost of users due to their longer cycle life and better performance retention. Different SEI optimization strategies have different cost-effectiveness ratios. For example, the use of some new additives may be less costly and can effectively improve SEI performance, while the development of new solid electrolyte materials may require higher investment and face the challenges of technological maturity and large-scale production. In practical applications, it is necessary to select the appropriate SEI optimization technology according to specific needs and economic conditions to achieve the best balance between cost and performance.</p><p>In summary, the research of SEIs is crucial for improving the performance of LMBs. Through continuous material innovation and theoretical development, we can expect to achieve safer, more stable, and more efficient lithium metal battery technology in the future. With a deeper understanding of the SEI and the application of new materials and modeling techniques, the commercialization and large-scale application of LMBs will no longer be far away.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has increased
significantly with an aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to
exploit the higher total energy conversion efficiency of batteries
than that of internal combustion (IC) engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Commercialized EVs with the current lithium-ion batteries have considerably
lower driving ranges than vehicles with IC engines, and the charging
time for these batteries is excessive when compared to that to fill
a gasoline tank. These serious problems should be solved to realize
the dissemination of EVs. The specific energy density of a gasoline
IC engine for automotive applications is estimated to be around 1700
Wh kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> whereas the
theoretical specific energy density for a lithium-ion battery based
on a carbon anode and a LiCoO<sub>2</sub>-based cathode is as low
as 387 Wh kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The
lithium-ion diffusion constants in Li<sub>0.65</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> and graphite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> are reported to be 9.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 25 &#x000b0;C, respectively, which are several orders
lower than that for aqueous liquid electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the specific power density of a high-capacity
lithium-ion battery is less than 1000 W kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>In this decade, lithium&#x02013;sulfur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and lithium&#x02013;air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> batteries have
been extensively studied as high-energy-density batteries for EVs.
The theoretical energy densities of these batteries are 2567 and 3050
Wh kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively, which are higher than that
of the IC engine. However, even after a decade of research and development,
mass production of these batteries has yet to be realized. Several
problems with respect to the cell chemistry must be addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p><p>Aqueous lithium batteries are attractive candidate for high-energy
and power-density applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Two types of aqueous
lithium batteries have been proposed; one with an aqueous electrolyte
and lithium interaction electrodes developed by Dahn and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and the other with an aqueous cathode and lithium anode separated
by a water-stable lithium-conducting solid electrolyte developed by
Goodenough and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> The former aqueous lithium battery system exhibits high power density;
however, the specific energy density is lower than that of conventional
lithium-ion batteries. The cell proposed by Goodenough and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> consists of a water-stable Li<sub>1+<italic>x</italic></sub>Al<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>Ti<sub>2&#x02013;<italic>x</italic></sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (LATP) separator, a
water soluble redox couple cathode, Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x02013;</sup>/Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>4&#x02013;</sup>, and a lithium anode. This
cell has a theoretical specific energy density of 392 Wh kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which is comparable to that of current lithium-ion batteries. Byon
and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> proposed a similar aqueous
lithium battery with a triiodide/iodide redox couple in an aqueous
cathode that exhibited excellent rate capability, although the theoretical
specific energy density was comparable to that of lithium-ion batteries.
The cell with Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> and
Br<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> exhibited a theoretical
energy density that was twice as high as that of conventional lithium-ion
batteries; however, the stability of the lithium-conducting solid
electrolyte in aqueous electrolytes is questionable. Lithium metal
anodes with liquid cathodes are attractive for the development of
high specific power and energy density rechargeable batteries. We
have recently reported on high specific energy density aqueous lithium
rechargeable batteries with a metal chloride MCl<sub>2</sub> (M =
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) aqueous cathode that have proven to be feasible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Among these cathodes, the Li/CoCl<sub>2</sub> and Li/NiCl<sub>2</sub> couples exhibit successful charge and discharge
performance; the estimated specific energy density of the Li/NiCl<sub>2</sub> couple, determined from the mass of the cell components with
a Li<sub>1.4</sub>Al<sub>0.4</sub>Ge<sub>0.2</sub>Ti<sub>1.4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (LAGTP; 0.1 mm thick) separator, was
670 Wh kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (except the packaging). The charge and
discharge performance of the Li/NiCl<sub>2</sub> cell at a high discharge
depth is investigated here to confirm the high specific energy density
of this system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The Li/NiCl<sub>2</sub> cell was composed of a lithium metal anode,
a Li(FSO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N (LiFSI)-tetraethylene glycol dimethyl
ether (G4) (1:2 molar ratio)-50 vol % 1,3 dioxolane (DOL) interlayer,
LAGTP-3 wt % epoxy resin film, a mixture of saturated NiCl<sub>2</sub> and LiCl aqueous solutions (1:1 v/v), and a Ni metal current collector.
LAGTP was reported to be unstable in contact with lithium metal;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> therefore, (LiFSI-2G4)-50 vol % DOL was used
as the interlayer between the lithium metal anode and LAGTP to prevent
direct contact. The (LiFSI-2G4)-50 vol % DOL electrolyte suppresses
the formation of lithium dendrites during the lithium deposition process
at room temperature and high current density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup></p><p>The stability of the lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte
in
the catholyte is necessary. LATP was reported to be stable in aqueous

3.7. No change of the impedance profiles was observed for three weeks.
The impedance profiles showed a semicircle, which indicates the grain
boundary resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> The total (bulk

then plateau voltages were observed. The capacity of the first plateau
was 4.55 mAh, which corresponds to 93.6% reduction of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni in the catholyte. The second plateau is attributed to the

excellent cyclic performance for 50 cycles. The specific energy density
of conventional lithium-ion batteries is generally dependent on the
area specific capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> However, the Li/NiCl<sub>2</sub> cell showed no dependence of the specific energy density

those calculated for the reduction of Ni<sup>2+</sup> in the catholyte.
This result suggests that the energy density of the practical battery
approaches the calculated energy density because the contribution
of the weight of the nonactive cell components decreases with an increase
in the cell capacity. EV batteries require high power density. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c shows the current

at 90 &#x000b0;C overnight and then LiNO<sub>3</sub>, Al(NO)<sub>3</sub>, and NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (Nakalai Tesque)
were added to the gel. After a homogenous solution was formed, ethylene
glycol was added and the solution was then heated at 200 &#x000b0;C to
allow water to evaporate. The gel was then heated at 580 &#x000b0;C for
4 h. The black-colored product was ground to a fine powder with an
agate mortar and pestle before sintering at 800 &#x000b0;C for 4 h. The
LAGTP powder was dispersed in a mixed solution of ethanol and toluene
with a fish oil dispersant for half a day using a high-speed mechanical

deaired under vacuum. Tape-casting was performed on a silicon-coated
polyethylene substrate foil using double blades with gap heights of
0.7 and 0.4 mm and a constant casting speed of 60 cm min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. After tape-casting, the green tape was slowly dried at 5 &#x000b0;C

and 50 Pa and then sintered at 900 &#x000b0;C for 7 h. The LAGTP&#x02013;epoxy
composite films were prepared by dropping a mixed solution of 1 M
1,3 phenylenediamine and 2 M 2,2-bis(4-glycidyloxyphenyl)propane (0.5:1.0,
molar ratio) in tetrahydrofuran on the surface of the tape-cast LAGTP
film. The LAGTP films (0.4&#x02013;0.2 mm thick) with the epoxy resin
solution were kept under vacuum for 30 h, and the films were dried
at 80 &#x000b0;C for 3 h and then polymerized at 170 &#x000b0;C overnight.
A pouch-type cell with a small amount of catholyte was used for cell
performance tests (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c). The LAGTP&#x02013;epoxy film was enveloped with a surface-modified
polypropylene film. The package was evacuated and heat-sealed, apart
from a 1.2 cm diameter window on the LAGTP&#x02013;epoxy film. The
packed LAGTP film was sandwiched with a thin separator (Toray F16CK2,
0.016 mm in thickness) containing a (LiFSI-2G4)-50 vol % DOL interlayer
and lithium metal (0.2 mm thick, Honjyo Metal, Japan) and enveloped
with an aluminum-laminated film (2,4-dinitrophenol, Japan). These
procedures were performed in an Ar-charged glovebox. A thick separator
(nonwoven film, 0.17 mm thick) containing a saturated NiCl<sub>2</sub> and LiCl aqueous solution (1:1, v/v) was attached to the Li/interlayer/LAGTP&#x02013;epoxy
anode side. XRD data were obtained using a Rigaku RINT 2500 diffractometer
with Cu K&#x003b1; radiation in the 2&#x003b8; range from 10 to 90&#x000b0;
at a scan step rate of 0.02&#x000b0; s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. AC impedance
spectroscopy measurements of the cell were performed using a frequency
response analyzer (Solartron 1260) with an electrochemical interface
(Solartron S1 1287) in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The
cell potentials were measured using a potentio-galvanostat (Biologic
Science Instruments VMPX).</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information

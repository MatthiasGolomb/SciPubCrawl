social enhancement
in environmental consciousness, the secondary chemical power system
developing rapidly and gradually replaced the primary energy system.
Lithium-ion battery (LIB) as the high-energy chemical power source
has been used in a large number of applications in laptop computers,
digital cameras, and other electronic products. However, the commercial
LIB with an organic electrolyte always has several drawbacks such
as safety issue, insufficient lifetime, high cost, and so forth. For
example, the battery internal combustion to explosion is caused by
short-circuit problem, and it has no regular outbreak and unpredictable
happen. The development of all-solid-state thin-film battery with
inflammable solid electrolytes is an important strategy to solve those
problems, in particular, the safety issue. Therefore, the all-solid-state
battery has become an exigent topic for a new generation battery system
with high energy density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The glassy lithium phosphorus
oxynitride (LiPON) ion conductor has been the subject of increasing
interest because of its isotropic ionic conduction, no grain boundaries,
and ease of fabrication as an electrolyte for all-solid-state rechargeable
ion batteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> LiPON has a stable electrochemical
window at potential range from 0 to nearly 5.5 V in contact with metallic
lithium and high conductivity close to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>The all-solid-state
batteries with various cathodes such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> LiCoPO<sub>4</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> and
FePO<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> were widely investigated.
Those cathodes were usually prepared by vacuum deposition techniques
such as sputtering or evaporation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However,
these film cathodes with crystalline or nanocrystalline need further
high-temperature annealing; thus, the typical silicon or stainless
steel substrates were used as an electric collector. Prussian blue
iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) and its analogues (A<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>M[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>&#x000b7;<italic>z</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O, A and M are alkali metal and transition
metal, respectively) have received considerable attention as attractive
cathode materials for LIBs because of their low cost, environmental
friendliness, and easy synthesis process. In addition, the FeHCF cathode
material has a stable open-framework structure and delivers a high
capacity of 195 mA h/g (the specific gravimetric and volumetric energy
density: 624 W&#x000b7;h&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and 1123 W&#x000b7;h&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with an average voltage of 3.2 V).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Previous studies about the electrochemical
activity of FeHCFs in LIBs in nonaqueous electrolyte reported that
their electrochemical properties were strongly dependent on synthesis
methods. For example, Shen et al. reported the electrochemical performances
of cubic FeHCF synthesized by a coprecipitation method as cathode
materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Wu et al. reported high-quality
and high-purity nanocrystal FeHCF electrode by using Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x02013;</sup> as a single iron source for a high-capacity
and long-life LIB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Recently, a high-quality-sized
FeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> as a cathode material for nonaqueous potassium
ion battery was reported in our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> However, there is no available report on the electrochemical characterization
of all-solid-state lithium battery based on Prussian blue LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> cathode because it is very difficult to prepare the thin-film
electrode by vacuum deposition techniques. Here, we report the fabrication
process and electrochemical performance of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li
all-solid-state battery for the first time. All-solid-state cells
are assembled with LiPON film as an electrolyte and metal lithium
film as an anode, and LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> thin film on the aluminum
foil fabricated by coating technology as a cathode. The nonvacuum
coating technology is employed for cathode film fabrication from the
perspective of large-scale preparation of current LIBs with liquid
electrolyte. Our purpose is to examine the electrochemical feature
of a novel all-solid-state LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li battery
system as well as to explore the new assembling methods for all-solid-state
battery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a shows

mode, respectively, indicating the existence of crystal water in the
open-framework structure of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>. This is further
proved with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) result, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c, in which a negative
peak of differential thermal analysis (DTA) curve at 97.65 &#x000b0;C
represents the loss of crystal water (18.76 wt %). In addition, two

of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> with Fe sites as the active redox center,
which can be provided

the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode in 1.0 mol/L LiPF<sub>6</sub>-ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) electrolyte between
a voltage range of 1.5 and 4.0 V and at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s. In
the first charging process, a large peak appears at 3.82 V, indicating
the deintercalation process of Li<sup>+</sup> from the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode. In subsequent scans, the main features in the
CV curves exhibit two pairs of well-defined symmetric redox peaks
at 3.82/3.73 V and 3.07/2.98 V. These peaks should correspond to the
oxidation&#x02013;reduction of the low spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> couple coordinated to the C atoms and the high spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> couple coordinated to the N atoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The intensities and shapes of these two pairs
of CV peaks were maintained in the subsequent cycles, indicating a
highly reversible and stable oxidation&#x02013;reduction process of
the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> cathode. If compared with CV curves of
FeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> the
shapes of the redox peaks at 3.82/3.73 V are sharper and more symmetrical
and their relative intensities to the redox peaks at 3.07/2.98 V are
larger than those of FeHCF electrodes. This result suggests that the
LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode exhibits a well electrochemical activity
than that of the FeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode. The occupation of
Li in the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode may help the structural
stability of its framework to ensure the high electrochemical activity
of the high spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> couple. It should
be noted that LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> as a lithium-contained Prussian
blue electrode could exhibit a well electrochemical performance.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) First

was calculated based on the first discharge capacity) are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b. The initial charge
process delivers a specific capacity of 90 mA h/g, which is close
to one Li<sup>+</sup> extracted from LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, whereas
the first discharge capacity reaches to 142 mA h/g and two voltage
plateaus at around 3.76 and 3.10 V can be observed clearly, exhibiting
a two-electron redox process. The charge/discharge curves can almost
overlap without any polarization in the subsequent processes, and
voltage profiles are in good agreement with the CV data.</p><p>The
well cyclic performance of the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode
is also clearly seen from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c. After 200 cycles at 0.5 C, the electrode still retains
a discharge capacity of 120 mA h/g and the Coulombic efficiencies
from the second cycle can maintain a high level of nearly 100%. Besides,
the capacity fade is calculated to be 0.1% for per cycle after 200
charge/discharge cycles. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>d shows good rate performance of the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode, in which the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode
delivers discharge capacities of 142, 135, and 96 mA h/g at 0.5, 1,
and 20 C, respectively. Such a good electrochemical cyclic and rate
performances should be related to large interstitial sites that allow
fast insertion/extraction of Li ions in the open-framework crystal
structure of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>. It seems that water molecules
tend to a stable structure of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> with a lower
water content. If the as-prepared LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> material
is dried in a vacuum oven over 150 &#x000b0;C to remove the crystal water,
it resulted in the low discharge capacities less than 70 mA h/g, and
low Coulombic efficiency, and electrochemical performance deterioration
for LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode in 1.0 mol/L LiPF<sub>6</sub>-EC/DEC electrolyte. It should be noted that the discharge capacities
from lower plateaus (3.25&#x02013;1.5 V) are&#x000a0;94, 93, and 87 mA
h/g at 0.5, 1, and 20 C, respectively. The capacities from the lower
plateaus due to the high spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> are
not changed by increasing currents, and the main capacity loss at
higher rates should be attributed to the higher plateaus with the
low spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup>. It indicates that the oxidation&#x02013;reduction
of the low spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> is kinetically limited
and is strongly depend on the current rates from 0.5 to 20 C.</p><p>In order to investigate the structural modification of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode during electrochemical process, ex situ XRD at
charge and discharge states is carried out and is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>. It could be found
that all of these diffraction patterns exhibit a typical face-centered
cubic structure, whereas the shift of the diffraction peaks from (200)
and (400) is observed clearly. The cubic lattice parameters were calculated
as <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> = 10.20 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x000c5;, 10.17
&#x000b1; 0.01 &#x000c5;, and 10.23 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x000c5; for the pristine
and the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode after the charging to 4.0
V and discharging to 1.5 V, respectively. It means that the parameter <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> decreases after charge and increases after
discharge process. The unit-cell volume changes of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> after the full delithiation are ca. 0.88%. Such a negligible
volume change during the charge/discharge processes of the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> cathode is very attractive to all solid-state thin-film batteries.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Ex situ

curves of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li are examined at 10 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 60 &#x000b0;C. The open-circuit voltage lies at 2.6 V. The
charge and discharge profiles include a slope region from 3.4 to 4.0
V for the first cycle and a corresponding slope region from 2.8 to
1.5 V in the second cycle, respectively. In the subsequent cycles,
the charge and discharge curves differ considerably from the first
cycle and both the charge/discharge voltage increases during the activation
process of electrode. Apparently, one plateau on the charge and discharge
processes appears in the all-solid-state battery, whereas two plateaus
in the liquid electrolyte are observed, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b. The higher plateau at 3.8
V in liquid electrolyte disappears in the solid-state electrolyte
because of the slow kinetic oxidation&#x02013;reduction of the low
spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and this will result in the
lower discharge capacity in solid-state electrolyte than that in liquid
electrolyte. This difference should be associated with the different
interfaces between the electrode&#x02013;liquid electrolyte and the
electrode&#x02013;solid electrolyte. The closer contact at the solid&#x02013;solid
interface with lower interfacial resistance should be needed to improve
the capacity of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li in the future work.
The discharge capacities of 61.5, 60.5, and 82.5 mA h/g are obtained,
respectively, in the first, second, and third cycles. Afterward, the
cycling becomes more and more stable, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b. The discharge capacities
of the 50th, 100th, and 200th cycles are 53, 52, and 51 mA h/g, respectively,

found
to be dependent on the ambient temperature and current density. As
shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>,
at the room temperature, the all-solid-state cell only delivers a
capacity of 54.5 mA h/g at the current density of 10 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. The discharge capacity could be increased to 73.3 mA h/g
at a current density of 10 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. The discharge
polarization of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li battery obviously
increases at a larger current density of 20 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 50 &#x000b0;C, which results the reduced discharge capacity of 66.0
mA h/g. When the temperature is increasing, the capacity of solid-state
battery increases at the current density of 20 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. When the temperature is increased to 60, 70, and 80 &#x000b0;C, higher
discharge capacities of 76.4, 81.6, and 85.1 mA h/g are obtained.
This indicates the utilization of about 90% of the active material
in the thickness of about 16 &#x003bc;m if one Li<sup>+</sup> is deintercalated
from LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> in all-solid-state cell. These results
suggest that LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li battery could work at
80 &#x000b0;C and the high temperature is beneficial in the improvement
of the capacity of solid-state battery.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Galvanostatic discharge/charge

a very important point of concern. Such an all-solid-state battery

of the cell sharply increases when the working temperature is decreased
to &#x02212;30 &#x000b0;C, indicating that the internal resistance of
all-solid-state battery rises at low temperature. The discharge capacity
of the cell significantly decreases, and the discharge capacity of
0.056 mA h (0.8 mA h/g) even at 0.1 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> is obtained
for the second cycle; this value is almost 2 orders of magnitude smaller
than the specific discharge capacity of 54.5 mA h/g delivered at room
temperature at the 10 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. These measurements
can carry out up to 40 cycles with a capacity loss of less than 2.0%

of the LiPON electrolyte film could be obtained from an ac impedance
measurement of the Au/LiPON/Au sandwich structure on a glass substrate,
and this type of sandwich structure has been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> According to the following equation<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao-2018-011023_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula>where <italic>d</italic> is the film thickness, <italic>A</italic> is the area of the Al contact, and <italic>R</italic> is

is calculated to be 8 and 250 &#x003a9; at the room temperature and
&#x02212;30 &#x000b0;C, respectively. Apparently, a low ion conductivity
at &#x02212;30 &#x000b0;C is not the origin of the limited discharge capacity
of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li battery at low temperature. The
interfaces impedance between LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON and LiPON/Li
as well as the slow diffusion of Li ion in LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> at
low temperature should mainly be responsible for the kinetics limitation
of the all-solid-state cell.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>ac impedance spectra of (a) Au/LiPON/Au and

all-solid-state thin-film batteries. The electrochemical feature of
LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li battery with 16 &#x003bc;m cathode layer
was presented at measured temperatures from 80 to &#x02212;30 &#x000b0;C.
In the liquid cell, two pairs of well-defined symmetric redox peaks
at 3.82/3.73 V and 3.07/2.98 V were clearly observed in the CV curves
of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode. The discharge/charge curves of
LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li are different from those of the LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPF<sub>6</sub>/Li liquid battery. The higher plateau at
3.8 V in liquid electrolyte disappears in solid-state electrolyte
because of the slow kinetic oxidation&#x02013;reduction of the low
spin Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup>. The cell could exhibit a discharge
capacity of 51 mA h/g after 200 cycles at 10 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. Our results have demonstrated the feasibility to assemble an all-solid-state
LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub>/LiPON/Li battery by a nonvacuum coating technology
for the cathode film, which is very important for grid-scale batteries
because of high energy density, low cost raw materials, and an environmentally
friendly process.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Synthesis of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> Powder</title><p>LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> powder was synthesized
by simple aqueous reaction, 50 mL
(0.05 mol/L) of Na<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> aqueous solution
was slowly added to 100 mL (0.1 mol/L) of FeCl<sub>2</sub> solution
under the magnetic string and maintained for 6 h under 60 &#x000b0;C.
The precipitate was soaked in excess LiCl solution and then was washed
with deionized water. The molar concentration ratios of Na/Fe in these
precipitates after each wash were examined by inductively coupled
plasma emission spectroscopy (P-4010, Hitachi Co., Japan). All Na
have been replaced with Li when the content of Na decreased from 1
to 0 during soaking and washing processes. Then, the green precipitate
of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> was collected by centrifugation and washed
with deionized water several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 80
&#x000b0;C overnight.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Characterization of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> Powder</title><p>The
TGA/DTA (SDT Q600) was conducted in the temperature range from 20

H<sub>2</sub>O molecules in the as-prepared LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> material. The structure of pristine powder was examined by XRD (Bruker
D8 ADVANCE, Germany) using Cu K&#x003b1; radiation (&#x003bb; = 0.1541

measured with a SEM (Cambridge S-360). FTIR spectra were recorded
on a Nicolet Nexus-470 spectrometer. The structure evolution of LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> cathode after initial charge/discharge process was also measured
by ex situ XRD. The electrochemical cell was disassembled in the glovebox,
and the electrode was washed by DEC three times to remove the residual
electrolyte and salt.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Assembling of Liquid Cell</title><p>Active

were prepared by coating the slurry onto an aluminum foil and drying
in vacuum. The area mass loading of the electrode was approximately
2.3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. A conventional coin cell was constructed in
an argon ambient filled in the glovebox with LiFeFe(CN)<sub>6</sub> electrode as the cathode and one sheet of high-purity lithium foil
as the anode. LiPF<sub>6</sub> (1 M) in nonaqueous EC/DEC (1:1) was
used as a liquid electrolyte.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Fabrication of All-Solid-State

cycles were carried out from &#x02212;30 to 80 &#x000b0;C with a Land
CT 2001A battery system. CV and ac impedance tests were performed
on a CHI660A electrochemical working station (CHI instruments, TN).
ac impedance spectra measurements were examined in the frequency range
from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an ac perturbation of 5 mV/s. The current
densities and capacities of electrodes were calculated based on the
weight of active materials.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="" id="notes1"><title>Author Contributions</title><p><sup>&#x000a7;</sup> D.-R.S. and J.F. contributed equally to this work.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="notes2"><p>The authors

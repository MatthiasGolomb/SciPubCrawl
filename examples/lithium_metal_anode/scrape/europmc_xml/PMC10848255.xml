efficient
approach to enhancing the cycling performance of lithium metal batteries.
Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>) is a popular electrolyte
salt. Mechanistic insights into its degradation pathways near the
lithium metal anode are critical in modifying the battery electrolyte
and SEI. In this work, we elucidate plausible reaction pathways in
multiple representative electrolyte systems. Through ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations, lithiation and electron transfer are identified
as the triggering factors for LiPF<sub>6</sub> degradation. Meanwhile,
we find that lithium morphology and charge distribution substantially
impact the interfacial dissociation pathways. Thermodynamic evaluation
of the solvation effects shows that higher electrolyte dielectric
constant and lithiation extent profoundly assist the LiPF<sub>6</sub> decomposition. These findings offer quantitative thermodynamic and
electronic structure information, which promotes rational SEI engineering
and electrolyte tuning for lithium metal anode performance enhancement.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000015</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11357</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>jp2c07838</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>jp2c07838</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current commercially available lithium-ion
batteries are approaching
their theoretical limits, while the electronics market still urges
further energy capacity extension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The
lithium metal battery (LMB) is a promising technical route for next-generation
energy storage devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The cycling efficiency
and safety risk control on the battery anode are the primary technical
obstacles that hinder LMB commercialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the anode surface regulates
Li<sup>+</sup> ion migration and deposition, which is critical in
minimizing lithium dendrite and whisker formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Therefore, the battery&#x02019;s electrochemical performance
is tightly bonded with SEI morphology and composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Fluorination has been suggested as an efficient strategy
in battery
electrolytes and SEI engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> The
fluorine-containing electrolyte components, such as LiPF<sub>6</sub>, lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), and fluoroethylene carbonate
(FEC), experience decomposition and yield lithium fluoride nanoparticles
in SEI. However, the SEI internal structures are notoriously complex
to resolve due to their fragility and chemical reactiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> So far, only limited while expensive techniques
such as cryo-electron microscopy are able to precisely probe the spatial
distributions of SEI nanostructures, where battery disassembly is
mandatory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In addition, the electrolyte
species also alter the solvation environment, which profoundly impacts
the thermochemistry and kinetics of SEI formation reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Aside from the designing principles based on empirical concepts,
theoretical approaches are expected to envision the electrolyte&#x02013;electrode
interfacial chemistry and ion transport mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Hereby, we study the reactions resulting in prevalent
inorganic components in SEI from LiPF<sub>6</sub>-based electrolytes.
The quantitative understanding of the reaction thermodynamics may
enable future multiscale simulations of the SEI formation processes.</p><p>It is inherently challenging to characterize the electrode&#x02013;electrolyte
interfacial chemistry at the nanoscale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> The SEI grows in such a highly reductive and salty environment.
Despite limited experimental data available to precisely elucidate
the SEI composition and formation mechanisms, many proposals depict
plausible scenarios in generating SEI of LMB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Hexafluorophosphate
degradation is recognized as the primary contributor to the LiF in
SEI based on this electrolyte chemistry, while few reports denote
the destination of phosphorus. A trace amount of moisture in battery
electrolyte can cause hydrolysis of PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>, yielding POF<sub>3</sub> and its derivatives as detected in spectroscopic
analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Further information regarding the direct
PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> decomposition and reduction without
water participation is less reported in the experimental work. The
characterization of interfacial chemistry is particularly challenging
in accessing delicate nanoscale surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> First principles simulation is compelling in predicting the molecular
behavior at the metal&#x02013;liquid interface, which is fragile to
atmospheric interruptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) successfully predicts the stabilities and
reductive dissociation of electrolyte solvents near metallic surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup></p><p>The LiPF<sub>6</sub> degradation chemistry near the anode
shows
unique features. The phosphorous element usually demonstrates a singlet
electronic state in stable compounds. However, some reported atomic
charge analysis on the AIMD simulation shows that this rule may not
apply to all cases in the LiPF<sub>6</sub> decomposition near lithium
battery anode surfaces. Martinez de la Hoz et al. identified the plausible
oxidation state pathway on the silicone anode surface, where the equilibrium
charge state of phosphorous was identified to be &#x02212;1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> A fully reduced phosphorous reduction product
was found in the lithium metal case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Both
these scenarios require continuous electron uptake.</p><p>Ether-based
electrolytes are mainly composed of dimethoxyethane
(DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), with moderate dielectric constants
(&#x003b5;) varying from 4 to 10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> High
salt concentration is mandatory in maintaining the integrity of ether
solvents in high voltages, despite their compatibility with lithium
metal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> The commonly used carbonate solvents, including
ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and vinylene carbonate
(VC), create a solvation environment with much higher dielectric constants
and unique solvation structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> In the
electrolyte environment with a positive dielectric constant, the direct
electron tunneling probability decays exponentially with respect to
particle&#x02013;metal-surface distance. Consequently, electron-induced
reactions usually occur via complex charge transport mechanisms that
manipulate the corresponding redox reaction rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> The ion&#x02013;solvent interactions are one of the most
important factors in bottom-up LMB development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> The beginning stages of phase separation and ionic nucleation
in forming SEI have been reported in previous molecular dynamics (MD)
and AIMD studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> A longer simulation time scale may compensate for
this issue by implementing high-quality ab initio thermodynamic information
in kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Beyond elucidating the underlying chemical processes, we aim to
contribute toward data-driven LMB electrolyte and SEI engineering
from the electrolyte solvation and anode morphology perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Computational Methods</title><p>After creating a vacuum slab

(1) close contact to the Li metal surface and (2) dissolved in electrolyte
while the mass center is at least 5 &#x000c5; away from the lithium surface.
The molar ratios of each species and the system density were further
assessed to be consistent with the experimental macroscopic properties.

exists at the first P&#x02013;F cleavage process. However, the real

As an example of the complexity of interfacial reactions, it has been
reported that the solvent&#x02013;reactant interactions at the air&#x02013;liquid
interface can profoundly alter the reaction thermodynamic profile,
and such impact varies under different dielectric environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Similarly, many factors, including metal&#x02013;electrolyte
interfacial effects, solvation effects, charge transport, and lithium

Here, we apply AIMD simulations to elucidate the interfacial decomposition
reactions and further quantitatively evaluate the key conditions at
the molecular level.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Lithiation and Electron-Tunneling-Induced Salt Degradation</title><p>We perform AIMD simulations to reveal the ultrafast decomposition
of LiPF<sub>6</sub> in different electrolyte systems. The initial
configuration contained PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> structures
with different lithium coordination degrees and distances to the lithium
metal surface. The time scale required for salt degradation varies
in different solvation environments. In the cyclic carbonate-solvated
system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>),
the PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> structures close to the lithium
metal surface easily decompose within 2 ps of simulation time. Following
such an event, the EC and VC structures disintegrate into carbonyl/carbon
monoxide and ethylene di-carbonate (EDC). The solvent degradation
pathways have been investigated in many systematic works.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> In addition to the complete degradation at the electrolyte&#x02013;metal
interface, we also observe the partial dissociation phenomenon of
[Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>+</sup> complex, which is located
15 &#x000c5; from the lithium metal surface and 8 &#x000c5; from the top
periodic boundary of the <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> plane in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> (blue-circled). Such a process is reproducible in other solvent
systems, such as DME-DOL. The rearranged structure resembles a seesaw-shaped
PF<sub>4</sub> coordinated with a rhombic Li<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> complex. Throughout the P&#x02013;F cleavage and rearrangement processes,
chronological Bader charge analysis (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07838/suppl_file/jp2c07838_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link> for details) indicates no charge variation occurring on
neighbor electrolyte species or He; only Li and PF<sub>6</sub> clusters
are involved in the charge transport without direct contact. Therefore,
we suggest that such charge transfer-driven partial decomposition
may be caused by electron tunneling from lithium metal to the dual-lithiated
cation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>AIMD simulation of LiPF<sub>6</sub> decomposition on and near lithium

on the dual-lithium

Specifically, in the comparable configuration without extra &#x0201c;free&#x0201d;

not occur in the corresponding AIMD simulations. With dual lithiation,
the P&#x02013;F cleavage ceases after the [Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cluster receives an electron from Li metal and becomes
negatively charged. We also compute Li<sup>+</sup> affinity energetics
of different electrolyte species (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07838/suppl_file/jp2c07838_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>) and find that the lithiation free energies for the formation of
[Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and [solvent-Li]<sup>+</sup> adduct are close to each other. Therefore, the population ratio
of [Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cluster is equivalent
to that of the solvated Li<sup>+</sup> in concentrated electrolytes.
The [Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>+</sup> partial decomposition
depicted above should be a non-negligible event during LMB fabrication.</p><p>We further analyze the Li-coordination&#x02019;s impacts on the
electronic structure of [PF<sub>6</sub>]<italic><sup>x</sup></italic> species. Previous studies have shown that lithiation reconstructs
common electrolyte solvent molecules&#x02019; HOMO and LUMO structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> As suggested in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a,b, P&#x02013;F bonding has strong covalency in PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> anion and neutral LiPF<sub>6</sub> molecule,
while the bond length is slightly extended due to the lithium coordination.
When two lithium atoms are coordinated, some particular P&#x02013;F
bonds demonstrate ionic properties, as the electronic Laplacian planar
plot indicates. The P&#x02013;F distance (dashed bonds in 2d and 2e)
also extends from 1.7 to 2.0 &#x000c5;. Meanwhile, it is interesting
to notice that the Li&#x02013;P interaction shows positive Laplacian
in the anionic cluster, suggesting covalent interactions between Li
and P atoms, unlike the ionic Li&#x02013;F cases. Therefore, high-level

of the two anionic [Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> structures, the partial charges of Li<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> moieties
are generally neutral while the rest of the PF<sub>4</sub> substructures
occupy most of the negative charge density (&#x02212;0.83 and &#x02212;0.87,
respectively). Current computing power limits AIMD from probing the
final chemical forms of the partially dissociated [Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<italic><sup>x</sup></italic> cluster. Over a longer time
scale, such species may either (a) join undissociated PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> anions and serve as ionic carriers in liquid
electrolyte or (b) further decompose and become part of SEI. The close&#x02013;shell
[PF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion generated from Li1-F3 cleavage
has a smaller diameter than the unreacted [PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and is thus expected to have a higher diffusion coefficient. From
the battery electrolyte and SEI engineering perspective, the PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> partial degradation near the anode material
can lead to electrolyte ionic conductivity properties that differentiate
from the direct measurement of pure LiPF<sub>6</sub> solution. Meanwhile,
the electrolyte dielectric constant not only impacts the solvation
of ionic species but also influences the electron transport rate from
the metallic surface, determining the quantities of corresponding
products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> For instance, it requires less than 1 ps
in ether electrolytes (lower &#x003b5;) to obtain the metastable [Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> structure, while the equivalent
process takes more than 2 ps in the carbonate system (higher &#x003b5;).
The Bader charge analysis of both systems (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07838/suppl_file/jp2c07838_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>) further confirms that such reductive dissociation results
in significant charge variations on the lithium metal surface. Therefore,
future LMB development could also benefit from the real-time analysis
of electrolyte composition in working conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Lithium Metal Surface Morphology</title><p>The lithium surface

mechanistic correlation with the regional metal surface structure.</p><p>We perform AIMD simulations on hexafluorophosphate species with
different initial lithiation statuses. Background charge of opposite
sign is applied to PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>-containing slabs
(a) and (b) as no counter ion is included. Bader charge analysis of
the initial configurations shows that the PF<sub>6</sub> clusters
in both cases have &#x02212;1.1 e equivalent charges, while lithium
atoms representing bulk structures are generally neutral. Comparing <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a&#x02013;c,b&#x02013;d,
charge-neutral LiPF<sub>6</sub> demonstrates faster interfacial adsorption
and dissociation than PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> anion in equivalent
Li facets. Mulliken charge analysis shows that lithium coordination
&#x0201c;pushes&#x0201d; electron density to the fluorine atoms on the
opposite side. In other words, the bare fluorine atoms are more electronegative
than the Li-coordinated ones in a hexafluorophosphate cluster. The
uneven internal charge distribution of LiPF<sub>6</sub> is mainly
responsible for the increased degradation rate.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Energy profile of the

equilibrium, the
hexafluorophosphate dissociation on Li(110) is slightly faster than
that on Li(100), which has longer Li&#x02013;Li distances. The first
significant energy relaxation is a consequence of the hexafluorophosphate
adsorption to the metal interface. Anionic hexafluorophosphate species
can form more than four binding sites with the lithium metal surfaces
before dissociation. When PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> approaches
the Li(100) surface, five F atoms simultaneously coordinate with neighboring
Li atoms in 1 ps. PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> maintains its
geometric integrity longer until adsorbing to the Li(110) facet after
approximately 3.5 ps. Comparatively, the charge-neutral LiPF<sub>6</sub> allows three fluorine atoms to bind with interfacial Li atoms upon
adsorption. Thus, given the impact of salt concentration and solvent
chemistry on the electrolyte structure at the Li metal/electrolyte
interface, we expect that the observed significant chemical difference
in the interactions of the anion with the surface highlighted here
would influence the SEI properties derived from each electrolyte.</p><p>The differences in adsorption patterns result in the facet-dependency
of fluorophosphate decomposition pathways. In Li(100) configurations,
anionic PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> experiences one-by-one sequential
P&#x02013;F bond cleavages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a), while two fluorine atoms simultaneously cleave
from the LiPF<sub>6</sub> structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). A similar two-atom dissociation happens
to PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> on Li(110) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b), while three fluoride anions
leave the phosphorous center of LiPF<sub>6</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d). It is worth noting that
at least two Li atoms are coordinated with the dissociated F atom
in all of the dissociation events.</p><p>Based on our findings, anode
metal surface modifications could
be a rational strategy in SEI engineering. The Li&#x02013;Li distances
and surface charge distributions profoundly influence the SEI growing
rate. Therefore, delicate modifications, including doping and chemical
pretreatment, may tune the SEI to ideal structures and functional
performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup></p><p>Combined with the
electronic structure evidence in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="other">Introduction</xref> section, we can conclude that hexafluorophosphate
degradation requires multiple (at least three) lithium coordinations
to fluorine atoms. The semi-covalent Li&#x02013;P interaction destabilizes
P&#x02013;F bonds and induces further charge transfer from nearby electron-rich
lithium atoms. The accumulated negative charges further result in
P&#x02013;F bond cleavages. We compute the energy profile at the molecular
level to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of lithiation and solvation
in the decomposition pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Hexafluorophosphate Degradation Pathway and Solvation&#x02019;s
Role in Thermodynamic Profiles</title><p>To further understand the

The Bader charge analysis of key time points in hexafluorophosphate

bond cleavages: (1) lithium coordination; (2) [PF<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>]<sup><italic>y</italic>&#x02212;</sup> cluster receives
external electron(s). Based on these criteria, we propose a plausible
reaction mechanism that includes electron uptake followed by P&#x02013;F
bond cleavage. We also investigate the lithium bonding&#x02019;s thermodynamic
role in such processes. In addition to the implicit SMD model, which
mimics the DME-DOL electrolyte (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>), we also obtain the free energy surface of the identical
reaction pathway in higher dielectric constant and in gas-phase conditions
shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07838/suppl_file/jp2c07838_si_001.pdf">Figures S3</ext-link> in the SI. Such a thermodynamic
analysis of the primary SEI fluorination reaction in different solvation
environments benefits a quantitative understanding of the reaction
pathway and promotes rational electrolyte tuning in future work.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Free energy

reactions,
the relative energetics of each species are calculated with respect
to LiPF<sub>6</sub>, Li<sup>+</sup>, Li(0), and F<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). This
method provides rich information in understanding the stepwise energy
barriers while being conservative in evaluating the exergonicity and
exothermicity, especially when the generated particles embed into
the solid surface. The largest free energy uphill is found at the
electron-receiving step in forming the closed-shell PF<sub>4</sub> structures. Lithiation does not show any thermodynamic assistance
in this step, while the thermochemistry is particularly favorable
in the later reaction stages when more lithium cations bind with the
intermediates. This is consistent with the AIMD finding that the dissociation
progress is significantly faster after two P&#x02013;F bonds are cleaved. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> shows that the nonlithiated
pathway is unfeasible in the medium-dielectric environment, and the
singly lithiated one is reluctant to proceed. The thermochemistry
is generally favorable when at least two lithium atoms are coordinated.
Therefore, the lithiation of [PF<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>]<sup><italic>y</italic>&#x02212;</sup> intermediate induces charge transfer
and plays an assistive role in P&#x02013;F bond breaking.</p><p>We
find that the transition states for P&#x02013;F cleavages do
not form significant thermodynamic obstacles; the electron uptake
steps hinder the degradation instead. Note that compared with free
energy, the enthalpy change in each stage is generally more positive/less
negative, indicating that the dissociation progress is primarily entropy-driven.
When the decomposition finishes and the initial SEI layer forms, the
entropy reaches a local maximum. Besides the energy increase in generating
the corresponding open-shell [PF<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>]<sup><italic>y</italic>&#x02212;</sup> structures, charge transfer would
be more sophisticated after the metallic surface is passivated.</p><p>We also assess solvation effects&#x02019; role in hexafluorophosphate
degradation. In the gas phase, where the dielectric constant is zero,
the reaction shows a clear increasing trend in the free energy surface
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07838/suppl_file/jp2c07838_si_001.pdf">Figure S6a</ext-link>). Such a pattern is completely
inverted in high-dielectric-constant solvation conditions. As shown
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07838/suppl_file/jp2c07838_si_001.pdf">Figure S6c</ext-link>, with a solvation environment
comparable to the EC&#x02013;VC electrolyte, the energy barrier for
generating PF<sub>4</sub> is significantly lower than that in DME-DOL.
In addition, the following P&#x02013;F dissociation steps are thermodynamically
favorable in all of the lithiation conditions. The free energy uphill
of all steps after generating the low-spin PF<sub>4</sub> species
is significantly lower than the corresponding medium-dielectric scenario.</p><p>The solvation effects play two significant roles in the initial
layer formation reactions of SEI. One is hindering direct electron
tunneling between lithiated hexafluorophosphate species and lithium
metal, and the other is creating a stabilizing solvation shell for
intermediates in salt degradation. Thus, both the ionic conductivities
and viscosity are altered together with the SEI formation kinetics
and morphology when tuning the LMB liquid electrolyte. In the meantime,
because the dissociation reaction rates are strongly correlated with
the dielectric environment, people may rationally design the reagents
for artificial SEI construction to control the ratios and distributions
of different SEI components based on the criteria we present in this
work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This work showcases the complex chemical
interactions among LiPF<sub>6</sub>, electrolyte solvent, and lithium
metal. The hexafluorophosphate
structures that directly contact the Li metal surface easily experience
further lithiation at the electrolyte&#x02013;lithium&#x02013;metal
interface, where electrons are available for further reduction. The
early-stage pathways and reaction rates of such interfacial dissociations
are dependent on the regional lithium metal morphology. According
to the continuum modeling, strong solvation effects and high lithiation
degrees are assistive toward the decomposition thermochemistry. Energy
barriers are flatter in a higher dielectric environment. In the solution
phase, the electrolyte-dissolved hexafluorophosphate species is partially
protected from complete degradation by limited lithiation and charge-transfer
rates. Nonetheless, the dual-lithiated species [Li<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>+</sup> can still be incompletely reduced via electron
tunneling without being adsorbed to the lithium surface. This partial
decomposition is caused by elevated ionicity and destabilized electronic
configurations of P&#x02013;F bonding properties in the reduced and
multilithiated structures.</p><p>The interfacial LiPF<sub>6</sub> degradation
rate is associated
with the porosity and density of the SEI initial layer. Techniques,
including the surface modification for Li(110) facet exposure and
pretreatments using high-dielectric LiPF<sub>6</sub>-containing solutions,
would benefit the formation of a dense LiF layer on lithium metal.
The detailed mechanistic and thermodynamic information can be incorporated
into coarse-grained kMC simulations for the understanding of SEI evolution
processes on a larger time and length scale.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information

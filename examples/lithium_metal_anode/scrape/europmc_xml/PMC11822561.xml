cyclability
of lithium&#x02013;sulfur (Li&#x02013;S) batteries, a combined strategy
is devised and evaluated for high-performance Li&#x02013;S batteries.
It consists of the following steps to reduce the loss of active sulfur
and sulfides migrating in the liquid electrolyte to the anode and
add electrocatalyst groups in the cathode or catholyte: (i) A hollow
porous nanoparticle coating cathode host with a pseudocapacitive PEDOT:PSS
binder that also contributes to trapping polysulfides. (ii) A thin
interlayer of B&#x02013;N-graphene (BNG) nanoplatelets on the above
cathode trapping polysulfides while participating in the electron
transfer and acting as an electrocatalyst, thus ensuring that the
trapped sulfides remain active in the cathode. (iii) Added semiconductor
phthalocyanine VOPc or CoPc to form an electrocatalyst network in
the catholyte, trapping polysulfides and promoting their redox reactions
with Li<sup>+</sup> ions. (iv) Added silk fibroin in the liquid electrolyte,
which also suppresses dendritic growth on the lithium anode. This
strategy is evaluated step-by-step in Li&#x02013;S battery cells characterized
experimentally and in simulations based on a multipore continuum physicochemical
model with adsorption energy data supplied from molecular dynamics
simulations. The thin BNG interlayer sprayed on the cathode proved
a decisive factor in improving cell performance in all cases. A Li&#x02013;S
cell combining features from (i), (ii), and (iv) and with 45 wt %
S in the cathode yields 1372 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at first discharge and 920 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the 100th discharge after a cycling schedule at different C-rates.
A Li&#x02013;S cell combining features from (i), (ii), and (iii) and
with 55 wt % S in the cathode yields 805 and 586 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the first and the 100th discharge, respectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lithium&#x02212;sulfur batteries</kwd><kwd>interlayer</kwd><kwd>silk fibroin</kwd><kwd>catholyte</kwd><kwd>experiments</kwd><kwd>multiscale simulations</kwd><kwd>multipore continuum digital twin

storage devices focuses on improving
key performance indicators (KPIs) closely related to certain application
fields, with electric vehicles (EVs) being the top application priority.
These KPIs are (i) the energy density, aiming to increase the driving
range of EVs and the operating range of portable devices; (ii) the
power density, seeking to fast-charge EVs and other application devices.
Supercapacitors exhibit high power density but still have low energy
density, despite many efforts to tailor the pore size distribution
of electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> and functionalize carbon electrodes
with pseudocapacitive groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Hybrid battery-supercapacitor
devices exhibit relatively good energy density, but their high-power
supercapacitor part comprises only 10&#x02013;15% of the total hybrid
device energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Alternatively, efforts to increase
the power density of Li-ion batteries have been reported by developing
carbonate electrolytes compatible with a hard carbon anode, aiming
at raising the diffusion rate of Li<sup>+</sup> ions in the anode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> to match the good Li<sup>+</sup> ion diffusion
coefficient in the latest high-performance NMC cathodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Li-ion batteries are the main energy storage
devices used for EVs, due to their high energy density, with the latest
NMC batteries reaching 200&#x02013;250 Wh kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> However, Li-ion batteries are reaching their
upper limit with regard to energy density, and research is turning
to alternative battery technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Attempts
to replace lithium ions with cations based on abundant materials,
such as ammonium ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> and zinc ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> have not yielded any higher energy densities so far. Hence,
research for next-generation batteries has been directed to other
cathode materials of high theoretical specific capacity, such as oxygen
and sulfur. Metal-air batteries and fuel cells offer high theoretical
energy density, for example, a theoretical energy density of 11140
Wh/kg<sub>Li</sub> for Li&#x02013;O<sub>2</sub> batteries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> but suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics,
high overpotential, low efficiency, the need for expensive catalysts,
the need for pure oxygen feed without moisture and CO<sub>2</sub>,
and poor cyclability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Additional issues to be resolved
concerning hydrogen fuel cells include green hydrogen production and
the development of relevant safe infrastructure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>The interest in lithium&#x02013;sulfur (Li&#x02013;S)
batteries is
due to their high theoretical energy density, over 2700 Wh kg<sub>electrodes</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, combined with the low cost
and abundance of sulfur as the active cathode material. Considerations
in translating the high specific capacity of sulfur to high cell energy
density include maximizing the amount of sulfur in the cathode and
minimizing the electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio, E/S.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Combining an E/S = 6 &#x003bc;L mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with
a cell/sulfur mass ratio of 5.3, an energy density of 650 Wh kg<sub>cell</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was achieved in pouch cells of Li&#x02013;S
battery with MoS<sub>2</sub> cathode host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> However, despite such high energy density, well above the performance
of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> that would have been ideal for long-range EVs, Li&#x02013;S
batteries still seem in the research stage with no manufacturers ready
to adopt them for commercial applications.</p><p>Conductive cathode
hosts have been devised to encapsulate the sulfur
and accommodate its expansion when converted all the way to Li<sub>2</sub>S.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> A multipore continuum physicochemical
model of the Li&#x02013;S battery with liquid electrolyte 1 M LiTFSI
in DOL/DME has been developed and employed by our group to aid in
the design of the cathode host microstructure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> First simulations using a digital twin based on this
Li&#x02013;S battery model identified several problems in Li&#x02013;S
batteries, many of which are closely associated with the cathode:
(a) Sulfur in deep micropores remains undissolved and unutilized until
the end of discharge, which frequently occurs in microporous hosts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> At very low C-rates, a small amount of electrolyte solvent might
soften the encapsulated solid sulfur or sulfides in such micropores,
and redox reactions might occur in a semisolid state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> (b) Sulfur and soluble sulfides in meso- and macropores can easily
migrate to the anode during discharge and shuttle between cathode
and anode during charge via the mechanisms of diffusion and drift
current.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> This might occur even in high
tortuosity graphene-based cathodes due to large pores between curled
graphene platelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> (c) In many types of cathodes, sulfur and sulfide leaching takes
place from different cathode locations toward the cathode surface
facing the separator, resulting in exceeding the saturation concentration
and precipitating, forming a thick layer there that remains mostly
undissolved and generally does not participate in further redox reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> (d) The presence of a pure lithium
anode poses the risk of dendrite formation, as also in Li-ion batteries
with a lithium metal anode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p><p>The following step-by-step strategy has been devised in the
present
study to address the above problems in Li&#x02013;S batteries: (i)
Use of hollow porous nanoparticle-based cathode host to retain sulfur
in the nanoparticle core and thus reduce the &#x0201c;shuttling&#x0201d;
effect. (ii) Develop a nanoplatelet interlayer between the cathode
and separator to further reduce the &#x0201c;shuttling&#x0201d; effect
and possibly eliminate it. (iii) Employ an effective electrocatalyst-type
additive in the catholyte region to promote the Li&#x02013;S redox
reaction chain while also retaining sulfur and sulfides in the catholyte.
(iv) Employ an additive in the electrolyte to suppress dendritic growth
on the Li anode.</p><p>Hollow porous particle-based cathodes have
been one of the first
proposed solutions to reduce the &#x0201c;shuttling&#x0201d; effect
in Li&#x02013;S batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> with a reported specific
capacity of 900 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> after 100 cycles at 0.2
C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> and 700 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> after
100 cycles at 1 C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Despite such high
performance, there has been no follow-up in the commercialization
of such sulfur cathodes, which might be attributed to two reasons:
(a) The multistage synthesis method of the hollow porous particles
based on a silica template, which needs to be removed typically with
repeated washing steps using a highly toxic and corrosive HF aqueous
solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> (b) The surprisingly high C-rate of reported
cycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> corresponds to a current density
of at least 2 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> at which dendritic growth
is expected at the anode. According to Sand&#x02019;s equation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> the onset time for dendrite formation is estimated
to be 225 s for a current density of 2 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> in
liquid electrolyte 1 M LiTFSI in DOL:DME 1:1 v/v, which is certainly
within the discharge or charge time reported for the Li&#x02013;S battery
cycled at 1 C; this means that the reported batteries are at high
risk of short-circuiting in any further charge&#x02013;discharge cycling.
(c) Furthermore, a very high E/S ratio, E/S = 61 to 122 &#x003bc;L mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, was required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> well above
the recommended metrics for realizing a Li&#x02013;S battery with good
energy and power density with respect to cell mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Other studies have used a commercially available material,
Ketjenblack EC-600JD, with smaller hollow porous nanoparticles of
about 30 nm as a cathode host in Li&#x02013;S batteries that have achieved
good specific capacity at first discharge in the range of 700&#x02013;900
mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 0.1 C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> with
a smaller amount of electrolyte at E/S = 6 to 11 &#x003bc;L mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Hence, the Ketjenblack EC-600JD is
the cathode host adopted in the present study. Furthermore, earlier
research within our group replaced the typical PVDF binder in the
cathode coating with PEDOT:PSS, which allows for more environmentally
friendly cathode fabrication based on aqueous slurry, increases the
specific capacitance by 7&#x02013;9% due to the pseudocapacitance of
PEDOT:PSS, and adsorbs the sulfur and polysulfides, significantly
reducing the polysulfide migration to the anode, although there is
still a small sulfur concentration at the anode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><p>Much research in the past focused on modifications
of the separator
to suppress the &#x0201c;shuttling&#x0201d; effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> This includes functionalization or coating of the separator with
chemical groups or materials that adsorb sulfur and polysulfides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Numerous papers have been published with DFT (density functional
theory) and MD (molecular dynamics) simulations to determine the adsorption
energy, <italic>E</italic><sub>ads</sub>, of lithium sulfides and
sulfur by different functional carbon or graphene substrates. These
include <italic>N</italic>- and N&#x02013;S- doping of graphene with <italic>E</italic><sub>ads</sub> in the range of 0.8 to 2.06 eV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> Mo-functionalized graphene with <italic>E</italic><sub>ads</sub> around 2.3 eV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> and B,
N hexagonal codoped graphene with very high <italic>E</italic><sub>ads</sub> values of 4.4 eV, which is attributed to the strong Li&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;N
and S&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;B interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> An interlayer of 40 wt % functional boron-nitride nanosheets and
53 wt % graphene raised the specific capacity of a Li&#x02013;S cell
by only 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> The disadvantage of that
method is believed to be the low conductivity of the B&#x02013;N nanosheets,
which limited the electron transfer across the thickness of the interlayer
and the utilization of any sulfur and sulfide trapped there. Hence,
high conductivity B,N-codoped graphene (BNG) has been adopted in the
present study, with three avenues of investigation: BNG-coated separator,
BNG-coated cathode, or BNG coating on both the cathode and separator.
The advantage of high conductivity BNG coating on the cathode is that
any sulfur or sulfides adsorbed and trapped by the BNG layer will
be in the path of electron transfer in the cathode and actively participate
in the chain of redox reactions there. In particular, BNG has excellent
potential for also acting as an electrocatalyst for these reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup></p><p>DFT simulations to predict the adsorption
energy and electrocatalytic
ability of different single atom catalysts (SACs) in terms of activation
energy of the Li&#x02013;S redox reactions in the presence of SACs
of the type Me-N<sub>4</sub>- as part of a graphene structure yielded <italic>E</italic><sub>ads</sub> in the range of 3.3 to 4.5 eV for the best
SACs V&#x02013;N<sub>4</sub>-C and W&#x02013;N<sub>4</sub>-C and <italic>E</italic><sub>ads</sub> in the range of 1.2 to 2 eV for Fe&#x02013;N<sub>4</sub>-C and Co&#x02013;N<sub>4</sub>-C with respect to the different
lithium sulfides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> Given that micropores
of cathode hosts physically trap the sulfur and polysulfides, migration
of these active substances to the anode takes place mostly via the
meso- and macropores. Hence, the aim would be to functionalize the
walls of such pores of porous cathode hosts with appropriate SACs
to reduce the &#x0201c;shuttling&#x0201d; effect. However, DFT studies
demonstrated that the <italic>E</italic><sub>ads</sub> values drastically
decrease in pores greater than 1 nm, as one may generally consider
that the adsorption energy falls with the reverse of distance away
from the optimum position of the sulfide with respect to the functionalized
substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> Hence, a novel idea in the
present study is to employ vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) as an additive
in the catholyte. VOPc comprises small molecules as semiconductor
dipoles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> which we envisage would form
an SAC network in the catholyte within the meso- and macropores, bridging
their walls, that would retain the sulfur and lithium sulfides locally
in the pores and promote the redox reaction chain there, reducing
leaching of active material toward the separator and anode. Apart
from VOPc being an excellent electrocatalyst and Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> absorbing means, a delicate balance is sought
between the VOPc network offering sufficient conductivity to promote
electron transfer but not too high conductivity to short circuit the
cell, as the small VOPc molecules can easily be transported through
the separator pores. Starting from the conductivity, &#x003c3;, of multiwall
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that have been observed to cause short circuiting,

the strategy steps adopted in this study to realize high-performance
Li&#x02013;S batteries: (a) The cathode comprises a hollow porous nanoparticle
coating based on Ketjenblack EC-600JD (henceforth referred to as KB)
with 10 wt % pseudocapacitive PEDOT:PSS binder. (b) A KB-based cathode
with PEDOT:PSS binder is still employed with a thin sprayed interlayer
of BNG nanoplatelets on the cathode coating using, as interlayer binder,
a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE); the aim is for the BNG interlayer
to attract sulfur and sulfides and act as an electrocatalyst for the
redox Li&#x02013;S battery reactions. (c) Still employing the KB-based
cathode with a thin BNG interlayer on the cathode surface, VOPc or
CoPc nanodots are added to the catholyte with the aim for these semiconductor
molecules to form an electrocatalyst network in the cathode meso-
and macropores while also attracting soluble sulfur and lithium sulfides.
(d) Still employing the KB-based cathode with a thin BNG interlayer
on the cathode surface, silk fibroin is added to the liquid electrolyte
with the aim to form a monolayer on the Li anode surface and suppress
dendritic growth as well as coordinating with soluble sulfur and lithium
sulfides. The experimental investigations are aided by simulations
of discharge&#x02013;charge of the Li&#x02013;S cells with the corresponding

was mixed with sulfur powder (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and ground together
for 30 min. The mixture was then dispersed in acetone for 30 min in
an ultrasonic bath, followed by tip sonication for 10 min at room
temperature. The dispersed sulfur-KB acetone slurry was magnetically
stirred overnight until acetone evaporation. The resulting mix was
further ground for 30 min and placed in an aluminum foil parcel, which
was left in an oven for 3 h at 155 &#x000b0;C for sulfur infiltration
in combined melt/vapor phase. The samples were weighed before and
after the sulfur infiltration procedure to determine the sulfur mass
retained in the KB host. The sulfur-infiltrated KB mix was ground
for 30 min and added to an aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios PH
1000, Heraeus, Germany), placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min,
and left to stir on a magnetic stirrer to mix well and thicken. The
viscous slurry was coated on a carbon-coated aluminum foil current
collector (MTI, US) via the doctor blade technique at a blade gap
of 250 &#x003bc;m. Cathode coatings of 45 and 55 wt % S in KB with 10
wt % PEDOT:PSS were manufactured in this manner. Alternatively, for
higher sulfur contents, starting with the cathode coating of 45 wt

via the solution method in the form of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> solution in DOL/DME 1:1 v/v. In this manner, cathodes of 55, 60,

g/g (equivalent to 55 wt % in the final cathode coating with 10 wt

particles of outer diameter of about 30 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> to spherical agglomerates of about 200 nm. EDX analysis and scanning
along a slice diametrically through the S-KB agglomerate show the

that sulfur has fully infiltrated the wall pores of the particles.
There is good correspondence between the S maxima and the C valleys

the results of electrochemical testing of the Li&#x02013;S battery

of the cells with high S content (320 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for the cells with 60 and 70 wt % S), these cells recover to even
higher capacity after the applied cycling schedule to 370&#x02013;410
mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> after 100 cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c), which is similar to the
specific capacity of the 45 wt % S cell after 100 cycles. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c also exhibits the
effect of the C-rate: The 45 wt % S cell demonstrates the best performance
at higher C-rates. While the C-rate performance worsens as the S content
in the cathode increases from 45 to 55 wt %, it gradually improves
while it increases further to 60 and 70 wt%, although it is still
much lower than the C-rate performance of the 45 wt % S cathode. Furthermore,
the equivalent series resistance (ESR) was determined from the experimental
data at the start of each discharge in the GDC cycling schedule of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c and is presented

is reduced with increasing sulfur content in the cathode. This is
attributed to the corresponding higher amount of electrolyte, where
while maintaining a constant E/S ratio of 11 &#x003bc;L mg<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, the higher sulfur content, which also fills
a greater fraction of available pore volume of the porous cathode
host and separator, is translated to more added electrolyte. Ultimately,
this means that the higher amount of electrolyte fills even less pore
volume and wets the porous cell components better, resulting in lower
ESR for the higher sulfur cells. It is also noticed that the Li&#x02013;S
cell with 45 wt % S in the cathode displays a 10 times rise in ESR
at low C-rates. Simulation of the first GDC cycle at 0.05 C for this
cell using our multipore continuum model predicted a certain amount
of sulfide migration within the cathode from the current collector
side to the cathode surface facing the separator, accumulating in
the micro- and mesopores of the porous KB particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> The postmortem SEM image and the EDX S and C element maps

element map in these agglomerates on the cathode surface.</p><p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c shows
that all cells generally exhibit low specific capacity when tested
at the 2 C rate. For example, the Li&#x02013;S cell with 55 wt % S
in the cathode starts with an ESR of 100 ohms at 0.05 C, which falls
to a minimum of 50 ohms at 2 C after 100 cycles. With such an ESR
value at the high rate of 2 C, the cell potential falls immediately
under 2 V at the first point of discharge, which means that there
is little chance for the redox reactions corresponding to the high
voltage plateau of Li&#x02013;S batteries. In the absence of any formed
mid-order sulfide Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, no reactions can then
take place at the low-order plateau either. Hence, the cell potential
falls immediately below the minimum set discharge voltage for this
cell at 2 C. Furthermore, the 2 C current densities for the different
sulfur content cells in this study were in the range of 3&#x02013;11
mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>, which are at very high risk of dendrite
formation at the anode according to Sand&#x02019;s equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> For this reason, 2 C GDC testing was eliminated
from the schedule of subsequent electrochemical testing of Li&#x02013;S
battery cells in this study.</p><p>Delving a little more into the
effect of sulfur content in the
cathode on the specific capacity and cyclability of Li&#x02013;S cells
in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b,c, it
seems that there is a fluctuating trend in the cycling performance
of cells with sulfur content in the range of 55&#x02013;70 wt %. For
these cathodes, the first 45 wt % S was infiltrated following the
melt/vapor route, and it is expected that most of the sulfur impregnated
the core and the microporous wall of the hollow KB particles. The
rest of the sulfur, 10&#x02013;25 wt %, was infiltrated in the form
of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> via the solution route, and it is expected
that it occupied the mesopores between the KB particles. In such a
case, the produced soluble sulfides would easily migrate from such
large pores to the anode, especially in the case of the lower sulfur
content, e.g., 55 wt %, where the mesopores would be only partially
filled and still leave unfilled pore space for the soluble sulfides
to move. This would reduce the specific capacity and the cyclability
of the Li&#x02013;S cell. As the sulfur content is increased to 70
wt %, the mesopores are filled to a greater extent, and the sulfides
cannot move so freely. Sulfide migration is reduced as cyclability
improves, as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c for the 70 wt % S cathode. However, the high sulfur concentration
may create a semisolid state and concentration overpotential, reducing
the specific capacity at least in the first cycle(s), until Li<sup>+</sup> ions find a route to access the active cathode material.
Concentration variations in the coating may shift the balance of these
counteracting mechanisms and may explain the fluctuation in the cycling
performance for the Li&#x02013;S cells with sulfur content in the range
of 55&#x02013;65 wt %. Other factors affecting this fluctuating trend
are the thermodynamics of phase equilibrium between the solid and
dissolved state of the multiple coexisting sulfides and sulfur during
discharge and charge,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> weakly dissolved
sulfur and sulfides at locally high concentrations of these species
in the mesopores,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> and the effect of TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, depending on its local concentration, on the solvation
of sulfides and local regulation of redox reaction kinetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup></p><p>The next design step is to evaluate Li&#x02013;S
cells with a BNG
interlayer. A preliminary set of experiments with a commercial Nanomyte
sulfur cathode (70 wt % sulfur in a carbon black coating with PVDF
binder) included: a sprayed BNG interlayer on the cathode surface
only; a sprayed BNG interlayer on the separator surface only (the
surface facing the cathode); and finally, BNG interlayers sprayed
on both the cathode surface and the separator surface. The results

sprayed on the cathode surface has the highest specific capacity at
discharge and a certainly lower amount of BNG than the cell with two
BNG interlayers on both the cathode and separator. The specific capacity
of the cell with the BNG interlayer on the cathode surface is higher
by 42% than the specific capacity of the cell with the plain Nanomyte
cathode (without any BNG interlayer). This is much better progress
than that reported in the literature for an interlayer of B,N nanosheets
and graphene (only 10% rise),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> which is
attributed to multiple mechanisms: The high adsorption energies of
the BNG interlayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> can prevent sulfur
and sulfides from leaving the cathode, while their good conductivity
and direct contact with the cathode ensure good electron transport
from the carbon cathode host across the BNG interlayer to the sulfur
and sulfides trapped there, so they remain active in the Li&#x02013;S
battery redox reaction chain.</p><p>Investigations then proceeded
to the high-performance KB-10 wt
% PEDOT:PSS cathode with a very thin BNG interlayer (with 10 wt %

the first GDC cycle and the cycling performance, respectively. Both
figures demonstrate that the optimum electrolyte content is at E/S

ratios display a lower and uneven discharge curve at the low voltage
plateau than the optimum E/S ratio discharge curve, indicating a lack
of Li<sup>+</sup> ions to carry on with the redox reactions, which
is attributed to poor wetting of the cathode pores and low Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport rate. While this is understandable for the
low E/S ratio of 8 &#x003bc;L/mg<sub>S</sub>, it is thought that at
the high E/S ratio of 16 &#x003bc;L/mg<sub>S</sub> the cell becomes
overflooded initially, which leads to outward electrolyte flow to
the peripheral channel between the electrode discs of 19.2 mm diameter
and the cell cavity of 25 mm diameter, and this leaves the main cell
poorly wetted. Hence, the rest of the cells with 45 wt % S in the

model about
which pore sizes can accommodate the SF molecule. Molecular modeling
of the SF structure solvated in DOL:DME 1:1 v/v yielded an SF diameter
of 3 nm, the diameter of the first layer of coordinated DOL solvent
being 4 nm, and the diameter of the first layer of coordinated DME
being 8 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> As there was some uncertainty
for the present study about whether the SF structure could deform

mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively, with the last
case study of SF in d<sub>p</sub> &#x0003e; 3 nm fitting the experimental
data best. It seems that if SF is present in all pore sizes, its adsorption
of locally produced sulfides does not allow any interpore transport,
so the volume expansion generated from the early production of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> quickly fills the micropores fully with solids
without the presence of any liquid electrolyte. Given that the redox
reaction chain for electrolyte 1 M LiTFSI in DOL/DME is assumed to
take place only in the liquid phase, this stops any further reaction
and any further transport of Li<sup>+</sup> ions through the pores
of the KB particle wall to the hollow KB particle core that contains
the main part of sulfur, which leads to the rapid depletion of Li<sup>+</sup> ion supply and ceasing of the redox reaction chain. If the
model allows SF in meso- and macropores of d<sub>p</sub> &#x0003e; 3 nm
(where
the size of the SF structure is in fact 3 nm),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> it seems that the sulfide transport allowed through the
micropores accommodates the expansion of the active cathode material
over the whole pore size distribution of the cathode host and the
continuous presence of the liquid electrolyte in many of these pores,
maximizing the extent of redox reactions and the specific capacity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>A multistep strategy was
devised and tested to optimize the performance
of Li&#x02013;S batteries. The evaluation was based on experimental
studies of small Li&#x02013;S cells and multipore continuum model-based
simulations with key properties supplied from MD or DFT simulations.
Predicted GDC curves for the different types of Li&#x02013;S cells
explored in this study exhibited very good agreement with experimental
data, contributing to the validation of our numerical model in the
presence of BNG interlayer, heterogeneous and mobile promoters, and
traps of soluble sulfides.</p><p>The use of a hollow conductive particle-based
cathode host was
the basis of the strategy, together with the cathode coating binder
PEDOT:PSS. Ketjenblack EC-600JD was selected as a commercially available
conductive hollow particle powder, which can accommodate up to 45
wt % sulfur in the cathode coating (including 10 wt % binder) impregnated
in the hollow particle core and its ultimate expansion upon full conversion
to Li<sub>2</sub>S. This cathode was tested with a low E/S ratio of
8&#x02013;11 &#x003bc;L mg<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and reached
772 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at first discharge, falling
to 193 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the 100th discharge
at 0.05 C after a schedule of cycles at different C-rates. Multipore
continuum model-based simulations showed that PEDOT:PSS contributed
with its pseudocapacitance by 7&#x02013;9% to the overall specific
capacity of the battery below 1.8 V, which was confirmed by the shape
of the experimental discharge curve. Furthermore, the hollow particle
host and the PEDOT:PSS binder combined their physical constraining
action and strong adsorption energy, respectively, to slow down the
sulfur and sulfides migration to the anode. However, a low amount
of sulfur, Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> sulfides were still predicted at the anode surface at the end of
the first discharge that would accumulate with cycling, deteriorating
the battery performance, which was also confirmed by the yellowish
and dark brown areas on the anode surface from the postmortem anode
photo after the full cycling schedule of this study.</p><p>The second
successful strategy step was a sprayed thin BNG layer
on the cathode surface, with an estimated thickness of about 3 &#x003bc;m
from SEM images. This increased the specific capacity to 1010 mAh
g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the first discharge, falling
to 633 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the 100th discharge
after a cycling schedule at different C-rates. The higher specific
capacity and better cyclability of this type of Li&#x02013;S cell were
attributed to the further retention of sulfur and sulfides by the
increased tortuosity of the BNG platelets and the adsorption energy
of the B&#x02013;N- groups, as per the predictions of the multipore
continuum model-based simulation of the first GDC cycle. This allowed
only a small amount of sulfur and Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> to migrate
to the anode, which was confirmed by the light brown-yellowish area
on the anode surface from the postmortem anode photo after the full
cycling schedule of this study. The novel BNG interlayer on the cathode
surface proposed in this work has the advantage of being in direct
contact with the conductive cathode, which ensures excellent electron
transfer to any sulfur and sulfides trapped in the BNG interlayer,
retaining them active. In fact, they react under favorable conditions
in the presence of the B&#x02013;N&#x02013; electrocatalyst groups.
Li&#x02013;S cells with a sprayed BNG interlayer on the separator or
on both the cathode surface and the separator exhibited inferior performance
due to the loss of any sulfur and sulfides trapped at the separator,
as they did not receive electrons from the cathode and ceased any
participation in the redox reaction chain.</p><p>The final successful
strategy step was the addition of 0.8 wt %
silk fibroin in the liquid electrolyte, which yielded a specific Li&#x02013;S
cell capacity of 1372 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at first
discharge and 920 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the 100th
discharge after a cycling schedule at different C-rates. A multipore
continuum model-based simulation of the first cycle predicted further
reduction of the sulfide migration to the anode due to their adsorption
by the SF additive present in the electrolyte in pores greater than
3 nm, which was confirmed by the clear anode surface from the postmortem
anode photo after the full cycling schedule. The protective effect
of SF in the reduction of dendrites on the anode was also noted via
postmortem SEM imaging of the anode. The main conclusion from the
step-by-step strategy devised in this study was that the reduction
of sulfur and sulfides&#x02019; migration to the anode and the retention
of their active character in the redox reaction chain played a key
role in maximizing the specific capacity and cyclability of Li&#x02013;S
cells with liquid electrolyte. The multipore continuum model-based
simulations demonstrated that allowing a small extent of interpore
transport was beneficial in distributing the sulfides in order to
allow volume expansion, especially in the micropores.</p><p>A step
of adding VOPc or CoPc in the catholyte to act as an adsorbent
of sulfur and sulfides in the meso- and macropores and as an electrocatalyst
of the redox reactions in the cathode did not always yield the expected
improvement in Li&#x02013;S battery performance and cyclability. This
failure was attributed to slow charge transfer along the VOPc network
due to the relatively low conductivity of the VOPc semiconductor network,
while the higher conductivity CoPc migrating to the anode easily caused
short-circuiting.</p><p>Higher sulfur content than 45 wt % S in the
cathode was realized
by heat impregnating 45 wt % S and adding the rest of the sulfur in
the form of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> via the solution/evaporation
method, so it may fill the interparticle voids, allowing for expansion
upon ultimate conversion to Li<sub>2</sub>S. Li&#x02013;S cells with
55 to 70 wt % S, KB cathode host, and PEDOT:PSS binder started with
lower specific capacity in the first GDC cycle than the 45 wt % S
cell, which increased with cycling, reaching a maximum of 408, 329,
and 211 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the 100th cycle for
the cells with the 60, 55, and 70 wt % S cathode, respectively. Testing
cells with 55 wt % S in the cathode, the thin BNG interlayer on the
cathode yielded 932 and 233 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in
the first and 100th discharge, respectively. A cell with 55 wt % S
in the cathode, a thin BNG interlayer on the cathode, and 1 wt % VOPc
in the catholyte yielded 805 and 586 mAh g<sub>S</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the first and 100th discharge, respectively, demonstrating the
beneficial role of the VOPc network in the meso- and macropores in
this case.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information is

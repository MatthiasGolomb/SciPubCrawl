This result is consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, that is, TEP has higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, which is oxidized prior to FEC.<sup><xref rid="cit44" ref-type="bibr">44,45</xref></sup> Subsequent LSV tests in Fig. S2 (ESI<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>) demonstrate that after the formation of cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) from TEP decomposition, further reactions between the cathode and electrolyte around 4.0 V are prohibited.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>(a) EIS of QCE-P at room temperature and 60 &#x000b0;C, (b) temperature dependent ionic conductivity of QCE-P, and (c) comparison of LSV curves of QCE-base and QCE-P in the first sweeping.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c9ra08677c-f3" position="float"/></fig><p>To further investigate the interfacial impedance between QCE-P and electrodes, EIS test of the Li/QCE-P/LCO cell was carried out. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> displays the Nyquist plot and the corresponding equivalent circuit.

The polarization voltages between charge and discharge process increase and voltage plateaus become blurred as the current density increases, because the interfacial electrochemical polarization and concentration polarization in cathode increase steadily.<sup><xref rid="cit46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> The maximum discharge capacity of LCO with QCE-P at 0.1C is 136.3 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is close to the theoretical capacity of LCO charged to 4.2 V (&#x0223c;140 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The discharge capacities of LCO with QCE-P at 0.5C, 1C and 2C are 128.9 and 121.7 and 110.5 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, higher than that with QCE-base. As seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, the merit of using QCE-P becomes more obvious as the current density increases to 5C and 10C, where the cell still has a relatively high specific capacity of 87.6 and 60.3 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. The gradual increase in capacity with cycling at 0.1C, 0.5C and 1C can be ascribed to the increased activation of the interface between the electrolyte and electrodes. When the current density returns to 1C, the discharge capacity increases to 120.8 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, indicating excellent reversibility of the cell. The cycling stability of the cell was evaluated at 1C after activation at 0.1C for 10 cycles and 0.5C for 5 cycles. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, the QCE-P cell also exhibits improved cycle performance compared with the QCE-base cell. After 180 cycles at 1C, the cell with QCE-P has a 78.7% retention, while the retention of the cell with QCE-base is only 59.2%. This behavior indicates that QCE-P electrolyte and its interfaces with the electrodes are stable during repeated cycling.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>(a) Voltage profiles of LCO cell with QCE-P, comparison of (b) rate capability and (c) cycling performance (1C) of LCO cells with QCE-P and QCE-base, (d) voltage profiles of NMC811 cell with QCE-P, and comparison of (e) rate capability and (f) cycling performance (1C) of NMC811 cells with QCE-P and QCE-base.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c9ra08677c-f5" position="float"/></fig><p>The electrochemical performance of the cells with more aggressive NMC811 cathode was also investigated. A high discharge capacity of 177.2 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is obtained at 0.1C (1C is defined as 180 mA g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for the NMC cell with QCE-P as seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>.

The enhanced rate capability can be ascribed to increased Li-ion conductivity in the QCE-P bulk and the interface between QCE-P and the electrodes. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, although the cycling stability of NMC811 cathode is relatively poor owing to severe transition metal dissolution, easier electrolyte degradation and lattice structure damage problems,<sup><xref rid="cit47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> the QCE-P cell still shows a relatively high capacity retention of 73% after 100 cycles, while the cell with QCE-base has a retention of only 60.9%.</p><p>To better understand the reason why cells using different electrolytes show huge difference in cell performance, the Li anodes were observed by SEM after 100 cycles from the NMC811 cells. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> shows that lithium dendrites grow vertically into column-like microstructure when Li was repeated cycled in QCE-base. The conventional carbonate electrolyte is not compatible with Li anode, where a large proportion of electrolyte irreversibly reacts with Li to produce a thick SEI layer which insulates dead Li from electronic contact with the rest of the Li. However, in the case of QCE-P, an efficient SEI layer forms from the decomposition of the F- and P-containing plasticizers in QCE-P. The SEI layer inhibits the further reactions between Li and the electrolyte and the growth of lithium dendrites. A smooth Li surface is thus obtained as seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>. As a result, the cell with QCE-P shows stable cycling with a stable SEI layer on Li.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>SEM images of the top of Li anode after 100 cycles from NMC811 cells with (a) QCE-base and (b) QCE-P electrolyte.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c9ra08677c-f6" position="float"/></fig><p>
<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a and b</xref> compare digital images of electrolytes after cycling in the NMC811 cells. Obvious side products can be seen on the surface of QCE-base (the brown area in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>) with the side reactions between the electrolyte and the electrodes. By contrast, QCE-P should hardly react with the electrodes after the formation of efficient the SEI and CEI layers, leaving a clean surface of the electrolyte (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). To understand the effect of F-containing FEC and HFE and P-containing TEP on the chemical compositions of the SEI and CEI, XPS characterizations were conducted on the cycled NMC811 cathodes. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c and d</xref> compare the P 2p and F 1s XPS of the cathodes cycled in different electrolytes. For the cathode with QCE-P, the peak at 133.6 eV corresponds to the formation of Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> from the decomposition of TEP. For the cathode with QCE-base, the peak at 135 eV is ascribed to the formation of Li<sub><italic toggle="yes">x</italic></sub>PO<sub><italic toggle="yes">y</italic></sub>F<sub><italic toggle="yes">z</italic></sub> from the decomposition of LiPF<sub>6</sub>. As the main decomposition product from TEP, Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> has been used to coat cathode materials or fill in gel electrolytes due to its wide electrochemical window.<sup><xref rid="cit48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Thus, the relatively Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>-rich CEI can prevent further decomposition of the electrolyte on the cathode. This stabilization effect of cathode surface is also supported by the F 1s spectrum. The surface of the cycled NMC811 cathode contains much less LiPF<sub>6</sub> decomposition species like Li<sub><italic toggle="yes">x</italic></sub>PO<sub><italic toggle="yes">y</italic></sub>F<sub><italic toggle="yes">z</italic></sub> and LiF. Owing to less content of electronically insulating LiF, the QCE-P cell has a lower charge transfer impedance after cycling and exhibits better rate performance than the QCE-base cell. In addition, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>), the formation of a P and F-containing CEI layer is evident by the HAADF-STEM observation and EDS mapping on the cycled NMC811 particles.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>Optic photographs of the surface of (a) QCE-base and (b) QCE-P after cycling in the NMC811 cells, XPS of (c and d) NMC811 cathodes and (e and f) Li anodes cycled in different electrolytes.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c9ra08677c-f7" position="float"/></fig><p>The chemical components of the SEI are mainly attributed to degradation of FEC, as it has a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy.<sup><xref rid="cit44" ref-type="bibr">44,45</xref></sup><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e and f</xref> illustrate the Li 1s and F 1s spectra of the Li anodes cycled in QCE-base and QCE-P. Unlike the cathode side, species such as LiF and C&#x02013;F from FEC reduction dominate the SEI. F-rich SEI is good electronic insulator and blocks the electron tunnel, making itself a pure ionic conductor to prevent continuous electrolyte consumption.<sup><xref rid="cit49" ref-type="bibr">49,50</xref></sup> In addition, LiF presents high interfacial energy to Li metal, which facilitates Li-ion migration along the interface and enables the deposition of metallic Li in the parallel direction.<sup><xref rid="cit51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> As a consequence, these substances act as efficient protective layer for Li anode, enabling a smooth Li surface and thereby slower capacity loss during cycling.</p><p>For NMC811 cathodes, surface phase transformation to rock-salt structure is another important mechanism for electrochemical failure. To investigate the degree of lattice reconfiguration, the NMC811 cell was charged to 4.3 V after 100 cycles, and then it was disassembled to check the change of valence state of Ni on the cathode surface using XPS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).

Lithium metal cells assembled with QCE deliver high capacity and show stable cycling at 60 &#x000b0;C. The LCO cell with QCE can keep 78.7% of its initial capacity after 180 cycles and the NMC811 cell holds 73% capacity after 100 cycles at 1C rate.

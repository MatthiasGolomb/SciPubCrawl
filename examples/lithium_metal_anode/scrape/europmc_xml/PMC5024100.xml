The prevailing understanding is that LiNO<sub>3</sub> reacts with metallic lithium anode to form a passivation layer which suppresses redox shuttles of lithium polysulfides, enabling good rechargeability of Li-S batteries. However, this view is seeing more challenges in the recent studies, and above all, the inability of inhibiting polysulfide reduction on Li anode. A closely related issue is the progressive reduction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> on Li anode which elevates internal resistance of the cell and compromises its cycling stability. Herein, we systematically investigated the function of LiNO<sub>3</sub> in redox-shuttle suppression, and propose the suppression as a result of catalyzed oxidation of polysulfides to sulfur by nitrate anions on or in the proximity of the electrode surface upon cell charging. This hypothesis is supported by both density functional theory calculations and the nitrate anions-suppressed self-discharge rate in Li-S cells. The catalytic mechanism is further validated by the use of ruthenium oxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>, a good oxygen evolution catalyst) on cathode, which equips the LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free cell with higher capacity and improved capacity retention over 400 cycles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>With high energy density and low cost, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered among the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The history of Li-S battery research dates back to 1960s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, with most of the early works (1960&#x02013;1990s) in primary batteries focusing on electrolyte optimization and sulfur utilization improvement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The early research on the rechargeable ones, however, encountered the serious issue of fast capacity decay with very limited number of cycles (&#x0003c;20)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The main cause of the poor rechargeability has been known as lithium polysulfide redox shuttles (LiPSs, soluble intermediates in charge/discharge reactions), which internally short-circuit the battery and display an ultra-long voltage plateau at ~2.35&#x02009;V on charging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Tricks were employed to rectify the cycling behavior by fixing the charge time in each subsequent cycle, which however led to partial charging with little improvement to the fast capacity decay of the batteries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In addition, LiPSs redox shuttle was also found responsible for high self-discharge rate, warranting the urgency of research need in the development of high-performance Li-S batteries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>In 2008, Mikhaylik revealed the efficacy of LiNO<sub>3</sub> in suppressing LiPSs redox shuttles as a big breakthrough, enabling a real rechargeable Li-S battery with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of close to 100%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Coincidentally, the introduction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> was found to concurrently improve the sulfur utilization rate in the cathode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. These promising results have made LiNO<sub>3</sub> the most important electrolyte additive and almost appear in every reported Li-S cell thereafter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The function of LiNO<sub>3</sub>, according to the prevailing understanding, is to form an electrically insulating layer on Li anode via a spontaneous reduction reaction which prevents further reduction of polysulfides thereon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The passivation layer was identified as Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> by Aurbach <italic>et al.</italic> using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Later, Wen and co-workers reported LiNO<sub>3</sub>-induced formation of smooth and dense solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on Li anode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, serving as a protection layer to the reductive Li metal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Inspired by these promising results, significantly more efforts were devoted to rechargeable Li-S battery research on nanostructured sulfur cathode development, leading to the revelation of a large number of interesting materials and findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Nevertheless, recent work of K. Amine&#x02019;s group showed the irrelevance of redox shuttle suppression to the Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, triggering new thinking on future Li-S battery development. Another related phenomenon that echoes this argument is the finding of progressive LiNO<sub>3</sub> reduction on Li anode, which suggests the ineffectiveness of a Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer in prevention of LiPSs reduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. All these unambiguously justified the necessity of relooking into the role of LiNO<sub>3</sub> in rechargeable Li-S batteries. Herein, we revisit some key factors that influence LiPSs redox shuttles, clarify the roles of Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> passivation layers, and propose a new mechanism that redox shuttle suppression in the presence of LiNO<sub>3</sub> is due to the strong binding between the soluble high-order LiPSs and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) anions adsorbed on carbon substrate, which promotes the oxidation of polysulfide to sulfur on charging. This is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>-induced low self-discharge rate in Li-S batteries. As the progressive reduction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> compromises long-term cycling stability of Li-S batteries by gradual increase of the internal resistance, we propose the substitution of soluble LiNO<sub>3</sub> with solid oxide catalyst of good polysulfide oxidation reaction (PSOR) activity, to which ruthenium oxide was found as a preferable choice.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Rationale of experimental conditions</title><p>Initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of a rechargeable battery reflects the reversibility of its cell reactions in the first cycle and is typically above 90% for commercial Li-ion batteries. In a Li-S battery with LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free electrolyte, ICE varies notably due to the different extent of redox shuttles. To clarify the role of LiNO<sub>3</sub>, general factors that influence ICE must be fixed, e.g. Li salts concentration and applied current<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, in all cells are 1 M LiTFSI in DOL/DME (v/v, 1:1) and 0.1&#x02009;mA, respectively.</p><p>In addition, sulfur loading density (SLD) was found to affect ICE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1, Supplementary Information</xref>). At SLD &#x0003c;0.8&#x02009;mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, ICE experienced a quasi-linear decrease with the increase of SLD; whereas at SLD &#x0003e;1.1&#x02009;mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, increase of SLD elevates ICE slowly. Interestingly, at 0.8 &#x0003c;SLD &#x0003c;1.1&#x02009;mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> ICE exhibits a buffer-like behavior and fluctuates at 62&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5%. This unique feature is ideal for the study of redox shuttle effect, as the effect of SLD to ICE can be neglected if it is fixed at 0.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, the volume of electrolyte shows a direct impact on ICE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2, Supplementary Information</xref>). On a Li-S cell with 80&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of electrolyte, an ultra-long charge voltage plateau at 2.35 V presents with an ICE of 66.4%. In contrast, as the electrolyte was reduced to 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;L, a similar cell delivers a decent cycling performance with an ICE as high as 99.1%. The notably higher ICE at smaller volume of electrolyte was likely due to the increased viscosity of electrolyte at much higher LiPSs concentration that slowed down the diffusion of LiPSs from cathode to anode. This was supported by the &#x0201c;recovered&#x0201d; low CE when the cell was given sufficient time for relaxation between charges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3, Supplementary Information</xref>). The electrolyte volume effect to the cycling performance of Li-S cells can be found in a systematic study by Zhang<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, showing the importance of electrolyte volume optimization to the high performance cells. In this study, we fixed the electrolyte volume as 80&#x02009;&#x003bc;L in cells for ICE study, and 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;L in those for cycling/storage tests.</p><p>Further, ICE varies with the change of the operating temperature of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). At a higher temperature, e.g. 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, the severe redox shuttles internally short-circuited the Li-S cell, leading to &#x0201c;infinite&#x0201d; charging; whereas at an operating temperature of &#x02212;10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, ICE of 84.9% was achieved with redox shuttling phenomenon hardly visible. At conventional operating temperature, i.e. room temperature of 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, a Li-S cell with 80&#x02009;&#x003bc;L electrolyte and SLD of 0.9&#x02009;mg cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> delivers ICE of 66.4%. Such cells with moderate ICE values are ideal for the clarification on the role and efficacy of LiNO<sub>3</sub> additive in Li-S batteries. All experiments were thus conducted at room temperature unless stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inability of Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layers on electrodes in redox shuttle suppression</title><p>To re-evaluate the efficacy of a Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> passivation layer in redox shuttle suppression, we constructed 3 types of Li-S cells, i.e. with Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> passivation layer only on anode or cathode, or absent on both electrodes, and get them cycled in LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free electrolyte, respectively. The results show that in the absence of LiNO<sub>3</sub> and Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> passivation layer, a Li-S cell delivers a reproducible initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 66.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). At this ICE the LiPSs redox shuttle phenomenon is severe and reflected as an abnormally high charge capacity (or &#x0201c;infinite charging&#x0201d;). In contrast, a replicate cell cycled in LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte gave a reversible efficiency of ~100% in 2<sup>nd</sup> cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), showing the efficacy of LiNO<sub>3</sub> in electrolyte for redox-shuttle suppression. The overshoot of ICE above a unit in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle (and slightly in the 2<sup>nd</sup> cycle) was due to the side reaction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> reduction on cathode (forming Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer) at the voltage below 1.85&#x02009;V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4, Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p>As a &#x0201c;used&#x0201d; Li-S cell with Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layers on both electrodes was disassembled at full-charge state (2.8&#x02009;V) in an Ar-filled glove box, <italic>a</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> protected anode and <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> covered cathode were collected (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic> here stand for anode and cathode, respectively). After cleansed using fresh electrolyte solvent, the <italic>a</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub>/Li anode was coupled with a new carbon/sulfur cathode to form a new Li-S cell in LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free electrolyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Surprisingly, with a discharge capacity of 765&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> the cell showed a charge capacity of 1464&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which corresponds to an ICE of as low as 52.2%. This result suggests the inability of <italic>a</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer in LiPSs redox shuttle suppression, echoing the previous report of Amine <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, a Li-S cell assembled using the cleansed <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> covered cathode and a fresh Li anode in LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free electrolyte was able to deliver an ICE of 99.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), indicating excellent redox-shuttle suppression. Nevertheless, a notable drop in the cell capacity (300 <italic>vs.</italic> 765&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is likely due to the dissolution of sulfur/LiPSs into the electrolyte in the previous cell during the preparation of <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> covered cathode. This was supported by a higher capacity retention (511&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) when the electrolyte volume was reduced from 80 to 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;L. It is worth noting that this high ICE does not necessarily originate from the <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer. The <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> covered cathode with a rough surface was difficult to be fully cleansed, leaving LiNO<sub>3</sub> residues on (or in the proximity of) the cathode surface or inside the binder polymer matrix which works in its own way to suppress the redox shuttles.</p><p>The necessity of <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> for high ICE was further excluded by cycling a freshly assembled Li-S cell of Li anode and carbon/sulfur cathode in LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte with a cut-off voltage of 2.0&#x02009;V, whereby the reduction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> on cathode unlikely took place and hence a <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer was absent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Nonetheless, the ICE value was found as high as that of the cell discharged to 1.5&#x02009;V with the formation of <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5, Supplementary Information</xref>). Similar experiment has also been carried out by Zhang recently and NO<sub>3</sub> radical intermediate was proposed as the key in shuttle suppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In our experiment, LiNO<sub>3</sub> was replaced by NaNO<sub>3</sub> in the electrolyte (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6, Supplementary Information</xref>) and a high ICE was also obtainable. These results have clearly suggested that instead of <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub>, it was NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions adsorbed on (or in the proximity of) cathode suppressing the redox shuttles.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Stronger binding of LiPSs to NO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-theoretical calculations and self-discharge test</title><p>A possible mechanism for redox shuttle suppression by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions on (or in the proximity of) the graphitic electrode surface is that these anions promote/catalyse a faster oxidation of soluble high-order LiPSs into element sulfur on charging such that fewer LiPSs diffuse to anode surface to undergo a reduction reaction. At higher charge voltage (2.35 V plateau) the redox shuttle phenomenon is a competing process with the oxidation of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;S<sub>8</sub>. With Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> as the most stable LiPS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, a stronger binding of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions on (or in the proximity of) graphite than directly to C atoms of graphite would support the proposed oxidation mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Hence, we calculated the adsorption energies of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> onto NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions covered graphite and onto pure graphite in electrolyte solvent, respectively. The density functional theory (DFT) modelling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) shows that on NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions covered graphite Li atoms in Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> &#x0201c;bond&#x0201d; to O atoms in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> with a &#x0201c;bond-length&#x0201d; of 1.978 or 1.971&#x02009;&#x000c5;, comparable to a typical N&#x02212;H hydrogen bond (1.97&#x02009;&#x000c5;). In contrast, on pure graphite Li atoms interacted to C atoms. The Li&#x02212;C distance in this case was 3.400&#x02009;&#x000c5;, which came to the edge of distance for dispersive interaction. Clearly, it has suggested much stronger Li&#x02212;O interactions between Li and O of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> than Li&#x02212;C interactions between Li and C of graphite. This is further supported by the larger adsorption energy for Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> on NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (&#x02212;20.24&#x02009;kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than that on pure graphite (&#x02212;6.51&#x02009;kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Similar scenario has also been reported previously by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> in a study of graphene oxides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Such notably strong binding can be seen as the first step of the proposed catalytic mechanism. Since it was known that LiPSs&#x02192;sulfur conversion on pure carbon was hardly possible in the absence of LiNO<sub>3</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, the strong LiPSs/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> bonding enabled oxidation conversion of polysulfides on cathode upon charging of the battery could be seen as a catalytic process.</p><p>The strong LiPSs/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> interaction should also help suppress the reduction of S<sub>8</sub> to Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> for storage, which is reflected as lower self-discharge rate in battery. This was proven by monitoring the impedance changes of a fully-charged Li-S cell with electrolyte containing 5.0&#x02009;wt% of LiNO<sub>3</sub> over 10 days of storage at room temperature, using its LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free counterpart as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). In the Nyquist plot the first semi-circle at high frequency range was attributed to the resistance of solid electrolyte interface (R<sub>SEI</sub>), whereas the second one at middle frequency range was ascribed to the charge transfer (R<sub>ct</sub>). The simulation data shows that for the cell with LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte R<sub>SEI</sub> increased from 37.2 to 70.1&#x02009;&#x02126; over 10 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S7, Supplementary Information</xref>), which was notably higher than that of its LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free counterpart (from 38.8 to 42.3&#x02009;&#x02126;). Fast increase of R<sub>SEI</sub> in the presence of LiNO<sub>3</sub> electrolyte additive is attributed to progressive reduction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> on Li anode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Here, the drop of R<sub>ct</sub> is more of a concern, as it reflects the state-of-charge of a cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. R<sub>ct</sub> is larger for higher charged state, and its sharper decrease indicates faster self-discharge. Thus, the slower drop of R<sub>ct</sub> (27.1&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;24.0&#x02009;&#x02126;, or 3.1&#x02009;&#x02126;) for the cell with LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte as compared to that of its LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free counterpart (22.8&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;12.8&#x02009;&#x02126;, or 10.0&#x02009;&#x02126;) is suggesting the clear inhibition of self-discharge by LiNO<sub>3</sub>. This is understandable, as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions covered graphite were able to hold LiPSs more tightly and thus notably slowed down the self-discharge process (S<sub>8</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;LiPSs).</p><p>The inhibited self-discharge in cells with LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte was echoed by its higher open circuit voltage (OCV, 2.33&#x02009;V) after 10 days of aging at room temperature as compared to that of the LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free counterpart (2.16&#x02009;V, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8, Supplementary Information</xref>). The self-discharge suppression is achieved through the strong interactions between Li and O of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions covered graphite and irrelevant to the presence of the <italic>c</italic>-Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer on cathode, evidenced by a similar OCV when setting a higher cut-off voltage (2.0&#x02009;V). In cells with LiNO<sub>3</sub>-free electrolyte, self-discharge over time led to the disappearance of the upper voltage plateau corresponding to the series reductions of S<sub>8</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> in the following discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). As LiPSs in electrolyte can diffuse to the surface of Li anode and eventually precipitate thereon in the form of solid Li<sub>2</sub>S/Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, irreversible capacity decay was seen with only 61.5% of capacity retention after the storage of 10 days (475 <italic>vs.</italic> 772&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). In sharp contrast, cells with LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte were able to retain 97.0% of capacity (783 <italic>vs.</italic> 807&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) over the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The significantly suppressed self-discharge in the presence of LiNO<sub>3</sub> provides a solid support to the stronger interaction of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions on graphite to LiPSs (Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>) in Li&#x02212;O &#x0201c;bonding&#x0201d; mode. This further supported the catalytic mechanism of redox-shuttle suppression by LiNO<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Despite its high efficacy on LiPSs redox shuttle suppression and self-discharge mitigation, use of LiNO<sub>3</sub> in electrolyte brings in two noticeable drawbacks to the cycling stability of Li-S cells. One is the progressive reduction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> on Li anode, elevating cell internal resistance which lowers the discharge voltage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>; the other is the formation of Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> passivation layer on cathode at low voltage which destabilizes the cathode upon charging and induces faster capacity decay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. It is worth noting that cells with LiNO<sub>3</sub> in electrolyte are generally in a non-equilibrium state, whereby the free LiNO<sub>3</sub> will be gradually depleted by continuous reduction on both electrodes. Eventually NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions on (or in the proximity of) graphite will diffuse into the electrolyte and get consumed as well. This is evidenced by the clear decrease of CE in long-term cycling test of cells using LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Searching of a replacement for LiNO<sub>3</sub> becomes necessary for Li-S batteries with long-term cycling stability.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Replacing LiNO<sub>3</sub> with transition metal oxides</title><p>Different from Zhang&#x02019;s proposal of NO<sub>3</sub> radical intermediate as the key to promote LiPSs&#x02192;sulfur conversion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we believe that the shuttle suppression could be achieved by incorporating solid transition metal oxides into cathode as a catalyst of polysulfide oxidation reactions (PSOR). Some transition metal oxides were employed previously as polysulfide absorbents to improve the performance of Li-S cells, with Magn&#x000e9;li-phase Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> being a successful example<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Moreover, MnO<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, ZrO<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> as a major component in cathode, were found to improve the Li-S cell performances in different ways. The new understanding on the role of LiNO<sub>3</sub> in this work makes us believe that transition metal oxides may be used in low content to &#x0201c;catalyze&#x0201d; the oxidation of the adsorbed polysulfide, if their interactions are strong. To validate this catalytic mechanism, we introduced low content (&#x0003c;3&#x02009;wt% in the sulfur electrode) of transition metal oxides (18 in total) to investigate their activities towards PSOR. In each experiment one of the 18 transition metal oxides, selected from Period 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S9, Supplementary Information</xref>), 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S10, Supplementary Information</xref>), and rare earth elements in the lanthanide series (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S11, Supplementary Information</xref>) of the periodic table, was loaded onto graphite. The composition and structure of these graphite/oxide composites were confirmed by their respective X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S12, Supplementary Information</xref>). After mixing with sulfur to form the cathode, the shuttle effect of LiPSs in the obtained Li-S cell was studied. The ICE data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) clearly shows that V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MnO, CdO and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> imposed a negative effect on ICE (&#x0003c;50%), whereas anatase-TiO<sub>2</sub>, rutile-TiO<sub>2</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, RuO<sub>2</sub> and most rare earth oxides improved the ICE (&#x0003e;80%) as compared to bare graphite (ICE: 66.4%). It is noteworthy that a direct correlation between CE value and different transition metal oxide here would be hardly achievable. Their binding affinity to polysulfides could be an important factor which, however, is extremely difficult to be accurately quantified due to various complications, e.g. crystal phase, dominating surface atoms, orientation, overall exposure to surface of electrode made from slurry method, etc. These factors could vary notably for different metal oxide species. One point to note could be the adverse impact of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MnO with notable reduction power, which may compete with the &#x0201c;polysulfide oxidation reaction&#x0201d; and make the latter more difficult to take place. A clearer picture may be available after more discrete research on various transition metal oxides are studies in great details in future.</p><p>Coincidentally, RuO<sub>2</sub>, an efficient catalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, was found to be the most effective catalyst towards PSOR among these oxides, furnishing Li-S cells with the highest CE (92.5%) and superior cycling stability as compared to their LiNO<sub>3</sub>-based counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b&#x02013;d</xref>). The discharge capacity can be improved by replacing graphite (17.8&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S13, Supplementary Information</xref>) with large surface area carbon, e.g. multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, 256.3&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b</xref> shows the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of MWCNTs decorated with RuO<sub>2</sub> and the bright dots indicate the location of well-dispersed RuO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. By employing a cathode of MWCNTs/sulfur composite with 2.87&#x02009;wt% RuO<sub>2</sub>, initial discharge capacity of as high as 1298&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was achieved at a current density of C/20 (1C&#x02009;=&#x02009;1672&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In contrast, the MWCNTs/sulfur composite based Li-S cells without RuO<sub>2</sub> gave additional two potential plateaus at lower voltages (&#x0003c;1.89&#x02009;V, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S14, Supplementary Information</xref>), attributing to the reduction of LiNO<sub>3</sub> which is detrimental to the long-term cycling stability of the cell. One may eliminate LiNO<sub>3</sub> reduction at cathode side by setting a higher cut-off voltage, as suggested by Aurbach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>; however, the progressive LiNO<sub>3</sub> reduction on Li anode remains an issue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. It is hence not surprising to see faster capacity fading in cells cycled in LiNO<sub>3</sub>-contained electrolyte than in the ones with RuO<sub>2</sub> as a replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S15, Supplementary Information</xref>). The improvement of battery performance becomes more pronounced at elevated cycling rate (C/2), reflected as higher capacity and smaller voltage gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). For instance, in 5<sup>th</sup> cycle the cell with RuO<sub>2</sub> delivers a discharge capacity of 912.4&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is notably higher than the one with LiNO<sub>3</sub> additive (729.8&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Meanwhile, the much smaller voltage gap (0.266 <italic>vs.</italic> 0.686&#x02009;V, in 5<sup>th</sup> cycle at a discharge capacity of 400&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) corresponds to a higher round-trip efficiency of the cell equipped with RuO<sub>2</sub> (84.1 <italic>vs.</italic> 61.6%). The lower discharge voltage at higher rate for battery using LiNO<sub>3</sub> additive was likely due to the higher impedance caused by the introduction of Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer as a result of LiNO<sub>3</sub> reduction. This again shows the advantage of using transition metal oxide, whereby the Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layer formation can be avoided. In a long-cycling test for batteries with transition metal oxide or LiNO<sub>3</sub>, similar capacity fading trends were observed for both cells in the first 250 cycles except higher capacity for the former in the same cycle. The similar fading trend was likely due to the loss (with cycling) of active materials (sulfur) on cathode which still remains an issue to be solved. The lower capacity (retention) at C/2 for the one with LiNO<sub>3</sub> additive was due to its higher impedance from the Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layers as we discussed before. Adverse effect rising from the LiNO<sub>3</sub> progressive reduction started to become more prominent from 250 cycles, and the cells become unstable as clearly evidenced by the oscillated CE values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). The same phenomenon is also observed in Li-S cells with graphite/sulfur electrodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S16, Supplementary Information</xref>) and also a recent study by Janek <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Interestingly, a Li-S cell with RuO<sub>2</sub> on cathode exhibited a constant CE and was able to deliver a discharge capacity of 513.3&#x02009;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (@C/2) even after 400 cycles.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we re-examined the efficacy of Li<sub>x</sub>NO<sub>y</sub> layers on both anode and cathode in redox shuttle suppression, and found both ineffective. Previously observed convincing phenomenon of redox shuttle suppression by LiNO<sub>3</sub> additive in electrolyte could have functioned through the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions on or in the proximity of the graphitic surface in sulfur cathode. These anions bind strongly to LiPSs via &#x0201c;bond-like&#x0201d; interaction, facilitating fast LiPSs&#x02192;sulfur conversion which mitigates the diffusion of LiPSs to anode in charge process. The stronger binding was confirmed by DFT calculations and echoed by LiNO<sub>3</sub>-enabled low self-discharge rate in Li-S batteries. To replace LiNO<sub>3</sub> for long-term cycling stability, low content insoluble solid transition metal oxide was incorporated into carbon substrate in sulfur cathode. RuO<sub>2</sub>, a prominent OER catalyst, enables an ICE of 92.5% with improved long-term cycling stability. This work opens a new research path for the development of Li-S batteries, i.e. using polysulfide oxidation catalysts as enablers to realize long-term cycling stability.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials and electrochemical characterizations</title><p>Primary synthetic graphite (TIMCAL TIMREX&#x000ae; KS6), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, Aldrich, O.D.&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;L: 6&#x02013;9&#x02009;nm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, purity: &#x0003e;95%), precipitated sulfur powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%) and poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF, Solef&#x000ae; 5130) were used as received. The graphite/sulfur cathode was prepared by manually mixing graphite and sulfur (w/w, 1:1) in an agate mortar to form a graphite/sulfur composite which was then formulated to a slurry with PVDF in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, anhydrous, Aldrich) (w/w: 95/5), and cast evenly onto a piece of aluminum (Al) foil. For the CNT/sulfur cathode, PVDF content was increased to 10&#x02009;wt% to ensure strong adhesion of active material on Al foil. After drying in air at 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h, electrode discs of 15&#x02009;mm in diameter were punched out and transferred into an argon-filled glove box (MBraun) for assembly of Li-S cells.

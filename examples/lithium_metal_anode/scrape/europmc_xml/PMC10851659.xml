fluoride (TMF) conversion-type cathodes promise
up to 4 times higher gravimetric energy densities compared to those
of common intercalation-type cathodes. However, TMF cathodes demonstrate
sluggish kinetics, poor efficiencies, and incompatibility with many
liquid electrolytes. In this work, coevaporated heterostructured iron
and lithium fluoride (Fe-LiF) cathodes are investigated in thin-film
solid-state batteries with a LiPON electrolyte and a lithium metal
anode. The cells were cycled 2000 times at a cycling rate of 6C. They
show a gradual improvement in voltaic efficiency (37&#x02013;53%) and
specific capacity (146&#x02013;216 mAh/g) during cycling. After 2000
cycles, the cathode capacity reaches 480 mAh/g at a cycling rate of
C/3.6, close to its theoretical capacity of 498 mAh/g, at room temperature
conditions. This capacity gain is correlated with an observed electrochemically
activated nanorestructuring of the cathode, characterized by cycling-induced
coarsening (from 2.8 to 4.2 nm) of the metallic iron phase and its
accumulation near the current collector interface, as well as lithium
fluoride phase accumulation near the LiPON interface.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Li-ion battery</kwd><kwd>solid-state

physicochemical power
and energy density limits and hence, other cathode materials are being
explored for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> State-of-the-art
intercalation-type positive electrodes (cathodes) mostly contain transition
metal oxides (LiMeO<sub>2</sub>, LiMePO<sub>4</sub>, where Me = Fe,
Co, Ni, Mn, etc.), and are widely used thanks to their cyclability
and good power density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Transition-metal fluoride (TMF)
cathodes which operate via a conversion reaction promise up to 4 times
more gravimetric Li<sup>+</sup> storage capacity than intercalation
cathodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> FeF<sub>3</sub> and FeF<sub>2</sub> are by far the most studied TMF cathodes with theoretical
energy densities when in charged states (delithiated) of 713 and 587
mAh/g and 2600 and 2363 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively (FeF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> + <italic>x</italic>Li<sup>+</sup> + <italic>x</italic>e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> &#x02194; Fe + <italic>x</italic>LiF,
with <italic>x</italic> = 2 or 3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The theoretical capacities of the discharged (lithiated) products
(Fe + 3LiF and Fe + 2LiF) are slightly lower at 604 and 498 mAh/g
and 2202 and 2003 mAh/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively (as calculated
based on their molar mass). Comparatively, LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC811), a common cathode
material for commercial LIB production, has a theoretical discharge
capacity of 275 mAh/g (discharged state, calculated by removing 1
stoichiometric equivalent of Li<sup>+</sup> from LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and a practical capacity
of &#x0223c;200 mAh/g (cycled to 4.2 V vs Li/Li<sup>+</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p><p>However, TMF cathodes exhibit sluggish kinetics and poor reversibility,
leading to difficulties in accessing all of their Li<sup>+</sup> capacity.
In practice, significant quantities of conductive additives are included
in the cathode matrix (20&#x02013;60% by weight of cathode layer) to
achieve sufficient cathode utilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> In doing so,
it can be difficult to study and understand pure material characteristics.
In addition, TMF cathodes are plagued by poor stability versus many
liquid electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In liquid electrolytes, cathode
dissolution and ion shuttling have a detrimental effect on the capacity
and rate performance of TMF cathodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, due to the volume and phase changes of such cathodes,
solid electrolyte interface (SEI) stability and particle disintegration/fusing
can also have a detrimental effect on capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Zhao et al. reported a lithiated iron fluoride cathode
(1 Fe +
1 LiF) grown using pulsed laser deposition and could observe 350 mAh/g
(41.6 mA/g current density) in a liquid electrolyte half-cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, Zhao et al. also showed a mixed
metal cathode (1 Cu + 1 Fe + 2 LiF) with 420 mAh/g (41.6 mA/g current
density) capacity with 88% capacity retention after 200 cycles (95%
coulombic efficiency).</p><p>In this work, a 1 Fe + 2 LiF thin-film
cathode was grown by thermal
coevaporation. Using thin-film deposition techniques, well-controlled
and pure materials can be used to create model cell systems that do
not require any additives. In this way, the electrochemical activity
of the TMF cathodes can be isolated. This cathode was cycled against
a Li-metal anode, using a LiPON solid electrolyte. LiPON had been
selected due to its stability in a wide potential window.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> The Fe-LiF cathode was investigated electrochemically
in order to better understand how it behaves in contact with LiPON.
An electrochemically driven activation mechanism is observed at certain
cycling rates connected to a change in microstructure that is studied
through microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Coevaporation
was used to create a well-mixed, heterogeneous 2-phase
system of Fe and LiF as the cathode (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). Cathode thickness was varied depending
on the requirements for different experiments, but the deposition
conditions (deposition rates, substrate temperature, rotation speed,
etc.) are kept constant. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning
transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) micrograph (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b) shows darker and
brighter regions, indicating Li- and F-rich domains and Fe-rich domains,
respectively. The layer thickness is mostly constant throughout the
imaged area. The Fe-rich nanodomains measure roughly 2&#x02013;3 nm
in diameter (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). This nanodomain
size is likely related to the deposition rate of the layers and could
be tuned to achieve different cathode characteristics. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c is a top-view photograph
of 18 fully assembled thin-film solid-state cells on a Ti (200 nm

25 mm<sup>2</sup>. The inset image depicts a close-up of one cell
and where the cathode was placed within the structure (embedded under
subsequent layers; red dotted line). The cathode is circular, with
an active area of 5 mm<sup>2</sup> (2.73 mm cathode diameter). The
cathode was then fully covered by a LiPON electrolyte (1000 nm thick,
outermost edge of the cell structure). Finally, an anode (2000 nm
thick Li and 200 nm thick Cu) was deposited in the inset from the
electrolyte layer to avoid short circuiting to the Ti layer, but with
an area larger than the cathode area to ensure full cathode activity
(gold-colored layer in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c). 2000 nm thick metallic Li was used as a Li reservoir that
also provides a stable electrochemical potential in order to isolate
cathode electrochemistry. All layers are also shown with cross-sectional
SEM micrographs in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d. XPS and XRD measurements were conducted to determine the
chemical state and the crystallography. The results confirm the presence
of Fe metal and LiF salt within the cathode matrix through their respective
crystallographic peaks and binding energies (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figures S2 and S3 and Supplementary Note 1</ext-link>). Cathode composition
was controlled during deposition by calibrated independent quartz-crystal
microbalances measuring the deposition rates of Fe and LiF independently.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Fe-LiF cathode and solid-state cell structure</bold> (a)

for charging and discharging the
cells were 5 and 0.5 V (vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li), respectively. This
range was chosen in order to maximize TMF cathode utilization while
still maintaining LiPON electrolyte stability (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). Above 5 V, the side reactions of the electrolyte
become significant, leading to considerable cell degradation over
long-term cycling. For voltages below 0.5 V, there is no significant
capacity contribution, thus falling outside the optimal operational
range for the battery. Setting the cutoff voltage at 0.5 V also helps
in circumventing issues related to Li alloying or plating on the cathode
side. The typical voltage profiles of the cells are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a. The low Coulombic
efficiency (61.1%) during the first cycle is due to side reactions,
which are likely to occur as the Li<sup>+</sup> ions shuttle toward
the anode, forming a solid&#x02013;electrolyte interface at the LiPON&#x02013;Li
interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In addition, overlithiation
of the cathode (due to sputtering of the LiPON electrolyte) may also
impact the low coulombic efficiency of the first cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> The second cycle shows that the cathode discharge
capacity is 261 mAh/g, roughly half of the theoretical capacity. This
discrepancy is likely linked to poor kinetics within the cathode layer
in its pristine state. It is well understood that Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity
in LiF is highly dependent on its crystal structure and favors an
amorphous phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> As shown by Zhao et
al., a mild post-deposition annealing process (200 &#x000b0;C for 2 h
under high-vacuum) of similar cathodes improves the pristine lithiated
cathode performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> In fact, after an
activation protocol (5 cycles at C/8, 100 cycles at 6C, 5 cycles at
C/8, and 100 cycles at 6C, explained in more detail later), the cell
capacity is dramatically improved and reaches 480 mAh/g, very close
to the expected theoretical capacity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Electrochemical characterization</bold> (a) Charge&#x02013;discharge

results of a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT)
measurement performed with 2 min current pulses (same current density
as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a) and
30 min rest phases. In this technique, the kinetic and equilibrium
phenomena can be deconvoluted and studied independently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Polarization is significantly impacted by the
state-of-charge of the cell. This indicates that the charged and discharged
states of the cathode exhibit dramatically different kinetic properties.
This is also confirmed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>) where the cathode conductivity
is calculated (through equivalent circuit fitting) to be 2.4 &#x000b1;
0.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> and 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;10</sup> S/cm for the discharged and charged states respectively
(errors represent one standard deviation of confidence). Hence, not
only the reaction activation energy can affect cell overpotentials,
but also the 2 orders of magnitude change in cathode conductivity
between discharged and charged states. As shown by <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b, kinetic limitations of such
thin TMF cathodes cannot be neglected. At a charging rate of 138 mA/g,
overpotentials as high as 2 V are observed when the cathode is fully
charged. The thin-film system allows us to precisely probe such kinetic
limitations of pure cathode materials without having to consider the
contribution of additives in composite cathode systems.</p><p>In the
GITT experiment, the cathode demonstrates almost double
the capacity as in the galvanostatic charging experiment for the pristine
cathode state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a) but similar values to the cathode after activation. Furthermore,
a pseudoequilibrium voltage profile can be calculated, by interpolating
the data points at the end of each rest phase. Subsequently, d<italic>Q</italic>/d<italic>V</italic> curves are calculated for both the
galvanostatic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a) and the pseudoequilibrium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b) voltage profiles and are plotted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c. The pseudoequilibrium d<italic>Q</italic>/d<italic>V</italic> (black line) indicates a multistep
charging mechanism (Fe + <italic>x</italic>LiF &#x02192; FeF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> + <italic>x</italic>Li<sup>+</sup> + <italic>x</italic>e<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, with <italic>x</italic> = 2 or 3), represented
by the peaks at 2.69 and 3.20 V. The theoretical potentials for the
conversion for FeF<sub>2</sub> and FeF<sub>3</sub> are 2.59 and 3.00
V respectively, closely matching the experimental results but also
indicating the rest step in the GITT measurement did not reach equilibrium.
In comparison, from galvanostatic cycling, d<italic>Q</italic>/d<italic>V</italic> curves were calculated for the second cycle, the peaks
are shifted to higher voltages for charging due to kinetic considerations,
and the cathode is showing minimal activity at the FeF<sub>2</sub> peak, which could indicate preferential conversion directly to the
FeF<sub>3</sub> phase. This is likely due to local iron deficiencies
at the reaction front due to its relatively poor mobility, as indicated
by Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p><p>During discharge,
a peak shift toward lower voltage is observed
for the pre-activation cathode as compared to the pseudoequilibrium
curve. From the GITT measurements, the same features are observed.
A minor peak is observed at 3.11 V attributed to intercalation of
Li<sup>+</sup> into the FeF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> phase before
the conversion reaction occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The discharge
peaks at 2.29 and 1.85 V are linked to the conversion reaction of
the TMF cathode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Significant capacity
is still observed at low voltage, but the voltage range was limited
to 0.5 V in order to avoid the risk of Li-metal plating on the cathode
at high charging/discharging rates in subsequent experiments.</p><p>After cathode activation, during charging, the principal capacity
is occurring in a much higher potential region (4&#x02013;5 V; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a). More capacity
is also observed in the discharge curve, shifted to lower potentials
by &#x0003c;0.1 V as compared to the preactivated cathode curve. This implies
significantly better cathode utilization (the amount of cathode material
is constant). These features are considered to be related directly
to the conversion mechanism due to their very high respective capacities.
Some features are also evident in the low voltage region (&#x0003c;1.5
V) for all d<italic>Q</italic>/d<italic>V</italic> curves, but the
Li<sup>+</sup> storage mechanism in this range is yet unclear and
requires further studies.</p><p>The Fe-LiF cells were cycled at different
C-rates in order to determine
their rate capabilities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). As the C-rate is increased, discharge capacity
decreases due to higher overpotentials which lead to less material
conversion. At 6C (100 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>), cathode capacity
was observed to increase from 154 to 174 mAh/g, depending on the cathode
cycle number. Interestingly, this is a 13% capacity increase during
the 100 cycles conducted at 6C. This experiment was conducted multiple
times on different devices from the same substrate and from different
batches, and a similar trend is observed in each case as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link>. It is inferred that this effect is
due to a rate-dependent nanorestructuring of the cathode during each
charge and discharge. In theory, the cathode cycles between a 2-phase
heterogeneous system (Fe + <italic>x</italic>LiF, discharged state)
and a different, single phase system (FeF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, charged state), which implies a relationship between charging rate
(a proxy for reaction rate) and the nanostructure of the product formed
(both during charging and discharging). The restructured cathode can
be beneficial to its performance by electrochemically activating more
cathode regions, shortening diffusion pathways, and increasing the
surface area for reactions. This is further validated by the discrete
capacity slopes observed for each different charging rate. In the
final 10 slower cycles (1C), a significant decrease in capacity is
observed that may also be linked to a favorable nanostructure being
replaced by a less favorable one when cycling at 1C (20 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>). In this way, cathode discharge capacity could be tuned
as a function of the cycling rate and may be able to be regenerated
if the cathode is cycled with an appropriate protocol, as previously
shown by Le Cras et al. in a different cell system (Li<sub>1.2</sub>TiO<sub>0.5</sub>S<sub>2.1</sub>|LiPON|aSi).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> As the system relies on solid&#x02013;solid (electro)chemical reactions,
kinetic implications (for example, nucleation and growth of other
phases) are key. Hence, it is thought that cycling at different rates
will form different cathode nanostructures. This effect can be observed
in the regions shaded in blue in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a. Over 10 cycles at 1C, the capacity is
reduced each time at a different slope. The change in slope is likely
due to the structure at the beginning of the 1C cycle set, determined
by the C-rate of the preceding cycles. In this way, it can be concluded
that the 1C cycles may reach a common &#x0201c;equilibrium&#x0201d;
capacity after more cycles. Furthermore, it is evident that the restructuring
takes place over more than 10 cycles (the slope in 1C regions does
not reach a plateau, and longer 6C cycling results in higher capacity
in the following 1C cycles). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b shows voltage profiles of the 15th, 65th, and 175th
cycles corresponding to <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a. A change in electrochemical activity is observed, leading
to the formation of a new plateau at the high voltage region (4&#x02013;5
V), indicating a reduction in overpotentials after 6C cycling allowing
for more Li<sup>+</sup> removal from the cathode, similar to the observation
made in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c.
Voltage plateaus in the region of 2.5 to 3 V are also extended during
charging. During discharge, the largest improvement in capacity is
indicated by the conversion reaction plateau (2 to 0.5 V) with some
minor improvement to the higher voltage region (3.5 to 2 V), generally
associated with the intercalation of Li<sup>+</sup> into the FeF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>High-rate

cathode specific capacity, coulombic efficiency, and voltaic efficiency
over 2000 cycles of the TMF cathode. A cyclic voltammetry (CV) voltage
sweep (0.5 mV/s, 0.5 to 6 to 0.5 V) was conducted before cycling and
then again after 1000 cycles (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>). During the 2000 cycle experiment, the cathode capacity increased
from 146 to 216 mAh/g, a 48% increase. Furthermore, voltaic efficiency
increased from 37 to 53% within the first 400 cycles. After the second
CV voltage sweep, the capacity was initially significantly improved
but quickly dropped back to follow the initial trend. This long-term
increase in specific capacity during cycling further reinforces the
hypothesis that the nanostructure affects the discharge capacity,
as observed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a and leads to a material &#x0201c;activation&#x0201d; enabling higher
utilization of the cathode over time (30 to 43% utilization versus
theoretical capacity at 6C). Another indication of this is that after
the voltage sweep (with variable effective C-rate), capacity is greatly
increased for a few cycles, likely due to full material conversion,
but then settles back into the same positive trend of discharge capacity
that is observed before the voltage sweep. This observation was reproduced
by similar cells with the same Fe-LiF cathodes, this is shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>. This positive trend in capacity indicates
that there is an inherent advantage to converting the cathode material
at high rates that is not observed if cathodes are cycled slower. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b shows voltage profiles

(and voltage profiles) is observed within the first 500 cycles, closely
linked to the trend observed for the voltaic efficiency, as shown
in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a. The voltage
plateaus during charging indicate that significantly more Li<sup>+</sup> is released from the cathode in the 1 to 3 V range in cycle 500

plateaus are extended in capacity after 500 cycles. In addition, a
voltage &#x0201c;bounce back&#x0201d; is observed at 1.5 V for the later
cycles, as discussed for iron fluoride conversion reaction mechanisms
in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> This effect is attributed
to the nucleation of Fe and LiF reaction products, which promote electronic
and ionic diffusion to the reaction front, leading to improved kinetics

Similarly to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>(b), the precycled cathode shows a well-mixed, two-phase system of
Fe-rich nanodomains (2.8 nm in diameter, see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>) and a F-rich matrix, which likely also contains the Li-ions
in the form of LiF. This is further evident in the Fe/F ratio map,
which indicates a well-mixed system for the two observed phases. After
2000 cycles at 6C, we observe a change in cathode nanostructure. First,
a coarsening of the Fe-rich clusters is evident within the cathode
structure, showing an increase in their average diameter from 2.8
to 4.2 nm (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). Second, the
Fe/F ratio map indicates an accumulation of Fe on the current collector-cathode
interface and a similar accumulation of LiF on the electrolyte-cathode
interface. No comment on the absolute values of the Fe/F stoichiometric
ratios can be made due to inherent limitations of EDX (beam damage,
limited field of view, etc.). In relation to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>, it is clear that this electrochemically
driven restructuring provides advantages to cycling performance. Further
testing and characterization is necessary in order to determine the
reason for this advantage. Due to the solid&#x02013;solid nature of
the chemical reactions taking place, a more evenly mixed cathode is,
in theory, a preferred candidate allowing for shorter physical pathways
for reactants to meet, but these data suggest otherwise. Studies on
composite cathodes have shown that optimizing the cathode for roughly
equal electronic and ionic conductivities leads to the highest cathode
utilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Following this theory, it
is possible to suggest that the restructuring observed leads to favorable
ionic and electronic conductive network. Notably, a gradient of Fe-LiF
ratio is formed within the cathode during cycling (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>), with the highest electronic
conductivity being near the current collector (due to aggregation
of Fe near the current collector) and vice versa for the ionic conductivity
(due to aggregation of LiF near the electrolyte). In the studied system,
the LiF provides the role of the ionic conductor and Fe, the role
of the electronic conductor in the discharged state. This may suggest
a reason why the observed cycled cathode performs better than the
pristine cathode.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Post-cycling characterization</bold> (a) HAADF-STEM

with the use of liquid electrolytes and TMF cathodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> In addition, due to dramatic phase changes during TMF cathode
cycling, composite cathode systems often struggle with material stability
over many cycles, leading to SEI instability and capacity loss. After
2000 cycles at 6C, there is no observed capacity loss or evidence
of cell degradation. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146/suppl_file/nn3c10146_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link> shows EIS
spectra taken every 50 cycles over the course of 1000 cycles. There
is no observed degradation of the LiPON contribution. There is a decrease
in the magnitude of impedance in the low frequency range, further
solidifying the activation phenomenon described. Due to the thin nature
of the system, any interface formation and/or degradation would significantly
impact the cell&#x02019;s performance. In contrast, an improvement
of cell performance metrics is observed as the cells are cycled further.
An activation of the cathode material is observed after such a cycling
protocol that allows for very high cathode utilization (96%) with
observed cathode gravimetric capacities of 480 mAh/g at a thickness
of 90 nm.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A thin-film solid-state battery was created
with the scope of testing
the electrochemical performance of Fe-LiF conversion cathodes with
LiPON solid electrolytes. Using the thin-film solid-state system,
2000 cycles at 6C of cells with Fe-LiF cathodes have been achieved
without noticeable degradation of the cell structure or performance.
TMF cathodes are notoriously poorly compatible with liquid electrolytes
and result in long-term irreversible capacity fading. Here, we show
a Fe-LiF cathode with 480 mAh/g of capacity at a C/3.6 rate, 96% of
theoretically achievable capacity after electrochemical activation.
At 6C cycling rates, 216 mAh/g of discharge capacity remained after
2000 cycles. An important finding is that for such a coevaporated
lithiated cathode system, an activation step is advantageous for higher
cathode utilization, capacity, and improved energy efficiency. A distinct
change in the nanostructure is observed which is likely linked to
the cathode activation mechanism and improved cell performance metrics.
Conversion cathodes still have a lot of untapped potential, and the
thin-film system seems to be able to unlock some of it. As the rest
of battery research is moving toward solid-state electrolytes, understanding
how TMF cathodes interact in all solid-state cells will allow to better
assess their usability in future generations of batteries.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Fabrication</title><p>Uncoated

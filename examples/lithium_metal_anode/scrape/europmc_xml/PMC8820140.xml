compatible with high energy density cells
are critical for lithium metal battery applications, but dendrite
formation associated with the use of dilute organic electrolytes complicates
their realization. High-concentration electrolytes mitigate some of
the issues of the electrolytes but introduce additional problems,
such as low conductivity and high cost. Hence, pseudo-concentrated
electrolytes, wherein a co-solvent is added to a dilute electrolyte,
have been presented as a possible alternative to both dilute and concentrated
electrolytes. However, the effect that the co-solvent has on the electrolyte
properties at both macroscopic and microscopic levels is unknown.
Here, a study of the structure and electrochemical properties of two
electrolytes as a function of co-solvent concentration is presented
using an array of spectroscopies (FTIR, ATR&#x02013;FTIR, and nuclear
magnetic resonance) and computational methods (density functional
theory calculations). The chosen electrolytes comprised two different
lithium salts (LiPF<sub>6</sub> and LiTFSI) in a mixture of dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) with 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane (PFB) as the co-solvent.
Our results show that in the case of the LiPF<sub>6</sub>/DMC electrolyte,
the addition of a co-solvent (PFB) with a larger dielectric constant
results in the strengthening of the lithium&#x02013;anion interaction
and the formation of aggregate species since PFB does not interact
with the anion. Conversely, in the LiTFSI/DMC electrolyte, the co-solvent
appears to interact with the anion via hydrogen bonds, which leads
to the dissociation of contact ion pairs. The change in ionic speciation
of the electrolytes upon addition of PFB provides a reasonable framework
to explain the different trends in both the bulk and interfacial macroscopic
properties, such as conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability.
Overall, our findings demonstrate that the interactions between the
anion and the co-solvent must be taken into consideration when adding
a co-solvent because they play a major role in determining the final
electrolyte properties.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Division of Chemistry</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000165</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE- 1751735</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chemistry Department, Louisiana State University</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">NA</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Louisiana State University</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100008294</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Louisiana Board of Regents</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100006952</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LEQSF(2019-22)-RD-A-05</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>jp1c09193</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>jp1c09193</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lithium-ion
batteries have become the dominant technology in portable
energy storage due to their low weight, cost efficiency, and relatively
high energy density since their introduction in 1991.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The current commercial lithium-ion batteries, widely used
in portable electronics, are based on a graphite anode, which lacks
sufficient energy density to support more energy demanding applications,
such as electric vehicles and power grid storage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> To this end,
lithium metal has the potential of becoming an anode material due
to its exceptionally high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h
g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) and low negative electrochemical potential
(&#x02212;3.040 V vs SHE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> However, an
anode consisting of metallic lithium has inherent problems including
dendrite formation (short-circuiting) and unmitigated growth of the
solid electrolyte interface (decreased cycling efficiency and increased
resistance).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> To solve these issues, highly concentrated lithium
salt electrolytes have been proposed. These highly concentrated electrolytes
not only inhibit dendrite formation but also have other desirable
properties, such as enhanced electrochemical stability, reduced corrosivity
of the aluminum current collector, and the formation of a more stable
solid electrolyte interface, the so-called SEI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> However, highly
concentrated electrolytes are not free of problems since they have
high viscosity, low ionic conductivity, and high cost, which hamper
their widespread adoption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> One proposed alternative to suppress dendrite formation
and reduce the cost of the highly concentrated electrolyte is the
introduction of a &#x0201c;co-solvent&#x0201d;. An essential characteristic
of the co-solvent should be to have minimum interactions with the
electrolyte components. In other words, the co-solvent is expected
to not directly interact with the lithium ion or its counter ion when
added to the electrolyte. Previous works with co-solvents include
the use of dioxolane, water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, diethyl
carbonate, toluene, hydrofluoroethers, dichloromethane, hexafluoroisopropyl
methyl ether, and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropylether
as co-solvents to battery electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> It has been observed that in some cases, the addition of co-solvents
to highly concentrated electrolytes does not result in the total disruption
of a rigid three-dimensional structure and in turn creates pockets
of a highly concentrated electrolyte with increased mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> For these reasons, these diluted electrolytes have been described
as pseudo-concentrated electrolytes. Pseudo-concentrated electrolytes
have particularly interesting properties such as enhanced ionic conductivity,
lower viscosity, and lower cost when compared to highly concentrated
electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> In addition, the possibility
of using these electrolytes for high-voltage lithium-ion batteries
has been recently shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Highly halogenated
co-solvents have been used to create pseudo-concentrated
electrolytes since they are expected to lower the viscosity of the
system without modifying the pre-existing interactions among the components
of the electrolyte due to their chemical inertness. An example of
such behavior has been demonstrated in the addition of dichloromethane
to a highly concentrated electrolyte where the co-solvent did not
alter the interfacial properties of the electrolyte (i.e., electrochemical
stability) but decreased the viscosity of the electrolyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> However, recent work casts doubt on the non-interacting
nature of the co-solvent since it revealed that the addition of a
highly fluorinated ether as a co-solvent to a concentrated electrolyte
resulted in the change of the interfacial and bulk properties of the
electrolyte concomitant with a change in the anion speciation in the
electrolyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><p>The literature of
pseudo-concentrated electrolytes also presents
conflicting accounts of the role of the co-solvent on the ionic speciation
and interfacial and bulk properties of the diluted electrolytes. In
a work on a system composed of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(LiTFSI) in ethyl acetate, the addition of a dichloromethane co-solvent
did not appear to alter the speciation, which exists primarily as
contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) in diluted and pure
electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> In contrast, an electrolyte
consisting of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) showed that the addition of a fluorinated co-solvent
directly affects the speciation of the lithium ion by increasing the
concentration of CIPs and AGGs in the diluted electrolyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Owing to these conflicting reports, further
study of the solvation structure of the lithium ion when diluted with
a &#x0201c;non-interactive&#x0201d; co-solvent is needed.</p><p>The
focus of this study is to determine the possible molecular
mechanisms by which a co-solvent affects the ionic speciation and
the electrochemical properties of the system. Previous reports indicated
that the chemical nature of the anion occupies a critical role in
dictating speciation, so two different lithium salts are investigated
to determine whether the identity of the anion plays any part in directing
speciation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> To this end, two commonly used
lithium salts (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, LiTFSI
and lithium hexafluorophosphate, LiPF<sub>6</sub>) in DMC and a highly
fluorinated solvent (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane, PFB) are used (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref></xref>). It has been demonstrated
that both lithium salts are soluble in DMC, though not with the same
degree of dissociation, and their use in previous spectroscopic studies
of electrolytes warrants their use here as representative lithium
electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> The use of PFB as a co-solvent is based on the expectation that
the solvent by itself will not affect the electrochemical window of
the system due to its chemical inertness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> but it will improve the transport properties because of its low
viscosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> Moreover, PFB is structurally
similar to the widely used polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride) typically
used as a binder in lithium-ion batteries. Hence, electrolyte samples
with varying co-solvent concentrations are examined experimentally
via conductivity measurements, viscosity measurements, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, linear FTIR spectroscopy, and cyclic
voltammetry and complemented by density functional theory (DFT) computations.
In particular, previous works have shown the benefits of using IR
and NMR characterizations synergistically to study the solvation structure
of lithium ions in a solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup></p><fig id="sch1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title>Chemical Structures of LiTFSI, LiPF<sub>6</sub>, DMC, and PFB</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="jp1c09193_0008" id="gr7" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>, 98% Acros Organics)

carbonyl stretches, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> The linear FTIR spectra for LiTFSI and LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>) show definitely different trends in association with the solvent
with the lithium ion for the two salts. In the case of LiTFSI samples,
the spectra reveal a downward trend where the amount of free carbonate
is maximized for the sample without PFB, and the first addition of
PFB slightly lowers the amount of free solvent, which then remains
almost constant for all the different PFB concentrations. This trend
implies that PFB is not likely to directly interact with Li<sup>+</sup>. However, it appears that the addition of PFB to the LiTFSI samples
actually enhances the interaction of the organic carbonate with lithium
ions. This is explained by the extremely poor solubility of LiTFSI
in PFB, even though PFB has a larger dielectric constant than DMC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> In regard to ion speciation, the changes in
the carbonyl stretch band intensities indicate that in the absence
of PFB (the 1:9:0 LiTFSI sample), some CIPs are present, but the addition
of PFB (the 1:9:1 sample) is sufficient to disrupt such complexes,
resulting in a higher coordination of lithium ions by carbonates,
or equivalently, in the loss of intensity for the free carbonyl band
(1757 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). Moreover, subsequent additions of PFB
do not appear to change the free carbonate solvent molecules or the
ionic speciation in the sample since the ratio of the bands does not
change. Note that the loss in the intensity of the free carbonyl band
could also be attributed to a change in the dielectric constant of
the solution by the addition of PFB, but this is unlikely because
the ratio of the band intensity remains invariant even at very large
concentrations of PFB. The solvation structures described are shown

in almost the same positions as the LiTFSI samples. Compared to the
bands in the latter, the carbonyl stretch bands are blue-shifted by
1 and 3 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively. Interestingly, the trend
observed for the peak intensity of the LiTFSI samples is completely
different from that of the LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples, where a sustained
growth of the free carbonyl band is observed with increasing PFB concentration.
The trend in the carbonyl bands shows that more free solvent molecules
are generated with the increasing concentration of PFB. While the
addition of PFB could significantly alter the oscillator strength
of the carbonyl mode of DMC, this effect should also be noticeable
in the LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples. However, the PFB addition to the
LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples only produces a small solvatochromic shift
of the carbonyl stretch frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> Thus,
changes in the environment do not appear to be caused by substantial
change in the transition dipole magnitude of the carbonyl stretch.
The effect of PFB can be explained by an increase in the interaction
between the lithium ion and its counterion, which results in more
CIPs and AGGs in the LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples with increasing PFB
concentration. The formation of more CIPs and AGGs is also supported
by the broadening revealed in the high-frequency band with increasing
PFB concentration, which may denote additional vibrational modes from
CIPs or AGGs contributing to the high-frequency band.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> This is reflected in the IR frequencies calculated from

LiPF<sub>6</sub> in DMC suggest that the solution contains primarily
SSIPs, such that stronger Li&#x02013;anion interactions would result
in aggregate species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup></p><p>The change in the speciation of the PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> ion is further deduced from ATR&#x02013;FTIR spectroscopy.

two broad bands, one at 840 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and a second one
at 860 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. This latter band has been previously

three additional bands appear at 820, 857, and 885 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, suggesting a change in the ionic speciation of PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>. The proposed change in speciation is in agreement
with a previous report, which showed the appearance and growth of
the same side P&#x02013;F stretch bands at high concentrations of LiPF<sub>6</sub> in organic carbonates, where the interaction between the
lithium ion and its counterion is enhanced by concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Moreover, this previous study also assigned
the same P&#x02013;F stretch bands, observed for the 1:9:3 samples

interactions with higher PFB concentrations. This behavior is in agreement
with the increase in free carbonate molecules seen in the carbonyl

agreement for frequencies of the free anion and the SSIP than for
those of the CIP. Furthermore, the calculations also reveal the IR
bands seen in FTIR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>), and the three additional IR bands observed in ATR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) spectra with increasing
PFB concentration are better represented by the carbonyl and P&#x02013;F
stretches arising from the 2,2-aggregate rather than from the 1,2-aggregate
(structures D and E in Scheme S1; see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c09193/suppl_file/jp1c09193_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>). In summary, the change in the speciation of PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> is consistent with the behavior in pseudo-concentrated
electrolytes, wherein the presence of a non-interacting co-solvent
strengthens the cation&#x02013;anion interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup></p><p>The anion speciation was also inferred from the fluorine nuclei
chemical shifts. As can be seen in the IR spectroscopy data, the LiTFSI
and LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples present opposite trends for the change
in the chemical shift (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). While the PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> fluorine nuclei
decrease their chemical shift (increasing shielding) with PFB concentration,
the TFSI fluorine atoms increase their chemical shift (less shielding).
From the perspective of the sample concentration, an increase in the
lithium concentration should lead to a decrease of the chemical shift
(increasing shielding) due to the stronger interaction between the
anion and the cation as previously demonstrated for a TFSI-based ionic
liquid doped with LiTFSI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> DFT calculations

effect in the NMR chemical shift since the formation of a CIP results
in a decrease of the chemical shift (more shielded) of anion fluorine
nuclei in either sample. Moreover, the addition of an explicit solvation
shell for Li<sup>+</sup> does not modify the chemical shift trend
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c09193/suppl_file/jp1c09193_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). Hence, the DFT results confirm
our interpretation of the IR data for both PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> and TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. In other words, the addition of PFB
to the LiPF<sub>6</sub> sample leads to a stronger lithium&#x02013;anion
interaction, resulting in a more shielding of the fluorine nuclei
(lower chemical shift) and more free carbonates. In contrast, the
addition of PFB to the LiTFSI sample results in a weaker interaction
between the cation and TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup> or equivalently a higher
chemical shift (less shielding) in agreement with the disappearance
of free carbonates in the sample as can be seen from the IR results.</p><p>So far, two key conclusions can be extracted from the experimental
IR and NMR data and the computational results. First, the addition
of PFB appears to affect the Li&#x02013;anion interaction differently
for the two samples. Second, the presence of the co-solvent has a
stronger effect on the formation of CIPs and AGGs than lowering the
lithium concentration. Hence, the addition of the co-solvent affects
the speciation of the two electrolytes differently, which points to
different molecular interactions between PFB and either anion. DFT

Previous work has shown the existence of weak hydrogen bonds between
C&#x02013;H donors and the O atom of acceptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup> These CH&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;O hydrogen bonds have energetics

geometries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> The PFB&#x02013;TFSI interaction shows similar energetics
of &#x0223c;0.86 kcal/mol to the CH&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;O hydrogen bond.
Additionally, the bond lengths for the C&#x02013;H bonds of PFB and
C&#x02013;H&#x02013;O bond angles (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c09193/suppl_file/jp1c09193_si_001.pdf">Table S2</ext-link>) mirror results previously seen in other systems (see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>), respectively). Thus,
the DFT results strongly suggest that the formation of weak hydrogen
bonds between PFB and the TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup> might be the cause
for the dissociation of the CIPs in the LiTFSI/DMC samples. Overall,
the juxtaposing results from IR, NMR, and DFT data provide a unified
picture of the molecular&#x02013;level interactions in these systems.
The IR experiments show more free solvent molecules with increasing
co-solvent concentration for the LiPF<sub>6</sub>/DMC system due to
enhanced interactions between PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> and
the lithium cation. Conversely, for the LiTFSI/DMC system, there is
a slight loss of free solvent molecules with the initial introduction
of PFB, indicating that the co-solvent dissociates ion pairs (SSIPs
and CIPs) and forces the carbonate solvent to solvate Li<sup>+</sup>. In the case of the PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> sample, the
enhanced cation&#x02013;anion interactions are also observed through
both the downshift of the fluorine chemical shift and the appearance
of new bands in the P&#x02013;F stretch IR region. In contrast, the
weakening of the Li<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;anion interaction produced
by the presence of the co-solvent in the LiTFSI/DMC sample is directly
observed from the upshift of the fluorine chemical shift. The NMR
and IR spectra for these samples calculated with DFT strengthen the
interpretation of these interactions, denoting the existence of free
TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and SSIPs in the LiTFSI samples and free PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>, SSIP, and 2,2-aggregate species in the
LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Macroscopic Properties</title><p>The electrophysicochemical
properties
of these systems also present interesting trends. The molal conductivity
of both systems (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>) shows that the value remains nearly constant with a slight increase
for those samples containing PFB for the LiTFSI samples. In contrast,
the LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples present a maximum around the 1:9:6 sample,
but all the samples containing PFB have a larger conductivity than
the pure electrolyte (1:9:0 sample). In these electrolytes, the conductivity
mechanism is expected to be driven by the mobility of free ions, the
viscosity, and the lithium salt concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref></sup> The formation of CIPs and AGGs should limit the number
of charge carriers and thereby lower the conductivity of the system.
However, the addition of a co-solvent to an electrolyte not only changes
the number of charged species but also alters the viscosity of the
system. Thus, a lower viscosity in the sample should facilitate a
faster diffusion of the charge carriers, which is the observed behavior
for pseudo-concentrated electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup></p><p>The
viscosity of the studied electrolytes as a function of PFB concentration
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>) in either
sample displays a monotonic decrease of the viscosity with the addition
of the co-solvent. Since viscosity and conductivity are inversely
related, a monotonic decrease in viscosity should be reflected as
an increase in the conductivity when the ionic speciation in the sample
remains unaltered. This is the case for the LiTFSI samples, where
the addition of PFB leads to a linear increase in conductivity. However,
the trend does not explain the conductivity of the LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples, which exhibits a nonlinear behavior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>), likely due to a change in the ionic speciation
as previously concluded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref></sup> Moreover, the
viscosity of the LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples does not follow an ideal
behavior, in which the viscosity of the system is defined exclusively
by the viscosity of the components and their molar fractions. The
non-ideal behavior is seen when comparing the real and ideal viscosity
of the mixtures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>), in which the latter was computed using the viscosity of the pure
electrolytes and pure PFB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> In this case,
it is observed that the experimental viscosity for the LiTFSI samples
matches well with the value of the viscosity predicted for the ideal
case. In contrast, the experimental viscosity for the LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples presents a much lower value than that of the ideal case.
Thus, the viscosity provides evidence of a change in the cohesive
forces of the electrolyte likely arising from the change in the ionic
speciation of the LiPF<sub>6</sub> sample due to the presence of PFB.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Left panel

PFB concentration. Because the Walden product removes the viscosity
effect, one can use this metric to evaluate the changes in the number
of charge carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref></sup> For the LiTFSI sample,
the Walden product (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>) decreases monotonically since it is directly influenced
by the change in the number of charge carriers produced by the addition

(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>) for the
LiPF<sub>6</sub> samples does not follow the same trend as LiTFSI,
indicating that there is another underlying molecular mechanism, beyond
simple dilution, altering the properties of the system. This mechanism
is the change in ionic speciation of the two systems as derived from
the IR and NMR experiments. Hence, the Walden products assert that
PFB plays a different role in the solvation of these LiPF<sub>6</sub> and LiTFSI electrolytes and their dilutions. In the case of the
LiTFSI system, PFB has a minimal effect on the conductivity of the
system and only serves as a co-solvent, while in the LiPF<sub>6</sub> system, PFB creates a pseudo-concentrated electrolyte with enhanced
conductivity by altering the ionic speciation of the electrolytes,
that is, creating more aggregates.</p><p>Finally, the effect of PFB
on the electrochemical stability of
the electrolyte was also evaluated from cyclic voltammetry. It has
been previously shown that there is a relationship between enhanced
ionic conductivity and a change in the electrochemical stability of
the electrolytes, in which a higher concentration of the lithium salt
typically leads to a larger electrochemical stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> The linear sweep voltammogram
(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>) for the
LiPF<sub>6</sub> sample without (1:9:0) and with (1:9:9) PFB shows
that the onset potential for oxidation is 6.48 and 6.47 V for the
two samples, respectively. The results indicate a negligible (&#x0223c;10
mV) change in the electrochemical window upon addition of PFB for
the LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolyte. The LiTFSI samples show a completely
different behavior, where the onset oxidation potential is found to
be 5.94 and 5.82 V for the pure (1:9:0) and diluted (1:9:9) sample,
respectively. Thus, in the LiTFSI electrolyte, the electrochemical
stability window is reduced by &#x0223c;120 mV when PFB is added. Addition
of PFB lowers the oxidative current densities in both electrolytes;
however, the effect of PFB addition on the onset potentials differs
depending on the lithium salt in the electrolyte. The electrochemical
results appear to be conflicting, but the change in the bulk ionic
speciation of the samples explains the observed electrochemical behavior
since it has been previously observed that an increase in the cation&#x02013;anion
interaction leads to a larger electrochemical window of the electrolyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref></sup></p><p>To find a possible link and rationalize the effect of the

calculated using DFT computations (see Methods section). This method
is used because it has been previously shown that the HOMO&#x02013;LUMO
gap is correlated with the electrochemical stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">78</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref></sup> The HOMO&#x02013;LUMO gap for the free anion, SSIP, and CIP of both

LiTFSI, the HOMO&#x02013;LUMO gap is found to be similar for the CIP
and SSIP but significantly smaller for free TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. A similar trend is seen for the LiPF<sub>6</sub> species (free

SSIP &#x02248; CIP), albeit the consideration of aggregates as previously
demonstrated. Thus, the electrochemical data allow us to deduce the
same molecular mechanism resulting from the addition of PFB to the
two electrolytes. In the case of the LiTFSI sample, a weaker interaction
between Li<sup>+</sup> and its counterion resulting in less ion pairs
(both SSIPs and CIPs) and more free ions is observed when PFB is added.
These changes in speciation cause a decrease in the electrochemical
window. In contrast, the addition of the co-solvent leads to a stronger
Li&#x02013;anion interaction in the LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolyte, which
leads to the formation of more CIP and AGGs in the sample and maintains
the electrochemical window constant. Overall, the contrasting behaviors
observed in the electrochemical stability of the samples reflect a
shift in speciation toward more free ions (with reduced electrochemical
stability) in the case of the LiTFSI electrolytes and a shift toward
aggregates (with a similar electrochemical stability) in the case

ion electrolytes and their dilutions with
a co-solvent were characterized using experimental and computational
methods. Complementary IR and NMR spectroscopies showed a different
speciation for the two electrolytes with the increasing concentration
of the co-solvent. In the case of the LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolyte,
the anion forms aggregates when PFB is added, while the addition of
the co-solvent actually dissociates CIPs in the LiTFSI electrolyte.
The change in the speciation is also observed in the different electrophysicochemical
properties of the systems. The stronger Li&#x02013;anion interactions
in the LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolyte result in a higher conductivity,
lower viscosity, and no change in the electrochemical window with
the addition of the co-solvent. In contrast, the conductivity of the
LiTFSI electrolyte remains fairly constant irrespective of the PFB
concentration, while the addition of the co-solvent decreases both
the viscosity and the electrochemical window. The lower oxidative
stability is in agreement with the change in the speciation and their
computed electrochemical stability via the HOMO&#x02013;LUMO gap. The
difference in speciation appears to be caused by the formation of
a strong hydrogen bond between TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and the co-solvent.
In short, this study establishes that the addition of a co-solvent,
usually considered inert, can alter the ionic speciation of the electrolyte
species, and attempts to improve the transport properties through
a decrease in viscosity could inadvertently impact the electrochemical
properties of the system.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information is

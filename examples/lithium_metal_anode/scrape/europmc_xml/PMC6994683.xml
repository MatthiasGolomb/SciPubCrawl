This surface layer not only promotes uniform lithium deposition, but also facilitates the formation of a robust solid-electrolyte interface film comprising cross-linked polymer. As a result, lithium|lithium symmetric cells constructed using the octaphenyl polyoxyethylene additive exhibit excellent cycling stability over 400 cycles at 1&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, and outstanding rate performance up to 4&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

In particular, batteries combining the highest-capacity anode (lithium metal) with high-capacity cathodes (including oxygen and sulfur) have attracted significant attention. However, the major obstacles hindering the widespread practical applications of Li-O<sub>2</sub> and Li-S batteries are the problems related to the lithium metal anode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Issues resulted from dendritic lithium deposition, infinite volume change, and unstable solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layers all contribute to the impracticality of lithium metal batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Over the past several decades, researchers have developed various strategies to counteract these obstacles, including replacing Li metal with a LiX alloy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, developing new solid electrolytes or optimizing electrolyte components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, modifying separators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, constructing an artificial upper interfacial layer for Li metal anodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, designing two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2-D/3-D) Li-hosting materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and various other techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Several studies have shown that heterogeneous deposition of lithium is the main cause of dendritic lithium growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, many approaches to improve lithium metal-based batteries are aimed at regulating the uniformity of Li-ion distribution on the surface of the anode, in order to inhibit dendritic growth during plating and stripping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recently, Wu et al. reported a functional bilayer composite separator (GO-g-PAM) in which hydrophilic polyacrylamide chains homogenize Li deposition and suppress dendrite growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, Lu et al. directly introduced a quaternized polyethylene terephthalate nonwoven fabric (q-PET) as a multifunctional interlayer to simultaneously regulate Li ion distribution and reduce anion concentration gradients by utilizing the strong Li<sup>+</sup> affinity of polar ester functional groups on the backbone of q-PET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The application of these artificial interfacial layers results in dendrite-free lithium metal anodes, enabling the production of a stable SEI film, which prevents continuous consumption of electrolyte. However, the introduction of an additional functional layer on the separator or anode is fiscally ineffective, and also adds further complexities to the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the aforementioned strategies are all at a macro-scale, rendering their effectiveness highly dependent on the quality of surface contact with the electrolyte. Finally, while the introduction of an additional layer increases the electrode quality, it is at the expense of the overall energy density of the battery. In lieu of these macro-scale solutions, one potential alternative relies on the optimization of electrolyte components (e.g., the introduction of additives) to achieve the same effect as these artificial surface layers. In particular, additives must both regulate lithium deposition and facilitate the construction of a robust SEI film to impede consumption of the electrolyte without hampering efficiency, in order to create a safe and long-lasting battery.</p><p id="Par5">One promising additive is polyethylene oxide (PEO), which has been thoroughly studied as a polymer electrolyte in metal lithium batteries due to its ability to coordinate lithium ions, forming a PEO/lithium complex salt (PEO/Li<sup>+</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The directional motion of Li<sup>+</sup> in nanochannels formed by the PEO chains can facilitate ion transport and therefore increase ionic conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In addition, ethylene oxide (EO) groups can react with lithium metal, forming a SEI film to improve electrolyte safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Based on the aforementioned qualities, the use of PEO as an electrolyte additive in lithium metal batteries to regulate Li<sup>+</sup> deposition and form an ion-conductive surface layer to address the issue of lithium dendrites appears promising. However, PEO additives, such as poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME), have been shown to produce unstable SEI layers, causing continuous consumption of the additive, significantly decreasing the batteries&#x02019; cycle life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Over time, lithium dendrites form, eventually puncturing the SEI film and ultimately causing a short-circuit in the cell (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This has prevented such additives from being widely investigated, despite the widespread use of PEO as a solid electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, finding efficient polyether-based electrolyte additives that coordinate with Li<sup>+</sup> to facilitate homogeneous lithium deposition while also forming a robust SEI layer is highly desirable. This will not only improve the prospects of lithium metal batteries, but also could provide theoretical guidance in the design of future electrolyte additives.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Protection mechanism of OP-10 additive and morphology characterizations of Li deposition.</title><p>Schematic illustration of lithium deposition with and without various additives (<bold>a</bold>).

This allows the lithium metal anodes to remain dendrite-free even under high current densities. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, the OP-10 additives contain hydrophilic EO chains that coordinate with Li<sup>+</sup> to form PEO/Li<sup>+</sup> complexes near the anode surface, thereby controlling Li deposition. Long phenyl carbon chains form a resilient crosslinked 3-D network to improve the structural and chemical stability of the EO groups, preventing the consumption of the additives during cycling. The SEI film formed in cells containing the OP-10 additive is very flexible and stable, and successfully reduces contact between the electrolyte solvent and the anode surface, which can impede the continuous consumption of electrolyte solvent and formation of dendrites on the lithium metal anode, enabling the long-term stability of Li stripping and plating even at a high current density. By regulating lithium deposition at the molecular level, full cells comprising with a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode and a metal lithium anode modified with OP-10 can run up to 1000 cycles with an extremely low capacity decay of 0.023% per cycle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of the lithium anode surface</title><p id="Par7">In situ optical microscopy was used to monitor the Li deposition process as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> where no additives in electrolyte, Li dendrites start to grow on the surface of the lithium foil only after 1&#x02009;min. When 6&#x02009;min passed, completing coating of Li dendrites on the surface of the lithium foil can be observed. In contrast, after usage of OP-10 additive in the electrolyte, there are no any lithium dendrites on lithium foil even after 6&#x02009;min of plating (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). These results indicate that the OP-10 additives effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites on lithium foil. Similar plating experiment on copper foil was performed and the results are given in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d&#x02013;g</xref>. Without the additive, lithium deposition was observed to be highly non-uniform, resulting in the presence of several holes and large cracks on the foil surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>). These defects can result in continuous consumption of the electrolyte and a commensurate decrease in Coulombic efficiency during cycling. In contrast, when OP-10 was added to the electrolyte, the homogeneity of lithium deposition improved markedly, with nearly imperceptible holes and cracks on the electrode surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f, g</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">A similar phenomenon is observed in the SEM analysis of copper foil surface over three cycles of Li plating and stripping (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Without the additive, the SEI film exhibited several defects, with holes readily observed throughout the surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). When a PEGDME additive was introduced into the system, the homogeneity of the SEI film was improved, but still contained many small holes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). This non-uniform film is not stable, as it allows for a continuous reaction to happen between the Li anode and the electrolyte, eventually leading to the appearance of uncontrollable dendrite growth, as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. In contrast, the addition of the OP-10 additive resulted in a dense and stable SEI film remaining after Li stripping (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). Ultimately, this stable film can prevent dendritic growth, thus improving electrochemical performance.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>SEM analysis of the lithium anode.</title><p>Top view SEM images of lithium stripping after three cycles at 0.5&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for 0.4&#x02009;h with untreated electrolyte (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>), with PEGDME (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>), and OP-10 additives (<bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) (Scale bars: <bold>a</bold>, <bold>c</bold>, <bold>e</bold> 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m; <bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, <bold>f</bold> 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;m).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2020_14505_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e575"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Meanwhile, to further verify the inhibit effect of dendrite after introducing OP-10 additives, the SEM images of Li anode and corresponding EDS element analysis after cycling are also given (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). With the addition of 5% OP-10, a smooth and dense surface of Li can be observed (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, c</xref>), while mossy Li deposits can be observed using electrolyte with 5% PEGDME (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b, d</xref>). In addition, it should be noted that the content of F element in the SEI film determined by EDS elemental analysis is much higher with OP-10 additives as compared to that with PEGDME additives (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e, f</xref>). LiF-rich interface layers not only can make the SEI film more stable, but also can enhance Li<sup>+</sup> surface diffusion rate to suppress the growth of Li dendrites during the following cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, the Li dendrite could be effectively inhibited. It is obvious the morphology and surface composition of Li anodes are different with the addition of PEGDME and OP-10 electrolyte additives, and such differences produce the different protective effect on Li anode. As these two electrolyte additives contain the same C&#x02013;O groups, thus, the protective effect difference should mainly arise from the long carbon chains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electrochemical performance of symmetric cells with OP-10 additive</title><p id="Par10">To investigate the long cycle stability and high-rate capability of electrolytes containing OP-10, Li|Li and Li|Cu&#x000a0;symmetric cells were analyzed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a&#x02013;c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) using electrolytes with and without additive. Cells with 5% OP-10 additive cycled stably up to 400 cycles at a current density of 1&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> with a constant capacity of 0.5&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; 200 cycles at a current density of 2&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> with a constant capacity of 1&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; and 160 cycles at a current density of 4&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> with a unchanged capacity of 1&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Under the same conditions, Li|Li symmetric cells without the additive showed significant fluctuations in voltage, suggesting severe instability of the lithium anode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. With the increasing of the cycles, the cells without additive exhibited increased polarization compared to the cells with the added OP-10. The Li anode modified by the OP-10 additive exhibited an overpotential of 100&#x02009;mV at 1&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, which increased slightly to 130.2&#x02009;mV and 188.5&#x02009;mV at 2&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and 4&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, respectively (enlarged subplots of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a&#x02013;c</xref>). On the contrary, a much higher overpotential can be observed for the cells without OP-10, eventually causing a short circuit. To further illustrate the stability using OP-10 additives, the coulombic efficiency of Li|Cu&#x000a0;symmetric cells with and without OP-10 additive were demonstrated in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>. As shown, the cell with OP-10 additives demonstrated a stable voltage profile, indicating an excellent coulombic efficiency, while for the cell without OP-10, charge capacity decreased dramatically after 30 cycles, which indicated fast decay of coulombic efficiency. Especially, after 40 cycles, irregular voltage profiles at the trailing end can be observed for the cell without additives, indicating that Li anode has been seriously damaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The elevated polarization, increased overpotential and low coulombic efficiency in cells without additive can be attributed to the formation of lithium dendrites and pulverization of metallic lithium during repeated cycling process, which can be identified by the SEM images of anodes after cycling 50 cycles (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

The observed electrochemical stability could be due to the adsorption of the PEO-based additives onto the metal Li surface, allowing these complexes to regulate the deposition of lithium during the charge&#x02013;discharge process. The capacitance of PEO-based additives was significantly lower than that of the unmodified electrolyte, and a capacitance peak appears at &#x02212;0.56&#x02009;V for both OP-10 and PEGDME, showing the adsorption of additive to the electrode surface and formation of a thick double layer (SEI membrane)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

From this data, it is clear that Li|Li symmetric cells containing OP-10 additives showed much higher cycling stability than those containing OP-4, OP-7, OP-15, or OP-50. This discrepancy in the stability can be attributed to the lengths of the EO chains. If the EO chains are too short, PEO/Li<sup>+</sup> complexes cannot be fully formed, resulting in inadequate regulation of lithium deposition and thus, the formation of lithium dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, though the increased EO chain length can promote uniform deposition of lithium, the excessively long chains may also result in unstable SEI films. In order to explain this phenomenon, the stabilities of self-assembled adsorbed layers containing EO chains of varying lengths were quantified using the Zeta potential of the lithium anode (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). A higher Zeta potential allows for a more stable self-assembled OP/Li<sup>+</sup> layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, causing the SEI film formed during cycling to be more robust.

And therefore, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, its cycling behavior is much less stable. It is reasonable to assume that the improvement in the cycling behavior of cells containing OP-10 additives is mainly due to the long carbon chain of the OP-10.

It is obvious the conductivity of the electrolyte is mainly decided by the concentration of Li salts and the viscosity of the solvent. For the electrolyte systems in this work, the much lower viscosity after introducing additives can offer a higher conductivity, and thus better Li ion mobility could be obtained. Such an enhancement can be directly confirmed by the testing of Li ion mobility via the pulse-field gradient method.

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>, the electrolyte with 5% OP-10 additive shows the lowest viscosity, thus corresponding to better electrochemical performance. Additionally, the contact angle of the electrolyte with 5% OP-10 is only 17.67&#x000b0;, markedly lower than the 23.97&#x000b0; angle measured for the 5% PEGDME additive (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). This delta in contact angle indicates that the OP-10 additive is more lithiophilic, and therefore can be more easily and homogenously absorbed onto the surface of the Li anode. These advantages of OP-10, combined with the optimized chain length described above, contribute to the increased cycling stability observed in Li|Li symmetric cells containing OP-10. The lithiophilic EO chains regulate Li<sup>+</sup> deposition, while the long carbon chains help to form a dense and stable SEI film to inhibit dendrite growth and change the properties of OP-10-containing electrolytes to facilitate ion transport.</p><p id="Par18">Having optimized the composition and chain length of the electrolyte additive, the influence of the OP-10 concentration to the cycling stability of Li|Li symmetric cells was investigated. The cells with 5% OP-10 additive were found to exhibit the highest cycling stability and the smallest voltage polarization (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). When the additive concentration is below 5%, there is not sufficient OP-10/Li<sup>+</sup> complexation to produce a robust layer on the anode surface. However, at excessively high additive concentrations, the intrinsic properties of the electrolyte are significantly altered so that stable OP-10/Li<sup>+</sup> layer cannot be formed either. The stability of the adsorbed layer formed by the electrolytes containing different concentrations of OP-10 was quantified using the Zeta potential of the Li anode, as above. The Li foil modified by 5% OP-10 exhibits the highest Zeta potential, approximately 40&#x02009;mV, corresponding to the most stable OP-10/Li<sup>+</sup> layer, and therefore the most stable SEI, on the Li anode (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Small amounts of OP-10 additive decrease the contact angle between the electrolyte and lithium foil (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>), allowing the modified electrolyte to be more homogenously absorbed onto the surface of the Li anode. The decreased contact angle also corresponds to the decreased electrolyte viscosity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), facilitating Li<sup>+</sup> transport and thus enhancing cycling performance. However, the concentration is above 5%, the OP-10 molecules aggregate to form micelles, causing a dramatic increase in the contact angle (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13e, f</xref>) and viscosity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), hindering the ion transport and the stable SEI formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.

This indicates that the electrolyte containing the OP-10 additive is much more stable and less likely to undergo redox reactions during cycling.

Conversely, the cells with the additives form a more stable SEI film, significantly improving the Li<sup>+</sup> transport and decreasing <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> values compared to both blank electrolytes and electrolytes before cycling (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The cell with the OP-10 additive exhibited the lowest <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> value, corresponding to the most stable and dense SEI film, as confirmed by SEM, EDS, and LSV, which explains its excellent electrochemical performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">The addition of OP-10 additives to the electrolytes results in improved homogeneity of lithium deposition due to the complexation of the lithiophilic EO functional groups with Li<sup>+</sup>, which tunes lithium deposition and prevents lithium dendrite growth. In addition, in contrast to the conventional PEO, the OP-10 additives not only enhance the chemical and electrochemical stability of the electrolyte, but also act as a cross-linking template to construct a stable, dense SEI layer that improves Li<sup>+</sup> transport and reduces the consumption of the electrolyte. As a result, lithium anodes modified with OP-10 additives in Li|Li symmetric cells demonstrated stable cycling stability for 400 cycles at a current density of 1&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. When the OP-10 modified Li anode was employed in Li|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> full cells, it also exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate capability. At a high current density of 10&#x02009;C, the Li|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> full cells containing OP-10 exhibited a high reversible capacity of approximately 67.1&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 1000 cycles, which is three times higher than that of the cells without additives. The electrolyte containing OP-10 was found to be extremely stable against high charge&#x02013;discharge voltage, and could withstand voltages of up to 5&#x02009;V. To further verify this superiority, high voltage Li|LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> full cells were assembled and tested. As shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18b, c</xref>, the Li|LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> full cells with blank electrolyte, OP-10 electrolyte and PEGDME electrolyte show the similar charge&#x02013;discharge voltage profiles, but after 50 cycles, this full cell with OP-10 additives shows a much more stable voltage profile than that of full cells with blank electrolyte and PEGDME electrolyte.

Moreover, it also pioneers a new electrolyte additive for the production of safer, longer-lasting and higher-voltage lithium-based batteries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par26">Octaphenyl polyoxyethyiene (OP-4, OP-7, OP-10, OP-15, and OP-50) was obtained from Shandong Yousuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd.

electrochemical measurements were investigated via coin cells at room temperature. All the batteries were measured in the ester-based electrolyte (30&#x02009;&#x000b5;L). The balnk electrolytewas 1.0&#x02009;M lithium hexafluorophosphate dissolved in mixing solvents of propylene carbonate (PC), ethyl carbonate (EC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) with a volume ratio of 1:4:5. For the modifited electrolyte, 5.0% (volume) additives were added in the blank electrolyte. The Li|Li symmetrical cells were conducted at current densities of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, respectively. To test the electrochemical performances of Li|LiFPO<sub>4</sub> (LFP, Shanghai Darui Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.), Li|LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCM) and Li|Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LTO, Shenzhen Beite Rui New Energy Materials Co., Ltd.) batteries, LFP, NCM, or LTO were used as the cathode and Li foil was used as the anode. To fabricate the LFP, NCM, or LTO electrode, LFP, NCM, or LTO, carbon black, and polyvinylidene difluoride in a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to form a homogeneous slurry, and then coated this slurry onto the aluminum foil or copper foil. After dying at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 12&#x02009;h, all the above batteries were galvanostatically cycled on the battery testing system (LAND, CT2001). Li|LFP cells were performed between 2.5 and 4.2&#x02009;V (vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) at current densities of 1, 2, 5, and 10&#x02009;C (1&#x02009;C&#x02009;=&#x02009;170&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Li|LTO cells were performed between 1.0 and 2.5&#x02009;V (vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) at current densities of 1, 2, 5, and 10&#x02009;C (1&#x02009;C&#x02009;=&#x02009;175&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Li|NCM cells were performed between 3.0 and 4.7&#x02009;V (vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) at current densities of 1&#x02009;C (1&#x02009;C&#x02009;=&#x02009;280&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The mass loading of the LFP, LTO and NCM electrodes are about 1.0&#x02013;1.2, 1.2, and 1.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were obtained with copper foil as the working electrode and Li foil as a counter electrode between 2.8 and 5.0&#x02009;V under a scan rate of 10&#x02009;mV&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using an Solartron 1287 electrochemical workstation at an amplitude of 5&#x02009;mV over a frequency range between 10 mHz and 100&#x02009;kHz. With the same instrument, the differential capacitance-potential curves were studied.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>

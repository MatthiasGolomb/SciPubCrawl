From a design perspective, aliphatic alkyl chains, without allyl, hydroxyl, <italic>etc.</italic> reactive groups, are used to enhance chemical and electrochemical stability; alkyl chain asymmetry around the phosphonium is maintained to minimize potential crystallization or packing interactions; dicationic phosphoniums are evaluated given their enhanced thermal stability compared to mono-phosphoniums; counter ion size and basicity are altered to vary viscosity. Increasing the chain length from C2 to C10 enhances thermal and electrochemical stability while selection of the TFSI anion decreases the viscosity and increases the ion conductivity elative to the chloride, bromide and tetrafluoroborate samples. Phase transitions are observed for dicationic phosphoniums between &#x02013;70 and 100 &#x000b0;C.

All three batteries possessed high capacities of about 135 mA h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the initial cycle similar to conventional room temperature LiCoO<sub>2</sub> based batteries. However, the battery with 0.3 M LiTFSI suffered from significant capacity loss during cycling, which decreased to less than 5 mA g h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> after 20 cycles along with low coulombic efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and S3<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>).

Efficient and safe recovery of petroleum from new and existing reservoirs requires diagnostic technologies for mapping the pH, sulfur content, temperature, pressure, <italic>etc.</italic> Current sensors are attached <italic>via</italic> wirelines for power, and, although useful, the areas that can be reached using wirelines are limited.<xref rid="cit46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The next generation of downhole oil sensors will be self-powered freely mobile devices that can migrate throughout a reservoir. The power requirements are estimated to be around 60 &#x003bc;W for these devices with micro-scale dimensions, and the battery must operate at elevated temperatures, such as 100 &#x000b0;C,<xref rid="cit48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="cit49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> for a short 1&#x02013;2 day period (<italic>e.g.</italic>, temperature bore logger) or as long as 6 months.<xref rid="cit46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> An energy density calculation reveals the first cycle provides 568 W h kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (Fig. S4<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>), and this value decreases to 303 W h kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> after 70 cycles. Thus, the above LMB meets the power specifications and could power a microsensor for approximately 100 hours after one charge.</p><p>An additional design requirement for the battery is that it delivers power at elevated temperatures and remains off during work transitions or during storage at room temperature to conserve power. We hypothesized that the significant temperature-conductivity dependence of the phosphonium electrolyte would provide a mechanism for switching the battery between off and on as a function of temperature. Li ion transport would occur readily at high temperatures but not at low temperatures. Charge&#x02013;discharge cycles were performed with the LMB (Li, LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, mono-(C<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PC<sub>10</sub>-TFSI, 1.6 M LiTFSI) from 25 to 120 &#x000b0;C, and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, the voltage&#x02013;time profiles were measured for five cycles at each temperature. A constant current rate of C/7 was maintained to charge and discharge the battery between 3 and 4.2 V. At 25 &#x000b0;C, the battery does not operate due to a lack of ion mobility, which forces the voltage to quickly switch between the maximum and minimum. This result is in agreement with the conductivity measurements. Increasing the temperature to 60 or 80 &#x000b0;C decreases the viscosity but still afforded relatively fast charge and discharge cycles &#x02013; characteristic of a viscous electrolyte with poor ion mobility-, and therefore low capacity. However, upon increasing the temperature to 100 &#x000b0;C, the battery functions with full charge and discharge cycles. Further increasing the temperature to 120 &#x000b0;C showed good capacity retention over 5 cycles, however the capacity decreased with additional cycles as the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathode deteriorates at these high temperatures. A second experiment was performed to test the robustness of the battery's response towards temperature, as well as the ability to retain capacity after subjected to a significant temperature change. The LMB was operated at 100 &#x000b0;C for 20 charge&#x02013;discharged cycles and then placed at rest for 2 weeks at room temperature. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>, upon subsequent heating to 100 &#x000b0;C and performing charge&#x02013;discharged cycles, the battery exhibited no significant loss of capacity (&#x0223c;0.7%) due to self discharge at room temperature. Even if the battery was cycled at room temperature, the capacity decay is minimal due to the property of the ionic liquid chosen (see Fig. S5<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>(A) Charge&#x02013;discharge voltage profile of the thermally responsive ionic liquid electrolyte in a (Li, LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, mono-(C<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PC<sub>10</sub>-TFSI, 1.6 M LiTFSI) cell (current rate C/7).

The chemical stability of the ionic liquid was confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy before and after high temperature cycling, and therefore the electrolyte decomposition is not a likely cause.

Samples were also tested with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 20 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and a cooling rate of 10 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> from &#x02013;70 to 200 &#x000b0;C. All samples were measured between 5 to 10 mg and scanned for three heat&#x02013;cool cycles.</p><p>The conductivity measurements were performed using a Conductivity Meter (K912, Consort) that has a 4-electrode cell to prevent the polarization error and fouling of the electrode. The ionic liquid electrolytes were dried at 100 &#x000b0;C under high-vacuum overnight to remove any trace amount of moisture before testing. Samples were loaded in test tubes sealed with septum stopper in order to maintain N<sub>2</sub> environment. A heating block was used to control the temperature and stirring was maintained during the measurement to maintain homogeneity. A 30 minute equilibration time was used at each temperature.</p><p>To analyze the electrochemical stability window lithium/lithium/platinum three-electrode system was assembled and sealed in the glove box. Then cyclic voltammetries at 1 mV s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> between &#x02013;0.2 V and 6.5 V <italic>versus</italic> Li<sup>+</sup>/Li were carried out using a Princeton Applied Research VersaStat. A multichannel Princeton Applied Research VersaStat battery tester was used for cycle testing. LiCoO<sub>2</sub> discs (area = 1.4 cm<sup>2</sup>) were punched out of the electrode film (MTI), and assembled into CR2032 coin cells along with equal-sized metallic lithium discs (0.75 mm thick) and Celgard 480 separators. All cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with a dew point of &#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C. The cells were equilibrated at 25 or 100 &#x000b0;C in an oven. The potential window was 3.0 V to 4.2 V at C/7.</p><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Zeiss SUPRA 40VP field emission SEM. Samples were gently washed with dimethyl carbonate and were allowed to dry for 24 h in the glove box. The samples were loaded with the protection of argon and were imaged at an accelerating voltage of 1.5 to 2 kV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><alt-text>Supplementary information</alt-text><media xlink:href="SC-006-C5SC01518A-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported in part by the Advanced Energy Consortium (AEC) and the National Science Foundation (CHEM 1012464).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="cit1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamath</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tarascon</surname><given-names>J.-M.</given-names></name></person-group><source>Science</source><year>2011</year><volume>334</volume><fpage>928</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22096188</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="cit2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Aric&#x000f2;</surname><given-names>A.

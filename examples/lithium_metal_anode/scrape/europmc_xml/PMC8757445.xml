solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) for high energy
density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) usually needs to take into
account of the interfacial compatibility against lithium metal and
the electrolyte stability suitable for a high-potential cathode. In
this study, through a facile two-step coating process, novel double-layer
solid composite electrolytes (SCEs) with Janus characteristics are
customized for the high-voltage LMBs with improved room-temperature
cycling performance. Among which, high-voltage resistant poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) is adopted here for the construction of an electrolyte
layer facing the cathode, while the other layer against the lithium
anode is composed of the polymer matrix of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
blended with PVDF to obtain a lithium metal-friendly interface. With
the further incorporation of Laponite clay, the PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L
SCEs not only exhibit improved mechanical properties, but also achieve
a highly increased ionic conductivity (5.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) and lithium ion migration number (0.471)
at room temperature. The assembled NCM523|PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L
SCEs|Li cells thus are able to deliver the initial discharge capacity
of 153.9 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with 80.8% capacity retention after
200 cycles at 0.3 C. Such easily manufactured double-layer SCEs capable
of operating steadily at room temperature provide a competitive electrolyte
option for high-voltage solid-state LMBs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21908037</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education of the People''s Republic of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100002338</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JZ2021HGTB0119</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91834301</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao1c05576</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao1c05576</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Relying on the extremely
high theoretical specific capacity (3860
mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) and ultralow potential (&#x02212;3.04 V
vs standard hydrogen electrode) of lithium metal anodes, lithium metal
batteries (LMBs) have been expected to be one of the most promising
energy storage devices with high energy density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> On the one hand, however, an unstable
solid electrolyte interface (SEI) often forms in conventional LMBs
owing to the heterogeneous lithium deposition and natural reaction
between liquid electrolyte and lithium metal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> which
seriously hinders the exertion of battery capacity or even causes
a battery short circuit due to the accompanying uncontrolled lithium
dendrite growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> On the other hand, to maximize
the energy density of batteries, lithium metal anodes need to be matched
with high-voltage cathodes, and it thus puts forward urgent demands
for more stable electrolytes enabling sustained high voltage. To solve
these issues, various strategies have been explored, such as constructing
artificial SEI layers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> adding electrolyte fillers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> replacing the
liquid electrolyte with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Among them, introducing SSEs
into LMBs has received the most attention due to their high safety
and effective lithium dendrite inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Accordingly, developing the SSEs with excellent interfacial compatibility
to lithium metal anodes as well as high-voltage stability to cathodes
for high-performance LMBs becomes particularly critical and is of
great significance.</p><p>Generally, SSEs include solid inorganic
electrolytes (SIEs), solid
polymer electrolytes (SPEs), and solid composite electrolytes (SCEs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> SIEs have attracted attention mainly because
of their high ionic conductivity and large moduli for lithium dendrite
inhibition, but their inherent mechanical brittleness and high interface
impedance leads to severely limited utilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Compared with
SIEs, SPEs are known for the easier processing, higher mechanical
flexibility, and better interfacial compatibility, while they always
show a low ionic conductivity at 25 &#x000b0;C (&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), which is hard to meet the normal operation
of room-temperature batteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> As a solution to the issues, SCEs constructed through compounding
inorganic fillers with SPEs are considered to be the most promising
candidate for safe electrolytes on account of the combined advanced
features of SIEs and SPEs, such as acceptable ionic conductivity,
good interface contact with electrodes, improved mechanical strength
to realize lithium dendrite inhibition, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Unfortunately, a monocomponent
polymer matrix for SCEs is still powerless to satisfy the increasingly
diversified demands.</p><p>For instance, as one of the most extensively
researched polymer
electrolyte substrates, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) possesses excellent
stability to the lithium metal anodes with low potential as well as
fine interface contact with the electrodes owing to the soft texture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> but it shows poor mechanical property when mixed with high-content
lithium salt, and more seriously, it suffers gradual oxidation or
decomposition once matched with high-voltage cathodes (&#x0003e;3.9 V).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> By contrast, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) that is also employed
as a common polymer electrolyte material can exhibit a wide electrochemical
window enabling constant high voltage due to the existence of strongly
electron withdrawing groups (&#x02212;C&#x02013;F),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> while its interface to lithium metal anodes always appears
unstable, resulting in poor cycling performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> The promising efforts to overcome such incompatibility between a
wide electrochemical window and good interface stability focuses on
constructing multilayer SCEs with Janus characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p><p>Herein, novel double-layer SCEs consisting
of an antioxidative
PVDF-based layer facing the cathode and a lithium metal-friendly (PEO+PVDF)-based
layer against the anode, are proposed for room-temperature high-voltage
LMBs. Specially, the bipolymer feature of the (PEO+PVDF)-based layer
therein not only endows the electrolytes with excellent lithium affinity
but also avoids the PEO-introduced mechanical softness with the help
of the mechanical support of PVDF polymers. Moreover, laponite clay
as an inorganic nanofiller is creatively incorporated into the whole
SCE membranes to further improve the mechanical properties for lithium
dendrite inhibition as well as realize higher ionic conductivity and
larger lithium ion migration number (<italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup>). As a result, the SCEs with Janus characteristics (denoted
as PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L) exhibit the advantages of both a wide electrochemical
window and excellent interfacial compatibility to lithium metal; meanwhile,
the solid-state LMBs assembled with PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L SCEs, high-voltage
NCM523 cathodes, and lithium anodes are able to deliver a high specific
capacitance and improved cycling and rate performance at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Result

SCEs
can be accurately reflected by the DSC curves. As presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b, the (PEO+PVDF)
SPEs show a much lower melting temperature of 112.5 &#x000b0;C than that
of PVDF SPEs (150.5 &#x000b0;C), owing to the natural lower crystallinity
of PEO compared to PVDF polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> As expected,
the double-layer PVDF/(PEO+PVDF) SPEs thus possess the combined crystallinity
characteristics with the two melting points of 114.8 and 150.7 &#x000b0;C
corresponding the (PEO+PVDF) and PVDF components, respectively. Consistent
with the XRD results, with the addition of laponite clay, the PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L
SCEs exhibit the overall decreased melting temperature of 106.6 and
145.2 &#x000b0;C, suggesting the reduced crystallinity and enlarged amorphous
area introduced by the disruption on the arrangement of polymer chains,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> which will be beneficial for the rapid migration of Li<sup>+</sup> in the polymer matrix resulting in a higher ionic conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><p>The thermal stability of PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L SCEs is evaluated
through

slow and synchronous weight variation in the initial stage and sudden
mass loss about at 300 &#x000b0;C, which are mainly attributed to the
volatilization of remained DMF plasticizer inside the electrolyte
membranes and the accelerated decomposition of polymer matrix caused
by the addition of lithium salt, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the thermal decomposition temperature at 300 &#x000b0;C
is still enough for the PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L SCEs operated in room-temperature
LMBs. Furthermore, EA and FT-IR measurements are carried out to separately
investigate the content and existing form of the residual DMF solvent.
The EA result shows that the calculated mass percentage of remaining
DMF is about 20 wt % in all the electrolyte membranes (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.1c05576/suppl_file/ao1c05576_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>). More importantly, this low content

the introduction of PEO, the blending (PEO+PVDF) SPEs can exhibit

thus delivers a lower initial overpotential and a slightly improved

PVDF/(PEO+PVDF)-L SCEs membranes are
successfully fabricated by a facile two-step coating process and applied

the antioxidative PVDF-L layer ensures a good potential tolerance
for high-voltage cathode adaptation, whereas the (PEO+PVDF)-L layer
in contact with the anode is responsible for providing lithium metal
affinity. Especially, the introduction of laponite clay inside not
only helps to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at room temperature but
also improves the mechanical properties and meanwhile increases the <italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup> up to 0.471 for better lithium

exhibit a significantly enhanced electrochemical stability against
lithium metal with the cycling life over 470 h and deliver the initial
discharge capacity as high as 153.9 mAh g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with
the capacity retention up to 80.8% after 200 cycles, when matched

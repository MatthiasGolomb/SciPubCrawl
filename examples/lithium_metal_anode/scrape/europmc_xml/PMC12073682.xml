Introduction</title><p>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have been considered one of the next-generation rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity, low electrochemical potential, and gravimetric density [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, the growth of Li dendrites seriously deteriorates the stability of the Li depositing/stripping process, which may lead to a short cycle lifespan and even safety hazards of LMBs [<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>As a crucial component of an LMB, the separator not only isolates the anode and cathode to prevent short circuits of the battery but also provides channels for ion transport [<xref rid="B3-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Its properties play an important role in the working life of batteries [<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, traditional polyolefin separators display poor wettability to a liquid electrolyte, which would cause non-uniform transportation of lithium ions and the generation of lithium dendrites [<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, the PE/PP separators are prone to shrinkage at high temperatures, resulting in the contact between anode and cathode and further thermal runaway [<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Different from polyolefin separators, cellulose-based materials with outstanding electrolyte wettability and thermal stability show great potential application in the LMBs [<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Neither the source of cellulose isolation nor the method of its isolation are guaranteed for successful use as a separator [<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, although cellulose-based materials are known to have high mechanical strength due to their abundant inter-/intra-hydrogen bonds in the dry state, the derived separator may suffer from serious strength weakening after soaking in the electrolyte. This phenomenon could be attributed to the swelling and softening behaviors of the separator caused by electrolytes, which would affect the cycle performance of the assembled battery [<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In order to solve this issue, researchers have tried to enhance the wet strength of cellulose-based separators in liquid electrolytes. Xie [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] prepared the separator by casting of the lignosulfonate powder and bleached eucalyptus cellulose pulp in a mold. The wet tensile strength of the separator achieved approximately 22 MPa due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the lignin and cellulose molecules. The bulk resistance of the separator seemed to be high and its cycle performance was not investigated. Lv [<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] fabricated a cellulose-based separator by blending cellulose pulp and cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) followed by filtration. The separator demonstrated a wet tensile strength of 28 MPa, and the assembled cell displayed a capacity retention of 91% after 100 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, due to the covalent crosslinking between lignosulfonate&#x02013;polyamide-epichlorohydrin complex (LPC) nanoparticles and CNFs, the resulting separator displayed a capacity retention of 92.2% after 160 cycles at 1 C [<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. </p><p>To further improve the comprehensive properties of cellulose-based separators, the side reactions during cycling should be considered. According to the literature, the hydroxyl groups in the separators would react with Li<sup>+</sup> ions, leading to deterioration in the interface stability as well as a reduction in the charge/discharge efficiency [<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the reaction between the residual trace water in the cellulose-based separators and LiPF<sub>6</sub> may cause the formation of HF, which would impair the stability of separators and SEI layers to make their cycle life degrade [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Based on the above discussion, in this work, a novel cellulose-based separator was designed by fiber propionylation and silane crosslinking to reduce the side reactions aroused by hydroxyl groups and enhance the wet strength in liquid electrolytes to further improve its cycling properties. The optimal addition dosage of silane for the separator was investigated by characterization of its physiochemical and electrochemical properties. Finally, the action mechanism on the cycle performance of the separator was elucidated using molecular simulation and element analysis on the Li foil in a separator-assembled cell after cycling.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-17-01203"><title>2.

Degree of substitution (DS), tensile strength, thermal stability, thermal dimensional stability, porosity, and electrolyte uptake ratio were determined according to the literature [<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The contact angle was obtained using a contact angle measuring instrument (DSA100, KRUSS, Hamburg, Germany). Ionic conductivity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were measured on an electrochemical working station (PGSTAT302N, Autolab, Herisau, Switzerland). The electrochemical window was measured in the assembled Li/separator/LiFeO<sub>4</sub> cell. Rate capability and cycle performance of Li/separator/LiFeO<sub>4</sub> cells were conducted on the battery testing system (LAND CT 2001A, Wuhan, China) at room temperature.

Molecular Simulation</title><p>In order to elucidate the effect of silane crosslinking on the wet strength of propionylated cellulose fibers, molecular simulation was conducted using the software of Materials Studio 17.1 [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cellulose with a degree of polymerization of 10 was chosen as the model. The degree of substitution of the propionylated cellulose model was 1.10, while the grafting ratio of silane in the propionylated cellulose model was 0.20. The Forcite mechanical properties of the above models in a vacuum atmosphere and electrolyte solvents (EC, DMC, and DEC) were calculated in the COMPASS force field. In brief, the amount of solvent molecules was set to 60 in the mix model. The Anderson and Berendsen method was used for temperature and pressure control, respectively, in the process of energy optimization and molecular dynamics simulation according to the literature [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-polymers-17-01203"><title>3. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-polymers-17-01203"><title>3.1. Design Idea</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the preparation process of the PBF-GPTMS separator mainly involved two chemical reactions, including fiber propionylation and silane crosslinking. In the process of propionylation, the ester groups were introduced to the surface of the cellulose fibers, leading to fiber swelling in the carbonated electrolyte based on the &#x0201c;similarity-intermiscibility&#x0201d; principle. Although this phenomenon would endow the resulting separator with high electrolyte absorption and ionic conductivity, its low wet strength in the electrolyte would seriously affect the cycle performance of the assembled battery [<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In order to solve this problem, silane was employed to crosslink the propionylated cellulose fibers. As a common crosslinking agent, GPTMS creates covalent bonding between the fibers, including C-O-Si and Si-O-Si bonds, which could improve the mechanical properties of cellulose-based materials [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, it is known that the electrolyte molecule (LiPF<sub>6</sub>) would be hydrolyzed to produce PF<sub>5</sub> and HF during battery working. The PF<sub>5</sub> could be further hydrolyzed to form HF [<xref rid="B20-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which may promote corrosion of the battery. Thanks to the lone pair electrons in the formed Si-O-C structure in the PBF-GPTMS separator, HF could be scavenged to enhance the working lifespan of the assembled battery [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-17-01203"><title>3.2. Chemical Structure and Morphology</title><p>The chemical structure of the PBF-GPTMS separator was investigated in detail. <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of the BF, PBF, and PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separators. Compared with the BF separator, the PBF separator displayed a new peak at 1740 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which was attributed to the stretching vibration of the O-C=O groups [<xref rid="B21-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This indicated the successful modification of the cellulose fibers. By titration, the degree of substitution (DS) value of the PBF was calculated to be 1.10 [<xref rid="B22-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Further crosslinking by silane resulted in to PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator displaying no signal of the C-O-Si and Si-O-Si groups, which could be due to its coincidence with the C-O-C groups on the cellulose structure [<xref rid="B23-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In order to further identify the chemical composition of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator, the XPS technique was employed and the according spectra are shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b. It can be seen that the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator exhibited a new Si 2p peak at 101 eV in comparison with that of the PBF separator [<xref rid="B24-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, the C 1s regions were deconvoluted to further understand the chemical structure of the separators (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c,d). As for the PBF separator, the relative peak area of the C-O structure was 86.31%, which decreased to 78.61% after silane crosslinking. Furthermore, the Si 2p deconvolution spectra of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator confirmed the chemical attachment of silane to the cellulose fibers via C-O-Si and Si-O-Si bonds (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>e) [<xref rid="B25-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p><xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>f shows the XRD patterns of the BF, PBF, and PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separators. Two typical peaks were observed at 16.1&#x000b0; and 22.5&#x000b0; in the BF separator, which could be ascribed to the (101) and (002) lattice planes of cellulose I, respectively [<xref rid="B26-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Its degree of crystallinity was determined to be 76.4% by Segal&#x02019;s equation. Although the PBF and PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separators displayed the same XRD patterns as the BF separator, their crystallinity was found to be 61.8% and 61.9%, respectively. This phenomenon may be attributed to the chemical reaction occurring in the crystalline phase of cellulose molecules during propionylation with pyridine as the catalyst [<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The decreased crystallinity of the separators may be beneficial to ion transportation [<xref rid="B27-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Apart from the chemical structure, the microstructure of the separators also plays a key role in their electrochemical properties. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>g,h, the PBF-GPTMS separator exhibited a denser and more uniform pore structure in comparison with the PBF separator. Such morphology would endow the separator with higher mechanical strength and more homogenous deposition as well as the transportation of Li<sup>+</sup> ions. In addition, the silicon element was evenly distributed on the surface of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator, which further confirmed the homogeneity of the separator (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>i) [<xref rid="B29-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-polymers-17-01203"><title>3.3. Physicochemical Properties</title><p>The good mechanical properties of the separators could prevent the internal short-circuit to promote the safety of the assembled LMBs [<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As depicted in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a, the tensile strength of the PBF separator was 14.73 MPa. After silane blending, the generated PBF-GPTMS separators showed tensile strength from 15.10 MPa to 30.11 MPa with the increased doping content of GPTMS. This indicated the strength enhancement of the separator by silane crosslinking. Additionally, as the GPTMS content increased to 10%, the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator displayed the highest elongation at a break of 9.10%. This could facilitate stress dissipation when the separator is subjected to external forces, thus preventing its premature fracture [<xref rid="B30-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further increasing the silane content leads to a decrease in the strain of the separator due to stress concentration [<xref rid="B31-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Since the separator is immersed in the liquid electrolyte during the working of the battery, it is necessary to know its wet strength. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b, the tensile strength of the PBF separator was only 4.20 MPa after soaking in the electrolyte, which could be attributed to the swelling and softening effect of the electrolyte on the separator [<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Instead, the wet strength of the PBF-GPTMS separators could still reach from 5.5 MPa to 25.0 MPa depending on the silane dosage. This could be ascribed to the covalent bonds between cellulose fibers and GPTMS, which would prevent electrolyte destruction on the fiber networks [<xref rid="B32-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the thermal stability of the separators is also an important parameter for the safety of LMB since heat is generated during the battery working to induce a thermal runaway. <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c,d shows the TGA and DTG curves of the PBF and PBF-GPTMS separators. It can be seen that all the separators displayed similar mass loss between 215 and 330 &#x000b0;C due to the thermal decomposition of the cellulose molecules [<xref rid="B33-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the main degradation peak (T<sub>max</sub>) of the PBF and PBF-GPTMS separators increased from 270 &#x000b0;C to 300 &#x000b0;C with the addition of GPTMS. This phenomenon could be due to the formation of a highly stable polysiloxane layer on the PBF-GPTMS separators [<xref rid="B34-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, the Celgard 2400 separator became curled after storage at 120 &#x000b0;C for 30 min, while the shape of PBF and PBF-GPTMS separators remained constant (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>e). All these results indicated the good thermal stability of our proposed separators.</p><p>As displayed in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>f, the porosity and electrolyte uptake of the PBF separator were 71.4% and 347.1%, respectively, which decreased to 28.31% and 212.2% with the increase in silane content. This could be explained by crosslinking causing a much denser network structure of the separator as shown in the SEM image [<xref rid="B35-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Even though, the electrolyte absorption ratios of the PBF-GMTMS separators were still higher than that of the commercial Celgard separator (163.8%). In order to understand this phenomenon, the electrolyte wettability of the separators was investigated. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>g, the electrolyte droplet hardly spread within a few seconds with a contact angle of 37&#x000b0; on the Celgard surface. Instead, the electrolyte was well-infiltrated into the PBF-GPTMS separator (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>h). This confirmed that the PBF-GPTMS separator possessed excellent liquid electrolyte wettability, which could be due to the abundance of electrolyte-friendly groups, e.g., hydroxyl, ester, and epoxy groups [<xref rid="B37-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-polymers-17-01203"><title>3.4.

Their bulk resistance was 4.6 &#x000b1; 0.2, 5.9 &#x000b1; 0.4, 7 &#x000b1; 1, 8 &#x000b1; 1, and 10 &#x000b1; 1 &#x003a9;, and the corresponding ionic conductivity was calculated to be 0.62 &#x000b1; 0.02, 0.48 &#x000b1; 0.04, 0.33 &#x000b1; 0.04, 0.28 &#x000b1; 0.02, and 0.18 &#x000b1; 0.02 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> respectively (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b). The decreased ionic conductivity of the separators with the addition of silane could be due to their denser microstructure. When the silane dosage was no more than 10%, the PBF-GPTMS separator still had higher ionic conductivity than that of the Celgard separator (0.32 &#x000b1; 0.03 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) due to the better electrolyte wettability [<xref rid="B38-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, the electrode/electrolyte interface also displayed a similar change tendency with the charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) increasing from 81.3 &#x003a9; to 280.6 &#x003a9; with an increase in the GPTMS content (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c). Even though, their properties were still better than that of the Celgard separator (302.3 &#x003a9;).</p><p><xref rid="app1-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref> shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of separators. It can be seen that when the voltage rose to 3.5 V, the current in all the separator-assembled cells with LFP as the working electrode exhibited a sudden increase, which was consistent with the operating voltage of the LFP cathode [<xref rid="B39-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Based on the above discussion, all the separators could be used under a voltage of at least 3.5 V, which made it possible for them to be applied in the LFP batteries. Since the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator displayed the highest mechanical strength and ionic conductivity in the PBF-GPTMS separators, it was selected for the following cycle test of the assembled battery. <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d shows the cycle performance of the assembled Li/separator/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery at 0.5 C. The discharge capacity of the Celgard separator decayed from 147.5 to 99.8 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 245 cycles. There was an irreversible short circuit in the PBF separator-assembled cell after 175 cycles. Instead, the initial discharge capacity of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator-assembled battery was 156.8 and 140.8 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with a capacity retention rate of 94.5% after 300 cycles and 93.6% after 160 cycles at 0.5 and 1 C, respectively (<xref rid="app1-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). These cycling properties were better than those of the reported cellulose separators for LMBs (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>g) [<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B40-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which could be due to the excellent wet strength and electrolyte absorption properties of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator.</p><p>Moreover, the rate performance of Li//LiFePO<sub>4</sub> half-cells with different separators at different current densities was also investigated. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>e, the Li/Celgard/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> half-cell exhibited specific capacities of 147.2, 138.8, 130.4, 118.1, and 142.6 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 0.2 C, respectively. While, the corresponding data for the Li/PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub>/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> half-cell were 153.9, 145.7, 137.5, 127.2, and 150.3 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. It was clear that the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator displayed better C-rate performance in comparison with that of Celgard due to its higher electrolyte uptake.</p><p>Finally, the long-term electrochemical stability of PBF-GPTMS against Li metal was demonstrated using symmetric Li/Li cells. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f, the cell with Celgard exhibited extremely high overpotential and unstable voltage profiles for 500 h at 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Its poor electrochemical behavior was caused by the nonhomogeneous deposition of Li<sup>+</sup> ion due to the low electrolyte wettability, which further induced severe Li dendrites growth on the surface of the Li anode [<xref rid="B42-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although the PBF separator displayed a more stable overpotential than that of Celgard, its value was obviously higher than that of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator within 800 h. This could be explained by the high wet strength and HF scavenging of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator [<xref rid="B43-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-polymers-17-01203"><title>3.5. Working Mechanism</title><p>To further understand the mechanism of the long lifespan of the PBF-GPTMS separator, the effect of electrolyte solvents (EC, DMC, and DEC) on the propionylated cellulose model before and after silane grafting was analyzed by molecular simulation. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a, Young&#x02019;s modulus of the silanized propionylated cellulose model was 25.17 and 14.64 GPa in vacuum/pure and EC/DMC/DEC conditions, respectively, which was higher than that of the propionylated cellulose model (22.27 and 6.89 GPa). <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b,c presents the distinct details in the corresponding blended models. It can be seen that the silanized propionylated cellulose model was more stable in the solvent compared with the propionylated cellulose model. These results confirmed the strength enhancement of the propionylated cellulose by silane crosslinking. This could ensure the dimensional stability of the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub> separator during battery cycling.</p><p>In addition to the wet strength of the separator, a side reaction occurs during the battery work, which would also affect its cycle life [<xref rid="B27-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Accordingly, the chemical composition of the Li foil in the assembled cell after cycling was examined using XPS spectroscopy. There were three peaks at 689.9, 687.4, and 684.8 eV in the F 1s XPS spectra of the cycled Li foil (<xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>d,e), which were attributed to the signals of PF<sub>5</sub>, LiPF<sub>6</sub>, and LiF, respectively [<xref rid="B44-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It was obvious that the Li foil in the PBF-GPTMS<sub>10</sub>-assembled cell displayed a lower PF<sub>5</sub> content (17.19%) in comparison with that in the Celgard-assembled cell (30.47%). This could be attributed to that the lone pair electrons in the oxygen atoms in the Si-O motif of the PBF-GPTMS separator were able to effectively form a complex with PF<sub>5</sub> [<xref rid="B45-polymers-17-01203" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this case, a lower amount of HF would be generated, which might alleviate the corrosion on the separator. Based on the above discussion, it could be concluded that silane crosslinking endowed the PBF-GPTMS separator with both wet strength improvement and HF scavenger to further enhance its cycling performance as illustrated in <xref rid="polymers-17-01203-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>f,g.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-polymers-17-01203"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, a long-life cellulose-based separator was fabricated by GPTMS crosslinking of the propionylated cellulose fibers. The resulting PBF-GPTMS separator exhibited a wet tensile strength of 25.00 MPa, which was 5.95 times higher than that of the PBF separator. Due to the complexation between the lone pair electrons in the oxygen atoms of the Si-O motif in the separator and PF<sub>5</sub>, a lower amount of HF would be generated to reduce side reactions during battery working. Accordingly, the LMBs assembled with the PBF-GPTMS separator exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 94.5% and 93.6%, respectively, after 300 cycles at 0.5 C and 160 cycles at 1 C.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

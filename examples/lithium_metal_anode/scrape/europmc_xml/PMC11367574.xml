electrolytes (CSPEs) are safer alternatives
to liquid electrolytes and excellent candidates for high-voltage solid-state
batteries. However, interfacial instabilities between the electrodes
and CSPEs are one of the bottlenecks in pursuing these systems. In
this study, a cross-linked CSPE was synthesized based on polypropylene
carbonate, polyethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate, polyethylene
glycol diacrylate with additives including lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
salt, and tantalum-doped lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZTO).
Mass fractions of 10, 20, and 40% LLZTO were added to the CSPE matrix.
In a symmetric cell, lithium plating and stripping revealed that the
interface between the lithium metal anode and CSPE with 10% of the
LLZTO (CSPE-10LLZTO) shows the most stable interface. The CSPE-10LLZTO
sample demonstrated high flexibility and showed no degradation over
800 h of cycling at varying current densities. The ionic conductivity
for the CSPE-10LLZTO sample at 40 &#x000b0;C was 6.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S/cm. An all-solid-state full cell was fabricated with LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the cathode,
CSPE-10LLZTO as the electrolyte and separator, and Li metal as the
anode, delivering approximately 140 mAh/g of capacity. Differential
scanning calorimetry measurements on CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO
showed high miscibility and the elimination of crystallinity. Raman
spectroscopy revealed uniformity in the structure. These findings
demonstrate the capability of the CSPEs to develop high-voltage solid-state
lithium metal batteries.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>composite solid polymer electrolytes</kwd><kwd>solid-state

lithium metal batteries have been investigated as a
replacement for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the demands for safe
(nonflammable and nonvolatile organic solvents) and high-energy storage
for electric vehicles and other portable devices. To go beyond LIBs,
the Li metal anode with a theoretical capacity of 3,860 mAh/g, which
is approximately 10 times higher than the state-of-the-art graphite
(372 mAh/g) anode, is very promising.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The commercialization
of rechargeable Li metal batteries has been immensely challenging
due in part to the complex chemistry of Li metal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> In a commercial battery, microporous separators allow for
the transport of lithium ions within a liquid electrolyte back and
forth between the anode and the cathode of a battery; however, these
separators are vulnerable to the penetration of Li dendrites. This
lithium penetration process can lead to an internal short circuit
and severely limits the use of the Li metal anode. Substituting the
flammable liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes offers several
advantages, such as more efficient cell packing and better thermal
and mechanical stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Exothermic reactions
at the electrolyte/electrode interface and interphase are known to
contribute to thermal runaway. The relatively very slow diffusion
of organic material from the bulk of a polymer electrolyte to the
interface, in comparison to a liquid electrolyte, is a reason for
enhanced safety of polymer-based batteries in comparison to liquid-based
batteries, even when the polymer is combustible.</p><p>Today, one
of the most investigated and promising types of solid
electrolytes is composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPEs) made
of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), lithium salt, and nanocomposite ceramic
fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> The most used ceramic filler
is lithium lanthanum zirconium tantalum oxide (Li<sub>6.4</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.4</sub>Ta<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, LLZTO), which
is stable against Li metal and has a high ionic conductivity at room
temperature (10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> S/cm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> This combination of LLZTO and PEO has become one of the most studied
types of CSPE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Polymer electrolytes based on polycarbonates, including polypropylene
carbonate (PPC), as used here, are known to have higher oxidative
stability than the most common polymer electrolytes, such as PEO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Higher oxidative stability has also been observed
for block copolymer electrolytes that contain blocks of polycarbonate
and PEO blocks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> PPC is also a widely
available polymer in the commercial market. However, pure PPC-based
electrolytes have less than desirable ionic conductivity and weak
mechanical properties.</p><p>Here, we overcome these challenges by
creating a cross-linked,
interpenetrating network polymer electrolyte by polymerizing a comb
monomer polyethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) and cross-linking
monomer polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) in the presence of
PPC. The use of both the comb monomer and the cross-linking monomer
allows for enhanced ionic conductivity above that of the cross-linking
monomer alone, while the cross-linking monomer enables the creation
of a freestanding polymer electrolyte film, and both of these monomers
are also widely available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Cross-linking
can significantly improve the properties of these polymers, such as
giving them a rubber-like characteristic, which can improve the contact
between the electrodes and polymer electrolytes. Interfacial resistance
in CSPEs is one of the major drawbacks in lithium-ion transport, and
therefore, understanding the Li metal/electrolyte interface is of
paramount importance, which can lead to improving the performance
of solid-state lithium metal batteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup></p><p>In this article, we report on the bulk and interfacial properties
of this cross-linked composite solid polymer electrolyte. Lithium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) was used as the salt due
to its interfacial stability against Li metal. The ionic conductivity
improved when 10, 20, and 40% mass fractions of LLZTO were added.
A representative sample of 10% LLZTO added to the CSPE matrix (CSPE-10LLZTO)
demonstrated stable cycling over 800 h. An all-solid-state full cell
made of LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC), CSPE-10LLZTO, and Li metal anode showed that the solid electrolyte
performed very well.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Experimental
Section</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Preparation of CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO</title><p>The CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO synthesis was based on the semi-interpenetrating
polymer network structure, which has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> A brief description is given here. Unless otherwise specified, all
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and the experiments were
performed in an argon-filled glovebox with a controlled environment.
Samples were prepared in two different laboratories. The cross-linked
polymer matrix (CSPE-0LLZTO) was first prepared by dissolving a known
quantity of PPC, PEGMEA, PEGDA, and LiTFSI in acetone along with 2
wt % of the free radical thermal initiator 2,2&#x02032;-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)
(AIBN). A series of CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO samples were then
prepared by adding 10, 20, and 40% by mass of LLZTO (MSE Supplies,
particle size 400&#x02013;600 nm) to the prepolymer solution. The solutions
containing LLZTO were sonicated in icy water for 2 h to disperse the
particles. In the laboratory at the Xavier University of Louisiana,
casting was performed by pouring the solutions onto a polytetrafluoroethylene
dish and leaving it to allow for solvent evaporation for 48 h in the
MBraun glovebox. The composite was then cross-linked by heating at
80 &#x000b0;C under vacuum for 1 h before peeling and being punched into
a 16 mm diameter disk. In the laboratory at the University of Notre
Dame, the films were cast in an ambient atmosphere, and the bulk of
the acetone was evaporated in the hood. Then, the samples were transferred
to an LC Technologies argon glovebox equipped with a built-in vacuum
oven. The samples were placed into a vacuum oven and pumped down.
Then, while holding vacuum, the temperature in the oven was ramped
up to 80 &#x000b0;C over a period of 90 min. The samples were maintained
under vacuum in the oven at 80 &#x000b0;C for an additional 12 h before
being moved to storage under ambient pressure in the argon glovebox.
Samples prepared via either procedure were found to have equivalent
ionic conductivity and glass transition temperature.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Material Characterizations</title><p>The crystal
structure and purity of the LLZTO were characterized using powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the Bragg&#x02013;Brentano geometry from
10&#x000b0; to 80&#x000b0; in 2-Theta in a Rigaku MiniFlex benchtop with
Cu K<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> radiation (&#x003bb; = 1.5418 &#x000c5;). Additionally,
the CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO samples were examined by XRD as well.</p><p>The samples&#x02019; morphology and surface characterization were
performed in a Hitachi S-3400 scanning electron microscope equipped
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental mapping.
First, the samples were mounted onto a scanning electron microscope
holder inside the glovebox and placed in a sealed container to prevent
exposure to air and moisture. Then, the holder was carefully transferred
under inert gas to the SEM chamber for the analysis of the sample.</p><p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were conducted
using a TA Instruments Q2000. Polymeric samples of at least 5 mg each
were crimped in aluminum DSC sample pans. The DSC scans were run between
&#x02212;80 and 140 &#x000b0;C at a scan rate of 10 &#x000b0;C/min under
a nitrogen flow of 25 mL/min. The temperature was decreased to &#x02212;80
&#x000b0;C and then increased to 140 &#x000b0;C, and this cycle was repeated.
The second cooling scan was used to calculate the samples&#x02019;
glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>).</p><p>Raman spectroscopic studies were performed on an NRS-5100 confocal
micro-Raman spectrometer from Jasco with an excitation wavelength
of 532 nm. The samples were sandwiched between one quartz microscopic
slide and one glass coverslip. Carbon tape was used to seal the edges
of the glass to minimize the sample&#x02019;s exposure to moisture.
The following were the settings of the device: 20&#x000d7; magnification,
50 &#x000d7; 1000 &#x003bc;m slit dimension, and 4000 &#x003bc;m aperture.
The samples were exposed to the laser for 30 s for one accumulation
each in the 80&#x02013;2000 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> range.</p><p>Linear
sweep voltammetry asymmetric cell testing (SS|CSPE-10LLZTO|Li)
was performed to establish the electrochemical window of the cross-linked
polymer electrolyte in the range of 0 to 6 V at a scan rate of 2 mV/s.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Electrochemical Characterizations</title><sec id="sec2.3.1"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Ionic Conductivity</title><p>All the samples&#x02019;
ionic conductivity (&#x003c3;, S/cm) was calculated from the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data in the 25&#x02013;85 &#x000b0;C temperature
range. Before each measurement, the temperature was held constant
for approximately 60 min. Coin cell types CR2032 were assembled by
inserting a CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO film (&#x0223c;230 &#x003bc;m
thick) between two stainless steel blocking electrodes (SS|CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO|SS) and pressing the material with a spring. The
EIS for the cells was carried out in the frequency range of 800 kHz&#x02013;0.1
Hz using a Gamry 1000 Interface potentiostat, and the data were displayed
as Nyquist plots.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.2"><label>2.3.2</label><title>Interfacial Stability</title><p>All samples&#x02019;
overall resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub>) was measured
at 40 &#x000b0;C at an open-circuit voltage (OCV) by monitoring the EIS
response over time of a symmetric cell with the potentiostat in the
galvanostatic mode. This temperature was chosen because it falls in
the working temperature range of solid polymer electrolytes and the
ionic conductivity is relatively high. The CSPE-10LLZTO was selected
for further evaluation because it showed the best overall interfacial
stability. The CSPE-0LLZTO was tested as a control for comparison.
The sample was assessed by lithium plating and stripping for 1 h each
at current densities ranging from 50 to 400 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.3"><label>2.3.3</label><title>All-Solid-State Cell</title><p>The effectiveness
of the solid electrolyte was tested in a full cell using NMC (Ni:Mn:Co
= 5:3:2, MTI Corp.) as the active cathode, CSPE-10LLZTO as the separator
and electrolyte, and Li metal as the anode. The cathode was prepared
by mixing NMC, Super-P carbon black (Alfa Aesar) as a conductivity
enhancer, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, average Nw &#x0223c;
534,000, Aldrich) as the binder in the ratio 70:20:10 wt %, respectively.
The powders were placed in a pestle, and 2 mL of 27.5 g/L PVDF/NMP
(<italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 99.5%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich)
was added. The solution was transferred to a vial and stirred overnight
to yield a black slurry that was cast on 16 &#x003bc;m thick aluminum
foil (MTI, Corp). The samples were dried in a vacuum oven (MTI) at
110 &#x000b0;C overnight and punched into 15 mm diameter disks. The loading
mass was approximately 1.165 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the weight was
measured using a microbalance (Mettler Toledo).</p><p>Approximately
1.0 &#x003bc;L of 1.0 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6,</sub> LP30; EC: DMC = 50:50 v/v, Sigma-Aldrich, battery grade) in ethylene
carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was used on the cathode
to improve ionic conduction. Coin cells were assembled by using an
electric crimper inside the glovebox. The cells were cycled in a temperature-controlled
oven (Arbin Instruments) at 40 &#x000b0;C in the 2.8&#x02013;4.5 V voltage
range versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup> at a current density of 10 mA/g. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) was performed for the NMC cells in the same voltage
range at a scan rate of 0.2 mV/s to evaluate the chemical nature of
the redox reactions. Liquid cells were assembled using a Whatman inorganic
separator to compare to solid-state cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Post-mortem Analysis</title><p>For the CSPE-10LLZTO
sample, the cells were taken inside the glovebox for decrimping after
lithium plating and stripping, and the electrodes and electrolytes
were carefully separated whenever possible. Next, cross sections of
CSPE-10LLZTO were prepared by cutting the sample with a surgical blade
for SEM analysis. The effort to separate the lithium anode from the
CSPE-0LLZTO was unsuccessful.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results

of the CSPE-<italic>x</italic>LLZTO and LLZTO powder samples was determined
by powder XRD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). The XRD pattern of the CSPE-0LLZTO shows a broad peak from 10&#x000b0;

(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a) increased
for all of the samples as the temperature increased. This is a typical
trend in solid polymer electrolytes since higher temperatures enhance
the movement of Li ions and polymer chains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> As the LLZTO mass fraction increases from 10 to 20%, we notice that
the ionic conductivity also increases; however, CSPE-40LLZTO shows
that the ionic conductivity decreases. Typically, an increase in ionic
conductivity in CSPEs has been attributed to varied mechanisms in
the literature, including depression of the polymer glass transition
and increase of polymer chain segmental motion, increase in the effective
mobile ion concentration due to interaction between the anion and
the particle surface, preferential ion transport pathways along the
particle surfaces, and ion transport through both the inorganic and
polymer matrices in the case of active Li<sup>+</sup> conducting inorganics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> The latter mechanism involves ion conduction
in the inorganic phase that is inhibited due to high resistance to
ion transport across the particle&#x02013;polymer interface. The Arrhenius
plots of the samples show a nonlinear (curvature) dependence of the
ionic conductivity as a function of temperature. However, in the high-temperature
range, a linear dependence can be extrapolated for the samples that
contained LLZTO. Overall, the ionic conductivity behavior as a function
of temperature follows the Vogel&#x02013;Tamman&#x02013;Fulcher (VTF)
equation, indicating that the preferred conduction pathway is through
the polymer matrix rather than the LLZTO. Although the ionic conductivity
increased with an increase in LLZTO content to 20%, this increase
also cannot be attributed solely to the decrease in the glass transition
temperature for the CSPE-20LLZTO and increase in the polymer segmental
mobility, as the changes in the glass transition temperatures were
relatively small (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.4c08181/suppl_file/am4c08181_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). Nevertheless,

to 575 &#x003a9; cm<sup>2</sup>, which is a drop of 28%. The <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> fell by 13%, but <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> stayed constant. The <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> is decreasing more rapidly than the <italic>R</italic><sub>interface.</sub> We notice that despite the formation of the SEI, there was no increase
in the <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub> of the CSPE-10LLZTO during
the first month of storage time. It is normal for the <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> to increase with time. However, the decrease
in <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> showed that the interface is still
dynamic and wetting the electrode. After 41 days of testing, the <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub> dropped drastically from 28% (575 &#x003a9;
cm<sup>2</sup>) to 72% (325 &#x003a9; cm<sup>2</sup>), while the <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> dropped by 69 and 75%, respectively. This precipitous decrease represents
a soft short circuit (soft short) in the cell. After 55 days of testing,
the <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub> increased by 44% (325 &#x003a9;
cm<sup>2</sup>) from the last drop of 72% (225 &#x003a9; cm<sup>2</sup>) and the <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> increased by 80%. However,
the <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> stayed the same, which
implied that the interphase was completely nonexistent, and the electrolyte
and lithium metal were completely wetted where the electrolyte behaved
as a mixed conductor. The <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> dynamically
changes to lower resistances at both high and low impedances. That
can cause electron leakage in some parts of the electrolyte. After
78 days of testing, the overall resistance at high frequency was 0.5
&#x003a9; cm<sup>2</sup> (a 100% drop), and the shape of the graph completely
changed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b).
The fact that the plot appeared at the negative quadrant at high frequency
indicated the presence of inductance, which caused the cell&#x02019;s
electronic short circuit (hard-short) because of the growth of dendrites.
A similar phenomenon has been observed in the literature with a symmetric
ceramic cell made of Li|LLZTO|Li.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup></p><p>For comparison, CSPE-0LLZTO was also tested and showed a tremendous
decrease in <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub>. We believe that
the soft shorts are responsible for this acceleration in decreasing
the <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub>, although the cells continue
to cycle for 55 days. Dendrites&#x02019; growth erroneously showed
improved Li|CSPE-0LLZTO interface contact. The SEI layer decreased
with time, and the <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub> of the cell
also decreased with time. After 52 days, the <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub> value was approximately 200 &#x003a9; cm<sup>2</sup>,
and the <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> completely disappeared.
All the resistances (<italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub>) were dynamic and continuously changed with
time toward lower resistance. Typically, impedance increases upon
the formation of the SEI to protect the electrode from failure. In
our case, the drastic decrease in resistance of the Li|CSPE-0LLZTO
implies that a soft short took place through either electron leakage
of the electrolyte via dendrite growth or wetting of the electrode
surface. We do not believe a hard short circuit happened where the
electrolyte behaves as a resistor. Instead, a mixed conductor with
electronic and ionic conductions is more likely to result, which is
a phenomenon that is common with polymer electrolytes upon soft short-circuiting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup></p><p>Adding LLZTO beyond 10% did not further enhance the interfacial
resistance, but there was an increase in ionic conductivity. A similar
phenomenon has been observed in other architectures, where an increase
in ionic conductivity does not necessarily lead to a stable interface.
For example, in the Li/LLZTO/Li and Li/LLZT-2LiF/Li symmetrical cells
at 25 &#x000b0;C, the Li/LLZT-2LiF/Li was found to have a lower interfacial
resistance (345 &#x003a9;/cm<sup>2</sup>) compared to the Li/LLZT/Li

conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup></p><p>The EIS results showed
that the addition of LLZTO improved the

to a stable potential of &#x0223c;0.20 V and stayed constant. That
decrease in the overpotential implies improvement in the Li|CSPE-10LLZTO
interface. An increase in polarization to 0.35 V was observed when
the rate was increased to 100 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. The overpotential
remained constant at 0.35 V for 200 h in this case. The current density
was further increased to 200 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>; again, the overpotential
increased and stabilized to 0.50 V for over 200 h. Finally, to check
the retention memory of the electrolyte, the current density was reduced
to its initial rate of 50 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the overpotential
returned to its original value and stayed stable for an additional
200 h. We observed no significant changes in the plating and stripping

density is very low, since we observe no sharp peak when a ceramic
separator (Whatman GF separator) is filled with liquid electrolyte
(LP30, Sigma-Aldrich) in a symmetric cell during the first charge
at 50 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. A sharp peak due to SEI formation is
typically observed for liquid electrolytes, but we notice that we
are working at a much lower current density. However, even at a current
density of 400 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>, we did not observe a sharp
peak during the first charging but rather an arching of the voltage
profile. That explains the early tortuous pathway of the lithium-ion
in the polymer matrix at the very beginning of the cycling process
compared to the liquid electrolyte, where the arching appears much
later in the cycling process of the liquid electrolyte, although it
is strongly dependent on the current density.</p><p>For comparison,
lithium plating and stripping of CSPE-0LLZTO were
also performed at 50 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. For the first cycle,
the overpotential was 0.55 V, which is higher than the CSPE-10LLZTO
under the same conditions, and the voltage continuously decreased
with time while the current was kept constant. Between 550 and 560
h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>c), the
voltage dropped to &#x0223c;20 mV, indicating a soft short. However,
after a few cycles, the overpotential returned to 0.3 V, and lithium
plating and stripping continued. This type of phenomenon indicates
that this cross-linked polymer matrix has self-healing properties.
As the cell continued to cycle for an additional 30 h, the voltage
dropped again, and this time to 5 mV at the same current density of
200 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the voltage profile was quite different.
A flat plateau that makes the voltage profile look like a rectangle
is observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>d,e). The extremely low overpotential and the rectangular shape where
the voltage and the current are at the same height also represent
soft short. To check that the cell was indeed soft and short, EIS
was carried out under the OCV conditions. As demonstrated in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.4c08181/suppl_file/am4c08181_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>, a spectrum was obtained showing an
intercept at low frequency (0.1 Hz) of the real axis at 160 &#x003a9;/cm<sup>2</sup>; however, the <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> is approaching
zero resistance. The fact that a spectrum is observed represents ionic
conduction. Therefore, the electrolyte behaves as a mixed conductor
with localized soft shorts.</p><p>Comparing Li|CSPE-10LLZTO to the
CSPE-0LLZTO interface, the <italic>R</italic><sub>overall</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>interface</sub> of CSPE-0LLZTO were significantly
higher than those for the CSPE-10LLZTO,
proving that the LLZTO plays a vital role in interfacial stability.
Although ionic conductivity increased from CSPE-0LLZTO to CSPE-20LLZTO,
it has been challenging to demonstrate that LLZTO is a conduit for
lithium ions to improve ionic conductivity. As explained above, the
ionic conductivity of these CSPEs tends to follow the VTF model, where
the polymer matrix is the main conduction pathway. Although the NMR
technique has shown that Li ions exchange at the PEO/LLZO interface,
the diffusion was extremely high, which did not contribute to the
overall conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>Full

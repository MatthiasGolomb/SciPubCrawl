Herein, a bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide based single-ion polymer artificial layer for a lithium metal anode is successfully constructed, which is prepared via blending the as-prepared copolymer of lithiated 4, 4&#x02032;-dicarboxyl bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide and 4,4&#x02032;-diaminodiphenyl ether on the surface of lithium foil. This single-ion polymer artificial layer enables compact structure with unique continuous aggregated Li<sup>+</sup> clusters, thus reducing the direct contact between lithium metal and electrolyte simultaneously, ensuring Li<sup>+</sup> transport is fast and homogeneous. Based on which, the coulombic efficiency of the Li|Cu half-cell is effectively improved, and the cycle stability of the Li|Li symmetric cell can be prolonged from 160 h to 240 h. Surficial morphology and elemental valence analysis confirm that the bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide based single-ion polymer artificial layer effectively facilitates the Li<sup>+</sup> uniform deposition and suppresses parasitic reactions between lithium metal anode and liquid electrolyte in the LFP|Li full-cell.

Introduction</title><p>With the extensive application of high-energy-storage devices in human life, it is urgent to research electrode material with high-energy density to develop the next-generation of lithium secondary batteries [<xref rid="B1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, traditional commercial lithium-ion batteries are limited by the theoretical specific capacity of graphite anode (372 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), thus their energy density can no longer meet the needs of social development, such as electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and portable electronic devices [<xref rid="B2-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lithium metal, owing to its higher theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and lowest reduction potential (&#x02212;3.04 V vs. SHE), was considered as one of the most potential anode materials for next generation lithium secondary batteries [<xref rid="B3-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, the uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth, caused by the inhomogeneous deposition of Li<sup>+</sup> and persistent parasitic reactions between highly reactive lithium and liquid electrolyte are the two intricate barriers that seriously restrict the practical application of lithium metal anodes (LMA) [<xref rid="B5-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Tremendous effort was devoted to overcome the lithium dendrite growth and persistent parasitic reactions of LMA, mainly including the four aspects below: (1) Optimizing the liquid electrolyte formulation via additives, such as lithium difluorophosphate, [<xref rid="B7-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], fluorinated ether solvent [<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or 2,2-dimethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-dioxolane [<xref rid="B9-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], to improve the uniformity and compactness of SEI. (2) Utilizing inorganic, polymer or organic/inorganic composite solid-state electrolytes to inhibit lithium dendrite growth. For example, PEO-based solid-state electrolyte [<xref rid="B10-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], LLZO solid-state electrolyte [<xref rid="B11-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and PEO/LLZO composite solid-state electrolyte [<xref rid="B12-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. (3) Employing a 3D current collector, such as a carbon nanotube sponge [<xref rid="B13-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], carbon nanofibers matrix [<xref rid="B15-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and ZnO-coated hierarchical porous carbon [<xref rid="B16-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], to reduce the local deposition current density. (4) Fabricating a functional artificial layer to improve the interfacial stability of LMA/electrolyte [<xref rid="B17-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, a PVDF functional layer [<xref rid="B18-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], PEO thin film [<xref rid="B19-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and covalent organic framework [<xref rid="B20-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Evidently, it is the crucial to regulate the homogeneous deposition of Li<sup>+</sup> and prevent the direct contact of LMA and electrolyte.</p><p>Recently, construction of a robust single-ion polymeric artificial layer (SPAL) for LMA has attracted numerous attention [<xref rid="B21-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Firstly, the fixed anions on the matrix of SPAL can form an efficiency Li<sup>+</sup> transport channel and prolong the formation of the "ion depletion layer" on the surface of LMA, which is beneficial to facilitate the homogeneous deposition of Li<sup>+</sup> [<xref rid="B22-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Secondly, the compact SPAL on LMA isolates it from electrolyte, which can avoid the parasitic reactions between LMA and liquid electrolyte effectively [<xref rid="B23-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, this SPAL is flexible, which is able to adapt to the volume variation during charge/discharge cycles. Song et al. incipiently proved that the thin Nafion layer on the surface of LMA can improve the performance and durability of lithium metal batteries [<xref rid="B24-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the low ionic conductivity of the thin Nafion layer coursed by a strong binding energy between Li<sup>+</sup> and sulfonic acid group will discount the Li<sup>+</sup> transport rate during the charging and discharging processes. Therefore, Weng et al. introduced POSS nano-particles into a SPEEK layer to facilitate the dissociation of Li<sup>+</sup>, thereby accelerating the ion transport [<xref rid="B25-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, Jiang et al. combined the ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>-decorated metal-organic framework (UiO-66-ClO<sub>4</sub>) and flexible lithiated Nafion binder to construct biomimetic ionic channels for the artificial solid-electrolyte interfaces [<xref rid="B26-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity of an organic single-ion polymer is intrinsically lower compared to the commercial electrolyte as reported [<xref rid="B21-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p><p>Herein, 4, 4&#x02032;-dicarboxyl bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide was copolymerized with 4,4&#x02032;-diaminodiphenyl ether to obtain a single-ion conductor (LiPBIA, as shown in <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Scheme S1</xref>). Relying on the solution-casting method, the LiPBIA blended with PVDF was attached to a lithium foil surface to form a bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide based SPAL (<italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL). On the one hand, the continuous aggregated Li<sup>+</sup> clusters on fixed bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide anions endow prosperous Li<sup>+</sup> transport channels, allowing a fast and uniform Li<sup>+</sup> deposition process, which can effectively inhibit the growth of lithium dendrite. On the other hand, the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL, as an interlayer between electrolyte and LMA, isolates the contact of the two, impeding the parasitic side reactions between them (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-sch001" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>). By employing this <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL on LMA, the coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Li|Cu half-cell, interfacial stability of the Li|Li symmetrical cell and cycling performance of the LFP|Li full-cell were detected systemically.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-15-03490"><title>2.

At the same time, the two double peaks, &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;b&#x0201d;, shifted to the lower field (7.92&#x02192;7.90 ppm, 7.75&#x02192;7.73 ppm), respectively, which as a result, the methyl group was oxidized to the carboxyl group. For the LiPBIA, five peaks at 10.38 (e), 7.98&#x02013;7.96 (a), 7.86&#x02013;7.84 (b), 7.81&#x02013;7.79 (c) and 7.05&#x02013;7.03 (d) were observed, respectively. The hydrogen marked with &#x02018;a&#x02019;, &#x02018;b&#x02019;, &#x02018;c&#x02019; and &#x02018;d&#x02019; could be denoted as &#x02018;benzene hydrogen&#x02019;, while the hydrogen labeled by &#x02018;e&#x02019; was assigned to &#x02018;amide hydrogen&#x02019;, indicating the target product of LiPBIA was successfully synthesized.</p><p>The chemical structure of LiPBIA was further collected by the FTIR spectra, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. For 4, 4&#x02032;-dicarboxyl bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a), the peaks of 1691 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1438 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are ascribed to the stretching vibration absorption peak of the carbonyl group in the carboxyl function group, which is a special function group of the structure. The peaks of 1296 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 1264 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1010 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are attributed to the bending vibrations and symmetric stretching vibrations of the -SO<sub>2</sub>- group and the symmetrical stretching vibrations of the S=O bond in the sulfonylimide group. The peaks of 764 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 693 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> belonged to the symmetric stretching vibrations of 1,4-substituted benzene and benzene, respectively. For 4,4&#x02032;-diaminodiphenyl ether (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b), the peak of 1620 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> belonged to the bending vibrations of the -NH- bond of the amino group, which is the function group of the 4,4&#x02032;-diaminodiphenyl ether. The peaks of 1271 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1160 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are attributed to the stretching vibration of the Ar-O bond. The peak of 1010 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is attributed to the stretching vibration of the R-O bond. The peaks of 820 and 709 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are ascribed to the rocking vibration of the -NH- in the amino group. For the lithiated polyamide copolymer LiPBIA (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c), it is clear that the characteristic peak of the -COOH bond at 1620 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> disappeared. The peaks of 1239 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1075 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> belonged to the bending vibrations, symmetric stretching vibrations of the -SO<sub>2</sub>- bond and the symmetrical stretching vibrations of the S=O bond in the sulfonylimide group. The 717 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> peak is attributed to the symmetric stretching vibrations of the C-H bond in the 1,4-substituted benzene. Furthermore, the peaks of 1492 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,1394 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 880 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> bending vibrations of the -NH- bond of the secondary amine were reformed, which demonstrated that the LiPBIA were synthesized successfully. The two precursors are linked by a secondary amide, which is clearly identified in <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c. The XRD results show that LiPBIA has a clear and sharp peak of 2&#x003b8; = 20&#x000b0; (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>), which indicates a relatively good crystallinity. Therefore, combining the characterization of <sup>1</sup>H NMR, FTIR and XRD, can prove that the LiPBIA copolymer was successfully synthesized. In addition, the LiPBIA copolymer was soaked in the EC/DMC organic solvent for several hours through design experiments. There is no solid residue, which shows the dissolution stability (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). This phenomenon indicates that the LiPBIA copolymer is suitable as a protective layer for lithium metal batteries.</p><p>After confirming the structural information of LiPBIA, we tested the ionic conductivity of SPAL. It reached up to 0.96 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> when soaked with liquid electrolyte (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>). Such a high value is almost comparable to 1.12 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of commercial liquid electrolyte, which is attributed to the large amount of lithiated bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide anions, providing more sites for Li<sup>+</sup> dissociation and transportation [<xref rid="B29-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Subsequently, a mixture of LiPBIA and PVDF (3:1) was employed to fabricate SPAL on the surface of LMA (denoted as <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li). With the assistance of SEM, we observed that the SPAL was fitted on the surface of LMA evenly and compactly as shown in <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a. Between SPAL and LMA, there was no crevice, while the thickness of the SPAL is approximately 1.8 &#x003bc;m. Such a compact SPAL with a certain thickness appressed on LMA can avoid the direct contact between the LMA and electrolyte effectively. <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b displayed the surface section of the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li electrode, which demonstrated that the surface is smooth and close. Furthermore, even at a higher magnification, it still exhibits a contact and uniform morphology (insert of <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). Mapping images (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c) illustrate that the distribution of O, S, N, F elements on <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL @Li electrode is homogeneous, further suggesting that the SPAL is covered on the LMA continuously and densely. As zoomed in by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the typical microphase separation structure of SPAL is blindingly obvious, and tightly aggregated clusters are uniformly dispersed (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>d), which formulates an efficient Li<sup>+</sup> transport channel, ensuring fast and homogeneous Li<sup>+</sup> transport [<xref rid="B30-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These results suggest that SPAL has the potential to serve as an artificial SEI for LMA, in order to block the liquid electrolyte and guide the uniform deposition of Li<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>The CE of the Cu electrode was compared with the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Cu electrode to investigate the influence of <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL to reversible Li plating/stripping performance. In the first cycle, the CE of the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Cu electrode (~ 86.5%) was relatively lower than 92.1% of the bare Cu electrode (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a), which is attributed to the larger Li nucleation overpotential (223 mV vs. 79 mV, <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S4a</xref>) caused by the initial unstable interface between the Cu electrode and <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL. After an experienced one cycle, the Cu|<italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL interface was stabilized. The CE of the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Cu electrode increased to 96.1% at the third cycle, rapidly, which still remained at 93.9% after 100 cycles. With regard to bare Cu electrode, the CE in the third cycle was barely attenuated, dropping to 78.1% vertiginously after 40 cycles. Meanwhile, the Li stripping/plating overpotential for <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li was about 97 mV at the third cycle, which was maintained for 100 cycles continuously, thus, superior to the bare Cu electrode (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S4b&#x02013;d</xref>). Furthermore, Li|Li symmetric cells were assembled to evaluate the interfacial stability of LMA/electrolyte. As indicated by the black line in <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b, the overpotential of the bare Li symmetrical cell increased rapidly after 90 h. This illustrated that the bare Li anode could only work effectively in a limited time (&#x0003c;90 h), which owes to the complicated side reactions between the LMA and liquid electrolyte [<xref rid="B31-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The side reactions that consumed a portion of the Li metal led to an inferior performance, meanwhile, a more complex surface appeared, which affected the Li<sup>+</sup> transfer efficiency, and the generation of lithium dendrite was exacerbated [<xref rid="B32-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. At 152 h, short circuiting took place, which is attributed to the unmanageable lithium dendrite formation that connects the positive and negative electrodes together. When coating with <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL, the symmetrical Li|Li cell, using the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li electrode, displayed a much more stable Li plating/stripping behavior for 180 h and cut off at 240 h. More importantly, the polarization potential of the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li symmetric cell is similar to the bare one, which is attributed to the appreciable ionic conductivity of <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL. These results indicate that the as-prepared <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL is indeed critical for facilitating fast Li<sup>+</sup> transport and reversible Li plating/stripping [<xref rid="B33-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. </p><p>Ultimately, the LFP|Li full-cell was assembled and tested to further explore the practical application of the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li electrode with bare Li for comparison. Before the cycling test, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured and the EIS results, with the equivalent circuit, are shown in <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a. Clearly, the <italic toggle="yes">Rs</italic> (ohmic resistance) and <italic toggle="yes">Rct</italic> (resistance of charge transfer reaction between the electrolyte and the electrode) of full-cell fabrication with the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li electrode was 11.3 &#x003a9; and 359.2 &#x003a9;, respectively, which was relatively higher than that of the bare Li electrode (10.6 &#x003a9;, 272.5 &#x003a9;). This is ascribed to the slightly lower ionic conductivity of <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL compared to the liquid electrolyte (<xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>), resulting in the increase of both <italic toggle="yes">Rs</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Rct</italic>. Therefore, the discharge capacity of the full cell, with <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li as the anode, was about 156.3 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 0.2 C, slightly lower than 158.2 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of the bare Li anode (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b). Intriguingly, when the charge/discharge rate increased to 1 C, the discharge capacity of the two cells was almost equal (146 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). After 100 cycles, the cell with the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li anode still delivered a discharge capacity of 144.5 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with CE as high as 99.84 %, which was superior to the value of 138.4 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 96.87 % upon the bare Li. The corresponding charge/discharge curves at 1 C rates are shown in <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>. At the first cycle, the charge/discharge curve of both <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li and the bare Li cell remained almost the same. However, after 100 cycles at 1 C, the charge/discharge platform of the bare Li cell was shorter than the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li, which is attributed to the dendrite growth and parasitic reactions on the surface of the bare Li. These results confirm that the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL is beneficial for the cyclic stability of lithium metal batteries.</p><p>The SEM analysis was utilized to explore the surficial morphology and elemental state of bi-SPAL after 100 cycles. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a, the surface of bare LMA turns to rather porous and numerously isolated dendritic particles, while the LMA protected by <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL does not change significantly (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>b). The composition varieties of the cycled LMAs were further revealed by Li 1s and S 2p XPS analysis. For bare LMA (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>c&#x00026;e), the Li 1s XPS spectra could be fitted to the peaks of ROCO<sub>2</sub>Li (54.8 eV), Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (55.3 eV), LiF (55.9 eV) and no S 2p peaks were observed. For <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li (<xref rid="polymers-15-03490-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>d&#x00026;f), in addition to the peaks of Li 1s, the peaks of S 2p also appeared, which could be fitted to Li<sub>2</sub>S (163.2 eV) [<xref rid="B34-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], LiSO<sub>3</sub> (169.4 eV), respectively. The stronger deconvoluted peak of LiF and unique peaks of S 2p are attributed to the reduction of PVDF and LiPBIA with LMA, respectively, which is beneficial to form a uniform and robust SEI layer [<xref rid="B31-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, the parasitic reactions between LMA, the liquid electrolyte and the Li dendrite growth can be inhibited. The EIS results measured after 20 cycles at 1 C further conform this phenomenon. As shown in <xref rid="app1-polymers-15-03490" ref-type="app">Figure S6</xref>, the <italic toggle="yes">Rct</italic> of LFP/Li cell fabricated with the <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li electrode was 188.9 &#x003a9;, much lower than the bare one (250.3 &#x003a9;), which is attributed to the formation of steady SEI layer for <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-polymers-15-03490"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this work, a unique <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL was successively prepared. Attaching this <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL on lithium foil formed an even, dense and compact protective cover, able to inhibit the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrite and impede the parasitic side reactions between LMA and the liquid electrolyte during the charge&#x02013;discharge process, thus improving the interfacial stability of LMA. By inducing <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL@Li to the Li|LFP cell, a high discharge capacity of 144.5 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with CE at 99.84% was achieved at 1 C for 100 cycles. Surficial morphology and elemental state analysis of bi-SPAL, after battery reaction further verified the stabilization mechanism of <italic toggle="yes">bi</italic>-SPAL on LMA. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

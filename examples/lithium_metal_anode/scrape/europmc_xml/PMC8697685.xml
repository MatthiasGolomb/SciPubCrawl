In this study, a sandwich gel polymer electrolyte (SGPE) with a thermal shutdown function was developed to resolve the safety issues. By adjustment of surface pore size of the SGPE, lithium dendrite growth is suppressed. Due to the sandwich structure design, the SGPE can effectively respond to an overheating environment, regulate lithium ion transport and inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrite, demonstrating a remarkably high safety of the batteries, especially at high temperature or under thermal runaway circumstances. In addition, the LiFePO<sub>4</sub>/SGPE/Li battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 135 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 1C and maintains high capacity retention (&#x0003e;95%) after 200 charge&#x02013;discharge cycles. This study shows a great advantage to handle thermal abuse and a stable lithium anode, suggesting a promising approach to the high safety lithium metal batteries.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The SGPE can achieve high performance and high safety features simultaneously.<graphic xlink:href="d1ra02641k-ga.jpg" id="ga" position="float"/></p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

In detail, the high reactivity of lithium metal with organic carbonate promotes the continuous consumption of lithium metal, causing the degradation of coulombic efficiency.<sup><xref rid="cit4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref></sup> Moreover, uncontrolled dendrite growth resulting from heterogeneous electrodeposition would penetrate the separator, leading to a series of exothermic reactions, causing a short circuit and local overheating in the battery, and could even induce combustion and explosion in the commercialized lithium battery packs.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>To make better use of Li metal, different strategies have been utilized, including modification of electrolyte composition (lithium salt,<sup><xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> solvents,<sup><xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and additives<sup><xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></sup>), application of advanced electrolytes<sup><xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref></sup> and 3D lithium metal anode.<sup><xref rid="cit17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> During these strategies, advanced electrolytes, like solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with non-flammable and stable merits, considered to be the most promising way to solve security issues.<sup><xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref></sup> However, the low ionic conductivity at room temperature and the high interfacial impedance have limited SSEs.<sup><xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The electrolyte development is operating in a paradox: on the one hand, using SSEs is understood to be a fundamental way to ensure safety, but on the other hand, the high performance of liquid electrolyte at room temperature is difficult to give up. Therefore, gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have been proposed to combine the advantages of high performance of liquid and high safety of solid.<sup><xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref></sup> But because GPE still contains a considerable amount of flammable liquid electrolytes and host materials with thermal intolerance, the security issues are also plaguing at high temperature.<sup><xref rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Hence, high performance GPEs with high safety should be explored.</p><p>Strategies to achieve batteries with high security can be divided into two categories, one is external strategy, the other is internal strategy. Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) resistors are applying on commercial LIBs to shut down by undergoing a sharp increase in resistance as pressure and temperature out of control.<sup><xref rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr">27,28</xref></sup> However, such external devices are dull for transient change of pressure and temperature. Therefore, internal thermal response materials, with high sensitivity, fast response speed, self-shutdown function, are smart in preventing thermal runaway and have been developed,<sup><xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29,30</xref></sup> giving a smart and effective approach to enable LMBs with fast self-protection, preventing combustion and explosion at precise threshold.<sup><xref rid="cit31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref></sup> Thermally responsive materials have broad applications in batteries, not only as components of the electrolytes,<sup><xref rid="cit33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> but also as safe binders,<sup><xref rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> reversible switch collectors<sup><xref rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr">27,28</xref></sup> and as self-shutdown additives,<sup><xref rid="cit35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> exhibiting an intrinsic mechanism for shutdown device operation as the temperature increases beyond a given threshold. However, these strategies often require complex multi-step synthesis processes and additional flame-retardant components in the electrolyte which would increase the weight of the whole devices but do not contribute to the energy density.<sup><xref rid="cit31" ref-type="bibr">31,36,37</xref></sup> Recently, many works have reported on the method of structural modification, demonstrating application prospects in different aspects.<sup><xref rid="cit38" ref-type="bibr">38,39</xref></sup> In addition, the structurally designed electrolyte can also improve battery safety performance.<sup><xref rid="cit31" ref-type="bibr">31,40</xref></sup> Therefore, designing the electrolyte structure is an effective way to achieve high-performance and high-safety LMBs.</p><p>Herein, a novel high-safety sandwich gel polymer electrolyte (SGPE) was synthesized. The obtained SGPE consists of two porous poly(vinylidene-fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)/poly-pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) polymer layers (named PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub>-PETEA) contacting with electrodes to ensure safety and a layer constructed by poly-PETEA between them to create internal space to storage liquid electrolytes. Through innate intolerance of PVDF-HFP membrane, this SGPE forms the favorable protection layer on both electrodes, resulting in self-shutdown behavior by transforming the unstable PVDF-HFP membrane into thermal-responsive layer. In the absence of extra components, through the adjustment of surface morphology and electrolyte sandwich structure design, the prepared SGPE exhibited rapid and sensitive self-shutdown response under high temperature stimulation (80 &#x000b0;C), demonstrating the intrinsic safety characteristics of its autonomous response. Furthermore, the SGPE is proven to have a high liquid electrolyte uptake ratio (86.2%), long-term stable deposition of lithium metal without conspicuous dendrite growth (over 1000 h). These results well indicate the extraordinary security and electrochemical properties of this SGPE and its promising applications in high safety LMBs.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Experiment</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>

It is worth noting that the well-designed amount of PETEA monomer absorbed on the PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> membranes can modify the surface pore size and avoid too many monomers blocking the pores. At the same time, the polymerization of PETEA monomer in the confined space between the two PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> membranes can effectively connect the PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> matrix membranes on both sides, and create a loose intermediate structure in the middle for better storage of liquid electrolyte.

It can be seen from Fig. S2a<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> that the initial PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> membrane has the largest porosity. As the polymerized monomer content increases, the porosity gradually decreases, which should be due to the poor dispersion of polymer chains caused by the excessive polymerization of the PETEA monomer.<sup><xref rid="cit44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Compared with the work of other researchers,<sup><xref rid="cit45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> the reduction in porosity in this work is smaller, which is attributed to the lower dosage of polymerized monomer (0.0175 g PETEA monomer per SGPE membrane, mass ratio is 13.9%). When the concentration is 0, the two-layer PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> cannot be used as an effective electrolyte membrane, but as the concentration increases, SGPE with a uniform surface and a large cavity inside was prepared. In the comparison of a series of SGPE-<italic toggle="yes">X</italic>, with the increasing of the <italic toggle="yes">X</italic>, the porosity and pore size of the SGPE surface gradually decrease, which can be attributed to the increasing number of PETEA and the modification of the pore size by polymerization (Fig. S3<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). Combining those data above and the cycling performance test (Fig. S4<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>), the SGPE-40 is selected as an optimizing sample and studied in the following work.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the synthesis procedure of SGPE.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="d1ra02641k-f1" position="float"/></fig><p>As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, the SGPE-40 has a smooth and uniform texture with porous structure, its pore size was measured to be around 2000 nm, which is much smaller than that of the PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub>.

The thermal stability of these membranes was further evaluated by treating membranes on hot plate at different temperatures ranging from 25 &#x000b0;C to 120 &#x000b0;C. From <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, Celgard shrinks slightly at 60 &#x000b0;C, severe shrinkage occurs at 90 &#x000b0;C, and melt at 120 &#x000b0;C. In contrast, PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> and SGPE-40 show almost no morphology changes even at 120 &#x000b0;C, indicating that it can maintain dimensional stability under high temperature, better isolate cathode and anode to prevent short circuit. TGA analysis showed that both SGPE-40 and PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> have higher decomposition temperature (as shown in Fig. S5<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). Fig. S6<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> exhibits the combustion test between SGPE-40 and the Celgard separator both full of liquid electrolytes. When the Celgard 2400 close to the fire, it immediately burned, melt, and eventually turned into black debris in few seconds. For the SGPE-40, it burns quickly, and after 5 s, it extinguishes immediately, still maintains 43% effective area after burning. Therefore, the SGPE-40 shows better thermal stability.</p><p>In order to study the thermal self-shutdown performance of SGPE-40, we first assembled SS/SS battery to detect the ionic conductivity at different temperature, which is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. At room temperature, the SGPE-40 exhibits a very high conductivity (1.45 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and the conductivity reduces slightly with the increasing temperature until to 70 &#x000b0;C. It is worth noting that when the temperature rises to 80 &#x000b0;C, the conductivity appears a huge dropdown, which directly approaches 6.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and the same conductivity also obtained at 90 &#x000b0;C, indicating that the battery assembled with SGPE-40 can not operate under high temperature. The sudden drop in ion conductivity indicates that there is an open circuit inside the battery at this time. To better explore the reason, we assembled the LFP/Li battery and studied its charge and discharge properties at 25 &#x000b0;C and 80 &#x000b0;C, as shown in the <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>. The LFP battery has experienced a stable discharge specific capacity at room temperature, which are 156.0 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 156.4 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 156.1 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In sharp contrast, when the temperature rises to 80 &#x000b0;C, the specific discharge capacity of the battery drops to 0. At this time, the open circuit voltage of the battery is 3.3 V, indicating that the SGPE-40 has isolated the electrodes, resulting in the occurrence of open circuit. A more rigorous test method is to observe the behavior of plating/stripping of lithium on both lithium electrodes at different temperatures. The same result also occurred on the symmetrical lithium battery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). At room temperature, the battery maintained a stable voltage polarization about 25 mV, lasting 200 h. However, when the temperature rises to 80 &#x000b0;C, the voltage line of the battery using Celgard membrane quickly drops to 0, indicating the direct contact between the electrodes caused by the thermal shrinkage of the Celgard, according to the previous thermal shrinkage test. However, the voltage curve of the battery using SGPE-40 rises rapidly to 5 V, demonstrating no short circuit between the two electrodes. The AC impedance spectroscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c and d</xref>) show the occurrence of open circuit. The SEM image (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>) shows no pore structure on the SGPE-40 membrane surface, which proves that the pore is closed after hot treatment. When the temperature increases, its high-temperature unstable porous PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub>-PETEA layer of SGPE-40 quickly closes the pore, cutting off the transmission of lithium ions, and preventing thermal runaway. It is worth mentioning that the rapid increase in impedance of Li/Li using SGPE-40 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>) also illustrates the self-shutdown function of the SGPE-40.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>(a) Line fitting plots for ionic conductivity of the SGPE-40 ranging from 25 to 90 &#x000b0;C.

As shown in the <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, we dye the commercial liquid electrolyte with blue pigment and store them in right side of the H-electrolytic cell. Before the heat treatment, the liquid electrolyte has good wettability to the SGPE-40 membrane, and the electrolyte quickly diffuses to another side, which means that SGPE-40 has good wettability. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a&#x02013;d</xref>. The opposite is that after the heat-treat process, when the SGPE-40 membrane is in contact with the liquid electrolyte, since the surface has no porous structure, it essentially becomes a blocking device, which can neither absorb liquid nor undergo mass transfer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e&#x02013;h</xref>). It can be seen in Fig. S11<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> that when the temperature range is between 30&#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C, the battery maintains the capability of lighting the LED device. However, after keeping for more than 8 min in an environment of 80 &#x000b0;C, the LED doesn't work, indicating that the self-shutdown behavior has occurred.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>The visualized self-shutdown photograph before (a&#x02013;d) and after (e&#x02013;h) hot treatment.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="d1ra02641k-f5" position="float"/></fig><p>According to these analyses, we propose the mechanism of the thermal response of SGPE-40 to avoid thermal runaway when temperature rises. At room temperature, the sandwich structure of SGPE-40 can absorb a large amount of liquid electrolyte, ensuring good ionic conductivity and cycling performance. The suitable surface pore size can not only ensure the rapid migration of lithium ions and inhibit dendrite growth, but also guarantee safe cycling of Li metal batteries. When the temperature increased, all pores on the surface disappear simultaneously and cut off the battery operation. In this case, the SGPE-40 serves as an effective storage device for the electrolyte at high temperature, avoiding the combustion of the electrolyte, and stabilizing the whole battery. Moreover, the thermal unstability of the PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> membrane is no longer a disadvantage, but it is used as a temperature response device to improve the safety of the overall electrolyte,<sup><xref rid="cit53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> which is illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>The mechanism of thermal shutdown behavior achieved by SGPE-40.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="d1ra02641k-f6" position="float"/></fig><p>This strategy of utilizing electrolyte's own structural design to achieve self-shutdown function does not obstruct the overall performance of the battery. LFP/Li batteries were assembled to demonstrate the application of the SGPE-40 in lithium metal battery. The cycling performances of the LFP/Li cells using SGPE-40, PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> and Celgard 2400 were characterized by galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements at 1C (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>) and 2C (Fig. S7<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). The cells using three kinds of electrolyte membranes deliver similar discharge capacities in the initial cycles. The discharge capacity of the battery using SGPE-40 remain 95.4% after 200 cycles. Conversely, those batteries using Celgard 2400 and PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> couldn't stable charge/discharge after 70 cycles and display significant capacities fading since then, remain 60.8% and 72.3% after 200 cycles, respectively. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref> shows the rate performance of the battery using SGPE-40, PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> and Celgard 2400 at 25 &#x000b0;C. LFP/Li battery using SGPE-40 shows the satisfactory specific capacities of 151.6, 149.2, 143.8, 121.9 and 96.2 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at rates of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1.0C, 2.0C and 3.0C, respectively, remaining original specific capacity (153.3 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) when get back to 0.2C. However, battery using PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> shows much lower specific capacities of 153.4, 148.6, 135.8, 80.6, 39.5 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at the same rates, losing 63.2% specific capacities than that of SGPE-40 at 3C. Celgard film showed the worst rate performance. The typical charge&#x02013;discharge profiles of LFP/Li battery using SGPE-40 in a voltage of 2.5&#x02013;3.9 V at different cycle are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>. Obvious potential plateaus are observed when the current rate changed. The values of over-potentials increase along with the increase of the charge/discharge current rates, which is commensurate with the performances of cycling. In addition, as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d and e</xref>, it can be found that the cell using SGPE-40 and PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> have lower impedance than that of the Celgard before cycling. After two hundred cycles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>), the SGPE-40 cell still maintains a low impedance (240 &#x003a9;). However, the impedance of the PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> and Celgard cells become very large (472 &#x003a9; and 1354 &#x003a9;, respectively).</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>(a) Cycle performance, (b) corresponding galvanostatic charge&#x02013;discharge voltage profiles and (c) rate performance of batteries using Celgard, PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> and SGPE-40.

After 100 cycles at the rate of 0.5C, the capacity retention is 87.1%. For the rate performance, the NCA622/Li battery using SGPE-40 delivery specific capacities of 160.2, 156,1, 151.7, 143.5, 136.9 and 119.6 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at rates of 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.3C, 0.4C, 0.5C and 1C, respectively, remaining original specific capacity (158.7 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) when get back to 0.1C. This excellent performance can be attributed to the unique sandwich structure electrolyte which can not only effectively transport lithium ions but also inhibit dendrite growth. These demonstrate that the SGPE-40 shows promising potential application for high-performance power rechargeable lithium metal batteries.</p><p>To further investigate the compatibility and electrodeposition behavior of the SGPE-40 in Li anode, Li symmetric cells were assembled. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>, the SGPE-40 delivered long-term cycle stability over 1000 h under 0.5 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. The near-constant overpotential was as low as around 15 mV. In contrast, the overpotential of Celgard was initially maintained at about 53 mV for 250 h and gradually increased to over 100 mV after 200 h. The voltage hysteresis resulted from the continuous consumption of liquid electrolyte, Li dendrite growth and continuous interface side reactions.<sup><xref rid="cit56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> For the case of PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub>, due to the excessively large pore size, which could not effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites, occurs short circuit after 300 hours. Therefore, the Li/Li cell with SGPE-40 present more stable polarization potential than that of Celgard 2400 or PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting this sandwich structure can decrease the polarization of Li stripping and deposition. Different current density (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) was further used to test the plating/striping behavior of the SGPE-40. Compared with the low current density state, the polarization voltage has increased from around 48 mV to around 81 mV, but the Li/Li cell with SGPE-40 also can stable cycle for over 130 h, as shown in Fig. S9,<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> indicating that SGPE-40 can effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites and promote the uniform deposition of lithium ions, which may be due to the synergy effect of adding the fillers and adjusting the pore size.<sup><xref rid="cit57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Different Li anodes after cycling in LFP/Li batteries using Celgard, PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub>, and SGPE-40 were measured by SEM, as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g&#x02013;i</xref>. Dense and smooth lithium deposition are realized in SGPE-40 caused by its porous structure with smaller pore size.<sup><xref rid="cit58" ref-type="bibr">58,59</xref></sup> However, for the other cases, large and thick lithium moss or dendrites were observed on the Li anode surface, which not only cause the loss of the charge&#x02013;discharge specific capacity of the battery, but also cause short-circuit, thermal runaway and other dangers. After cycling tests, the surface of the SGPE-40 membrane becomes relatively rough (Fig. S10<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>) compared with the initial state. It may be attributed to the side reaction between Li metal and C&#x02013;F group in PVDF-HFP.<sup><xref rid="cit60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Additionally, the TEM images shows that SGPE-40 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7k</xref>) can form a uniform cathode solid interphase (CEI) on the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> material and its thickness is about 20 nm, while PVDF-HFP@SiO<sub>2</sub> cannot (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7j</xref>).

This novel designed sandwich gel electrolyte exhibits good flame retardancy, geometric stability and effective self-shutdown characteristics. Safe batteries with this SGPE shows high battery performance at ambient temperature and self-shutdown under high temperature, because the pores will be closed beyond a given threshold.

Introduction</title><p>Li ion batteries (LIBs) provide a unique combination of high energy, power and cyclability that makes them the first choice to power portable electronics and electric vehicles (EVs). In spite of this, the rapidly growing EV industry is imposing highly demanding requirements which are a challenge for a technology that is currently reaching a safety, lifetime and energy density plateau [<xref rid="B1-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Within the race towards high-voltage and high-energy density active materials [<xref rid="B2-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], liquid organic electrolytes result in electrochemical stability issues along with safety concerns due to their high volatility and flammability. The replacement of the liquid organic electrolyte in conventional LIBs by solid electrolytes, considered as a solution to high-capacity lithium-metal anodes owing to their mechanical strength, in solid-state batteries (SSBs), offers outstanding high-energy and high-power densities as well as inherent safety [<xref rid="B3-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, far from being a reality, there are still many challenges to overcome on the use of lithium metal anodes for solid-state batteries [<xref rid="B7-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]: most of the solid inorganic Li ion conductors are thermodynamically unstable [<xref rid="B9-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and dendrite growth is still a problem due to the inhomogeneous dissolution and subsequent deposition over cycling [<xref rid="B8-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, the continuous stripping and plating of Li metal needs to be fast enough to ensure their performance at an acceptable C-rate.</p><p>Among the wide range of solid electrolytes, organic solid polymer electrolytes have attracted widespread attention over their inorganic electrolyte competitors due to relevant advantages such a low density, a lower interfacial resistance between the components, ease of processing and excellent mechanical properties [<xref rid="B13-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, batteries including dry solid polymer electrolytes for which poly(ethylene)oxide (PEO) with conductive lithium salts is the forefront material need to operate at temperatures above 60 &#x000b0;C due to their low ionic conductivity (10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and Li<sup>+</sup> transference number (0.3) at room temperature, which affects the rate capability of the SSB. Nevertheless, solid-state PEO-based batteries have shown very promising performances [<xref rid="B17-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; indeed, a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> PEO-based cell with lithium metal anode is commercially available for EVs [<xref rid="B18-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In spite of the limited electrochemical stability of PEO (&#x0003c;3.8 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>) [<xref rid="B6-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], successful combination with high-voltage active materials such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B19-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Li(Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>Mn<sub>1&#x02212;x&#x02212;y</sub>)O<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B22-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid="B24-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] foresees a promising future for this chemistry, but still with important limitations on the anode side. The replacement of Li metal negative electrode by the spinel Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LTO) negative material would avoid stripping&#x02013;plating issues, dendrite growth and will ensure high performance devices with improved safety. LTO negative material delivers 175 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at an operating potential of 1.5 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. This material exhibits an exceptional electrochemical stability and is one of the most appealing negative materials to power lithium ion batteries in applications that require high currents, a long cycle life and high efficiency [<xref rid="B25-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, matching LTO with positive materials such as LiFePO<sub>4</sub> or LiMnO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B26-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] can still offer competitive energy density of 100 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02013;270 Wh L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 150 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02013;375 Wh L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, at reasonable areal loadings of 3.5 mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.</p><p>In SSBs, the heterogeneous nature of positive and/or negative electrodes results in various resistive interfaces and interphases of different nature and quality, jeopardizing the smooth performance of the cell, owing to multiple sources of impedance, by decreasing the capacity, increasing the polarization or inhibiting fast rate cycling [<xref rid="B27-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, an important challenge of solid-state batteries is thus to decrease such resistive sources by improving ionic and electronic conductivity. A robust electronic network at the electrode is essential to enable the transport of electrons between particles and with the current collector, ensuring fast kinetics of (de)lithiation reactions [<xref rid="B29-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additives with fibrous morphology like nanostructured multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show a high intrinsic electronic conductivity along the carbon fiber axis, thus providing a larger amount of electron-transport pathways for electroactive particles [<xref rid="B30-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this regard, CNTs have been studied for battery applications due to their excellent electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, high mesoporosity and good electrolyte accessibility [<xref rid="B30-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we report for the first time the electrochemical performance of LTO electrodes with a PEO-based electrolyte.

The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared electrodes have been evaluated in half-cells with a PEO-based electrolyte and a Li metal anode at 70 &#x000b0;C. The type of electronic conductive additive has proven to have a strong impact on the rate capability of the electrodes. The partial replacement of carbon black C65 by CNTs led to improved electrodes showing an enhanced remarkable rate capability up to 4 C, in addition to a long-cycle life with low ageing of the components after 140 cycles at C/20.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-materials-14-01213"><title>2.

In one of the electrodes, part of C65 was replaced by multiwalled CNTs (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The ratio C65:CNTs was fixed to 100:0 and 50:50 for the electrodes labelled as LTO-C65 and LTO-C65/CNTs, respectively, to follow the influence of the CNTs.

During the initial cycles, the LTO-C65 cell delivers an initial discharge capacity of ca. 200 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), exceeding the theoretical capacity of spinel LTO, which fades rapidly upon cycling. After a few cycles, the cell delivers 150 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at C/20 and decreases down to ca. 130 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at C/5. The poor performance of this electrode is evidenced by the remarkable capacity loss as well as the low and unstable coulombic efficiency (CE), with charging steps sometimes reaching the 10% time limitation. At higher currents of 1 C, the LTO-C65 cell experiences a severe fading with no signs of red-ox response. However, the cell is able to recover 125 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at C/10 for a few cycles, although the capacity retention drops down at the 40th cycle, evidencing the end-of-life for this cell. The rate capability of the LTO-C65/CNTs electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) evidences at first sight the enhanced electrochemical performance of the cell, promoted by the addition of CNTs. The cell shows a superior behavior delivering ca. 150 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> up to C/2 and a remarkable discharge capacity at faster rates: at 1 C, the cell displays 90 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and at 4 C (15 min of charge and discharge) delivers ca. 50 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with a CE remaining as high as 99.5%. Moreover, the cell is able to recover 150 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at C/10 with no signs of fading after 40 cycles, thus proving its excellent stability and reversibility. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f002">Figure 2</xref>c shows the charge&#x02013;discharge voltage profiles for the optimized LTO-C65/CNTs electrode from C/20 to 4 C. As observed, the red-ox plateaus between C/20 and C/2 remain flat, with a polarization below 60 mV. However, above C/2 the plateau turns into a sloppy profile with a polarization increasing above 250 mV, which could be ascribed to the insufficient ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte leading to kinetic limitations on the Li-ion transport in agreement to the low capacity observed at fast rates. The superior performance of the electrode including CNTs is supported by the impedance spectra shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f002">Figure 2</xref>d. The Nyquist plot of the cells with both electrodes shows a well-defined semicircle at high frequencies (0.01 MHz&#x02013;100 Hz) followed by a spike from 100 Hz to 1 Hz.

A similar bulk resistance of LTO-C65 and LTO-C65/CNTs was found to be 8 and 3 &#x003a9;, respectively.

Both cells display an interfacial electrode resistance, with a capacitance value of ca. 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> F, which is 50% lower for the CNTs electrode, evidencing that the addition of CNTs decreases the interfacial resistances at electrode level, in agreement with the superior performance of this electrode.

An EIS of the cell was obtained at the end of the 140th cycle after cycling at C/20. The Nyquist plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f003">Figure 3</xref>b) evidences an increase in the overall resistance above 1000 &#x003a9;, compared to the low resistance before cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f002">Figure 2</xref>d and <xref rid="materials-14-01213-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Several resistances have been identified for this cell after cycling. On the one side, the bulk resistance increases from 3 to 15 &#x003a9; after cycling, likely due to a slightly lower conductivity of the electrolyte arising from the degradation of the polymer and/or LiTFSI salt. Besides, the interfacial resistances at the electrodes (R<sub>int</sub>) increase up to 298 &#x003a9;. Such large resistance arises from physicochemical processes occurring at the SPE/Li metal interface or internal interfaces at the LTO electrode. An additional resistance appears after cycling and has been ascribed to the formation of a cathode solid electrolyte interface resistance (R<sub>CEI</sub>), which could explain the irreversible capacity observed during the initial cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) [<xref rid="B35-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Despite such large resistive CEI, the high discharge capacity and the high coulombic efficiency attained after 140 cycles evidence the positive contribution of this stable interface.</p><p>The evolution of the overpotential of the cell over cycling has been plotted in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. At C/20 the overpotential increases from 25 mV to 140 mV after 140 cycles, which corresponds to an increase of 400%. At C/5, the initial overpotential, 70 mV, is much higher than that at C/20, although after 40 cycles the increase remains below 25%. These results may indicate that cycling at lower currents induces a slow degradation of the cell interfaces, evidenced by the large resistance as well as the high overpotential of the cell. However, at higher currents the failure of the cell is probably induced by the formation of dendrites [<xref rid="B10-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as observed from the sudden loss of capacity at C/5. The high current density is prone to favor dendritic Li metal during Li electrodeposition. The morphology and corresponding elemental distribution of the interfaces were examined by the cross-sectional SEM and elemental mapping, respectively [<xref rid="B38-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. During the disassembly of the full cell, the Li metal was detached from the solid electrolyte. Then, the bilayer of electrolyte and electrode was cross sectioned by ion milling. The cross-section from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f003">Figure 3</xref>c confirms the retention of the structural integrity of all the aged components as well as the contact at the solid electrolyte&#x02014;electrode interface, in spite of more than 5600 h of cycling (140 cycles). Neither cracks nor voids are observed along the electrode thickness. The detachment of the electrode from the Al substrate of ca. 3 &#x003bc;m length may indicate some loss of binding properties over cycling, which would also explain the increase of R<sub>int</sub>, although it may arise from the manipulation during the preparation of the sample. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f003">Figure 3</xref>d shows the examination by EDX mapping of the squared scan across the bilayer thickness. The chemical composition analysis indicates the presence of Al from the substrate, Ti from the LTO active material and F and S species from the Li salt (LiTFSI). No segregation or diffusion of the elements across the thickness is observed and the uniform distribution of titanium is in agreement with the homogenous dispersion of the particles observed on the SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01213-f001">Figure 1</xref>) from the pristine electrodes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-materials-14-01213"><title>4. Discussion on the Electrode Design for Solid-State Batteries</title><p>The present work highlights the promising prospects of LTO as anode material for solid-state PEO batteries. In addition, it demonstrates the importance of a careful electrode design, with special attention on the electronic additives [<xref rid="B34-materials-14-01213" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Carbon nanotubes provide an improved and robust electronic conductivity network at the electrode, thereby overcoming important limitations of solid-state batteries. The partial replacement of C65 by CNTs effectively enhances the power capability as well as the long cycling life of the LTO anodes. This is confirmed by the high rate capability up to C/2 as well as the stable cycling at C/20 during 140 cycles, delivering 150 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, thus being particularly suitable for stationary applications with guaranteed high power peak demands. Cycling at a rate of C/5 leads to failure of the cell after 40 h, probably caused by dendrite formation promoted by the Li metal anode. However, cycling at lower currents of C/20 induces a slow degradation of the cell interfaces, ensuring a long cycling life of the cell. Further research coupling LTO electrodes with high-voltage positive materials is envisaged to take this technology to the next level. We demonstrate that the integration of LTO electrode in solid-state batteries is valuable and shows very promising performance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, F.A. and P.L.-A.; methodology, A.O.M. and N.G.; validation, F.A., P.L.-A. and A.O.M.; formal analysis, A.O.M., N.G., P.L.-A. and F.A.; investigation, A.O.M., N.G., P.L.-A. and F.A.; resources, F.A.; data curation, A.O.M., P.L.-A.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, P.L.-A.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, P.L.-A., A.O.M. and F.A.; visualization, P.L.-A.; supervision, P.L.-A., F.A.; project administration, F.A.; funding acquisition, F.A.

though lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries possess higher theoretical
capacity and energy density than conventional lithium-ion batteries,
the challenging issues such as poor electronic conductivity of sulfur,
dendrite formation and subsequent polysulfide shuttling, and the undesirable
interfacial properties of the lithium metal anode with an electrolyte
impede this system from commercialization. To circumvent the dissolution
of lithium polysulfides and to improve the interfacial properties
of the electrolyte with the lithium metal anode, numerous tactics
have been employed. Therefore, in this work, hybrid electrolytes composed
of room-temperature ionic liquids of different cations with the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(TFSI) anion and a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte [1 M LiTFSI in tetraethylene
glycol dimethyl ether/1,3-dioxolane 1:1 (v/v)] have been prepared,
and their physicoelectrochemical properties were thoroughly investigated.
The lithium surface upon cycling was characterized by Raman, Fourier
transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses.
The dendrite and shuttle current measurements also indicated the formation
of a stable solid electrolyte interphase and lower polysulfide shuttling
between the electrodes. Among the systems examined, the hybrid electrolyte
composed of 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium TFSI exhibited appreciable
charge&#x02013;discharge characteristics, better interfacial properties
with the lithium metal anode, and increased ionic conductivity which
were attributed to the enhanced ion-pair interaction that is present
between the 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium cation and the TFSI anion
in the electrolyte which was substantiated by Raman analysis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao8b03544</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao-2018-03544m</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the mechanism of the first lithium&#x02013;sulfur
battery
system was introduced by Ulam and Herbert in 1962, its technological
importance was recognized only two decades ago. The unique properties
such as the high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1672 mA h g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), environment-friendliness, low cost, and so forth have identified
lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries as a promising candidate for energy
storage and conversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the low conductivity of sulfur, dissolution and polysulfide
shuttling between the electrodes, and the poor electrode/electrolyte
interfacial properties of the lithium metal anode with nonaqueous
liquid electrolytes impede this system from practical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> However, enormous attempts have been made to
address these challenges around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> The conductivity of sulfur was appreciably increased by wrapping
elemental sulfur in carbon nanotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and
conducting polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and incorporating
solid additives such as MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> metal organic frameworks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> and so forth.
However, the performance of Li&#x02013;S batteries continues to suffer
from low Coulombic efficiency and capacity fade because of the low
utilization of elemental sulfur which arises from the dissolution
of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> when the system is
in conjunction with a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte. The most commonly
used electrolyte is a combination of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl
ether (TEGDME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) containing approximately 1
M Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) with LiNO<sub>3</sub> as an additive. To overcome the shuttling of lithium polysulfides
as intermediates of the discharged products, attempts have been made
to replace the nonaqueous liquid electrolytes with solid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and gel polymer electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Superionic conductors have also been employed as solid
electrolytes for lithium&#x02013;sulfur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and for Li-ion batteries with LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Although the migration of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> was effectively suppressed by the solid electrolytes, the
poor solid electrolyte/solid electrode interfacial properties and
low diffusion of Li<sup>+</sup> ions restrict the rate capability
of the Li&#x02013;S system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Therefore, designing
of the liquid electrolyte with a potentially lower solubility of discharge
species (S<sub>8</sub> to Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) is an effective way to enhance the performance of Li&#x02013;S batteries.</p><p>Generally, the ether-based electrolytes selectively coordinate
with the Li<sup>+</sup> Lewis acidic cation and have a high donor
number. This offers an improved solubility to lithium polysulfide
and provides an adequate concentration of redox sulfur species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Among the different organic solvents, DOL has
a high stability toward lithium anode by passively creating a solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the surface of lithium and also
better polysulfide solubility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> As a result,
this mixture (TEGDME + DOL) can provide sufficient specific discharge
capacity and longer cycle life at a high C rate. Nevertheless, DOL
is easily prone to degradation by small amounts of contaminants in
addition to polysulfide shuttling.</p><p>Ionic liquids (ILs) made
of only ions have been identified as a
possible replacement to highly inflammable organic solvents. The advantages
of ILs include negligibly low volatility, relatively less flammability,
high thermal stability, wide electrochemical stability, and better
safety. However, the properties of ILs are mainly determined by their
ionic nature. According to Cairns and Shin, ILs for lithium battery
applications are employed in different formulations: IL&#x02013;lithium
salt as binary electrolytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> IL&#x02013;lithium
salt with a polymer as gel electrolytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> and IL&#x02013;lithium salt with an organic solvent as ternary mixtures/hybrid
electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Watanebe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> quantitatively estimated the dependence of the
ionic structure, the polarity, the physicochemical properties, and
the degree of ionic nature of different ILs. The lithium polysulfide
diffusion and migration are mainly influenced by the physicochemical
nature of the electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The same
group has identified <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diethyl-<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-(2-methoxyethyl) ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide
as an alternative electrolyte for the lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries
in which lithium polysulfide was significantly suppressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Earlier reports clearly demonstrated the solubility
and mobility of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> which
can be successfully controlled by PP13TFSI by the weak Lewis acidic/basic
coordination of Li<sup>+</sup>-cation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> thereby suppressing the growth of lithium deposition. In a similar
way, <italic>N</italic>-methyl-(<italic>n</italic>-butyl)pyrrolidinium
TFSI also offers a high operating voltage though it suffers from poor
conductivity because of its viscous nature. On the contrary, trialkylammonium-based
ILs showed high ionic conductivity. Considering these properties,
in the present work, a series of hybrid electrolytes composed of commonly
used liquid electrolytes [comprising 1 M LiTFSI in a combination of
TEGDME and DOL of 1:1 (v/v) as solvents] and ILs of different cations
for different volume ratios were prepared, and their electrochemical
and interfacial properties were thoroughly investigated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a&#x02013;f

the solvent molecules and the high viscosity of room temperature ILs

diffusion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structural formula of the IL and organic solvents.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao-2018-03544m_0001" id="gr1" position="float"/></fig><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Ionic Conductivity and Compatibility Studies</title><p>The dependence

the addition of BMP and MPP, the conductivity is increased. Maximum
ionic conductivity was achieved when the content of e tbare electrolyte/IL

the values of ionic conductivity because of the increase in viscosity
of the hybrid solution. A similar trend was observed by Shin and Cairns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> On the contrary, in the present study, in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c, there is no increase

as discussed by Fox et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> The reduction
in conductivity in TES-containing ILs could be attributed to the steric
hindrance offered by the branched structure of the cation which leads
to a sluggish mass transport.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Ionic conductivity studies of the electrolytes,

performance of a Li&#x02013;S cell
with IL is attributed to the low solubility of polysulfide in IL.
However, the passivating film formed on the lithium metal also contributes
crucially to the determination of the charge&#x02013;discharge behavior
of the lithium&#x02013;sulfur cells. To evaluate the interfacial properties
of the lithium metal, symmetric cells with different electrolytes
were fabricated, and their interfacial resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>i</sub>) was measured as a function of time and displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>. The value of <italic>R</italic><sub>i</sub> can be generally obtained from the Nyquist
plots. The parallel combination of resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>film</sub>) and capacitance associated with the passivating film
on the Li electrode is represented by large semicircles. The small
semicircle is attributed to the double-layer capacitance in parallel
with the charge-transfer resistance. Interestingly, the intercept
of the large semicircle at high frequency on the real <italic>Z</italic>-axis is presumably associated with the <italic>R</italic><sub>i</sub> value of the lithium surface with the electrolyte system. It can
be clearly seen from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> that for a symmetric cell with BMP and TES, the value of <italic>R</italic><sub>i</sub> increases with the increase of time, which
is presumably because of the formation of a resistive precipitation
layer on the lithium anode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> However,
in the case of IL 2, IL 3, and IL 4 (hybrid electrolytes), the value
of <italic>R</italic><sub>i</sub> was found to be lower and is attributed
to the cation&#x02013;TFSI interaction with the electrolyte, which
helps to form a dense SEI layer with a thickness of a few micrometers,
which prevents the direct contact between the polysulfides and the
lithium metal. It is found that the ILs alone exhibited the highest
interfacial resistance because of their increased tendency to form
a passivation layer compared to that of alkyl carbonates. These results
are in accordance with the work by Katayama et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> wherein PEGDME was employed as a solvent to reduce the
interfacial resistance compared to pure ILs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Compatibility studies

The lithium metal surface which is in contact with the hybrid electrolyte

For all of the modes associated with the TFSI<sup>&#x02013;</sup> anion,
the intensity relative to the MPP<sup>+</sup> cation was found to
increase upon the addition of LiTFSI to the MPP IL. The strongest
band of the TFSI anion at 742 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was ascribed
to the bending of CF<sub>3</sub> in the SCF<sub>3</sub> groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> Interestingly, the peaks corresponding to the
expansion and contraction of the bulky TFSI anion occur, and these
vibrational modes induce an adverse change in the polarizability,

by the anion coordination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p><p>In accordance

In addition, the fingerprint region also consists of relatively weak

the nonaqueous liquid electrolyte, densely packed inorganic compounds,
and aggregated organic compounds on reaction with the Li metal. The
thickness of the SEI layer varies from a few nanometers to tens of
nanometers and is sensitive to chemical conditions; though it is insulating
in nature, it is ionically conducting. It also serves as a protective
barrier in screening the bulk electrolyte from the strongly reducing
lithium metal anode. To get a better insight into the SEI phenomena
and dendrite formation, a closer understanding of the lithium dissolution
kinetics, which represents the discharge (stripping) and deposition
kinetics congruent to the charging process, is required. As this can
be quantified by an overpotential, a simple tool to probe the formation
of dendrites in a lithium metal anode when in conjugation with a liquid
electrolyte under constant current cycling experiments was employed
as proposed by Bieker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> In the present

of deposition and dissolution of lithium at the WE. As seen from <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>a, the apparent initial
high overpotentials of lithium dissolution on the lithium surface
is attributed to the smooth and less surface area of fresh lithium.
Further, the overpotential remains constant even after prolonged cycling,
which confirms that the dissolution of lithium is stable in an already
roughened lithium surface with a robust SEI.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>(a) Evolution of overpotential

two voltage
plateaus during discharging (2.1 and 2.3 V) and a single plateau (2.3

is also apparent from <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>a that the first reduction voltage of the Li&#x02013;S cell
containing bare electrolytes is slightly higher than that of IL/IL-4
containing hybrid electrolytes. This is ascribed to the solvent effect
associated with the less solubility of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> These insoluble intermediates,
Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, as solids will get deposited
inside the composite sulfur cathode. The Li&#x02013;S cell with the
hybrid electrolyte comprising MPP-4 exhibited a high overpotential,
and it also delivered a discharge capacity of 300 mA h g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> on its first cycle which is much lower than that of the Li&#x02013;S
cell with other hybrid electrolytes. Although the solubility of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> is very low in ILs, the transport
properties of the hybrid electrolytes are shown to have an influence
on the charge&#x02013;discharge behavior of these systems. The ionic
conductivity of MPP and its hybrid is high compared to TES and BMP.
The charge&#x02013;discharge behavior of ILs is even worse than that
of the hybrid electrolytes, and only 50 cycles could be achieved.
Among the three hybrid electrolytes, the Li&#x02013;S cell with MPP-4
exhibited the maximum discharge capacity on its first cycle (1346
mA h g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) and the 50th cycle (398 mA h g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). In a similar way, the Li&#x02013;S cells with BMP-4 and TES-4 exhibited
301 and 1237 mA h g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> on their first cycles, respectively.
However, the discharge capacity reduced rapidly for the Li&#x02013;S
cells with BMP-4 and TES-4 as electrolytes. The IL-4 hybrid electrolyte
containing MPP has a balance between the solubility of polysulfides
and the diffusion rate. MPP offers a wide electrochemical range,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> and the weak coordination of the Lewis acid
and base pairs in the MPP-containing electrolyte alleviates lithium
polysulfide solubility. In addition, MPP is less viscous (10.3 cP
at 25 &#x000b0;C) compared to the others and has the potential to suppress
the lithium polysulfide diffusion rate appreciably as evidenced by
the shuttle current measurement (as discussed in the following section).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>Shuttle Current Estimation</title><p>One of the crucial parameters
for capacity fade in Li&#x02013;S cells is associated with the shuttling
process. The insight into the differences in the shuttling process
observed with various IL-based hybrid electrolytes was determined
by shuttle current estimation, as proposed by Moy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> In general, the open-circuit potential of the
anode is relatively constant and depends on the concentration of lithium
ions in the electrolyte and the accessibility of metallic lithium
on the anode. However, the potential of the cathode steadily decreases
because of the arrival of lower order polysulfides continuously at
the cathode from the anode by the shuttling phenomenon. In this experiment,
the cathode potential is maintained as constant by the application
of an external current which is proportional to the diffusional fluxes
of the polysulfides in the electrolyte across the electrodes. Hence,
the shuttle current can be quantified by forcing the electrode potential
to a constant value and measuring the response via the steady-state
current through the cell.</p><p>The linear region can be fit by a
straight line equation of the form (<xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>).<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao-2018-03544m_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula>where the

decay in shuttle current is observed for all lithium&#x02013;sulfur

in shuttle current sheds information on the amount of polysulfide
reduced to insoluble lower order polysulfide at the lithium metal
surface. Therefore, prevention of the deposition of lower order species
at the anode is expected to decrease the capacity fade in Li&#x02013;S
cells, via its effects on decreasing the slope of the shuttle current. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref> displays the shuttle
current versus time plot for the lithium&#x02013;sulfur cell with the

electrolyte composed of 1 M LiTFSI in a
combination of TEGDME and DOL (1:1 v/v) has been widely used, the
polysulfide shuttling and SEI on lithium are the challenging issues.
In the present work, the role of different cations of ILs to overcome
these challenges was systematically investigated. A series of hybrid
electrolytes composed of the aforementioned liquid electrolyte and
ILs of different cations, viz., BMP, MPP, and TES were prepared, and
their ionic conductivity and compatibility with the lithium metal
anode were also analyzed. It is found that the solvent&#x02013;IL interaction
influences the ionic conductivity and the SEI film thickness. The
Raman and FTIR studies of the lithium surface in contact with the
bare and hybrid electrolytes confirmed the presence of both conformers
(cis and trans) in the liquid phase of all hybrid electrolytes (IL-4).
Among the three cations investigated, the MPP-4 hybrid electrolyte
showed an enhanced cycling performance which was attributed to the
suppression of dendrite formation, polysulfide shuttling, and SEI
growth, as evidenced by the dendrite, shuttle current, and XPS analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental

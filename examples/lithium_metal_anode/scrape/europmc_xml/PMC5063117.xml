However, the growth of dendrites greatly hinders the practical applications of LMBs in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Constructing stable and efficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is among the most effective strategies to inhibit the dendrite growth and thus to achieve a superior cycling performance. In this review, the mechanisms of SEI formation and models of SEI structure are briefly summarized. The analysis methods to probe the surface chemistry, surface morphology, electrochemical property, dynamic characteristics of SEI layer are emphasized. The critical factors affecting the SEI formation, such as electrolyte component, temperature, current density, are comprehensively debated. The efficient methods to modify SEI layer with the introduction of new electrolyte system and additives, ex&#x02010;situ&#x02010;formed protective layer, as well as electrode design, are summarized. Although these works afford new insights into SEI research, robust and precise routes for SEI modification with well&#x02010;designed structure, as well as understanding of the connection between structure and electrochemical performance, is still inadequate. A multidisciplinary approach is highly required to enable the formation of robust SEI for highly efficient energy storage systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="advs52-kwd-0001">solid electrolyte interphase</kwd><kwd id="advs52-kwd-0002">energy storage</kwd><kwd id="advs52-kwd-0003">lithium metal</kwd><kwd id="advs52-kwd-0004">lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries</kwd><kwd id="advs52-kwd-0005">lithium ion batteries</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>advs52</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March 2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.0.0 mode:remove_FC converted:19.12.2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

Li dendrites can short&#x02010;circuit the cell causing a safety risk. In the 1990s, Li&#x02010;ion batteries (LIBs) were introduced by Sony Corporation to address the dendrite issues by hosting Li in a graphitic material. Li ion insertion strategies led to the tremendous success of LIBs in consumer portable electronics.<xref rid="advs52-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> It should be noted that the enhanced battery safety of LiBs is at a significant cost of energy density, because the specific capacity of Li metal (3860 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is ten times larger than that of graphite (370 mA h g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Though LIBs are now gradually approaching their theoretical limit, they still cannot meet the booming requirements for personal electronics and electric vehicles. With the development of advanced electrolytes, separators, and other battery components, Li&#x02010;metal&#x02010;based rechargeable batteries have been strongly considered in recent years.<xref rid="advs52-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>
</p><p>The safe use of Li metal as an anode is still a great challenge, as the dendritic and mossy metal deposits are very easily obtained on the working Li metal anode. Li dendrites induce a low Coulombic efficiency and severe safety risk, hindering the practical demonstration of Li metal batteries (LMBs) with very high energy density. The dendrite nucleation and growth are closely related to the surface layer between the electrolyte and anode. The surface component and structure of the layer play an extremely important effect on the morphology of Li deposits and decide the cycling performance of LMBs.<xref rid="advs52-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>
</p><p>As Li metal can react with most organic solvents, a surface film is formed during the initial charging/discharging processes. In 1979, Peled firstly realized the electrically insulating and ionically conductive interface and named it as the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).<xref rid="advs52-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> The SEI layer is with a thickness of &#x02248;20 nm and includes various organic and inorganic components. On one hand, the formation of the SEI intrinsically consumes the anode and electrolyte, leading to a low efficiency. On the other hand, the SEI effectively prevents the further physical contact between Li and the solvent, therefore making Li dynamically stable in certain organic solvents. Beyond that, the SEI can adjust the distribution of Li ions from the bulk electrolyte to the anode<xref rid="advs52-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> (<bold>Figure</bold>

The even deposition of Li ions leads to dendrite&#x02010;free morphology of LMBs with high efficiency.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="advs52-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A schematic description of Li&#x02010;ion diffusion from the bulk electrolyte to the anode.<xref rid="advs52-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> a) The solvated Li ion sheds its solvent molecules and thus has the access to the internal Schottky vacancy of the SEI. b) The Li ion continuously migrates through the bulk of the SEI by relaying itself in Schottky vacancies. c) The free Li ion reaches the anode surface and accepts an electron from the current collector, then deposits as Li metal.</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-3" xlink:href="ADVS-3-1500213-g001"/></fig><p>The SEI film is widely observed in LIBs. In routine LIBs, robust SEI layers can be formed when graphite, silicon and other oxides are employed as the anode. Since the SEI on the graphite anode can be extremely stable during several thousands of cycles in the carbonate electrolyte, the as&#x02010;obtained LIBs with the graphite anode have been successfully commercialized. However, the SEI layer of Li metal is usually unstable and is not yet well understood. Compared with volume changes of &#x02248;10 and 400% for graphite and silicon anodes, respectively, the relative volumetric change of Li metal anode is virtually infinite, because Li metal is &#x02018;hostless&#x02019;. The huge volume change requires the SEI layer with high elastic modulus. Dendrite growth is widely observed in LMBs, which is a fundamental challenge in LMB researche but has been detected less in current commercial LIBs. Consequently, the issue is much tougher for the SEI layer of Li metal in LMBs than that of LIBs. The fundamental exploration of SEIs on LMB is the first step to understand the complex but important issue of Li metal anode.</p><p>For an ideal SEI, it should have several features, such as high Li ionic conductivity, proper thickness with compact structure, and high elastic strength to mechanically suppress the breakthrough by Li dendrites, which is an important part to inhibit the dendrite growth on Li metal anode. However, the SEI layer of LMBs is unstable in some extreme operation conditions, such as extreme high/low temperature and high cycling rates. The formed SEI either grows much thicker or becomes non&#x02010;protective, which induces rapid performance degradation. Consequently, many strategies have been proposed to construct a stable SEI, such as the electrolyte additives, electrode design, charging models, etc.</p><p>In this contribution, the recent advances in fundamental science of the SEI formation on the Li metal anode are reviewed. Firstly, the formation mechanisms of SEI and models of SEI structure on Li metal anode are briefly summarized. The recent progress in the characterization of the components, structure, and electrochemical property of SEI layer are fully investigated. The principles of SEI formation under different operation parameters and SEI modification for robust use in a working cell are summarized. Finally, recent developments and new directions in research on SEIs of Li metal anode are also involved.</p></sec><sec id="advs52-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>Mechanism of SEI Formation</title><p>The present electrolyte systems in LMBs mostly contain solvents and Li salts.<xref rid="advs52-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="advs52-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> The common solvents are esters (e.g. ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC)), ethers (e.g. 1,2&#x02010;dimethoxyethane (DME), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), 1,3&#x02010;dioxolane (DOL), tetrahydrofuran (THF)), and sulfones (dimethylsulfoxide and trimethylene sulfite).

The unique double electric layer allows the products to attach themselves to the existing film.

Typically, the models are classified as: (i) structural ones, which link measured EIS data with kinetic parameters, concentrations and diffusion coefficients of the process, and (ii) formal ones, which describe the experimental impedances to obtain a good fitting between the calculated and experimental impedances, but without clear physico&#x02010;chemical significance.

However, none of them is capable to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Li surface yet. FTIR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, AES, NMR can provide the surface components of SEI layer. SEM and other high resolution microscopy can be applied to reveal the high resolution morphology of SEI. AFM is a powerful tool to investigate the structure, thickness, and mechanical property of SEI. EIS is a powerful and widely accepted technique to analyze the resistance of SEI layer in a working cell. In situ and in operando technologies are also critical to investigate morphology, structure, and electrochemical dynamics revolution of SEI layer. The theoretical chemistry is beneficial to understand the SEI at molecular scale. A rational combination of these characterization techniques is strongly considered to afford insightful understanding of the complex composition and morphology evolution of the SEI layer. More in situ and in operando methods are highly required for the dynamic characterization of SEI layer on Li metal. Since liquid electrolyte is the actual working condition of most cells, the in operando methods are expected to provide much more reliable information when they are conducted under the working conditions of batteries with organic electrolyte rather than in a vacuum environment or solid/ionic liquid electrolyte.</p></sec></sec><sec id="advs52-sec-0090"><label>4</label><title>SEI Regulation</title><sec id="advs52-sec-0100"><label>4.1</label><title>Factors Influencing SEI Formation</title><sec id="advs52-sec-0110"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Electrolyte Component</title><p>The components of SEI are always contributed from the reduction and decomposition of the electrolyte.

For a Li&#x02010;ion cell, Li metal anode affords the possibility to improve the energy density further because the cell&#x02010;energy&#x02010;density based on the intercalation anode is approaching its theoretical maximum. For the Li&#x02013;S and Li&#x02013;O<sub>2</sub> batteries, the issue of the Li metal anode is more urgent because Li metal anodes not only provide high energy density, but also bring many troubles on the cycling performance. More and more investigations indicate that the bottleneck of LMBs lies in Li metal anode and especially the SEI layer on the anode which determines the cycling life and efficiency. A stable and efficient SEI is the basic requirement to realize broad commercial applications of LMBs.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="advs52-fig-0017" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 17</label><caption><p>Proof&#x02010;of&#x02010;concept LMBs based on pouch cells. a) The pouch cell with full&#x02010;cell configuration of PGN anode and Li&#x02010;PGN cathode that powering an LED device (&#x02248;20 mA h).

The formation of a stable SEI is very important to achieve high cycling efficiency and long cycling life of LMB. An ideal SEI with intrinsic minimum electrical conductivity and maximum Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity should be flexible and elastic to accommodate active material breathing and non&#x02010;uniform electrochemical behavior. Remarkable progress has been achieved on the SEI components, morphology, and formation mechanism in the organic electrolyte. Effective strategies to stabilize the SEI structure through electrolyte component modulation, &#x02018;artificial&#x02019; SEI on Li metal, nanostructured Li&#x02010;metal&#x02010;based anode, as well as solid electrolyte have been proposed and verified recently.</p><p>However, the fundamental understanding on the SEI structure, formation, property, and regulation are still inadequate. The insights on the following aspects of SEI on Li metal should be strongly considered: (1) The exact role of the SEI. Little knowledge has been gained about the role of the SEI components on the cycling performance, because the function of SEI components has not clearly been analyzed in most published literature. (2) The accurate process of Li&#x02010;ion crossing in the SEI. It is generally accepted that Li ions sheds its solvent molecules and then crosses the SEI layer before arrival at the surface of Li metal. However, such a process has not been dynamically observed and the rate is still unknown. More&#x02010;smartly&#x02010;designed in operando techniques should be developed to track the process in a working cell. (3) Controllable modification of the SEI. Many effective strategies have been proposed to modify the SEI structure. However, the modifying process is still out of control in a bulk cell because the thickness, density, ion conductivity etc. cannot yet be rationally designed.</p><p>A robust SEI layer is critical to protect the anode in a rechargeable battery for practical applications. More scientific explorations on the fundamental understanding and SEI layer building require collaborative works from physics, chemistry, materials, nanotechnology, as well as engineering communities. Through further investigation of the science and engineering of SEI on Li metal, the use of Li metal as a superior anode in a rechargeable cell is quite promising. The ultra&#x02010;stable and very robust SEI will enable broad applications of rechargeable Li metal in advanced Li&#x02013;S batteries, Li&#x02013;O<sub>2</sub> batteries, and other advanced Li batteries.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="advs52-sec-0210"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Natural Scientific Foundation of China (21422604 and 21561130151), National Basic Research Program of China (2011CB932602 and 2015CB932500), and Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program (2014z22076).</p></ack><ref-list id="advs52-bibl-0001"><ref id="advs52-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="advs52-cit-0001">

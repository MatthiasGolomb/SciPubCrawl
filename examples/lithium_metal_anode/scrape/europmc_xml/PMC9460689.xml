Introduction</title><p>The accelerating developments in power vehicles and portable electronic devices put forward higher requirements for the energy density of traditional lithium-ion batteries [<xref rid="B1-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recently, commercial lithium-ion batteries with graphite anode materials are facing theoretically extremely high values of energy density [<xref rid="B3-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, electrode materials with high capacity need to be developed urgently. Among them, lithium metal is attracting considerable attention as a next-generation anode material owing to its ideal theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and ultra-low redox potential (&#x02212;3.04 V versus standard hydrogen electrode) [<xref rid="B5-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite the above advantages, lithium metal batteries face many challenges in the practical process. First, the high chemical activity of metallic lithium makes it easy to react irreversibly with most electrolytes, thence forming a solid electrolyte layer (SEI) on the anode surface [<xref rid="B6-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The formation of SEI film consumes active lithium and reduces Coulombic efficiency. The formation of non-uniform SEI leads to an uneven diffusion of lithium ions, which affects the initial lithium nucleation and aggravates the formation of lithium dendrites. Second, due to the poor conductivity of the SEI film, the transport of electrons between Li dendrites will be blocked or even completely isolated; these blocked and deactivated lithium metals cannot be reused in the subsequent cycle of the battery, so they are called &#x0201c;dead lithium&#x0201d;. The formation of dead lithium increases internal resistance and polarization, and it further reduces the Coulombic efficiency [<xref rid="B7-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Third, the irregular growth of lithium dendrites can pierce the separator easily, even leading to a series of safety problems such as battery short circuit. Finally, the continuous plating/stripping during the cycle leads to intense changes in the volume of the lithium metal, which may cause repeated rupture and formation of the SEI film, resulting in poor cycling stability. Therefore, it is highly essential for advancing the development of LMBs to prepare a safe and stable lithium metal anode [<xref rid="B8-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Obviously, the interfacial problem of lithium metal anodes is the critical factor hindering their practical application. In this case, various efforts have been devised to optimize the interface stability of LMBs, which include: (1) electrolyte modification to adjust SEI composition [<xref rid="B12-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; (2) artificial SEI to enhance certain properties of SEI [<xref rid="B15-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; (3) separator modification [<xref rid="B17-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; (4) solid-state electrolyte [<xref rid="B20-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; and (5) 3D collector to accommodate volume changes during cycling [<xref rid="B22-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For the construction of a stable interface, polymers play a significant role in LMBs because of the high flexibility as well as the low interface resistance with electrodes. For example, the mechanical properties of the polymer guarantee it to be a protective layer to prevent the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites; some polymers react with lithium metal to modulate the SEI composition and enhance certain properties of the SEI, etc. Because of the significant increase in research activity involving functional polymer materials design for LMBs, a timely and comprehensive review is urgent to examine this attractive and continuously evolving field of study. Novel functional polymer synthesis/design strategies proposed recently as well as a systematic classification are summarized to better demonstrate the progress of this research field.</p><p>In this review, we will discuss the most important roles of functional polymer materials in LMBs: polymeric artificial SEI, polymeric functional interlayer, and polymer electrolyte (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Recent advances in the development of advanced polymeric materials are examined for boosting the stability and cycle life of LMBs as different components including artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and functional interlayers between separator and lithium metal anode. Artificial SEI is a very thin artificially designed film with a good ionic conductivity as well as moderate mechanical strength and flexibility. A polymeric interlayer is a functional film placed between separators and lithium metal anodes. The thickness is generally higher than that of artificial SEI, normally in the range of tens of nanometers to several microns. Thereafter, we will review the research progress in the design of advanced polymer electrolytes for LMBs, which as alternatives of liquid electrolytes, have attracted extensive research attention because of their low flammability, flexible processability, and high resistance to mechanical deformation. The relationship between functionalized polymer materials and improved electrochemical performance will be elucidated. Finally, the development direction of polymer materials in LMBs in the future will also be prospected.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-14-03452"><title>2. Polymeric Artificial SEI</title><p>Generally, in liquid lithium-ion batteries, a passivation layer can be deposited on the surface of electrode materials ascribing to the reaction with electrolyte during the first charge&#x02013;discharge process. This passivation layer is an electronic insulator but an excellent conductor of Li<sup>+</sup>. Li<sup>+</sup> can be embedded and extracted freely through the passivation layer, which is called &#x0201c;solid electrolyte interface film&#x0201d; (SEI) [<xref rid="B24-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, LMBs place higher requirements on SEI films. In addition to having the most basic ion conduction and electron-blocking capabilities, SEI films in Li metal batteries require more uniform composition, structure and ionic conductivity. At the same time, the volume of lithium metal surface changes significantly due to repeated deposition/stripping during the cycle, so the SEI film needs to have certain strength or good flexibility. Unfortunately, the poor interfacial stability of the SEI film formed spontaneously between the electrolyte and lithium metal affects the cycling performance of the battery [<xref rid="B25-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>To optimize the performance of lithium metal anodes, a lot of research studies have been devoted to constructing artificial SEIs. The physicochemical properties of artificial SEI films can be carefully designed and tuned to compensate for the shortcomings of naturally formed SEI films. Polymers are widely used in artificial SEI due to their good flexibility, certain ionic conductivity, and low interfacial resistance [<xref rid="B27-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This section is divided into two subsections: polymer artificial SEI and inorganic/polymer composite artificial SEI.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-polymers-14-03452"><title>2.1. Polymers as Artificial SEI</title><p>Polymer artificial SEIs are functional polymer or polymer composite coatings rationally designed to provide excellent interfacial properties. Polymer artificial SEI prepared by an ex situ method is easy to produce and directly coated on the electrode surface. Since the polymerization process does not chemically bond with the electrode, there are many options for materials and preparation methods for the coating. </p><p>Polyethylene oxide (PEO) films are widely used in LMBs because of their non-reactivity with lithium, strong ability to modulate Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion, and the electrical insulation properties. Addisu et al. applied polyethylene oxide (PEO) as an artificial SEI on the copper current collector for uniform lithium metal deposition, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a [<xref rid="B29-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Li-ions interact electrostatically with the polar oxygen atoms in PEO to adjust the Li<sup>+</sup> flux and guide uniform lithium deposition. The PEO film encapsulates the deposited lithium to shed lithium from electrolyte contact and promotes the production of a strong but thin SEI layer. Moreover, the PEO film interacts with the lithium salt (such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI)) in the electrolyte, so it can reduce the consumption of the electrolyte on the electrode interface and enhance the Li<sup>+</sup> transfer. A uniform PEO thin film coating enables highly reversible lithium plating/stripping cycles. The assembled anode-free Cu@PEO||LiFePO<sub>4</sub> full cell was determined to cycled stably, of which the average Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention attained 98.6% and 30% over 200 cycles at 0.2 &#x000b0;C. Similarly, Dong et al. applied 18-crown-6 ether and polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF coated onto the lithium anode surface as artificial SEI to suppress lithium dendrites [<xref rid="B30-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PVDF is a flexible host, possessing high electrochemical stability and good dielectric properties. 18-crown-6 and PVDF composite coatings provide flexibility and high lithium-ion conductivity, which inhibits dendrite growth and improves cycling stability. Biopolymers are natural polymers produced from living organisms, which are resource-rich and environmentally friendly. Zhang et al. employed natural agarose (AG) film, which is ionically conductive, highly elastic and stiff, and chemically stable, to coat the copper current collector [<xref rid="B31-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thanks to the tough and elastic features of agarose polymer film, the excessive volume change can be relieved during the Li plating/stripping process, thereby impeding the Li dendrites from its overgrowth. The high ionic conductivity enables fast Li-ion transportation. Similarly, alginate biopolymer [<xref rid="B32-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and chitosan [<xref rid="B33-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] have also been reported as functional modification layers on current collectors.</p><p>Fan et al. coated a layer of lithophilic polythiophene derivative (PTs) matrix on copper foil to realize a uniform deposition of lithium metal [<xref rid="B35-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. According to the first-principles simulation, polythiophene derivatives with shorter side chains are more profitable due to their higher adsorption energy and diffusion rate compared with lithium ions (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c). There are numerous dispersed lithophilic sites that support lithium-ion diffusion channels on the backbone of the polythiophene derivative substrate, contributing to the uniform nucleation and growth of lithium ions. The authors concluded that polythiophene derivatives that have diverse side chains enable lithium ion electrodeposition into different morphologies, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b. </p><p>The application of a highly viscoelastic polymer on the lithium metal electrode may decrease the local current density and make a more uniform morphology of deposited lithium. Cui et al. coated the electrode with a soft and highly viscoelastic polymer to achieve uniform lithium deposition [<xref rid="B36-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This polymer with mobility flows over the electrode surface to repair SEI fractures and pinholes generated during lithium plating/stripping. When repairing SEI defects, the ionic conductivity of the polymer itself is lower than that of the liquid electrolyte, which can reduce the local current density and prevents the growth of lithium dendrites. At a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, the modified electrode exhibited a stable Coulombic efficiency of about 97% over 180 cycles. Likewise, in Liu&#x02019;s previous work, a dynamic cross-linked polymer silly putty (SP) was employed as a lithium metal anode artificial SEI layer (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d) [<xref rid="B37-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The &#x0201c;solid&#x02013;liquid&#x0201d; feature of SP is reflected in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>e. SP not only adapts to electrode volume change in the process of lithium metal deposition and stripping but also reduces the side reaction between electrolyte and lithium by restricting electrolyte from lithium anode. More importantly, the rigidity and fluidity characteristic of this kind of dynamic polymer can be reversibly switched according to the growth rate of lithium to uniformly cover and prevent the dendrites growth. </p><p>Polymers with microporous structures can increase the number of Li<sup>+</sup> transport to reduce the polarization in LMBs. Ma et al. used a polymer with intrinsic micropores (PIM) to coat lithium foil [<xref rid="B38-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The liquid electrolyte is confined in a porous polymer host, which increases its cation transport number because the length of its pores is similar to that of the Debye shield in the electrolyte, creating a diffusing electrolyte bilayer at the polymer&#x02013;electrolyte interface retaining counteracting ions and repelling co-ions from the electrolyte due to its large size. Since Li-ion is the smallest ion in the system and has almost no interaction with this microporous polymer host, the diffusion of Li-ion in the pore network is higher than that of anions. As a result, the cation transport number increased significantly. This is followed by a reduction in battery polarization during lithium metal plating. In the assembled Li-Cu half-cell, the Coulombic efficiency of the modified electrode was &#x0003e;98% over 80 cycles at 0.4 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

</p><p>Compared with artificial SEI constructed by ex situ methods, the in situ counterparts are chemically bonded to the electrode, and the in situ SEI layer is tightly connected to the lithium metal anode, which is helpful for the better mechanical performance and interfacial compatibility of the electrode. </p><p>Gao et al. reported a novel skin-grafting method to regulate lithium deposition by coating the surface of lithium metal with poly((N-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-methyl) base)-5-norbornane-exo-2,3-dicarboximide)), a chemically and electrochemically activated polymer layer, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a [<xref rid="B39-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The layer consists of a ring ether group with a rigid polycyclic skeleton as a grafted polymer surface layer on metallic lithium anodes. It not only enables the incorporation of ether-based polymer components into SEI but also regulates Li plating/stripping performance in a dendrite-free manner. As a result, the Li/Cu half-cell delivers an average CE of 98.3% over 200 cycles at the current density of 0.5 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). </p><p>The abundant polar functional groups in the polymers can manipulate the lithium ion flux and guide the uniform deposition of lithium. It could also facilitate the production of favorable components in SEI. As shown <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c, an ultrathin new polyurea film protective layer was fabricated by Sun et al. [<xref rid="B40-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The polyurea film can restrict Li deposition under the film and inhibit dendritic growth as a protective layer. There is a strong interaction between the nitrogen-containing polar groups in polyurea with lithium, thence modulating the lithium ions flux, reducing polarization and leading to uniform lithium deposition effectively (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>d). Similarly, Luo et al. used a highly polar <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic>-phase PVDF coating as an artificial SEI layer for dendrite-free lithium metal anode [<xref rid="B41-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. </p><p>Some polymers react with lithium to produce functional artificial SEI-protected lithium anodes. Li et al. modified lithium foils by immersing them in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-containing DOL/DME solutions [<xref rid="B42-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Pure PDMS is not a lithium ions conductor, but the new protective layer (PDMS-LI) facilitates the conduction of lithium ions. An et al. polymerized tetramethylenevinylene (TME) in situ on the lithium metal surface for uniform lithium deposition [<xref rid="B43-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Lithium ions on the lithium metal surface can form a complex with the C=C double bond of TME, producing a strong artificial SEI layer. Young&#x02019;s modulus of the TME&#x02013;lithium anode surface is increased to 16&#x02013;18 GPa after TME modification. The high modulus inhibits the growth of dendrites and thus improves the cycling stability. Polydopamine (PDA) is known for its strong adhesion to substrates of any type and shape; it can functionalize the surfaces of any material. He et al. reported a functional PDA layer coated on Cu foil [<xref rid="B44-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>e, lithium-coordinated carbonyl groups formed by lithium ions and hydroxyl groups on PDA serve as nucleation sites. These nucleation sites are conducive to the uniform nucleation of lithium metal and impede the formation and growth of dendrites. The Li-Cu half-cell delivered an average Coulombic efficiency of 97% for 100 cycles, and the symmetrical cell displayed an ultra-long cycle life of more than 800 h (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>f). Similarly, Li et al. adjusted the deposition of lithium through an artificial SEI flexible layer formed via the in situ reaction of metal lithium and polyacrylic acid (PAA) [<xref rid="B45-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The artificial SEI possesses the excellent binding ability and high stability LiPAA polymer, which can reduce the side reactions between lithium metal and electrolyte, thereby enhancing the cycling stability. </p><p>Wang et al. introduced 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) to enhance the interfacial adhesion between Li metal and SEI films through chemical bonding and physical entanglement effects (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>h) [<xref rid="B46-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The MPS layer is tightly adhesive to the surface of the lithium anode through Li-O-Si interaction, effectively establishing a dense barrier to prevent the corrosive effect of air (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>g). A lithium metal anode modified with MPS displayed outstanding electrochemical performance. The cycle stability of symmetric cells MPS-Li||MPS-Li reached 1400 h (current density, 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). The specific capacity of MPS-Li||S cells exhibited still 652 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 300 cycles at 0.2 &#x000b0;C.

Inorganic/Polymer Composites as Artificial SEI</title><p>Inorganic additives themselves have high ionic conductivities, but usually, their flexibilities are poor. The SEI composed of inorganic filler and polymer components can integrate the advantages of both, showing high lithium ion conductivity, excellent mechanical strength and flexibility.</p><p>Inorganic materials with high lithium-ion conductivity are incorporated into polymers to improve overall ion conductivity. Yang et al. applied an artificial polymer/ceramic hybrid SEI film as a protective layer for lithium anode, which is composed of a garnet-type Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.75</sub>Nb<sub>0.25</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZNO) ion conductor and a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based polymer electrolyte [<xref rid="B47-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The flexibility of PEO enables the hybrid film to buffer large lithium volume changes. PEO with ceramic LLZNO particles decoration remarkably improved their mechanical strength, which inhibits the growth of Li dendrites. As a solid ion conductor, LLZNO can dissociate additional Li-ions during interaction with anions and increase the flux of lithium ions, leading to Li deposition under the passivation layer. An assembled symmetrical cell with modified anode presented stable long cycling for 1000 h. The LiFePO<sub>4</sub>||PEO-garnets@SS full cell delivered excellent Coulombic efficiency of 99.5%. </p><p>The surface diffusivity of Li ions affects the morphological structure of electrodeposited lithium. Halogenated compounds are generally accompanied with high surface diffusivity. A lithium metal anode protecting layer composed of LiF/PEO nanocomposite was proposed by Fu et al. [<xref rid="B48-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The composite coating can block the contact between lithium anode and electrolyte to reduce electrolyte decomposition. LiF offers a low surface diffusion potential barrier and good electrochemical stability for lithium ion. PEO provides high donor numbers for lithium ion, which promotes the diffusion of lithium ions at the interface of LiF/PEO. When contacting with carbonate-based liquid electrolyte, the ionic conductivity and Li ion transfer number of the composite coating exhibited extremely high values of 0.97 mS cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 0.77, which facilitated uniform lithium deposition and suppressed the formation of lithium dendrites (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a,b). Therefore, the lithium metal anode with a protective layer coating can cycle above 1000 h at 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> stably. Similarly, Sun et al. developed a thin artificial SEI layer with a LiF/defluorinated polymer composite [<xref rid="B49-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The LiF/defluorinated polymer composite layer is constructed by a rolling process between polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and lithium metal, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c. It can be observed in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d that the composite layer consists of the inner and outer layers with lithium (LiF-rich) and polyene/fluoropolymer (polymer-rich), respectively. The cavities among LiF particles can be counteracted by the polymer layer to improve the uniform coverage of the protective layer on the lithium metal surface. Similarly, Kim et al. prepared a protective layer composed of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEDOT-co-PEG) and AlF<sub>3</sub> particles as an artificial SEI on lithium metal to stabilize the lithium electrode [<xref rid="B50-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. </p><p>The high Li<sup>+</sup> ion mobility number ensures the selective transport of cations for the uniform deposition of Li metal. A multifunctional artificial SEI was reported by Yu and his coworkers by a dynamic single-ion conductive network (DSN) [<xref rid="B51-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The structure of DSN is shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>e. The as-prepared DSN was assembled by a Al(OR)<sup>4&#x02212;</sup> (R = soft fluorinated linker) tetrahedral center as a dynamically bounding structure and counter anion, giving it mobility and Li<sup>+</sup> single-ion conductivity, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f. At the same time, the fluorinated linkers endow DSN with chain fluidity and electrolyte-blocking ability, which inhibits the parasitic reactions between electrolyte and lithium metal. Benefiting from above advantages, the Li-Cu half-cell using commercial carbonate-based electrolytes exhibited stable cycling capability for more than 400 cycles.</p><p>High ionic conductivity is one of the key parameters for desirable SEI films. Adding certain metal compounds into polymer matrices can improve their ionic conductivities. Cui et al. reported an artificial SEI layer that includes Cu<sub>3</sub>N nanoparticles tightly bounded with styrene&#x02013;butadiene rubber (SBR) (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a) [<xref rid="B52-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The reaction between Cu<sub>3</sub>N and lithium metal induces the formation of a Li<sub>3</sub>N passivation layer with high Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity. It can promote the Li-ions transportation across the surface of electrode effectively, resulting in uniform Li-ion flux. SBR provides good flexibility and ensures the integrity of the structure during lithium plating/stripping. Because of the excellent Li-ion conductivity and mechanical properties of the artificial SEI, the stability of the lithium metal anode is significantly improved. The SEM of Cu<sub>3</sub>N + SBR protecting Li metal is shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b. Hu et al. further reported the N-containing inorganic interface layer as an artificial SEI, which was fabricated via the in situ polymerization of <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>-ethyl cyanoacrylate with lithium nitrate as an additive [<xref rid="B53-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It can promote ion conduction and block further adverse interface reactions. Tu et al. reported a perfluorinated ionomer and nanoporous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite as an artificial SEI to protect lithium metal anodes [<xref rid="B54-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The ionomer owns a high ionic conductivity, which is further enhanced by the addition of nanoporous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Adding Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the artificial SEI can improve the mechanical strength, inhibiting the overgrowth of dendrite and improving cycling stability. Pang et al. used <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic>-Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> (LPS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite hybrid films as an artificial SEI to protect the lithium metal anode, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c [<xref rid="B55-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic>-Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> phase provides the Li<sup>+</sup> transport channels to improve lithium-ion conductivity. Elastomeric polymers (PDMS) filled into the particle interstices increase the flexibility of the film to accommodate the deformation phenomenon during lithium metal plating/stripping. The Coulombic efficiency of LPS&#x02013;PDMS&#x02013;coated Cu is relatively stable, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>d.</p><p>Lithium affinity is attributed to the wettability of the surface of lithium, and the addition of some metal ions in the polymer can increase the affinity. Meng et al. developed a polydopamine&#x02013;copper ion (PDA-Cu<sup>2+</sup>) coating formed by particles aggregated with copper ions and nanoparticles [<xref rid="B56-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The PDA coating presents a unique porous structure composed of sticky nanoparticles that can effectively regulate the deposition of lithium metal and increase the wettability of the electrolyte. Li ions can rapidly migrate through the gaps between the PDA nanoparticles due to the repulsive effect between similar charges. In this case, the modified lithium metal anode achieved great Coulombic efficiency and long-term stability. </p><p>The alloy phase is not only rigid enough to prevent dendrite growth but also has a strong affinity for lithium. Jiang et al. fabricated a poly(tetramethylene ether glycol) (PTMEG)-Li/Sn alloy hybrid layer on the lithium metal anode surface [<xref rid="B57-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The synthesis process involves simply dipping lithium metal into a 0.1 M solution of tin tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF). SnCl<sub>4</sub> was directly reduced by Li metal upon contact, forming an alloy layer. At the same time, LiCl as a nucleation site and SnCl<sub>4</sub> as a strong Lewis acid induce the ring-opening polymerization reaction of THF. The PTMEG-Li/Sn alloy hybrid layer provided a rapid lithium-ion transport channel as well as a strong affinity for lithium. As a consequence, the symmetrical cell is stably cycled for 1000 h at a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> without Li dendrite formation. Similarly, Ma et al. created an artificial SEI through an in situ reaction of AlI<sub>3</sub>, lithium metal and dioxolane (DOL), which induces the formation of a surface coating including Li-Al, LiI and a thin polymer film [<xref rid="B58-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Among them, LiI enabled the diffusion energy barrier reduction in lithium ions, Li-Al alloys provide an effective barrier for lithium dendrite formation, and thin polymer films can inhibit the side reaction between electrolyte and lithium metal. Similarly, Zhang et al. designed a functional hybrid coating layer containing LiF, lithophilic Li-Sb alloy, and flexible polymer styrene&#x02013;butadiene rubber (SBR) [<xref rid="B59-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Lithophilic Li<sub>3</sub>Sb alloys can provide fast transport channels for lithium ions. </p><p>Artificial SEI reacts in situ to produce a variety of favorable decomposition products at the interface to enhance SEI. Gao et al. proposed to use reactive polymer composites poly(vinylsulfonyl fluoride-ran-2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane) (P(SF-DOL))-graphene oxide nanosheets as an artificial SEI layer [<xref rid="B60-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The presence of LiF can be seen in the TEM of <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>f. This multi-component artificial SEI is dense enough to prevent electrolytes from contacting with the Li anode and relieve side reactions between electrolyte and electrode, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>e. Graphene nanosheets provide mechanical strength to hinder dendrite growth and increase the cycle stability of LMBs. The interfacial fluctuations could be reduced during Li deposition by 3D hosts. As a result, the average efficiency was as high as 99.1% at a current density of 2.0 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> over 300 cycles. Similarly, Zhao et al. reported a multifunctional cross-linked membrane of sulfur-containing hybrid lithium polyphosphate and poly(2-chloroethyl acrylate) (PECA) to protect lithium metal anodes [<xref rid="B61-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The film can promote the formation of a stable organic/inorganic hybrid SEI layer including lithium salt, inorganic Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>x</sub>, lithium sulfide, and polymer-based organic polysulfide on the lithium metal anode. Benefiting from this hybrid robust SEI layer, Li metal anodes achieved stable cycling without Li deposition dendrite.

The electrically insulating polymer may play the role as a 3D scaffold to lead the deposition of lithium on the surface of polymer fibers and in 3D polymer layers due to their surface polar functional groups with strong affinity for metallic lithium, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a.

This structure not only facilitates the diffusion of Li ions through the electrolyte channels between <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic>-PVDF fibers but also ensures transport along the ferroelectric surface by Li ion hopping on the fluoride side of PVDF. Furthermore, the 3D framework provides space to buffer volume changes during lithium plating/stripping.</p><p>Fan et al. plated lithium onto 3D porous poly-melamine-formalde-hyde (PMF) to optimize the cycling stability of LMBs [<xref rid="B66-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

Meanwhile, the nanocellulose layer exhibits good electrolyte wettability and thermal stability. The modified separator does not deform at 200 &#x000b0;C, which can effectively prevent battery thermal runaway. As a result, a high capacity retention rate of 97.5% can be obtained after 65 cycles in LiFePO<sub>4</sub>||Li half-cell with the modified separator.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-14-03452"><title>3.2.

This PPN protective layer could inhibit highly corrosive cyclic carbonates by modulating the polymer&#x02013;solvent interaction. In the PPN, the reactivity of C=O groups of the carbonate solvent can be effectively reduced by C&#x02261;N groups of the PAN polymer chains, resulting in the formation of an SEI layer with higher inorganic components. The PPN layer effectively inhibits the generation and growth of Li dendrites, thereby improving the Coulombic efficiency and prolonging the cycle life.</p><p>Ryu et al. fabricated a ferroelectric terpolymer&#x02013;polydopamine interlayer (f-PTC-PD) [<xref rid="B69-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. f-PTC with high ferroelectricity is beneficial to enhance ionic conductivity and transference number, which achieves the uniform transport of Li-ion. The protective PD layer suppresses the dissolution of PTC and improves the overall affinity for liquid electrolytes. The schematic diagram of the f-PTC layer protecting Li metal is shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>a. The f-PTC layer promotes the non-dendritic deposition of Li metal.

This PDA/POSS coating imparted different surface characteristics to the PE separators while maintaining their microporous structure. These optimized surface features contributed not only to enhanced lithium-ion transfer number and ionic conductivity of the PE separator but also improved lithium/electrolyte interfacial stability, which effectively reduces electrode polarization and inhibits the formation of lithium dendrite, achieving great rate capability and cycling performance. Likewise, Zhang et al. uniformly deposited functionalized lithophilic polymers consisting of chitosan (CTS), polyethylene oxide (PEO), and polytriglycol dimethacrylate (PTEGDMA) onto a commercial Celgard separator through electrospray and polymer photopolymerization techniques [<xref rid="B71-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The lithophilicity of the CTS-PEO-PTEGDMA layer ensured homogeneous lithium deposition and promotes a robust uniform SEI layer that suppressed the growth of lithium dendrites, generating an enhanced electrochemical performance of the lithium metal battery.</p><p>Yang et al. synthesized an adaptive buffer layer (ABL), which is composed of polypropylene carbonate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), and lithium salt, to regulate the interface between metallic lithium and solid electrolyte (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>c) [<xref rid="B72-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. ABL owns good viscoelasticity (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>f&#x02013;i), so it can accommodate the shape change of lithium metal anode and ensure the intimate contact between lithium metal and solid electrolyte during cycling (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>d,e). With ABL working in the lithium metal anode, the interface resistance of the Li/ABL/SPE/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery enhanced by merely 20% over 150 charge/discharge cycles, while the counterpart without ABL increased by 117%. After that, Subramani et al. prepared a networked solid-state polymer (NSP) as an artificial interlayer to address lithium dendrite issues in the lithium metal battery [<xref rid="B73-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The designed interlayer consists of poly(ethylene oxide-co-epoxypropane) (P(EO-co-PO)), poly(dimethylsiloxane) diglycidyl ether (PDMSDGE) chains and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) lithium imide salts. The methyl groups on the P(EO-co-PO) and PDMSDGE chains reduce the surface energy of the interlayer, which can completely cover the high-energy lithium metal and modulate the transport of lithium ions. Lower surface energy is more favorable to the generation of Li-F bonds, which promotes Li uniform deposition. Furthermore, the elastic PDMS chains enable the NSP to buffer the lithium volume change during cycling. All the above advantages of NSP contributed to long-term cycling stability and improved Coulombic efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-polymers-14-03452"><title>3.3.

As a consequence, dendrite-free lithium deposition with excellent Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability was achieved, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>b. Xu et al. hybridized poly(vinylidene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and LiF into composite films as interlayers between Li metal anodes and electrolyte [<xref rid="B76-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The good shape consistency obtained from the PVDF&#x02013;HFP matrix and high Young&#x02019;s modulus conferred by LiF bring various favorable characteristics, such as high mechanical strength, good ionic conductivity, excellent shape compliance, and good lithium metal anodes compatibility. All of the above merits lead to dendrite-free and dense Li deposition as well as reduced interfacial resistance.</p><p>Huo et al. coated a polypropylene (PP) separator with a hierarchical porous interlayer composed of Li<sub>6.4</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.4</sub>Ta<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZTO) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to regulate the uniform deposition of Li<sup>+</sup> [<xref rid="B77-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The Lewis acid&#x02013;base interaction between LLZTO and PVDF led to a superb ionic conductivity and high Li<sup>+</sup> transportation. The 3D fast Li<sup>+</sup> transport pathways in the coating interlayer can efficiently redistribute the inhomogeneous Li<sup>+</sup> flux from the insulating PP separator. Additionally, the interlayer could anchor the anions and guide a flexible Li<sup>+</sup> transportation, achieving uniform deposition on the lithium anode (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>c). All those advantages contribute to higher Coulombic efficiency and improved cycling stability. Similarly, Yan et al. designed a mixed ion/electronically conductive interlayer formed in situ from an intermediary Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> layer modified on polyethylene oxide (PEO) to tune Li deposition. PEO as a framework also provides lithium-ion transport [<xref rid="B78-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> layer is converted to Li<sub>3</sub>N and metallic magnesium through an in situ electrochemical reaction with the lithium anode. Li<sub>3</sub>N as a fast Li<sup>+</sup> conductor can help to achieve fast transport of Li<sup>+</sup> and alleviate the Li<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient. Mg metal is beneficial to the uniformity of current density distribution during cycling. Therefore, this interlayer avoided the creation of Li dendrites and improves the stability and kinetics of the lithium anode interface.</p><p>In summary, functional polymer interlayers in LMBs play critical roles in regulating Li<sup>+</sup> flux toward dendrite-free Li deposition. The thicknesses of interlayers are generally in the range of tens of nanometers to several microns, as summarized in the following <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In contrast, polymer electrolytes possess much higher thickness, normally over tens of microns, which will be discussed in detail in the following section.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-polymers-14-03452"><title>4.

In this section, the advancement of polymer electrolytes will be summarized by three categories, i.e., salt-in-polymer electrolyte, polymer-in-salt electrolyte, according to the various ion migration mechanism. The key difference between the former two is the lithium salt content, which are less than 50% and larger than 50%, respectively.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-polymers-14-03452"><title>4.1. Salt in Polymer Electrolyte</title><p>Wu et al. fabricated an ultra-thin and flexible solid-state electrolyte (SSE), which was achieved by immersing a 5 &#x000b5;m thick separator into polyethylene oxide (PEO) and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) (LiTFSI) polymer electrolyte [<xref rid="B80-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The strong and flexible polyethylene separator maintains the matrix of the polymer electrolyte, preventing internal short circuits and the penetration of dendrites. Similarly, Wang et al. synthesized a vertically aligned Li<sub>1.5</sub>Al<sub>0.5</sub>Ge<sub>1.5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (LAGP)/polyethylene oxide (PEO) composite solid-state electrolyte, with vertical LAGP walls providing continuous pathways for rapid ion diffusion [<xref rid="B81-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].

The polyethylene oxide (PEO) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)lithium imide (LiTFSI) were added to form uniform hybrid solid electrolytes (HSEs). The schematic structure of the HSEs is shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>a. The large amount of -OH in PEG can promote the bonding with CTMS, leading to improved ionic conductivities and increased Li<sup>+</sup> transference numbers. The strong chemical bonds tightly bonded ceramic and polymer, thereby solving the problem of interfacial compatibility. As a result, the LTO|PEO/PEG-3LGPS|Li battery delivered a high capacity retention rate of 94% after 120 cycles, as shown in <xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>b. Furthermore, the cycling stability of all-solid-state Li|PEO/PEG-3LGPS|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) battery exhibited good performance at a high temperature of 60 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>c).

The acrylate functional group of dipentaerythritol penta-hexa-acrylate (DPEPA) is capable of forming a highly cross-linked gel network. Ionic liquids with fluorinated side chains effectively immobilize the lithium salt anion by non-covalent interaction with the Lewis acid site, which reduces the affinity of lithium for the oxygen atom of the glycol chain and increases the lithium-ion transport number, finally improving the electrochemical stability of the polymer electrolyte.</p><p>Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(N-methyl-malonic amide) (PMA) were employed to make a double-layer composite polymer electrolyte (DLPSE) by Zhou et al.

PMA has a high dielectric constant but reacts easily with lithium metal, so the PMA side only came into contact with the cathode, which ensures extracting Li<sup>+</sup> from the cathode without oxidizing the electrolyte at high voltage. Meanwhile, the PEO side is close to the lithium metal, providing a dendrite-free deposition of lithium. The polymer electrolyte layer performed good adhesion and high flexibility (<xref rid="polymers-14-03452-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>e,f), which improves the solid electrolyte/electrode interface. Similarly, Zhou et al. fabricated a polymer electrolyte through the in situ copolymerization of lithium 1-[3-(methacry-loyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiMTFSI) and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) monomers and then integrating them with poly(3,3-dimethacrylic acid lithium) (PDAAli) coated by glass fiber membranes [<xref rid="B85-polymers-14-03452" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].

This polymer electrolyte has two transport pathways for lithium ions. One is originated from the PECLi phase, in which lithium salt can be dissolved and dissociated in PEC, forming a &#x0201c;polymer in salt&#x0201d; in PVDF-HFP substrate.

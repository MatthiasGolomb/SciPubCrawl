In recent years, the emergence of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) for LABs well alleviated the above problems. SSEs can prevent moisture, oxygen, and other contaminants from reaching the lithium metal anode, and their inherent performance can solve the generation of lithium dendrites, making them potential candidates for the development of high energy density and safety LABs. This paper mainly reviews the research progress of SSEs for LABs, the challenges and opportunities for synthesis and characterization, and future strategies are addressed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>solid-state electrolyte</kwd><kwd>lithium-air batteries</kwd><kwd>inorganic solid electrolyte</kwd><kwd>polymeric solid electrolyte</kwd><kwd>composite electrolyte</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Guangxi Special Program for Young Talents</funding-source><award-id>GuiKeAD20159066</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Guangxi Natural Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>2021GXNSFBA196029</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>22105047</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Guangxi Special Program for Young Talents (GuiKeAD20159066); the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation (2021GXNSFBA196029); and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22105047).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-polymers-15-02469"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The first generation of lithium ion solid-state electrolytes dates back to the 1830s when Faraday discovered that heated Ag<sub>2</sub>S and PbF<sub>2</sub> had anionic conduction properties, but they did not develop rapidly because of they have low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance at room temperature, and susceptibility to short circuit due to dendrite penetration [<xref rid="B1-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It was not until the 1960s that &#x003b2;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was discovered to have two-dimensional sodium ion conduction properties and was subsequently applied to high-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries [<xref rid="B2-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, the 1960s is considered the beginning of the development of solid-state electrolytes, which began to be used in batteries. In the following decade, Ag<sub>3</sub>SI solid-state lithium-ion conductor materials were successfully used for energy storage; solid-state electrolytes are increasingly used in practical applications [<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and in 1973, the PEO polymer was discovered to have the ability to conduct lithium ions, thus expanding the scope of solid-state ionics from inorganic materials to polymers [<xref rid="B5-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and since then, lithium&#x02013;ion polymer conductors have emerged and been used in all-solid-state polymer lithium&#x02013;ion batteries. In 1992, Oak Ridge National Laboratory successfully prepared LiPON thin film electrolyte material, which played a key role in improving the performance of thin film lithium batteries [<xref rid="B6-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since then, many types of inorganic solid-state electrolyte materials have emerged, including chalcogenide, sodium supersonic conductor (NASICON), garnet, sulfide, etc. [<xref rid="B7-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Until the early 21st century, solid-state electrolytes began to be combined with gaseous and liquid cathodes for lithium&#x02013;ion batteries, such as solid-state lithium&#x02013;air batteries, lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries, lithium&#x02013;bromine batteries, etc. [<xref rid="B11-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>With the development of society, the energy density of current lithium&#x02013;ion batteries is becoming more and more difficult to meet the demand.

The energy density of traditional lithium&#x02013;ion batteries (less than 350 Wh kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) are increasingly inadequate for current energy storage devices, and there is an urgent need to find environmentally friendly energy storage devices with an energy density comparable to fossil fuels [<xref rid="B17-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-polymers-15-02469" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

The highest ionic conductivity (1.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) at room temperature was achieved when the LiF molar ratio was 10% and the LATP ceramic electrolyte was sintered at 800 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-15-02469"><title>3.2.

In addition, diblock copolymers consist of two different covalently anchored macromolecular chains in which the blocks can self-assemble into microphase-separated nanostructured forms such as spheres (SPH), hexagonal filled cylinders (HEX), bicontinuous gyroids (GYR), and lamellae (LAM).

Conclusions</title><p>This review introduces the basic structure of LABs and the development of SSEs. As one of the next-generation energy storage devices, solid-state LABs have made many breakthroughs but not yet fully matured and still face many problems to be solved. The performance of LABs with different SSEs are summarized in <xref rid="polymers-15-02469-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. </p><p>In recent years, many solutions have been proposed by research workers to address the shortcomings of solid-state electrolytes, but the solutions are not yet mature: (1) The advantage of adding sintering additives is that it reduces the sintering temperature of solid ceramic electrolyte, thus reducing the loss of lithium and the formation of the second term, which in turn improves the lithium ion conductivity, but whether the added sintering additives are compatible with the electrolyte material and whether the contact with the two poles is stable are potential problems. If the temperature is lowered more, the material will not easily produce the desired morphology, and if the temperature is lowered less, the loss of lithium and the formation of the second term will not be significantly reduced. (2) The cold sintering process is similar to the sintering aid process in that it lowers the sintering temperature, which reduces the loss of lithium and the formation of the second term, but it has a greater impact on whether the material can produce the desired morphology because it involves two sintering steps, and the more sintering steps, the more uncertainty. (3) The interface modification technique has the advantage of increasing solid&#x02013;solid interface contact and decreasing interfacial resistance, but it does not address the loss of lithium and the formation of the second term during the high-temperature sintering of the solid ceramic electrolyte itself. (4) The diblock copolymer electrolytes offer independently regulated mechanical strength and electrochemical properties, which provide better mechanical strength and stability than conventional gel electrolytes, but still do not solve the problem of dendrite penetration compared to ceramic electrolytes. It is a complex and difficult task to investigate the actual material properties of the battery and to analyze the specific chemical changes during cycles, because the complex dynamic reaction process of the battery is differed from the structure, proportion, and fusion process of the specific actual material. It is necessary to combine the ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of materials from the temporal and spatial dimensions.</p><p>It is a systematic work to consider the properties of each component in LABs. We need to consider the source of the key materials in the electrolyte, the cost of production, the difficulty of the manufacturing process, and whether they meet stability requirements. The price and catalytic effect should be considered in the selection of a cathode catalyst. Furthermore, the type of battery casing and the level of manufacturing process workmanship also influences the final performance of the battery, so it can be argued that any part of the battery determines the final performance of the battery. </p><p>We firmly believe that through the continuous exploration of low-cost and highly Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity stable SSEs, solid-state LABs will become the high energy density facilities for future mainstream application.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the support from the Guangxi University of Science and Technology Doctoral Fund (19Z10) and the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program for College Students (Guangxi).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

Here we report that it can be achieved via the facile process of immersing the electrodes in ionic liquid electrolytes for a period of time before battery assembly. This creates a durable and lithium ion-permeable solid&#x02013;electrolyte interphase that allows safe charge&#x02013;discharge cycling of commercially applicable Li|electrolyte|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> batteries for 1,000 cycles with Coulombic efficiencies &#x0003e;99.5&#x00025;. The tailored solid&#x02013;electrolyte interphase is prepared using a variety of electrolytes based on the <italic>N</italic>-propyl-<italic>N</italic>-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide room temperature ionic liquid containing lithium salts. The formation is both time- and lithium salt-dependant, showing dynamic morphology changes, which when optimized prevent dendrite formation and consumption of electrolyte during cycling. This work illustrates that a simple, effective and industrially applicable lithium metal pretreatment process results in a commercially viable cycle life for a lithium metal battery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

This order of magnitude increase is the breakthrough needed for applications such as electric vehicles where concerns of &#x02018;range anxiety' are negated; in principle, these vehicles could compete with traditional petrol vehicles in terms of drive range per charge. Unlike graphite, lithium metal anodes do not intercalate lithium ions, instead requiring repetitive stripping and plating of the lithium metal surface. This causes volumetric and morphological changes that can lead to cycling instability. The inelastic solid&#x02013;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed during cycling cannot compensate for these morphological changes, and as a result is in a continual state of repair. This generally leads to low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and short cycle life because of electrolyte consumption and loss of lithium through cyclic SEI production.</p><p>This highlights a significant issue concerning the safe cyclability of lithium metal, that is, difficulty in controlling the thermodynamic instability and reactivity of lithium towards organic electrolytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. These factors contribute to the classic literature examples of lithium metal battery failure, which requires avoiding large Li dendrite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and non-uniform SEI formation that typically results in thermal runaway via the creation of a short circuit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Therefore, it is critical that there is not only further development in understanding SEI formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> but also a significant research effort into tailoring the SEI that is transferable into devices that can be practically realized.</p><p>Room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolytes are potentially a successful alternative to conventional organic solvent-based electrolytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and have shown promising results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In particular, RTILs composed of the bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide [FSI]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion are attracting significant attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The RTIL comprising the pyrrolodinium cation and <italic>N</italic>-propyl-<italic>N</italic>-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion, namely ([C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]), possesses low viscosity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and has been associated with delayed Al corrosion at the cathode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Previously, Budi <italic>et al.</italic> and other reports noted that the SEI formed through chemical pathways using [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] provides a smooth morphology that suppresses dendrite formation in symmetrical Li|electrolyte|Li cells, which is a critical prerequisite for secondary cell cycling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Ideally, the prospect of tuning the electrolyte to affect a beneficial change in electrode performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, rather than modifying the lithium electrode via complicated and tedious surface engineering with nanostructures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, would in principle allow a pathway towards simplified and cheaper battery construction. This approach could readily be translated to existing manufacturing processes and therefore accelerate the development of next-generation energy-storage solutions. We herein report on facile SEI formation via a simple chemical interaction between Li<sup>0</sup> and [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] mixtures utilizing LiFSI, LiPF<sub>6</sub> and LiAsF<sub>6</sub> salts. Remarkably, we observe extensive Li|electrolyte|Li cell cycling at 0.1 and 1.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for symmetrical cells pretreated using LiFSI and LiAsF<sub>6</sub> salts, respectively, dissolved in [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>], with no evidence of dendrite formation even after 2,500&#x0002b; hours cycling time. Full Li|electrolyte|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> batteries were also evaluated, and these batteries display extensive safe cycling at a rate of 1&#x02009;C, achieving 1,000 cycles with a CE greater than 99.5&#x00025; after pretreatment, comparable to or, in certain cases, outperforming current commercial 18,650 Li ion batteries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In addition, this approach is beneficial for cells that are left on the shelf, where a cell that was quiescent for 330 days is shown to cycle effectively with &#x0003e;95&#x00025; CE.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Time-dependent SEI formation</title><p>Our previous work showed that Li reacts with [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] to form an SEI layer, and that the application of a potential is not required to observe significant changes on the electrode surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. However, on addition of Li salts to the RTIL there is a dramatic difference in both the reaction rate and composition of the SEI, which has significant implications for the performance of symmetrical and full cells. This initial interaction between the electrolyte and Li anode, occurring on construction of any cell, is a critical factor that can in fact be tailored to increase cyclability, safety and CE, and is the focus of this study that uses [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] as the ionic liquid.</p><p>The facile lithium pretreatment methodology is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, and the observed morphological changes that occur for the LiFSI/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] electrolyte system after the reaction time of 4&#x02009;h, 7, 12 and 18 days are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b&#x02013;e</xref>. Moreover, shown are micrographs of a lithium surface pretreated with LiPF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f&#x02013;i</xref>) and LiAsF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j&#x02013;m</xref>) for the same time periods. These micrographs show the diverse topology that can be realized by tuning reaction time and/or electrolyte composition. In all cases there are dramatic changes in the Li surface compared with the relatively smooth pristine metal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>The SEI surface-morphology changes on salt addition are significantly different to that observed for neat [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Interestingly, inclusion of a Li salt results in accelerated changes, which are attributed to the anion. After 4&#x02009;h of pretreatment with LiFSI/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) the lithium surface contains residual electrolyte with numerous SEI sites. For foils pretreated for 7 days, the surface becomes rough and exfoliated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and inset). After 12 days, the smoothened surface exhibits ordered SEI deposition sites preferentially arranged into lines of equal spacing of <italic>ca</italic> 0.25&#x02013;11.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These ordered deposition sites eventually cluster to form ribbons (up to 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in length) after 18 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Honeycomb structures were also observed, dissimilar to those reported for LiBF<sub>4</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>The LiPF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] electrolyte reacts producing a rough surface with evidence of small deposits on the surface after 4-h interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1g</xref> shows that additional species (dark areas) dominate the surface and is attributed to an exfoliation process. After 12 days, a thick film of deposition products is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>), with rod-like features and surface electrolyte coverage. By 18 days, these resolve into discreet-layered islands of deposition products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>).</p><p>For the LiAsF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] electrolyte there are three distinct regions formed after 4&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>), showing deposition sites situated within both the darkest and lightest regions. Medium contrast regions contain adhered residual electrolyte and rough areas are also observed (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>). By 7 days of interaction time, there is complete coverage of Li by coral structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k</xref>); unlike the LiPF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] pretreatment this structure dominates and alters the entire morphology. Optically, the lithium foil shows a tarnish over the metal (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k</xref>&#x02014;typical LiAsF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]-pretreated foil), whereas all other electrolyte-treated samples retain a reflective surface. After 12 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>), the surface is dominated by electrolyte adhesion and is presumed to envelop the structures observed after 7 days. After 18 days, the electrolyte and breakdown products become part of the structure. A consolidation of both the deposition products and the electrolyte forms a coral superstructure with complete surface coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m</xref>). It is clear that the 12-day time point shows a common trend for all electrolytes in that a smoother surface is formed that does not contain as many protrusions and coral-like structures that are present at other times. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of additional reaction time periods of 4, 10, 14 and 16 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) further illustrate the gradual change of the Li surface. This time-dependent morphological change could have significant implications for battery performance, as this layer will be the initial seed layer that dictates the Li ion ingress/egress during initial cell cycling.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Surface chemistry of SEI via FTIR and XPS</title><p>The composition of the diverse SEI structures formed on the lithium surface after pretreatment was identified utilizing a combination of Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

On addition of LiFSI, there is a rise in the intensity of infrared (IR) bands at <italic>ca</italic>. 1,106 and 1,170&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, suggesting a greater amount of anion breakdown products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The SEI now changes and consists of LiF, LiSO<sub>2</sub>F, NSO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> species, LiOH and Li<sub>2</sub>S via reduction of the anion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, this breakdown process occurs without evolution of SO<sub>2</sub> gas, which illustrates the beneficial properties of a mineral SEI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, the increased concentration of [FSI]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> promotes the breakdown of the cation to propyl pyrrolidine, with reduction taking place via a Hofmann &#x003b2;-elimination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), and was observed via FTIR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In addition, FTIR measurements reveal that the SEI also contains surface-bound cation and anion species as well as Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> from the native lithium foils.</p><p>The conclusion for this mechanism of SEI formation is detailed in the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, which illustrates a Li 1<italic>s</italic> peak encompassing the responses for both LiF (56.1&#x02009;eV) and Li-O (55.3&#x02009;eV), while the F 1<italic>s</italic> spectrum validates the assignment with a response measured at 685.1&#x02009;eV. The F 1<italic>s</italic> spectrum also suggests the presence of LiSO<sub>2</sub>F with a band at 688.3&#x02009;eV, associated with the doublet at 170.7 and 169.9&#x02009;eV (S 2<italic>p</italic>), 55.3&#x02009;eV (Li 1<italic>s</italic>) and 533.2&#x02009;eV (O 1<italic>s</italic>).

However, the absence of bands in the As 3<italic>d</italic> spectra is indicative of As not taking part in SEI formation.

Interestingly, FTIR data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) only show evidence for this at earlier time periods, suggesting that this reaction is not proceeding to completion because of an absence of polymerizing precursors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p><p>Finally, for treatment with LiPF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), the SEI comprises LiSO<sub>2</sub>F, NSO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, surface-bound cations and anions and Li<sub>2</sub>S. For this pretreatment, a lower quantity of LiF, LiOH and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> was observed via energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The most notable difference for this system is the formation of methyl pyrrolidine. The Hofmann &#x003b2;-elimination discussed above may occur via three different pathways. The dominant pathway leads to ring cleavage towards the propyl pyrrolidine species. However, with LiPF<sub>6</sub> addition, the less preferred pathway now leads to the formation of methyl pyrrolidine.

The cell containing LiPF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] electrolyte begins with cycling behaviour as reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, with a periodic voltage response due to ambient temperature fluctuation. After 1,300 cycles, a period (<italic>ca</italic>. 250&#x02009;h) of voltage instability is observed, culminating in cell death. Unpredictably, the cell is re-animated for 100 cycles (<italic>ca</italic>. 3,750&#x02013;3,850 cycles) after a &#x02018;dormancy' of 22 days (550&#x02009;h) before permanently failing. This unusual behaviour suggests that failure is not due to a dendrite-induced short circuit, as this cannot be undone through continued galvanostatic cycling. The possibility that micro dendrites were formed during cycling, which created short circuits, but broke because of localized heating (that is, high resistances), thereby resurrecting the cell, was discounted because of no evidence of separator piercing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> displays the <italic>V&#x02013;t</italic> plot for a symmetrical cell containing LiAsF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>], which cycled for 5,000 cycles reaching a polarization of 13&#x02009;mV. This is attributed to a resistance decrease through repeated cycling forming a larger, and more porous surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

Symmetrical cells containing untreated lithium electrodes and LiFSI/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] electrolyte have also been reported to successfully achieve 5,000 cycles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Therefore, these data illustrate that the electrochemical SEI built-up during cycling is undoubtedly electrolyte-dependent. For the case of LiAsF<sub>6</sub> and LiFSI as previously reported, the pristine Li surface facilitates stable SEI formation and allows for effective cycling at a low current density of 0.1&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for up to 5,000 cycles; however, this is not the case when LiPF<sub>6</sub> is used. As discussed later, specific pretreatment of the Li anode before cycling alleviates this phenomenon, and stable cycling can be achieved, which is completely independent of the Li salt used in the electrolyte.</p><p>To gain an insight as to why the use of one electrolyte and not another resulted in cell failure, a post-mortem analysis of the anode was undertaken for LiFSI, LiAsF<sub>6</sub> and LiPF<sub>6</sub> cells. In all cases, SEM images of the lithium electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,e,g</xref>) exhibited no signs of dendritic growth of metallic Li from the surface; however, the quantity of surface species is higher than for the chemical pretreatment of the Li surface alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), resulting in a rougher surface. The electrode surface of the cycled LiAsF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) is completely fractured, and fresh Li<sup>0</sup> nucleation now occurs at grain boundaries and steps similar to the LiFSI case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This surface-fracturing allows fresh lithium to be exposed, leading to further SEI formation. This is as expected for a mineral SEI, whereby pressure is released from within the SEI because of expansion/contraction via fracturing during lithium-plating/stripping processes. The gradual release of pressure prevents build-up and inherently inhibits dendritic growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> shows small nucleation sites that continue to form even near the latter stages of the 2,500-h charge&#x02013;discharge cycle.</p><p>However, given the comparable nature of the SEI and lack of dendrite formation when LiPF<sub>6</sub> is used, the brief re-animation indicates that cell failure is due to something other than an effect at the anode. Therefore, an investigation of the separator post cycling was undertaken. Interestingly, the SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,f,h</xref>) show electrolyte-breakdown products that have become detached from the lithium metal surface. For LiFSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and LiAsF<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>) these detached species are relatively sparse, and the porous nature of the separator is still quite visible, suggesting that the detachment of the SEI occurs at a slow rate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d</xref> inset in fact shows that these deposits are located within the porous structure. This could suggest that bridging has occurred; however, these cells showed no significant drop in polarization for the experiment duration since the separator area blockage by the insulating SEI species is counteracted by the increase in lithium surface area through morphology changes. However, there is a clear discrepancy when the LiPF<sub>6</sub> case is examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>), as there is a significantly larger quantity of breakdown products observed within the pores that completely dominate the separator. In fact, the pores of the separator are no longer visible (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> for SEM image of a pristine separator). Consequently, cell failure occurs because the rate of increase of the lithium surface area is lower than the rate of separator blockage, thus impeding Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> flow and causing cell termination.</p><p>The FTIR measurements for electrochemically formed SEIs are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref> and show that the chemical composition of the SEI after extensive cycling is relatively consistent with the measurements on the purely chemically formed SEI. However, the presence of cation-breakdown products is noticeably less for the LiFSI-based cell, with negligible responses in the ring-mode region (<italic>ca</italic>. 800&#x02013;1,000&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and with fewer bands above 2,800&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The other chemistries, however, do have a larger abundance of cation products within the SEI layer. In fact, the cell composed of LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolyte exhibits a large response through the ring-mode region, indicating the extensive formation of cation-breakdown products, which may also contribute to the failure of this cell.</p><p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was undertaken on Li-symmetrical cells before and after 5,000 cycles at a current density of 0.1&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> to monitor any changes in the Li electrode impedance.

The cells were cycled at 1.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> following chemical pretreatment for 12- and 18-day time periods. The most obvious feature is that all the foils pretreated for 18 days begin cycling with large voltage instability, culminating in cell failure within just 6&#x02009;h. Regardless of electrolyte composition, the SEI that is chemically formed over an 18-day period does not permit effective cycling of symmetrical cells at this current density.

Once this cell reaches a stable voltage, it exhibits the longest stability period for all three systems, displaying how an electrolyte of LiPF<sub>6</sub> and [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] can be practical for lithium metal batteries.

EIS data obtained for the symmetrical cells with the 12-day pretreated Li anodes for the LiFSI, LiPF<sub>6</sub> and LiAsF<sub>6</sub> cases also demonstrate a significant drop in the electrode impedance after 300 cycles at this higher current density of 1.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

Promising cycling results for pretreated electrodes suggest that the application of ionic liquids may enable beneficial full-cell cycling. Furthermore, without pretreatment the electrodes do not cycle efficiently. Therefore, it appears that a smooth SEI formed via a chemical interaction of Li with the electrolyte, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,h,l</xref> facilitates the formation of a stable and well-adhered SEI during electrochemical cycling. If this chemically formed SEI is rough, as shown after 18 days of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,i,m</xref>), it is not a good precursor to the formation of an SEI that is stable during cycling and it results in near-immediate cell failure.</p><p>The SEM micrographs of the lithium surface and separator after cycling are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d&#x02013;f</xref>.

This is highlighted for batteries with pristine, untreated lithium anodes, which do not achieve the same degree of success compared with pretreated cells. By pretreating lithium anodes the SEI must only undergo a rapid equilibration (for example, 35 cycles with LiPF<sub>6</sub>/[C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] pretreatment) before reaching unparalleled lithium metal plating/stripping in full-battery scenarios.</p><p>The implication of diverse SEI formation on lithium metal anodes using RTIL electrolytes highlights the importance of interaction time for robust SEI formation capable of being used in lithium-metal batteries for extensive and efficient cycling.

However, this effect can be completely eliminated in a facile manner via a 12-day pretreatment time, which provides an optimal SEI in all electrolytes permitting the ingress/egress of lithium ions and withstands the associated volume change when cycling at a higher current density of 1.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. A longer pretreatment time of 18 days did not improve the performance, regardless of salt composition. The formation of a dense and rough SEI is not a beneficial seed layer for further electrochemical SEI formation, indicating the importance of contact time between the Li anode and the electrolyte before cycling of a full battery. These promising symmetrical cell measurements were confirmed in full cell cycling using a commercial cathode material. Each of the electrolyte systems studied herein has accomplished 1,000 charge&#x02013;discharge cycles in a Li|electrolyte|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> configuration, with no lower than 99&#x00025; efficiency. The one drawback of this approach is that some cycling needs to be performed to achieve a stable response, which is likely to result in some electrolyte consumption, and efforts to reduce this effect are ongoing. However, full cells that were left dormant for nearly 1 year could be effectively cycled at different rates, with a performance comparable to freshly prepared cells. Therefore, this work sheds light on the pre-conditioning that is often utilized for commercial Li ion batteries before roll out. For a battery based on Li|electrolyte|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> such pre-conditioning is greatly simplified, whereby Li only needs to be immersed in the relevant electrolyte for 12 days before cell fabrication.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pretreatment of lithium anodes</title><p>Lithium metal foils (China Energy Lithium, 0.33&#x02009;mm, 99&#x00025;) were immersed in [C<sub>3</sub>mPyr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] (Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seigaku, &#x0003e;99&#x00025;) electrolyte mixtures containing 0.5 mol&#x02009;Kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of a lithium salt for various time periods (4&#x02009;h and 7, 12 and 18 days). These lithium salts include the following: LiFSI (Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seigaku, &#x0003e;95&#x00025;), LiPF<sub>6</sub> (Sigma, 98&#x00025;) and LiAsF<sub>6</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, 98&#x00025;).

Replicate coin cells were cycled for either hundreds or thousands of cycles as specified in the text. Charge and discharge times were 15&#x02009;min each, with 30&#x02009;s rest between cycles (a cycle is defined as a charging step followed by a discharge step). The electrolyte used in symmetrical cells containing pretreated electrodes is kept consistent with that used for the pretreatment. Lithium metal foils used throughout the experimental design were 10&#x02009;mm in diameter and the amount of electrolyte measured was 60&#x02009;&#x003bc;l.</p><p>Full Li|electrolyte|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cells were fabricated in the same manner as symmetrical cells, with the addition of the cathode material, and underwent galvanostatic testing using an electrochemical pretreatment and subsequent 1-C rate.

Both LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and separator materials (Solupor) were dried at 100&#x02009;&#x000b0;C under vacuum for 12&#x02009;h before being used in both symmetrical and full cells. All cell-material handling and cell fabrication were performed in an Ar-filled inert atmosphere glovebox operating at less than 5&#x02009;p.p.m. H<sub>2</sub>O and 1&#x02009;p.p.m. O<sub>2</sub>. Duplicate cells were cycled for all systems to ensure reproducibility of data. Before cycling, all cells underwent three formation cycles at a rate of C/10, followed by 1,000 cycles at a rate of 1&#x02009;C (equivalent lithium current density of 1.25&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C temperature. Impedance measurements were carried out using a Solartron 1255B Frequency Response Analyser, a signal amplitude &#x0003c;10&#x02009;mV, between a frequency range of 100&#x02009;kHz to 0.1&#x02009;Hz.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Surface characterization</title><p>Surface characterization was performed after rinsing and drying of material with DMC, as stated previously, after pretreatment or cycling was carried out. Dried electrodes were loaded and enclosed in a hermetically sealed attenuated total reflectance stage (Specac Golden Gate) to permit FTIR analysis. After enclosure, the stage was removed from the glove box and spectra were obtained using a spectrum 400 FTIR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). All spectra were recorded over 16 scans using 4-cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> resolution. SEM was carried out using a Philips XL-30 field emission gun scanning electron microscope. A specifically designed brass substrate facilitated imaging of samples transferred to the SEM via a hermetically sealed environmental chamber. Images were recorded with an accelerating voltage of 5&#x02009;kV under vacuum of 1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5&#x02009;</sup>mbar. A Link ISIS (Oxford Instruments) energy-dispersive X-ray system was used to collect qualitative data of sample surfaces. A Microlab VG310F Spectrometer (Thermo) was used to collect XPS. Samples were introduced to the instrument using a dual layer glove bag (Sigma). Transfer of samples from the glove box to glove bag took place by storing a sample inside a Schott bottle within a heat-sealed aluminium laminate pouch (3&#x02009;M Film). All XPS measurements were recorded after 7 days of electrolyte pretreatment to ensure that sufficient time had lapsed for SEI reduction products to be detected. It is at this 7-day period that minimal electrolyte could be observed via SEM; thus, any spectral data best describe structural SEI information rather than pore-trapped residues.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors on request.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Basile, A. <italic>et al.</italic> Stabilizing lithium metal using ionic liquids for long-lived batteries. <italic>Nat.

However, it does not meet the cycle life and safety requirements of rechargeable batteries owing to electrolyte decomposition and dendrite formation on the surfaces of the lithium anodes during electrochemical cycling. Here, we propose a novel electrolyte system that is relatively stable against lithium metal and mitigates dendritic growth. Systematic design methods that combined simulations, model-based experiments, and <italic>in situ</italic> analyses were employed to design the system. The reduction potential of the solvent, the size of the salt anions, and the viscosity of the electrolyte were found to be critical parameters determining the rate of dendritic growth. A lithium metal anode in contact with the designed electrolyte exhibited remarkable cyclability (more than 100 cycles) at a high areal capacity of 12&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Anodes of lithium metal are being considered in the development of rechargeable batteries with high energy densities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The recent escalation in the demand for long-range electric vehicles (EVs) has rekindled research on lithium&#x02013;air and lithium&#x02013;sulfur batteries in which Li metal anodes are an essential component<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. While Li metal has a theoretical capacity (3860&#x02005;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) that is ten times larger than that of the graphite anodes (372&#x02005;mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) used in Li-ion batteries, another important requisite for fabricating cells with high energy densities is that the capacity per unit electrode area (areal capacity of the electrodes) should also be high. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the dependence of cell energy density on areal capacity for Li-ion, Li&#x02013;S, and Li&#x02013;air batteries (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for the assumptions related to and details of the calculations), where the energy density of a Li-ion battery is almost saturated after 6&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. On the contrary, the energy densities of Li&#x02013;S and Li&#x02013;air batteries increase without saturation. It is obvious that Li&#x02013;S and Li&#x02013;air batteries have the potential to considerably improve the driving ranges of EVs. However, long-range driving is feasible only when lithium anodes with significantly large areal capacities, preferably 10&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> or higher, are used.</p><p>In rechargeable lithium batteries, an areal capacity of 10&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> corresponds to the repeated stripping and plating of a lithium layer that measures about 50&#x02005;&#x003bc;m in thickness. This large change in the volume of the Li electrode can cause two serious problems: (1) continuous decomposition of the electrolyte owing to contact with the fresh Li surface through cracks in the solid&#x02013;electrolyte interphase (SEI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>; (2) acceleration of dendritic growth because of the presence of spatially inhomogeneous SEIs and non-uniform morphology of the Li surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. These two factors can seriously affect the performance, cycle life, and safety of lithium batteries. Hence, the prevention of electrolyte decomposition and the suppression of dendritic growth are necessary if Li anodes are to be employed in batteries. It had been previously suggested that the surface morphologies of lithium anodes could be controlled through the use of various electrolytes such as carbonates, esters, ethers, and ionic liquids, or mixtures of such electrolytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Furthermore, exploiting the pressure effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, using thin films of lithium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and applying block copolymer electrolytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> have also been suggested as ways of enabling efficient cycling at low areal capacities.</p><p>In our study, we systematically examined the effect of electrolyte composition on the cycling of Li anodes by combining multiple methods. We screened electrochemically stable liquid solvents against Li metal anodes using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigated the interactions between these screened solvents and the Li surfaces using <italic>ab initio</italic> molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Additionally, we conducted experiments using Li symmetric cells to identify the key parameters affecting the dendrites' growth rate. To further analyze the impact of these key parameters, <italic>in situ</italic> optical microscopy was performed and a statistical model of the parameters was investigated. Finally, Li symmetric cells were prepared using the designed electrolytes and cycled at an areal capacity of 12&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of cycling tests being performed under such severe conditions.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>The first step was to screen various solvents on the basis of their stability against lithium metal. Three groups of solvents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> were considered as candidates (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), and the reduction potential of each solvent molecule was calculated using a method based on <italic>ab initio</italic> DFT. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> lists 22 solvents whose calculated reduction potentials against Li<sup>+</sup>/Li are less than &#x02212;0.5 V (vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li), implying that the probability of a direct reaction between these solvents and lithium metal would be low. While solvent&#x02013;salt interactions were not considered for these calculations, the criterion of a reduction potential below &#x02212;0.5&#x02005;V (vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) was thought to be adequate for screening purposes, since a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> had suggested the energy levels in glymes were lowered by 0.5&#x02005;eV on average when the solvent&#x02013;salt interactions were considered. The screened solvents included six linear ethers, five cyclic ethers, two aromatic ethers, two carbonates, two amides, an amine, and a urea (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Except for the amide and the urea, all the screened solvents had a dielectric constant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> of less than 10; of the linear ethers considered, the shorter ones exhibited lower reduction potentials; the cyclic ethers showed lower reduction potentials than did the aromatic ones with conjugated rings. Therefore, it was inferred that the criteria of uniform charge distribution (low dielectric constant), short chain length (among linear ethers), and non-conjugated rings (among cyclic ethers) might aid in the design of solvent molecules with better electrochemical stability against reduction. Based on these computationally screened solvents, we performed experiments on the solubility of Li salt for further screening. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>, 11 solvents exhibiting solubilities of more than 1.0&#x02005;M for lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF<sub>4</sub>) salt were screened for the following experiments.</p><p>To identify the critical parameters affecting the growth of dendrites, we considered the properties of Li metal, as well as properties of interfaces between Li metal and the electrolytes. We have already shown in our previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> that the intrinsic properties of Li surfaces do not significantly affect the formation of dendrites. Hence, we shifted our focus to the interfaces formed between Li surfaces and the electrolytes investigated. Accordingly, the effects of four parameters, namely, the viscosities of the bulk electrolytes (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic>), the interfacial energies between Li metal and the solvents (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>), the concentrations of Li ions (<italic>C</italic><sub>Li+</sub>) in the electrolytes, and the size of the salt anions (<italic>R</italic><sub>A</sub>) were investigated in detail. Some of these parameters have been studied by Monroe and Newman<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> using a phenomenological model. We measured the short-circuit time (<italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub>) of Li symmetric coin cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) as an indicator of the dendrites' growth rate. The compositions of the electrolytes were chosen such that they bore representative values of the parameters <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, <italic>C</italic><sub>Li+</sub>, and <italic>R</italic><sub>A</sub>, with the solvents being some of the screened ones mentioned above (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> for the sets of electrolytes, where seven solvents&#x02014;1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME); tetraglyme; polyglyme; tetrahydrofuran (THF); 2-methyl THF; 2,2-dimethyl THF; 2,5-dimethyl THF&#x02014;were selected from the 11 screened solvents in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).</p><p>The viscosity of the electrolyte used in a battery may influence the movement of Li ions and affect dendritic growth. To study the effect of <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>, we chose linear ethers for the solvents since the values of <italic>&#x003b7;</italic> could be controlled by varying the molecular lengths of the ethers without significantly affecting the other parameters. It is known that differences in the molecular weights of solvents usually lead to differences in their viscosities as well. Therefore, the <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values of Li symmetric cells that used 1&#x02005;M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in DME (90.12&#x02005;g mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), tetraglyme (222.28&#x02005;g mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and polyglyme (~500&#x02005;g mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were measured. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows the lithium deposition profiles of these Li symmetric cells at a current density of 1&#x02005;mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for the selected electrolytes. The Li symmetric cell using DME showed the highest <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> (~74&#x02005;h) and the lowest overpotential (&#x0003c;0.07&#x02005;V) during lithium deposition, indicating that DME was the solvent that was most effective in reducing dendritic growth. The average <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values of the cell using tetraglyme was 23&#x02005;h, which was smaller than that of the DME-containing cell (56&#x02005;h), indicating faster dendritic growth. The overpotential of the tetraglyme-containing cell was also higher than that of the DME-containing cell. The potential of the Li symmetric cell using polyglyme jumped dramatically to over 2.5&#x02005;V right after the start of lithium deposition and then increased gradually to 5&#x02005;V, suggesting that the resistance of the polyglyme-containing cell was so high that lithium could not be deposited readily.</p><p>Higher interfacial energy between Li metal and the solvent molecules may retard dendrite formation since they would result in larger surface areas. By analyzing the results of the AIMD simulations performed for the screened solvent molecules listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, we found that the oxygen atoms in the ether molecules are attracted to the Li metal surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Therefore, in order to control the value of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, we selected four of the screened cyclic ethers: THF; 2-methyl THF; 2,2-dimethyl THF; and 2,5-dimethyl THF. It was assumed that the existence of methyl group(s) in the molecules of 2-methyl THF; 2,2-dimethyl THF; and 2,5-dimethyl THF would increase <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> owing to a steric effect. Indeed, the values of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> calculated for THF; 2-methyl THF; 2,2-dimethyl THF; and 2,5-dimethyl THF via the AIMD simulations were 0.453, 0.506, 0.526, and 0.567&#x02005;J m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), confirming the assumption regarding the steric effect. Consequently, the effect of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> on dendritic growth was investigated by measuring the values of <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> of Li symmetric cells that used 1&#x02005;M LiTFSI in THF; 2-methyl THF; 2,2-dimethyl THF; and 2,5-dimethyl THF. While the overpotential of the Li symmetric cells increased with the number of methyl groups present in the solvent, the differences in the <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values were negligible, judging from the profiles of the cells. The average <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values were 40, 44, 45, and 44&#x02005;h, for the Li symmetric cells employing THF; 2-methyl THF; 2,2-dimethyl THF; and 2,5-dimethyl THF; respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values increased slightly in the case of the solvents that contained methyl groups. However, it was revealed that the change in <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> induced by each solvent was not a dominant factor in determining <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub>.</p><p>It was assumed that a higher <italic>C</italic><sub>Li+</sub> would increase the number of Li ions present near the Li anode surface, resulting in spatially uniform Li plating. To investigate the effect of an increase in <italic>C</italic><sub>Li+</sub> of the electrolyte on dendritic growth, lithium deposition was allowed to occur in Li symmetric cells using 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0&#x02005;M LiTFSI in tetraglyme. The average <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> decreased slightly with an increase in <italic>C</italic><sub>Li+</sub> to up to 2.0&#x02005;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), implying that the increase in <italic>C</italic><sub>Li+</sub> could not mitigate dendritic growth. Instead, it is more plausible that the increase in concentration might have increased the viscosity of the electrolyte, thus accelerating dendritic growth to some degree. In the case where 3.0&#x02005;M LiTFSI in tetraglyme was used, the potential of the Li symmetric cell jumped to 1.25&#x02005;V immediately and then steadily increased to 4&#x02005;V. The resistance of the 3.0&#x02005;M LiTFSI cell was so high that measuring <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> was not possible.</p><p>A larger <italic>R</italic><sub>A</sub> may have increased the degree to which Li ions contributed to the ionic conductivity of the cells, since the movement of the anions might be retarded owing to their large size. In other words, a larger <italic>R</italic><sub>A</sub> might increase the transference number of lithium ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In order to investigate the effect of anion size on dendritic growth, we next selected three different salts whose anions had distinct radii to form the electrolyte: lithium iodide (LiI), LiBF<sub>4</sub>, and LiTFSI. The radii of the anions I<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, BF<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> were estimated to be 0.206, 0.24, and 0.326&#x02005;nm, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Therefore, the average <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values of Li symmetric cells using 1&#x02005;M LiI, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, and LiTFSI in tetraglyme were measured and found to be 7, 14, and 23&#x02005;h, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The value of <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> for the Li symmetric cell with LiTFSI was the highest, while the overpotential of the Li symmetric cell with LiI was the highest.</p><p>To further investigate the relationship between <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> and the kinetic properties of the electrolytes, the viscosities and ionic conductivities of all the electrolytes mentioned above were measured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2c and 2d</xref> show the dependence of the <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values of the Li symmetric cells on the viscosities and ionic conductivities, respectively, of the eight electrolytes formed using the salt LiTFSI (i.e., DME; THF; 2-methyl THF; 2,2-dimethyl THF; 2,5-dimethyl THF combined with 1&#x02005;M LiTFSI; and TEGDME combined with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0&#x02005;M LiTFSIs). The data for the other salts have been excluded to avoid the effect of their anions' sizes. It is obvious that their values of <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> were inversely proportional to the viscosity of the electrolyte, regardless of the other electrolyte-related parameters such as <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and <italic>C</italic><sub>Li+</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This confirms again that the viscosity of the electrolyte was one of the critical factors determining the dendrites' growth rate. However, a direct relationship between <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> and the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes was not found, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>. This is demonstrated particularly clearly by the set of electrolytes selected for the experiment based on the range of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). For a significant range of the ionic conductivity between 1.09 and 0.0185&#x02005;S m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, there was no change in the <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values for an almost constant viscosity, clearly indicating that dendritic growth was independent of the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. To summarize the results of the measurements of the <italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub> values, the viscosity of the electrolyte and the size of its anion were found to be the factors with the most influence on dendritic growth.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In order to directly observe the effects of the viscosity and anion size on dendritic growth, an electrochemical cell was set up such that it could be observed using <italic>in situ</italic> optical microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The dendritic growth on the Li electrode surface was recorded in real time during lithium deposition using a 1&#x02005;M solution of LiTFSI in DME (T-DME), a 1&#x02005;M solution of LiTFSI in tetraglyme (T-tetraglyme), and a 1&#x02005;M solution of LiI in tetraglyme (I-tetraglyme) at a current density of 5&#x02005;mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. A comparison of the cells using T-DME and T-tetraglyme elucidated the effect of electrolyte viscosity on dendritic growth, while those using T-tetraglyme and I-tetraglyme did the same for the effect of anion size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows the morphologies of the deposited lithium layers when T-DME, T-tetraglyme, and I-tetraglyme were used. The micrographs were taken after a charge of 1.67&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> had passed for each experiment. The thicknesses of the deposited lithium layers were 130, 570, and 800&#x02005;&#x003bc;m for T-DME, T-tetraglyme, and I-tetraglyme, respectively. Since the thickness of each deposited lithium layers should theoretically have been as low as 8&#x02005;&#x003bc;m, the results indicate that lithium was deposited in the form of dendrites in all cases. It was also reconfirmed that DME was more effective than tetraglyme as a solvent for mitigating dendritic growth, owing to the lower viscosity of the former and higher effectiveness of LiTFSI in generating dense lithium deposits than LiI because the TFSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions are larger in size.</p><p>To study the effect of <italic>&#x003b7;</italic> in detail, we performed statistical simulations using two-dimensional diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> shows the DLA simulation results for two different mean collision times (<italic>&#x003c4;</italic>), with the value of <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> for the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> being nine times greater than that for the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>. <italic>&#x003c4;</italic>, which is defined as the average time between collisions of particles in random motion, is proportional to the mobility (<italic>u</italic>), as shown by the equation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>

These cells contained two lithium electrodes facing each other; DME (low reduction potential and low <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>) and LiTFSI (large <italic>R</italic><sub>A</sub>) were chosen as the representative solvent and salt, respectively, for the cells. We also combined DME and LiTFSI with a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based electrolyte that contained silica as a filler and reinforced by a commercial polypropylene separator to further mitigate dendritic growth. Although the ionic conductivity of PEO is low, it is stable with respect to Li metal and has the ability to suppress directional dendritic growth. It is also known that a SiO<sub>2</sub> filler increases the dissociation of Li salts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and enhances the mobility of Li ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> in polymer electrolytes. In addition, compressive pressure was applied using a coil spring installed in the coin cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. For comparison, cells that used PEO, PEO + SiO<sub>2</sub>, tetraglyme + PEO + SiO<sub>2</sub>, polyglyme + PEO + SiO<sub>2</sub>, DME + PEO + SiO<sub>2</sub>, and propylene carbonate (PC) + PEO + SiO<sub>2</sub> as electrolytes were assembled and cycled at a current density of 3&#x02005;mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and capacity of 12&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, the cells containing only PEO and those with PEO + tetraglyme + SiO<sub>2</sub> and PEO + polyglyme + SiO<sub>2</sub> experienced a high degree of polarization during early stages of the tests and thus could not be cycled any further. While the cell containing PC could be cycled, its polarization increased continuously, possibly because of the repeated decomposition of the solvent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). On the other hand, the cell with DME + PEO + SiO<sub>2</sub> could be cycled a 100 times without a significant increase in polarization, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, confirming that our principles for electrolyte design were valid.</p><p>In summary, to overcome the problems of electrolyte decomposition and dendritic growth on the surfaces of Li metal anodes, we designed liquid electrolytes by performing <italic>ab initio</italic> atomic and statistical simulations, investigating model electrolytes using Li symmetric cells, and performing <italic>in situ</italic> microscopy-based analyses. We found that the following rules were applicable for designing electrolytes suitable with Li anodes: the solvent should have a low reduction potential, the salt anions should be large in size, and the resulting electrolyte should have low viscosity. By combining a screened liquid electrolyte with a polymer electrolyte in a pressurized cell, we could achieve an excellent charging/discharging durability of around 100 cycles for an anode with an extremely high areal capacity of 12&#x02005;mAh cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Although the practical use of this electrolyte composition might be limited owing to the low boiling point of DME (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), the results of this study clearly suggest that proper electrolyte design involving the control of electrolyte reactivity with respect to lithium, as well as the viscosity of the electrolyte and its anions' sizes, can increase the longevity of lithium anodes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DFT calculations</title><p>The DFT/basis-set of the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level and the polarized continuum model (PCM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> for describing the solvation effect were used as implemented in the Gaussian 03 software package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

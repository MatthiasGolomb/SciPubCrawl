Yet the low capacity of intercalation electrodes limits the further increase in the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries, which motivates our investigations of new materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. There is also an ever-increasing interest in revisiting lithium (Li) anode, as Li has the lowest electrode potential (&#x02212;3.04&#x02009;V vs. SHE) and the highest capacity (3860&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) among all anodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Pairing the Li anode with a high-capacity sulfur cathode, we may achieve an energy density of 500&#x02009;Wh&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, doubling that of current Li-ion batteries. However, structural and chemical irreversibility encumbers its stable cycling. On the one hand, Li metal is reactive, continuously consuming electrolyte, electrolyte additives, and active materials. On the other hand, the volume change of Li is infinite, because of its hostless nature, so a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) required for suppressing side reactions can be repeatedly breached, resulting in a vicious circle of anode degradation.</p><p id="Par4">The infinite volume change of Li metal over cycling requires a porous scaffold to stabilize the electrode structure and to provide more reaction sites for Li plating/stripping. Typical freestanding scaffolds include layered reduced graphene oxide, porous nickel and copper foams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Among them, porous carbonaceous scaffolds are attractive for their small pore size, low cost and light weight, but to load them with Li, the surface of the scaffolds needs to be highly lithiophilic. Even when we improve the lithiophilicity by decorating the carbon surfaces with materials like ZnO, Si, Ag, and Au, the molten Li necessitates a high temperature to lower its viscosity, which aggravates the unwanted reactions between Li and trace amounts of environmental impurities (e.g. N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>) that in turn hinder the infusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In spite of the difficulty of fabrication, when the porous Li scaffold is employed in a Li&#x02013;S full battery, a protective, ion-conductive surface layer is necessary to block the crossover of polysulfide intermediates. Inorganic solid electrolytes (e.g. Garnet-based) have been employed as the surface protective layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Though effective for the suppression of side reactions as well as dendrite propagation, the use of inorganic solid electrolyte suffers from the fragility, the high Li<sup>+</sup> transport resistance, and the relatively low volumetric energy density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Moreover, inside the porous Li scaffold, liquid electrolyte is usually needed for wetting the Li surface. A robust artificial SEI for smoothing the Li deposits and suppressing the consumption of liquid electrolyte thus would be necessary. The SEI needs to satisfy requirements of high chemical stability, high uniformity, adequate elasticity and high Young&#x02019;s and shear modulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Interfacial engineering is usually applied to achieve the above requirements by coating Li surface with mechanically stiff inorganic compounds (carbon, BN, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc.); binary Li&#x02013;X compounds (Li<sub>3</sub>N, Li<sub>2</sub>O, Li<sub>2</sub>S, LiF, Li<sub>4.4</sub>Sn, Li<sub>13</sub>In<sub>3</sub>); ternary Li&#x02013;M&#x02013;X compounds (Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Among them, LiF is considered as one of the most promising choices for the suppression of side reactions and dendrite growth owing to its high stability and high mechanical strength (Young&#x02019;s modulus: 65&#x02009;GPa; shear modulus: 55&#x02009;GPa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. By treating the porous Li scaffold in the fluorine-rich gas atmosphere, the LiF-based artificial SEI could be formed across the electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Such a vapor deposition method, however, might lead to safety concern during scaled-up production. Also, the issues, such as the loose binding between Li and LiF, and low ionic conductivity of LiF remain unsolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Spontaneous reactions at liquid/solid interface are arguably the most promising approach, recent examples of which include the use of InF<sub>3</sub> as an electrolyte additive and CuF<sub>2</sub> as the precursor for in-situ and ex-situ SEI formation, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, neither work could generate a sufficiently robust and conductive layer that is also immune to the attack by polysulfides; InF<sub>3</sub> is too low in solubility; and CuF<sub>2</sub> produces Cu which is unstable towards polysulfides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">With these considerations in mind, we design two steps of spontaneous reactions to achieve a porous Li electrode protected by functional composites. In the first step, we infuse molten Li into a sulfur/carbon nanofiber scaffold driven by the sparkling exothermic reaction between Li and the pre-impregnated sulfur to form a porous Li composite. In the next step, the porous Li composite reacts with a metal fluoride complex (BiF<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>) to spontaneously form Li<sub>3</sub>Bi alloy and LiF that are tightly anchored to the Li surface. P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> also polymerizes with residual Li<sub>2</sub>S on the porous electrode to form an ion conductive amorphous Li<sub>2</sub>S&#x02013;P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> solid electrolyte layer. The spontaneously achieved multiscale protection enables the stable operation of Li&#x02013;S full batteries with a rather high sulfur loading (10.2&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) at 6.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for over 200 cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabricating a porous Li electrode</title><p id="Par7">The porous scaffold for Li we chose is a carbon nanofiber matrix (CNF) of a high specific surface area and a robust interwoven structure (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Electrodeposition of Li led to a non-uniform distribution of Li, mostly at the separator side due to its high local Li<sup>+</sup> concentration. Such an electrode could not achieve stable cycling (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Alternatively, direct thermal infiltration of molten Li encountered the surface lithiophobicity issue, completely preventing the Li infusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">To tackle this issue, we applied the reactive wetting strategy to drive the Li infusion with a reaction between Li and sulfur. We chose sulfur out of a variety of materials after comparing their melting points and Gibbs free energies of complete lithiation reactions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The low melting point of sulfur and its high affinity with carbon allows for its effective filling into a porous scaffold at a low temperature. Besides, its highly exothermic reaction with Li can provide much heat to reduce the viscosity of molten Li and a chemical potential gradient that drives the wetting of Li on the carbon surface to overcome friction and surface tension (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, we first impregnated the CNF with sulfur to form a composite called herein as S&#x02013;CNF as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which led to a uniform sulfur film on all carbon fiber surface. When we further infiltrated the as-prepared S&#x02013;CNF scaffold with molten Li, we observed that Li rapidly reacted and wetted the carbon fiber scaffold as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. The infusion of molten Li into a 50-&#x003bc;m-thick CNF scaffold finished within 120&#x02009;s to form the Li&#x02013;S/CNF composite. Even with a volume expansion of 70% in such a small duration, the interwoven structure of CNF well accommodated the infused Li (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The void space was uniformly filled, as seen in the cross-sectional view (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Interestingly, after the gravitational condensation, we can create a Li<sub>2</sub>S-rich surface and a Li-rich surface as shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a, b</xref>. This is because the Li<sub>2</sub>S with a higher density (1.66&#x02009;g&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) has poor affinity with both carbon and Li, so it can gradually condense on the electrode&#x02019;s bottom surface to form a dense layer as shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c, d</xref>. Differently, lithiated CNF can trap molten Li with its good lithiophilicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, on the Li-rich surface, we observe the carbon nanofiber was coated with a Li shell as shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5e, f</xref>. The detailed gravimetric and volumetric fractions of these electrode components are shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> (calculation details can be found in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>. Porosity could be estimated around 7.1 % for the Li/S&#x02013;CNF electrode, which would be filled with the liquid electrolyte. The chosen initial sulfur loading was 2.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, which guaranteed the uniform Li filling, and an adequate scaffold expansion ratio (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, &#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref> and Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The fabrication of Li&#x02013;S/CNF. <bold>a</bold> Cartoons illustrating the fabrication process. <bold>b</bold> SEM of the surface of the pristine CNF; <bold>c</bold> snapshots taken during the fabrication, showing the sparkling reaction between molten lithium and the sulfur-impregnated CNF; <bold>d</bold> cross-sectional SEM of the Li/S&#x02013;CNF.

In this step, we employed another spontaneous reaction between Li and BiF<sub>3</sub>. We chose BiF<sub>3</sub> as its reaction with Li can create a composite coating of Li<sub>3</sub>Bi and LiF. The Young&#x02019;s modulus of Li<sub>3</sub>Bi (22.20&#x02009;GPa) is much higher than Li metal (1&#x02009;GPa), which can suppress dendrite formation and strongly interconnect LiF on the Li surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, Li<sub>3</sub>Bi is reported to possess a high concentration of interstitials, which may facilitate the Li<sup>+</sup> transport within and through the artificial SEI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Moreover, Li<sub>3</sub>Bi is electrochemically inert given its high delithiation voltage of ~1.1&#x02009;V vs Li/Li<sup>+</sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref> and Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). As a step further, we corroborate our postulation on the benefit of Li<sub>3</sub>Bi and LiF with first-principle density functional theory-based (DFT) calculations. The results show that Li adatom is weakly adsorbed on the substrate of Li<sub>3</sub>Bi, providing the lowest surface diffusion energy barriers for Li adatom (0.17&#x02009;eV), followed by LiF (0.36&#x02009;eV), and then Li metal (0.39&#x02009;eV) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). We thus expect that a surface composite layer of LiF and Li<sub>3</sub>Bi can result in facile Li plating and smooth Li deposits.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Coating Li by solubilized BiF<sub>3</sub>. <bold>a</bold> Charge density difference plots showing the adsorption of a Li adatom on the substrate of LiF (111) (left) and Li<sub>3</sub>Bi (111) (right) (top row); the diffusion pathways of Li adatoms on the corresponding surfaces (bottom row).

Our strategy is solubilizing BiF<sub>3</sub> with P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> as a complexing agent. P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> has been previously reported to complex with Li<sub>2</sub>S to form solid electrolyte precursor, because sulfide anions can initiate nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic phosphorous in P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, causing ionic polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Here we show that complexation occurs between BiF<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>. The lone pair electron of Bi can initiate nucleophilic attack toward P to form two possible products as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. We measured <sup>31</sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) spectra of the supernatants of mixtures of 50&#x02009;mM BiF<sub>3</sub> with various amounts of P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> in DME (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) to verify our hypothesis. Comparing the NMR spectra, we can deduce that two peaks at 105.2 and 97.8&#x02009;ppm represent the BiF<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> complex with one phosphorous reacted, which will take a higher portion in the soluble product when the molar ratio of BiF<sub>3</sub>: P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> decreases. And the peak at 83.1&#x02009;ppm represents the complex with both phosphorous atoms reacted. This complex likely maintains the symmetrical adamantane-like cage structure, therefore showing the single peak in NMR. While BiF<sub>3</sub> or P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> alone has intrinsically negligible solubility, for the solution with a BiF<sub>3</sub>: P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> ratio of 1:1, the solubility of Bi<sup>3+</sup> is 570&#x02009;ppm, as determined by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The as-prepared mixture will then be used to react with Li to form a composite artificial SEI comprising of LiF and Li<sub>3</sub>Bi (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). In spite of using ether-based solvent like DME, similar complexation and solvation behavior can also be attained in ester (e.g. ethyl propionate) and nitrile (e.g. acetonitrile) based solvents as shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>.</p><p id="Par11">We first applied this solution-based coating strategy to the planar Li foil. The reduction of BiF<sub>3</sub> on the Li surface resulted in the formation of a uniform, conformal black layer around 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;m in thickness as observed from the cross-sectional SEM images (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate the existence of Li<sub>3</sub>Bi and LiF phases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>), which can be further confirmed by the evolution of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Bi 4f and F 1&#x02009;s after lithaition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). No signals of BiF<sub>3</sub> or Li metal can be found in XRD or XPS, confirming the complete reaction. We also analyzed quantitatively the composition of the coating along the depth direction via XPS spectroscopy by sputtering its surface by Ar gas for different durations. The results indicate a uniform distribution of LiF and Li<sub>3</sub>Bi alloy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), with small contents of P and S (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), which is likely the residual P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> and the reaction products between Li and P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> (grey fitting line in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

The formation of the solid electrolyte layer can also be seen in the EIS profile and the polarization test. By applying the coating to a thick Li&#x02013;S/CNF (240&#x02009;&#x000b5;m) electrode, the low-frequency real part of the impedance (ReZ) decreased from 12&#x02009;&#x003a9; (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21a</xref>) to 9.0&#x02009;&#x003a9; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), indicating that the formation of a continuous solid electrolyte layer can indeed promote the ion transport.

Similar levels of specific capacity (1352&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and volume fraction of utilized Li (68.3 %) were achieved for a thicker electrode (240&#x02009;&#x000b5;m in thickness). We further show that at such a high areal discharge capacity (33.8&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), the counter electrode (also a MFC-Li/CNF) suffered from a loss of porosity, leading to the rise of impedances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. During charging, we observed that the impedance spectrum returned to its initial value, confirming the electrode&#x02019;s capability to withstand large volume change (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). In comparison, symmetric cells with neither Li&#x02013;S/CNF (240&#x02009;&#x000b5;m in thickness, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21b</xref>) nor planar Li electrodes could achieve such a high areal capacity due to the unregulated Li plating. Furthermore, we carried out the long-term cycling test to evaluate the stability of the Li/electrolyte interphase. The planar Li electrode could not be stably cycled at 1.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> within 160&#x02009;h and exhibited the high-overpotential, fluctuating voltage profiles at a higher current density (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>).

Enlarging the electrode surface area and building robust SEI across Li and liquid electrolyte could smoothen the Li deposits.

In addition, given the parasitic gas evolution and the limited benefit in long-term, high-loading cycling, we decide not to explore the use of LiNO<sub>3</sub> in this work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par17">In summary, we designed two steps of spontaneous reactions to achieve a porous Li electrode protected by functional composites, which delivered stable cycling performance at 45&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with an areal capacity above 7.5&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (4.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and 6.8&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (6.0&#x02009;mA&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) in a Li&#x02013;S battery. Both steps of fabrication can be generalized to other structures or materials. In the first step, the sulfur impregnation can apply to other carbon-based porous frameworks to drive the infiltration of molten Li with the exothermic reaction. In the second step, the complexation strategy to solubilize metal fluoride is by no means limited to BiF<sub>3</sub>. SbF<sub>3</sub> or InF<sub>3</sub>, can also complex with P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, which can then react with Li to form a composite coating comprising of LiF and Li-alloy (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">29</xref>). It is evident that many parameters in the two steps can be tailored to optimize the anode structure for better performance. In addition, the BiF<sub>3</sub>-P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> precursor solution and the formed MFC-Li/CNF electrode are both stable in the dry air (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">30</xref> and Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), which will facilitate cost-effective processing and battery assembly at a practical scale. Therefore, we believe that the facileness and the flexibility of our electrode design strategy holds a high promise in its application in practically rechargeable Li-based batteries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="Par18">The CNF scaffold was prepared according to the reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Briefly, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers were firstly obtained from PAN in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution by electrospinning technique. Stabilization and subsequent carbonization of the electrospun PAN fibers were carried out in a high temperature furnace to form the CNF.</p><p id="Par19">Sulfur was impregnated inside the CNF scaffold (13&#x02009;mm in diameter) on a hot plate (155&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). Due to the high affinity of sulfur/carbon, as soon as the CNF and molten sulfur droplet were attached, sulfur droplets could wet the CNF. The Li infusion, coating and heat treatment were all conducted inside the Ar-filled glove box, with O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O levels maintained below 1 ppm. When in contact with molten Li (200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), the sparking reaction soon occurred, which allowed the infusion of molten Li inside the CNF. After the reactive wetting process, by putting the composite on the heated flat stainless steel plate (200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) for 60&#x02009;min, the gravitational setting of Li<sub>2</sub>S formed a Li<sub>2</sub>S-rich surface layer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Beside, excessive molten Li that attached on the carbon surface could be squeezed out of the Li/S&#x02013;CNF composite. The areal weight of the CNF scaffold was 0.80&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and the areal sulfur loading before Li infusion was 2.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

With the thicker CNF scaffold (150&#x02009;&#x000b5;m in thickness), sulfur loading was also tripled, after Li infusion, the areal weight increased to 14.7&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, and thickness increased to 240&#x02009;&#x000b5;m.</p><p id="Par20">BiF<sub>3</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, &#x02265;99.9%) together with P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich) were dispersed in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (5&#x02009;mL, Sigma-Aldrich) by vigorously stirring for 60&#x02009;min.

After drying, there was an areal weight increase of 1.8&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> on the Li foil. For the thinner Li/S&#x02013;CNF composite (85&#x02009;&#x000b5;m), the areal weight increase of 3.2&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (overall 8.7&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) was attained after solution coating for 60&#x02009;min. For the thicker Li/S&#x02013;CNF composite (240&#x02009;&#x000b5;m), the areal weight increase of 10.3&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (overall 25.0&#x02009;mg&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) was attained.

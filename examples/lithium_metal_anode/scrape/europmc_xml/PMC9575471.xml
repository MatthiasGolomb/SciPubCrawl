Therefore, the SLCs can achieve high performance in solid-state batteries with Li metal as anode and organic molecule as cathode. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are leading candidates for constructing SLCs because of the excellent 1D channels and accurate chemical-modification skeleton. Herein, various contents of lithium-sulfonated covalently anchored COFs (denoted as LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2) are controllably synthesized as SLCs. Due to the directional ion channels, high Li contents, and single-ion frameworks, LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 shows exceptional Li-ion conductivity of 5.47 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x02009;S &#x000b7; cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, high transference number of 0.93, and low activation energy of 0.15&#x02009;eV at room temperature. Such preeminent Li-ion-transported properties of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 permit stable Li<sup>+</sup> plating/stripping in a symmetric lithium metal battery, effectively impeding the Li dendrite growth in a liquid cell. Moreover, the designed quasi-solid-state cell (organic anthraquinone (AQ) as cathode, Li metal as anode, and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 as electrolyte) shows high-capacity retention and rate behavior. Consequently, LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 implies a potential value restraining the dissolution of small organic molecules and Li dendrite growth.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007839">Yunnan University</funding-source><award-id>2019</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>International Joint Research Center for Advanced Energy Materials of Yunnan Province</funding-source><award-id>202003AE140001</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Key National Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province</funding-source><award-id>2019FY003023</award-id><award-id>2018FA028</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809">National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>52064049</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Due to the high mechanical strength and inflammable features of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), the solid-state Li metal batteries matched cathode materials with highly specific capacity and SSEs can achieve high-energy density and safety properties. Therefore, SSEs play a crucial role in realizing solid-state batteries [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among various SSEs, single-Li<sup>+</sup> conductors (SLCs) show high ion conductivity and transference number. Moreover, the polarization of concentration difference can be addressed because there are no randomly removable anion and solvent in SLCs. Notably, the multiple species of freely mobile anion and solvent molecule inevitably trigger ununiform Li<sup>+</sup> deposition and dendrite formation on the Li metal surface [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, designing and constructing advanced SLCs without anion and solvent are urgently needed.</p><p>Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are popular crystalline materials and show a larger surface area, adjustable skeleton, and easily chemical modification [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Significantly, the active groups or units are effectively locked into the skeleton of COFs, satisfying a variety of applications [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These outstanding characteristics provide an ideal setting for creating Li<sup>+</sup> conductors with high ion conductivity and transference number [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Consequently, COFs have been intensively investigated as advanced Li<sup>+</sup> SSEs in recent years [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Although COF-based SLCs have been reported and studied such as TpPa-SO<sub>3</sub>Li with ion conductivity of 2.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x02009;S &#x000b7; cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and transference number of 0.9 [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as well as LiCON-3 with ion conductivity of 3.21 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x02009;S &#x000b7; cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and transference number of 0.92 [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the ion conductivity and transference number are still far below expectations. The main reason is that finite active site is anchored onto COFs, generating a lower Li<sup>+</sup> content [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Besides, these Li<sup>+</sup>-conducting COFs are established by injecting Li salts or solvent molecules into the frameworks (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S1a</xref> and <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">1b</xref>), resulting in anion-caused interfacial side reactions, which impedes the Li<sup>+</sup> movement [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, the multicomponent of solvent and anion in the COF-based SSEs might generate ambiguously interfacial reaction mechanism [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, it is critically necessary to accurately modify and design a multiactive center for increasing ion conductivity and transference number.</p><p>Herein, we designed various COF-based SLCs by covalent modification of active-site SO<sub>3</sub>Li into the pores of COFs without additional padding Li salts (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S1c</xref>). The synthetic route and chemical structure of single-ion COF conductors (LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2) are provided in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Particularly, the anionic framework could avoid the interfacial side-reaction and restrain dendrite growth. As a result, LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 permits stable Li<sup>+</sup> plating/stripping in Li/Li symmetric battery. Furthermore, the Li<sup>+</sup> migration's dynamics and distance are improved. It leads to big ion conductivity and small activation energy. The Li<sup>+</sup> migration behaviors are fully deduced by DFT theoretical calculation. Moreover, the electrolyte is successfully implemented in solid-state organic Li battery. This strategy can hinder Li dendrite growth and avoid the organic cathode dissolution, leading to excellently cyclic and rate performances. We therefore anticipate that this study will lead to the development of a new technology that will enable COF-based single-ion conductors in solid-state batteries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Results and Discussions</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Structural and Morphological Characterizations</title><p>As shown in Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>, LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 are synthesized by condensation 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp), 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid (Pa-1SO<sub>3</sub>H),, and 2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-disulfonic acid (Pa-2SO<sub>3</sub>H) at mixed solvents of mesitylene, 1,4-dioxane, and CH<sub>3</sub>COOH. Subsequently, the sulfonic acid groups are easily reacted with Li<sup>+</sup> to form lithium-sulfonated COFs of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. Both the intermediate products of HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 are connected by the C-N bond. Therefore, the characteristic peak of C-N is detected by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum. Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2&#x02013;S3</xref> display obvious peaks for HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. It is ascribed to the stretching vibration of C-N [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The C-N bonds indicate successful condensation reaction between &#x02212;CHO and &#x02212;NH<sub>2</sub> groups and complete conversion into COFs. Moreover, the complete chemical conversion is further proved by the C=C bonds (1572&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and 1576&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2) [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The crystallinity of obtained HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 is investigated with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements. For HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows three obvious peaks at 2<italic>&#x003b8;</italic> of 4.76, 8.05, and 26.4&#x000b0;. They are attributed to the (100), (110), and (001) faces [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For further study structure, Pawley refinement is implemented. Low values of <italic>R</italic><sub>wp</sub> = 2.67% and <italic>R</italic><sub>p</sub> = 2.08% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a)</xref>, pink) suggest high in accordance with experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a)</xref>, green). In comparison with alternative AA and AB models, the HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 adopts the AA stacking (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S4</xref>). No peaks of starting materials of Tp and Pa-1SO<sub>3</sub>H appear in HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S5</xref>), demonstrating complete conversion. Consequently, the synthesis of the targeted sample of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 is implemented by suspending the HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. The LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S6</xref>) has similar PXRD with HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 after replacement of H atom by Li<sup>+</sup>. For the HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2, two obvious peaks at 4.49 and 26.12&#x000b0; can be observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(b)</xref>. The two peaks are attributed to (100) and (001) faces [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, the Pawley refinement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(b)</xref>, pink) with low values of <italic>R</italic><sub>wp</sub> = 2.57% and <italic>R</italic><sub>p</sub> = 1.98% indicates a good structure consistent with experimental data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(b)</xref>, green). HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 has AA stacking structure (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S7</xref>). No peaks of starting materials of Tp and Pa-2SO<sub>3</sub>H exist in the HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S8</xref>). And the PXRD pattern of lithium-sulfonated LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 has a similar profile to HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S9</xref>). Moreover, the solid-state <sup>13</sup>C NMR for HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(c)</xref>) and HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(d)</xref>) can further prove the C=O at ~174&#x02009;ppm and C-N bond at ~137&#x02009;ppm. The solid-state <sup>13</sup>C NMR result is consistent with the aforementioned analyses, indicating the successful preparation of sulfonated COF materials.</p><p>The porosity of prepared COFs is investigated by N<sub>2</sub> sorption/desorption isotherms. The samples of HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 show a surface area of 109 and 114 m<sup>2</sup>&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> according to N<sub>2</sub> sorption/desorption isotherms at 77&#x02009;K (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(e)</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(f)</xref>), respectively. The HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(e)</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(f)</xref> inset) exhibit a micropore feature with a cavity size of 1.3&#x02009;nm. The value is in high accordance with the simulated model (Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1(c)</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1(d)</xref>). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is applied to detect the element species of COFs. The XPS spectra of S 2p of COFs (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S10&#x02013;13</xref>) suggest the complete structure of COFs. Moreover, the Li 1s for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S14&#x02013;15</xref>) reveals that the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 sample has higher Li content than that of the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1. The Li content can be further proved by inductively coupled plasma detection for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 (2.01&#x02009;wt%) and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 (2.89&#x02009;wt%). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S16</xref>) indicates high thermal stability.</p><p>The microstructures of prepared COFs are studied by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron micrographs (TEM). Wirelike micrographs of HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 can be found in SEM and TEM images (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S17a&#x02013;d</xref>). After lithiation, the wirelike morphology is not changed (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S17b&#x02013;d</xref>) and the high-resolution TEM of the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 image shows a smooth structure, indicating no Li metal nanoparticles or clusters on the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 surface. The EDS mappings of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 can also suggest that the elements are uniformly distributed (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S17g&#x02013;l</xref>). For the HO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2, a similar morphology can be observed in SEM and TEM images (Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3(f)</xref>). In addition, the C, N, O, and S elements are uniformly distributed (Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3(g)</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3(l)</xref>). No obvious micrograph changes of the prepared COF before and after lithiation suggest outstanding structure stability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Electrochemical Performances</title><p>According to the above result, the SLCs of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COFn are successfully synthesized. In order to detect the chemical environment of Li<sup>+</sup> in LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2, the solid-state <sup>7</sup>Li NMR spectrum is used and illustrates a singlet at 1.03&#x02009;ppm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(a)</xref>). This result proves an equivalent chemical environment [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, the single peak demonstrates Li<sup>+</sup> dissociation, fast diffusion, and migration [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The electrochemical performance for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 is studied. The self-standing pellet is obtained by the cold-pressing method. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to investigate the Li<sup>+</sup> transportation ability of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. Nyquist plots of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 are recorded under various temperatures (20 to 80&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The EIS curve shows a semicircular profile made by plots of real component (Z) versus the imaginary component (Z<sup>&#x02033;</sup>). Based on curves, the calculated resistances of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 are 450, 365, 202, 81, 62, and 40&#x02009;<italic>&#x003a9;</italic> at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80&#x000b0;C, respectively. Accordingly, the investigated Li<sup>+</sup> conductivities are 4.46 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, 5.47 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, 9.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, 1.63 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, 2.47 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, 3.23 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, and 5.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>&#x02009;S &#x000b7; cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80&#x000b0;C, respectively, according to the impedance result and equation (described in the Supporting Information). It is worth noticing that the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 shows a high Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity of 5.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>&#x02009;S &#x000b7; cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>For the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1, the EIS is displayed in Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S18</xref>. It is obviously found that LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 exhibits larger resistances than LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. Consequently, the calculated Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity at 20&#x000b0;C is 2.67 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x02009;S &#x000b7; cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> according to impedance results as shown in Table <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>. According to the Arrhenius plots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(c)</xref>), LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 show low Ea value of 0.15&#x02009;eV and 0.18&#x02009;eV, respectively. The obtained small Ea is adjacent to other Li<sup>+</sup> conductors, certifying the directional Li-ion migration channel. The Li<sup>+</sup> transference number (<italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup>) is measured to be 0.93 for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 and 0.91 for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S19</xref>) at 20&#x000b0;C using potentiostatic polarization means, demonstrating Li<sup>+</sup> contribution to the ion conductivity [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Besides, the electrochemical window is studied by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The LSV is recorded under a sweep rate of 10&#x02009;mV &#x000b7; s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in a voltage range from 0.5 to 6.0&#x02009;V (vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>) at room temperature. As demonstrated in Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S20</xref>, the current density keeps constant until the voltage is a higher than 4.3&#x02009;V for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. Thus, LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 exhibits an electrochemical window of 4.3&#x02009;V than LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 (4&#x02009;V) within published work [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], indicating a wide range of working voltage. The Ea, Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity, and <italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup> for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1 and LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 are compared and displayed in Table <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>. The LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 conductor shows better electrochemical behaviors than LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF1, mainly caused by the more active-center content on the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. More notably, the comparison of Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity, Ea, and <italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup> indicates distinctly better electrochemical performance for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 than other reported materials (Table <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>). Compared with Li-ion conductors with propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent, and Li salt (Table <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>), LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 presents remarkable Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity. This is because LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 has numerous easily accessible sites and well-designed directional Li-ion channel. LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 has Higher <italic>t</italic><sub>Li</sub><sup>+</sup> than others (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(d)</xref>), implying that it has outstanding single-Li<sup>+</sup>-conducting behavior.</p><p>We further assess the application of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 in solid-state Li metal batteries. The prepared LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 SSE film shows high flexibility (exhibited in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(e)</xref> inset). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(e)</xref>, the Li metal electrode assembled by symmetric lithium metal battery configuration (inset of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(e)</xref>) is made to assess the practical use of the LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 conductor. So, the galvanostatic Li plating/stripping is studied under a current density of 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>A&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for 1&#x02009;h each cycle. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(e)</xref> demonstrates stable Li plating/stripping behaviors more than 450&#x02009;h without obvious fluctuation of potential. The prominent result is caused by the single-Li-ion-conducting behavior. The stability of the framework for LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 after electrochemical measurement is investigated by PXRD and FT-IR. From the FT-IR (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S21</xref>) and PXRD (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S22</xref>) patterns before and after the test, no obvious changes can be observed. This result implies that LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 has excellent skeleton stability.</p><p>The potential application of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 is further evaluated by constructing an organic battery. Universally, the organic carbonyl cathodes cause plentiful attentions in green electrode for rechargeable Li-ion batteries [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], as these compounds show eco-friendly and renewable great preponderance. However, the dissolution of this electrode material in liquid electrolyte will inevitably cause fast decay of specific capacity and hinder cyclability and rate behaviors. This issue could be resolved by fabricating solid-state batteries. Therefore, the performance of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 is further evaluated in the Li-organic battery. The organic battery is made of Li metal as anode and anthraquinone (AQ) as cathode. The AQ has ultrahigh capacity in traditional LIBs. Nevertheless, the capacity of AQ cathode decays distinctly and shows poor performances. This issue can be worked out in the solid-state LIBs [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, we assemble AQ | LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 | Li solid cell and measure its electrochemical performances. Liquid electrolyte (10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DEC <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic> = 1 : 1) is added to the electrode surface to improve interface contact [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S23</xref> exhibits the galvanostatic charging-discharging curves at a current density of 500&#x02009;mA&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The cathode AQ displays a discharging-specific capacity of 228&#x02009;mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, lightly lower than the liquid cell AQ | LiTFSI | Li with 278&#x02009;mAh&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Additionally, the AQ | LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 | Li has better rate behaviors (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S24</xref>) and cycling stability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(f)</xref>) than AQ |LiTFSI| Li battery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(f)</xref> and Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S25</xref>). The excellent cycling stability of AQ|LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2|Li is caused by restraining the dissolution of AQ cathode in liquid electrolyte.</p><p>Li dendrite growth and dead Li on the Li metal electrode surface are the major threats and challenges of Li metal batteries. Therefore, the surface morphology of Li metal electrodes in a symmetric battery, quasi-state-solid battery, and liquid battery is investigated by SEM technique. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(a)</xref>, for the Li metal surface of symmetric battery Li| LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 |Li, no dead Li can be observed. The result suggests that Li-ion is uniformly deposited to the surface of metal Li in LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. For the AQ |<italic>LiTFSI</italic>| Li liquid battery, the inhomogeneous Li deposition is obviously observed by SEM after cycling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(b)</xref>). That is because there is no functional material to guide the uniform Li-ion flux (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S26a</xref>). However, due to the well-defined channels, COF materials can achieve uniform Li<sup>+</sup> deposition (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S26b</xref>). Hence, no dead Li or dendrite after cycles for AQ|<italic>LiO</italic>3<italic>S</italic> &#x02212; <italic>COF</italic>2|Li is supported by SEM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(c)</xref>), implying homogeneous Li<sup>+</sup> deposition. The aforementioned phenomenon demonstrates that LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 displays well-done single-Li-ion conductor behavior, which can avoid unwanted side reactions [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As a consequence, the single-Li-ion conductor LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 has potential value in a solid-state Li metal battery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Mechanism Studies</title><p>The density functional theory (DFT) calculation is carried out to study the Li-ion migration routes in LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2. LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 is a 2D-extended material. Generally, two routes are parallel and perpendicular for Li<sup>+</sup> migration, which are divided into planar and axial approaches (Figures <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref>), respectively. Different pathways for Li<sup>+</sup> migration are expounded by evaluation of migratory barriers at rate-determining steps for planar and axial. Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S27</xref> shows the optimized Li<sup>+</sup> geometries. The oxygen atom of keto-form groups in COF promotes for the migration of Li<sup>+</sup> via the cation-dipole interaction [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. As shown in Figures <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6(d)</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6(f)</xref>, axial shows a lower migratory barrier of 0.245&#x02009;eV than planar of 0.85&#x02009;eV (Figures <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6(c)</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6(e)</xref>). Some conditions are beneficial for Li<sup>+</sup> migration with axial. Firstly, the pore of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 results in an entered condition than interplanar distance. The pore size (1.3&#x02009;nm) of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 is larger than the Li<sup>+</sup> radius (0.076&#x02009;nm) than interplanar distance (0.48&#x02009;nm), as shown in Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S27</xref>. Therefore, Li-ion migrates in the pore. Secondly, the distance of the axial pathway is shorter than the planar pathway (Figure <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S28</xref>). Beyond all question, the C=O groups provide electrostatic interaction and accelerate the dissociation of &#x02212;SO<sub>3</sub>Li, which plays an important role for promoting Li<sup>+</sup> migration. To sum up, the above theoretical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that Li<sup>+</sup> directionally transports across the stacked channel of LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 under the reliable assistance of O atoms and the <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>-electronic system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, a novel lithium-sulfonated covalent organic framework is successfully prepared as single-Li<sup>+</sup> SSE. The active center of &#x02212;SO<sub>3</sub>Li is covalently tethered into the 1D porous channel of COF to achieve single-ion behaviors. The unique framework structure and abundant active centers are beneficial for Li<sup>+</sup> migration. Thus, LiO<sub>3</sub>S-COF2 has high conductivity and transference number. Li-ion migration behaviors and routes are thoroughly studied and illustrated using DFT. Based on directional ion channel, the Li-ion conductor has exceptional electrochemical performance in quasi-solid-state batteries. This strategy can solve the crucial issue of the organic cathode dissolution in liquid electrolyte. Therefore, our work might accelerate the advancement of COF-based solid-state electrolyte.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>4.1.

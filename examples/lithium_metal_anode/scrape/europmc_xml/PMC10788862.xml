anode-free lithium-ion batteries, cells are manufactured
with a bare anode current collector where the lithium metal anode
is electrochemically formed from the lithium-containing cathode during
the first charge cycle. While this concept has many attractive aspects
from a manufacturing and energy density standpoint, stable plating
and stripping remain challenging. We have investigated gold, platinum,
and amorphous carbon as seed layers placed between the copper current
collector and the lithium phosphorus oxynitride thin-film solid electrolyte.
These layers guide lithium nucleation and improve the plating and
stripping dynamics. All seed layers facilitate reversible lithium
plating and stripping even at high current densities up to 8 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. Of particular note is the amorphous carbon seed
layer, which allowed a significant reduction in plating potential
from 300 mV to as low as 50 mV. These results underscore the critical
role of seed layers in improving the efficiency of anode-free solid-state
batteries and open the door to simplified manufacturing of anode-free
battery designs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>seed layers</kwd><kwd>lithium plating/stripping</kwd><kwd>anode-free</kwd><kwd>solid-state battery</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100010661</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>95817</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bundesamt f&#x000c3;&#x000bc;r Energie</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100005380</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SI/502460-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bundesamt f&#x000c3;&#x000bc;r Energie</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100005380</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SI/502460-0</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>am3c14693</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>am3c14693</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Solid-state
batteries are considered the next generation of battery
technology, offering advantages in safety and energy density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> The introduction of a solid, ionically conductive lithium-ion electrolyte
in place of the organic liquid electrolyte traditionally used in lithium-ion
batteries promises longer life and improved safety by eliminating
flammable components. This technology also paves the way for replacing
traditional graphite anodes with metallic lithium, resulting in 40&#x02013;50%
higher energy density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The introduction of metallic lithium presents challenges such as
high reactivity, unstable interfaces, and lithium dendrite growth
due to nonuniform plating and stripping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> These complications can lead to current focusing, dendrite formation
during battery cycling, and potentially dangerous short circuits.
Furthermore, lithium metal is highly reactive, and integration into
a battery is only possible under an inert atmosphere, suggesting that
the use of metallic lithium films in solid-state batteries may not
be practical.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p><p>One potential strategy
to overcome manufacturing challenges and
further increase energy density is to move away from lithium foils
to anode-free solid-state batteries (AFSSBs) or a &#x0201c;zero lithium
excess&#x0201d; manufacturing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Here, the battery is manufactured in the discharged state with a
lithium-containing cathode and a bare anode-side current collector
(CC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> This concept not only increases the energy density by reducing the
battery volume and weight but also reduces the handling and manufacturing
complexity. The lithium metal anode is then formed electrochemically
during the first charge cycle by electroplating lithium present in
the cathode. Therefore, mechanisms that control the nucleation and
growth of lithium metal are crucial to the success of AFSSBs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> While the concept of anode-free batteries had
been previously demonstrated in traditional liquid systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> its implementation in solid-state systems lagged.</p><p>Early research
on AFSSBs began with a study by Neudecker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> in 2000. This work involved the fabrication
of an anode-free thin film battery with a copper current collector,
a lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) electrolyte, and a lithium
cobalt oxide cathode using magnetron sputtering. The battery retained
80% of its original capacity after 1000 cycles. Later research shifted
the focus to an anode-free battery with a seed layer. A seed layer
is a comparable thin layer deposited between the anodic current collector
and the solid electrolyte. It provides nucleation sites for lithium
metal growth and can improve battery performance and stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> This direction was notably advanced by Lee et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> at Samsung in 2020. Their research
demonstrated an AFSSB with a silver&#x02013;carbon nanocomposite layer
and a sulfide electrolyte, achieving more than 1000 cycles and an
energy density of more than 900 W h L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. The study
of Feng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> demonstrated the effectiveness
of carbon seed layers in improving the air stability of LLZO when
deposited on a garnet-based electrolyte, thereby reducing the area-specific
resistance of the Li/LLZO interface. Building on this, Futscher et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> explored the use of amorphous carbon
seed layers. These layers facilitated uniform lithium plating, effectively
prevented dendrite formation, and increased the critical current density
to 8 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>.</p><p>Besides carbon interlayers and
mixtures of carbon composites, noble
metals such as platinum and gold seed layers have also been explored.
Studies on platinum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> revealed the effects of lithium
plating and stripping reactions with platinum current collectors on
LiPON, increasing the lithium nucleation number density compared to
copper CC. Microscopic observations provided insights into the interactions
between platinum and lithium. Recent studies of gold seed layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> have shown their role in improving the efficiency and lifetime of
AFSSBs. The work of Krauskopf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> has
investigated the effects of morphological instability of lithium metal
anodes in the presence of gold seed layers. They have shown that the
use of a lithium-alloying gold layer delays the penetration of lithium
metal into the garnet electrolyte and penetration occurs only after
the alloy phases are fully formed. This line of research was further
explored by Kim et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> who demonstrated
effective regulation of lithium distribution on LLZO by modifying
the surface with an interlayer. They proposed that the seed interlayer
serves two main functions during battery operation: it acts as a dynamic
buffer for the redistribution of lithium and as a matrix layer for
facile lithium precipitation.</p><p>This work aims to compare the
impact of different seed layers &#x02014;
gold, platinum, and amorphous carbon &#x02014; on lithium plating and
stripping in a thin-film configuration. The seed layers are placed
between the bare copper CC&#x02014;since the early day being used as
conventional current collectors on the anode side<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup>&#x02014;and the LiPON solid electrolyte. The
resulting configurations were tested in half-cell structures, and
the evolution of the overpotential and the relationship between lithium
plating/stripping, nucleation kinetics, and alloying properties of
each seed layer were analyzed. By comparing different seed layers,
amorphous carbon was found to be a cost-effective alternative to precious
metals, reducing the rise in overpotential by up to 70%.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We fabricated thin-film stacks to
study different seed layer materials
in the following architecture: Cu/seed layer/LiPON/Li/Cu, as shown
in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a, and compared

masks allowed us to evaporate individual areas (1 mm diameter dots)
of the lithium reservoir as separate cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). The LiPON solid electrolyte was chosen
due to its successful track record in facilitating reversible cycling
of lithium in AFSSBs, especially when combined with copper as a current
collector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The amorphous nature of LiPON
isolates the surface morphology and chemistry from other potential
obstacles, such as the presence of grain boundaries&#x02014;a notable
advantage over crystalline electrolytes such as LLZO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> In addition, LiPON&#x02019;s ability to form a thin yet
stable passivation layer with the lithium metal helps reduce lithium
loss during subsequent cycling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Schematic illustration

materials. A 10 nm thick layer of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation.
Platinum and carbon layers were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering
to achieve thicknesses of 10 nm for platinum and 50 nm for carbon.
Initial tests showed that the 10 nm gold layer in our thin film battery
showed superior cycling performance compared to thicker layers (100
nm gold layer, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.3c14693/suppl_file/am3c14693_si_001.pdf">Figures S1</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.3c14693/suppl_file/am3c14693_si_001.pdf">S2</ext-link>). The comparatively poor performance of thicker
films compared with thinner films is due to the longer lithium diffusion
length. This results in greater internal stress during lithium insertion/extraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Amorphous carbon, on the other hand, was previously
shown to perform best at a thickness of 50 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><p>The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c reveal surface
morphologies
that are comparable for all seed layers. All materials exhibit a smooth
texture with an RMS roughness of 2.2 nm &#x000b1; 0.1 nm. There are no
significant morphological differences between the different seed layers.
For a complete overview, see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.3c14693/suppl_file/am3c14693_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link> in
the ESI. Therefore, it is unlikely that the morphological characteristics
of the seed layers have an influence on the lithium plating and stripping
processes. As a result, observed disparities can be attributed to
differences in electrochemical processes and physicochemical properties
such as interfacial energies, alloying energies, and so forth.</p><p>Experiments involving the plating and stripping of a dense lithium
metal layer were conducted. In our study, the terms &#x0201c;plating
and stripping&#x0201d; in the context of thin film anode-free half
cells refer to the process of galvanostatic charging and discharging.
This involves the application of a constant current, which is essential
to manage the plating and stripping of lithium. We set constant current
conditions for a certain duration to obtain a lithium layer of 250
nm or 1 &#x003bc;m depending on the experiment. In addition, we set
potential limits to 1.5 V vs Li/Li<sup>+</sup> to avoid excessive
degradation of the LiPON solid-electrolyte layer.</p><p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a presents
the representative voltage profiles for a bare copper CC and different
seed materials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b&#x02013;d). Lithium metal of 0.2 mA h cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> was
plated, corresponding to a thickness of 1 &#x003bc;m of dense lithium,
using a current density of 0.2 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. Upon application
of current to the bare copper CC, the voltage exhibited a sharp decrease
below 0 V vs Li/Li<sup>+</sup>, reaching a nucleation potential at
&#x02212;225 mV. This pattern, characterized by a rapid voltage drop
followed by a flat voltage plateau at &#x02212;20 mV, aligns with predictions
from the nucleation and growth theory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect

voltage profiles were observed during lithium plating and stripping

mechanisms
with lithium. The gold layer interacts with lithium to form Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>-Au alloy phases and has a specific solubility
range in lithium metal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Thus, lithium
alloys with gold form a saturated phase prior to the formation of
pure lithium metal. Similarly, the platinum layer, with its distinct
solubility properties, provides a range of potential nucleation sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> The lithium metal plating process on gold and
platinum nucleation layers is characterized by two separate potential
plateaus, followed by a potential drop that signals the start of lithium
plating. The plating potential for these processes reaches its minimum
at approximately &#x02212;30 mV. This reduced nucleation potential
is attributed to the identical crystal structures of pure lithium
metal (&#x003b2;-Li) and the solid solution surface layer, which effectively
reduce nucleation barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup></p><p>Lithium
plating in the presence of amorphous carbon seed layers
shows a markedly different voltage profile; it shows a slower decrease
in potential. This voltage decline corresponds to the initial lithiation
of the carbon seed layer, indicating an intercalation behavior similar
to graphite. In fact, amorphous carbon seed layers can host up to
200 mA h g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> between 5 mV and 1 V vs Li/Li<sup>+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The drop is followed by a potential
minimum at &#x02212;55 mV before cells with a carbon seed layer also
reach a constant voltage plateau. Despite these differences, a consistent
observation at low current densities across the materials is the emergence
of a flat voltage plateau at about &#x02212;20 mV.</p><p>Irreversible
capacity loss in the first cycle also varies between
seed materials and is highlighted by the yellow areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). While almost no loss is
observed for the bare copper CC reference, alloying materials such
as gold and platinum show the greatest losses. Gold has the highest
lithium loss with a peak value of 13 &#x003bc;A h cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>, corresponding to 65 nm of dense lithium metal, while platinum has
a loss of about 6 &#x003bc;A h cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. The greater lithium
loss observed in gold during the first cycle could be attributed to
the different reactivities of gold and platinum with lithium. Carbon
shows the lowest irreversible lithium loss of the seed layers of about
4.5 &#x003bc;A h cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> in the first cycle.</p><p>To
better understand the plated lithium morphology, the influence
of various seed layers, and irreversible lithium loss, we conducted
FIB-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis under cryogenic conditions. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> shows cross-sectional

CC. These cracks can be attributed to the nonuniform deposition of
lithium, which exerts mechanical forces on the copper CC, ultimately
leading to its failure. This failure mechanism is a common problem
in thin-film batteries, as investigated in the study of Motoyama et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> The formation of cracks in the copper
CC creates energetically favorable sites for lithium nucleation. This
phenomenon may also explain the observed penetration and deposition
of lithium beneath the copper CC, leading to the development of gaps
between the substrate and the CC. Similar cracks were detected on
several other cells with bare copper CC, from both the same substrate
and different batches. Additional cross-sectional SEM images of these
cracks and various cells are provided in the ESI.</p><p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b&#x02013;d
show cross-sectional micrographs for cells with a seed layer. The
introduction of seeding layers appears to facilitate more uniform
lithium deposition, which in turn reduces the mechanical stress on
the CC as no cracks are observed. The gold seed layer cell contains
brighter particles with sizes on the order of 1 &#x003bc;m within the
plated lithium layer, which are likely Li&#x02013;Au alloy clusters.
Interestingly, the 10 nm thin gold seed layer agglomerates and forms
such clusters instead of remaining in the form of a uniformly thin
alloy layer. Inaoka et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> reported similar
behavior at the Li/Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> interface, where the
gold agglomerates into clusters. The platinum seed layer, which also
forms an alloy with lithium, shows a more uniform distribution of
similar but smaller clusters in the lithium metal layer. In contrast,
the amorphous carbon seed layer maintains its integrity. The lithium
passes through the carbon layer similarly as in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> and facilitates the formation of a dense and
uniform lithium metal layer between the current collector and carbon
interlayer.</p><p>We observed high irreversible lithium losses in
the first cycle
for alloying materials, especially gold and platinum, which may be
related to cluster structures. Initially, gold and platinum seed layers
spread uniformly over the bare copper CC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). However, during plating, these seed layers
agglomerate and form alloy clusters within the lithium layer. We speculate
that only surface lithium is removed, with the remainder &#x0201c;trapped&#x0201d;
inside, possibly explaining the reduced lithium loss in platinum due
to its smaller area/volume ratio. In addition, carbon cells show higher
irreversible capacity loss than our reference copper CC, possibly
related to the formation of a Li-containing interphase (lighter contrast)
seen in FIB-SEM micrographs at the lithium&#x02013;carbon interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup></p><p>To investigate the effect of varying current

the behavior of the reference sample with a bare CC. As the current
density increases, there is a corresponding increase in potential.
It is noteworthy that the half-cells do not exhibit a critical current
density even at an upper limit of 8 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. The
critical current density is the maximum current that a cell can sustain
before it shorts out. This behavior indicates inherent stability even
at high current densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> and demonstrates the robustness
of the thin-film system. The voltage profiles at 1 and 7 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> are shown in the second and third columns of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>. In the copper reference

at &#x02212;750 mV. This plateau is consistent with the growth region
identified in previous research by Pei et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> and this stability is maintained at high current densities.
In particular, the 250 nm lithium plating remains consistent, avoiding

carbon seed layers. These cells, like the bare copper CC cells, do
not reach a short circuit at the applied current density of 8 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> during the plating of 250 nm dense lithium. For all
seed materials tested, the lithiation plateaus are consistently observed
during both the plating and stripping processes, even at higher current
densities of 1 and 7 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. A comparison of the
bare copper CC with other seed layers reveals differences in their
plating and stripping dynamics. The introduction of a thin gold seed
layer improves stability, with its plateau stabilizing at &#x02212;680
mV. This represents a reduction in overpotential of up to 10% at the
highest current density tested, 8 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. In contrast,
the platinum and carbon seed layers establish their voltage plateaus
at &#x02212;520 and &#x02212;490 mV, respectively.</p><p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> provides

increase in the plating overpotential
with increasing current density is observed for all seeds. The bare
copper CC cell shows the steepest increase, reaching a peak overpotential
of 325 mV at a current density of 8 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. The
gold seed layer cell has a slightly lower rise in overpotential, reaching
a maximum of 250 mV, while platinum and carbon have the lowest overpotentials
of less than 100 mV at the highest current density measured.</p><p>The performance of carbon as a seed layer is characterized by a
minimal increase in the plating overpotential at higher current densities,
reflecting stable electrochemical plating and hence less overpotential
evolution. This stability is due to the intact amorphous carbon seed
layer between the current collector and the solid electrolyte&#x02014;as
shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>&#x02014;which
ensures homogeneous plating, optimal current distribution, and minimized
overpotential. It ensures uniform Li-ion diffusion, enhances surface
reaction rates, inhibits lithium filament growth, and improves the
reversibility of lithium plating. Our results show that carbon and
lithium&#x02013;platinum alloys provide better performance in lithium
plating/stripping and overall battery efficiency through overpotential
reduction compared with lithium&#x02013;gold alloys. In addition, the
promising results of two-component interlayers, namely silver/carbon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> and gold/carbon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> confirm these findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>We investigated
anode-free half cells with seed layers comprising
gold, platinum, or amorphous carbon placed between the LiPON solid-state
electrolyte and the bare copper CC. The formation of a dense lithium
metal layer between the copper CC and LiPON, which could be repeatedly
plated and stripped, was demonstrated. All cells withstood current
densities up to 8 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> without short-circuiting,
demonstrating the reliability of the thin-film configuration. Gold
and platinum seed layers alloyed with lithium early in the plating
process, facilitating uniform lithium metal plating on the current
collector. As these layers agglomerate, they form alloy clusters distributed
within the deposited lithium layer, preventing the mechanical failure
of the current collector. The amorphous carbon seed layer maintains
its integrity and is characterized by a uniform, dense lithium metal
layer between the current collector and the seed layer. Platinum and
amorphous carbon cells exhibit the lowest overpotential evolution.
Amorphous carbon has been found to be a viable and cost-effective
alternative to noble metals as a seed layer material.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Experimental Details</title><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Fabrication</title><p>Prior to deposition,

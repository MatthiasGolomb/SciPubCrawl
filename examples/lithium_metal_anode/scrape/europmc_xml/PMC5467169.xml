Here, for water-containing lithium-oxygen batteries with lithium hydroxide products, we find that a hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution added in the electrolyte can effectively promote the decomposition of lithium hydroxide compounds at the ultralow charge potential on a catalyst-free Ketjen Black-based cathode. Furthermore, for non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries with lithium peroxide products, we introduce a urea hydrogen peroxide, chelating hydrogen peroxide without any water in the organic, as an electrolyte additive in lithium-oxygen batteries with a lithium metal anode and succeed in the realization of the low charge potential of &#x0223c;3.26&#x02009;V, which is among the best levels reported. In addition, the undesired water generally accompanying hydrogen peroxide solutions is circumvented to protect the lithium metal anode and ensure good battery cycling stability. Our results should provide illuminating insights into approaches to enhancing lithium-oxygen batteries.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>Reducing the charge potential is of importance to advance the performance of Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries.

Such problems have blocked the realization of practical Li-air batteries.

In this way, charge potentials of &#x0223c;3.5&#x02009;V can be anticipated, but it is difficult to break through this limit. Also of note, the employment of inappropriate catalysts that strongly bind O<sub>2</sub> or the discharge intermediate LiO<sub>2</sub> may result in the undesired shift from Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to Li<sub>2</sub>O as discharge products and further lead to the poor reversibility of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>Recently, Li <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> in our group demonstrated a novel route to achieve the ultralow charge potential of &#x0223c;3.2&#x02009;V in a dimethyl sulfoxide-based electrolyte containing 100&#x02009;p.p.m. of H<sub>2</sub>O by constructing a composite cathode (MnO<sub>2</sub> and Ru particles supported on Super P carbon). The primary electrochemical reactions (the formation of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) during discharge were converted to the formation of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) via the catalysis effect of MnO<sub>2</sub> in the cathode towards the reactions between Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The discharge process was proposed to involve a 2e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> electrochemical reaction and a following chemical reaction. During charge, Ru in the cathode decomposes the LiOH at the low charge potential. Following this idea, in a tetraglyme (G4)-based electrolyte, 4,600&#x02009;p.p.m. of H<sub>2</sub>O was introduced to reduce the charge potential to &#x0223c;3.3&#x02009;V<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and, by integrating a hydrophobic ionic liquid-based electrolytes, Wu <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> realized a synergistic system for Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries in a humid atmosphere (relative humidity of 51&#x00025;) and a charge potential of &#x0223c;3.34&#x02009;V was attained. Although the transformed net electrochemical reactions based on the reversible formation and decomposition of LiOH compounds efficiently improve the charge ability and cycling performance, the introduction of MnO<sub>2</sub> and Ru or RuO<sub>2</sub>, with their heavy molecular weight and high cost, such as the abovementioned carbon-based composite cathodes, is inevitably subject to significantly decreased energy density and increased cost. Moreover, the overly strong catalytic activity of these additional catalysts may lead to parasitic reactions of the electrolyte. In the cases with carbon cathodes containing no catalysts, the charge potentials have been very high, generally above 4.2&#x02009;V, although H<sub>2</sub>O was reported to largely enhance the discharge capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

However, these features were not observed for Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries with common carbon material-based cathodes such as Super P carbon. Furthermore, some discussion challenged the detailed function of LiI and the reversibility of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery with LiOH as the discharge product and suggested that the uncertain mechanism should be further explored<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p><p>In this work, for an H<sub>2</sub>O-containing Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery with LiOH products, we reveal the critical role of an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution added into the electrolyte in assisting the decomposition of LiOH compounds at the ultralow charge potential when using a common Ketjen Black carbon (KB)-based cathode. Most importantly, for non-aqueous Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries with Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> products, a novel electrolyte additive urea hydrogen peroxide that traps H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the H<sub>2</sub>O-free organic is, to the best of our knowledge, first introduced to reduce the charge potential to as low as &#x0223c;3.26&#x02009;V and simultaneously avoid Li metal anode corrosion by H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Low charge potential for decomposing LiOH compounds</title><p>As H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generally exists in aqueous solution (30&#x02009;wt&#x00025;), to study the charge behaviour for decomposing LiOH compounds with or without the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution in the electrolyte, a Li metal anode-protected pouch cell is fabricated to prevent side reactions between the Li metal anode and H<sub>2</sub>O in the electrolyte<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. On the anode side, the Li metal is protected by utilizing a Li ion-conducting glass-ceramic film (LiSICON, Li<sub>2</sub>O-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub>-GeO<sub>2</sub>, Ohara Corporation, Japan), only allowing the transport of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and preventing the penetration of other ions. On the cathode side, a KB-based cathode and a glass fibre infiltrating electrolyte are constructed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref> presents the charge profiles for decomposing solid LiOH compounds on the KB-based cathode in the electrolytes with and without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution. The KB-based cathodes <italic>in situ</italic> loaded with solid LiOH compounds were obtained by first discharging Li-O<sub>2</sub> pouch cells in the dry electrolyte to 1.50&#x02009;mAh (corresponding to &#x0223c;4,000&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub> and 3.5&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,i</xref>), with Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the product being evidenced by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>. Then, the discharged cathodes were extracted in an Ar glove box and left in an Ar atmosphere with a relative humidity of 75&#x00025; for 7 days. The XRD pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> confirms that all the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the discharged cathode was converted to a mixture of LiOH and LiOH&#x000b7;H<sub>2</sub>O. New Li-O<sub>2</sub> pouch cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,ii</xref>) were assembled with these cathodes and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing/free electrolytes to investigate the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the charge performance. In the G4-H<sub>2</sub>O electrolyte, the charge potential increased rapidly to a plateau at &#x0223c;4.16&#x02009;V, corresponding to the overpotential of 1.20&#x02009;V. This high value indicates the difficulty of decomposing LiOH compounds at the KB-based cathode without an efficient catalyst. At the end of the charge process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>,iii), the charge capacity is only &#x0223c;0.6&#x02009;mAh, much lower than the discharged capacity (&#x0223c;1.50&#x02009;mAh). The XRD pattern of the recharged cathode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,iii</xref> illustrates that there are undecomposed LiOH compounds. We rationalize these observations by the poor catalytic activity of KB and the weakening contacts between KB particles and LiOH compound particles during the charging process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In contrast, when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution is introduced into the electrolyte, the charge plateau is greatly decreased to &#x0223c;3.50&#x02009;V and the charge capacity is increased to above 1.40&#x02009;mAh. It should be noted that 3.50&#x02009;V is quite low, considering the large electrochemical impedance of the employed LiSICON film. The low charge overpotential of &#x0223c;0.54&#x02009;V and the high recharge Coulombic efficiency of above 93&#x00025; indicate the exceptional benefit of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte for decomposing LiOH compounds. The disappearance of LiOH compound peaks after recharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,iv</xref>) confirms their full decomposition and good charge reversibility. After charge, the electrolyte exhibits no obvious decomposition and no formation of soluble species, as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>To quantitatively examine the charge process corresponding to the LiOH oxidation in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing electrolyte, we conducted a titration experiment to determine the consumed amount of LiOH at various charge states. The amount of these LiOH compounds (<italic>n</italic><sub>LiOHii</sub>) was quantified by titration following the method of McCloskey <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> When the newly assembled cells were charged to certain capacities (0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 0.85, 1.22 or 1.356&#x02009;mAh), the residual amount of LiOH compounds was titrated and the consumed amount of LiOH compounds could be obtained by subtracting the LiOH compounds at each point from <italic>n</italic><sub>LiOHii</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, at each point during the charge process, the calculated amount of LiOH compounds consumed was almost equal to the theoretical value and the relationship of the consumed amount and the charge capacity is linearly dependent. <italic>In situ</italic> differential quantitative mass spectrometry (DEMS) was performed to examine whether O<sub>2</sub> could be generated from LiOH decomposition at the low charge potential in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>, clear O<sub>2</sub> evolution can be detected at &#x0223c;3.50&#x02009;V during the charge process and there is no evolution of CO<sub>2</sub>. Accordingly, these quantitative results indicate that the oxidation of LiOH compounds dominates in the charge process.</p><p>We also examined the charge performance of commercial LiOH-preloaded KB-based cathodes in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing/free electrolytes. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>. With the aid of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte, the preloaded LiOH in the KB-based cathode is much easier to fully decompose at a low charge potential (&#x0223c;3.61&#x02009;V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) than in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (&#x0003e; 4.40&#x02009;V). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, we present the charge profiles of Li-O<sub>2</sub> pouch cells with dissolved LiOH aqueous solution and dissolved LiOH-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution in the electrolytes. The presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> allows a large reduction of charge overpotentials to 0.55&#x02009;V from 1.50&#x02009;V in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. After charge at high potential in G4-H<sub>2</sub>O-LiOH<sub>(l)</sub> electrolyte, the LiOH peak at &#x0223c;3,680&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in FTIR spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3,iii</xref>) remains, indicating the uncomplete decomposition of liquid LiOH in the electrolyte. In contrast, the LiOH can be fully decomposed after charge at low potential in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing electrolyte, as evidenced by the peak having disappeared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3,iv</xref>). This phenomenon may provide some insights into the improvement of the aqueous Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery by adding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into the aqueous electrolyte; further work will continue to explore this phenomenon. All of these results emphasize that the introduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte can greatly enhance the decomposition ability of either solid LiOH compounds at common carbon cathodes or liquid LiOH in the electrolyte at low potentials during the charge process.</p><p>In view of the superiority of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in improving the charge performance in Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries, the cycling stability is expected to be promoted. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> shows the discharge&#x02013;charge profiles of Li-O<sub>2</sub> pouch cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution in the electrolyte. Pure KB is used as the active material for the cathode and LiSICON film is used to protect the Li metal anode from corrosion by H<sub>2</sub>O. The pouch cells were discharged and charged with a limited specific capacity of 1,000&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub> at 100&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub> and a voltage range of 2.00&#x02013;4.50&#x02009;V. In the ten cycles, the discharge plateaus are at &#x0223c;2.70&#x02009;V and remain nearly unchanged. For the charge profiles, the first plateau is at &#x0223c;3.45&#x02009;V and the charge-specific capacity can reach 1,000&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub> with a terminal charge potential of &#x0003c;4.00&#x02009;V at the end of charge process, indicating the strong charge ability and reversibility. In the initial five cycles, the low charge plateaus remain and the terminal charge potentials show no notable increase. Until the sixth cycle, the charge plateau increases to &#x0223c;3.65&#x02009;V and the terminal potential reaches the limitation of 4.50&#x02009;V in addition to the charge-specific capacity decreasing to 950&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub>. After ten cycles, the charge profile shows a large increment (to &#x0223c;4.00&#x02009;V) of the plateau and poor reversibility (charge capacity of only 800&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub>). Electrochemical impedance analysis was performed before and after the cycles to determine the cause of the fading cycling stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The first arcs in the high-frequency region corresponding to the interphase impedance are almost constant before and after ten cycles. However, the second arc in the middle-frequency region corresponding to the charge transfer notably changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The large increase from 2.5&#x02009;k&#x003a9; in the first cycle to 3.6&#x02009;k&#x003a9; after the ten cycles is responsible for the difficulty of the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transfer through the LiSICON film and the resulting poor cycling performance. These results imply that adopting the LiSICON film to overcome the H<sub>2</sub>O addition accompanying the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution in the Li-O<sub>2</sub> pouch cell is inadvisable in terms of realizing long cycle life and alternative strategies should be sought to exploit the merits of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for enhancing the performance of Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Organic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compound introduction</title><p>In the general battery configuration with a KB-based cathode/glass fibre separator infiltrating electrolyte/Li metal anode structure, if the normal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution is introduced in the electrolyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), the concomitant H<sub>2</sub>O will inevitably attack the Li metal anode, causing battery death and possible safety issues.

This value is comparable to the levels of commercial electrolytes for Li ion batteries and indicates the high Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> conductivity. In the electrolyte containing UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the rate performances of Li-O<sub>2</sub> cells were evaluated at current densities of 100, 250, 500 and 1,000&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub>; the results are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>. At 100&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub>, the charge plateau is at &#x0223c;3.26&#x02009;V, corresponding to the much lower overpotential of 0.30&#x02009;V, which is among the lowest values reported. Even at the high current density of 1,000&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub>, the charge plateau is only &#x0223c;3.44&#x02009;V, suggesting the excellent rate capability. With regard to the Li metal anode, no LiOH was detected on the surface of the Li metal anode after cycling, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The silvery grey colour in the photo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> confirms the Li metal anode to be intact, in sharp contrast with the almost damaged Li metal anode (photo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In addition, from the storage experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), the steady open circuit voltage trends after a discharge process or one discharge&#x02013;charge cycle indicate the solid stability of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cells with the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte. The results verify that employing the organic UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an electrolyte additive is an accessible way to ensure the attractive charge performance of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell and achieve high stability of the Li metal anode, along with maintaining reliable safety.</p><p>The discharge products on the cathode of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell in the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte were analysed by XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref> summarizes the XRD patterns of pristine, discharged and recharged cathodes. The discharge products are determined to be Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. After recharge, the diffraction peaks of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> disappear, implying its full decomposition. The typical toroid morphology of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> after discharge can be directly observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>. After the cell is recharged, the particles are completely decomposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This is in good agreement with the XRD results.</p><p>As the reactions during discharge and charge in the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell are complex multiphase processes, it is necessary to confirm whether the low charge potential in the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell with the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte resulted from the improved charge ability or the unexpected side reactions. Therefore, we conducted <italic>in situ</italic> DEMS measurement to monitor the O<sub>2</sub> evolution during charge and titration experiments, to quantitatively analyse the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation and consumption during discharge and charge in the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell with the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte. The corresponding data are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>. After discharging the cell to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5&#x02009;mAh at 0.05&#x02009;mA, the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation was quantified by a titration method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). The yields of the formed Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (the amount of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> titrated divided by the amount of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> expected given the coulometry) held at &#x0223c;91&#x00025;. This value is similar to the yield reported by McCloskey <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and indicates some slight side reactions, possibly corresponding to inevitable electrolyte decomposition. The value of e<sup>-</sup>/Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be estimated to be 2.15, close to the theoretical value of 2. The gas evolution rates of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> upon charge are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>. O<sub>2</sub> evolution was detected from the beginning and continued along the charge potential of &#x0223c;3.3&#x02009;V during the whole charge process. No evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> was detected. The amounts of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed during charge were analysed by titration measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation follows an &#x0223c;2.14e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process during the whole charge process. This value approaches the ideal value of 2 and clearly demonstrates that the significant reduction of charge overpotential due to the UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> additive in the electrolyte can prohibit the high charge potential-induced side reaction and that the introduction of UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can improve the charge performance. The DEMS and titration results suggest that the charge reactions are dominated by the evolution of O<sub>2</sub> and the consumption of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, the high rechargeability of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell with the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte can be affirmed.</p><p>A comparison of the discharge&#x02013;charge profiles of Li-O<sub>2</sub> cells in the electrolytes with and without UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>, respectively, confirms the critical role of UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in ameliorating the insufficient oxygen evolution reaction catalysis ability when adopting pure KB carbon as the air cathode. At 500&#x02009;mA&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub>, the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell based on the KB cathode in the UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-free electrolyte shows a charge potential as high as &#x0223c;4.30&#x02009;V. This high value can result in the decomposition of electrolyte and the short cycle life of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell. After &#x0223c;20 cycles, the charge-specific capacity cannot recover to 1,000&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub> with a decreased Coulombic efficiency of &#x0223c;70&#x00025;. With respect to the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte, the cycling performance of Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,c</xref>. The electrolyte stability was evaluated through FTIR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Compared with the pristine G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte (iii), there is nearly no change in the FTIR spectra of the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolytes after discharge (iv) and charge (v), indicating no obvious decomposition of the electrolyte. After 50 cycles, the discharge profiles with plateaus at &#x0223c;2.68&#x02009;V show almost no change, indicating good stability. The charge profiles present low plateaus at &#x0223c;3.33&#x02009;V in the initial cycles, with a slight increment after 50 cycles. All of the 50 charge-specific capacities can achieve 1,000&#x02009;mAh&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sub>KB</sub> with a Coulombic efficiency of 100&#x00025;, implying excellent reversibility. The terminal charge potentials are restricted below &#x0223c;4.20&#x02009;V. The improved cycling stability is attributed to this developed electrolyte additive UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Considering the efficient assistance of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for decomposing the preloaded LiOH in the KB-based cathode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is also expected to solve the high charge potential for decomposing the preloaded commercial Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It is an essential prerequisite for constructing Li metal-free Li ion-O<sub>2</sub> batteries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> presents the first charge profiles of Li-O<sub>2</sub> cells with commercial Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-preloaded cathodes. In the electrolyte without any additive, a high potential peak slope at &#x0223c;4.32&#x02009;V, possibly arising from a thin surface coating of sparse LiOH or other impurities on the commercial Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> particles, must first be overcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. After that, the remaining part of the charge of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is performed at the high potential of &#x0223c;3.95&#x02009;V. In the G4-UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrolyte; however, the charge barrier is circumvented well and the charge potential shifts to the low value of &#x0223c;3.48&#x02009;V. After full charge, there is no Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> remaining in the cathode, evidenced from the disappearance of the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> diffraction peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) and the disappearance of the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> particles on the cathode as observed by SEM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Accordingly, the important role of UH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in assisting the preloaded Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition is verified.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>For an H<sub>2</sub>O-containing Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery based on LiOH compounds as products, we developed an accessible route of introducing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution in the electrolyte to realize a large reduction of charge potential (from &#x0223c;4.16&#x02009;V to &#x0223c;3.50&#x02009;V). The crucial role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was confirmed to greatly assist the decomposition of either solid LiOH compounds at the cathode or liquid LiOH in the electrolyte. Certain factors may be implicated in improving the charge ability in the aqueous Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery. Most importantly, for a non-aqueous Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery with Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> products, we first proposed an organic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compound (urea hydrogen peroxide) without any H<sub>2</sub>O as the electrolyte additive to significantly decrease the charge potential (to &#x0223c;3.26&#x02009;V, among the best reported) and moreover to circumvent the problem of undesired H<sub>2</sub>O corrosion of the Li metal anode. Avoiding the damage to the Li metal anode ensured the enhancement of the cycling performance and the safety of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery. With the aid of the novel additive, the preloaded Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> becomes easier to decompose, which aids the potential development of Li metal-free Li ion O<sub>2</sub> batteries. It should be emphasized that high performance is realized at the carbon-based cathode without any additional catalysts. Although much additional work should be conducted to understand the detailed mechanisms, these results are believed to contribute to the development of pure carbon-based cathodes for Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries, enabling the benefits of superior electron conductivity, high energy density and low cost, and should trigger further efforts to exploring other possible peroxides in addition to pointing to broader design principles for electrolytes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cathode preparation</title><p>KB carbon was used as the cathode material.

However, dendrite formation and low coulombic efficiency during cycling greatly hindered its practical applications. The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal anode (LMA) holds the key to resolving these problems. A lot of techniques such as electrolyte modification, electrolyte additive introduction, and artificial SEI layer coating have been developed to form a stable SEI with capability to facilitate fast Li<sup>+</sup> transportation and to suppress Li dendrite formation and undesired side reactions. It is well accepted that the chemical and physical properties of the SEI on the LMA are closely related to the kinetics of Li<sup>+</sup> transport across the electrolyte&#x02013;electrode interface and Li deposition behavior, which in turn affect the overall performance of the cell. Unfortunately, the chemical and structural complexity of the SEI makes it the least understood component of the battery cell. Recently various advanced <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ex situ</italic> characterization techniques have been developed to study the SEI and the results are quite interesting. Therefore, an overview about these new findings and development of SEI engineering and characterization is quite valuable to the battery research community. In this perspective, different strategies of SEI engineering are summarized, including electrolyte modification, electrolyte additive application, and artificial SEI construction. In addition, various advanced characterization techniques for investigating the SEI formation mechanism are discussed, including <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> visualization of the lithium deposition behavior, the quantification of inactive lithium, and using X-rays, neutrons and electrons as probing beams for both imaging and spectroscopy techniques with typical examples.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Different strategies of SEI engineering such as modification, additive application, and artificial SEI for electrolyte are summarized.

The insoluble electrolyte decomposition products are deposited on the Li anode, forming a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). If the as-formed SEI is unstable during lithium plating/stripping, fresh Li will be exposed to the electrolyte and undesired side reactions will occur continuously, resulting in low coulombic efficiency (CE), short cycling life and lithium dendrite formation of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) and severely limited practical applications of LMBs. Therefore, designing a highly stable passivating SEI is critical in preventing the continuous side reactions between the LMA and electrolyte, regulating Li ion flux, and suppressing lithium dendrite formation.<sup><xref rid="cit2" ref-type="bibr">2,3</xref></sup> In LMBs, an ideal SEI should be electronically insulating and ionically conducting with good chemical/electrochemical stability to sustain long-term cyclability. In addition, mechanical properties, including the shear modulus and flexibility of the SEI, also play critical roles as well. To optimize the SEI properties, major efforts have been made through electrolyte engineering due to its low cost and high effectiveness. Electrolyte engineering not only involves the solvent, salt and additive selection, but also the solvation structure manipulation by controlling electrolyte concentration.<sup><xref rid="cit4" ref-type="bibr">4,5</xref></sup> Another approach is by coating artificial SEIs to obtain a controllable composition and structure.<sup><xref rid="cit6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In recent decades, numerous achievements have been made regarding SEI engineering and the LMB electrochemical performance.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> At same time, continued efforts have been made for the fundamental understanding of this significant component, SEI. Since the first SEI model proposed by Peled<sup><xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> in 1979, more models including the multilayer model, mosaic model and plum pudding model have been proposed and extensively investigated.<sup><xref rid="cit3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, many experimental observations could not be well explained by just a single model. Besides, the correlation between SEI composition, the structure and its passivation properties could not be fully understood yet. Therefore, research groups have been developing new advanced characterization techniques to study the composition and structure of the SEI.</p><p>In this perspective, SEI improvement methods including electrolyte engineering and artificial SEI construction are discussed first. The progress of advanced characterization techniques and their applications in understanding the formation and function mechanism of the SEI are discussed in the following section. Recent progress in employing synchrotron X-ray, neutron, cryo-electron microscopy (EM), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and tomography techniques to study the SEI components and 3D morphology of lithium deposition are highlighted. In addition, new techniques for the quantification of inactive &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; lithium and its contribution to the coulombic efficiency loss using titration gas analysis (TGA) and <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> X-ray diffraction techniques are discussed. At the end, prospects regarding future research on interphase engineering methods and advanced non-invasive characterization techniques are presented. We hope that this perspective could provide in-depth insights to the battery community and inspirations for future LMB development.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>SEI engineering</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Electrolyte engineering</title><p>To enable the stable cycling of the highly active LMA, research groups focus on SEI engineering by changing electrolyte formulations. Typical carbonate solvents used for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) (such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)) are highly reactive with Li metal, resulting in low coulombic efficiency (CE), Li dendrite formation and battery failure. Therefore, most of the reported electrolytes for the LMA today use ether as the solvent (1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)), which is more compatible with Li metal. The widely used solvent DOL was reported to be able to form a stable polymerized surface inhibiting lithium dendrite growth.<sup><xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, the poor oxidation stability of ether solvents limits their applications when coupled with high voltage cathodes (transition metal oxides). Therefore, different electrolyte modification strategies have been developed to improve the LMB performance.</p><sec><label>2.1.1</label><title>High concentration electrolytes (HCEs)</title><p>To maximize the ionic conductivity of LIB electrolytes, most of the commercial electrolytes have been using salt concentration around 1 M for decades. Ogumi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> presented improved LMA performance in a highly concentrated LiTFSI/PC-based electrolyte and suggested that the deposition/dissolution behavior of lithium depends on the electrolyte concentration. Dendritic lithium growth was considerably suppressed and a thinner SEI was formed when the concentration of LiTFSI increased to 3.27 M. Yamada's group also made a lot of contribution to the development of HCEs for LIBs.<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11,12</xref></sup> They demonstrated ultrafast-charging capability of LIBs in 4.5 M LiFSA/AN and confirmed that such an improved performance should be attributed to the unique solvation structure of the super-concentrated electrolyte. The localized LUMOs at the TFSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions suggest that it is mainly through the reduction of TFSA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions, rather than AN solvents, a stable SEI film was formed on a graphite anode. Recently, the application of HCEs has been reported as a very effective approach for the performance improvement of LMBs. When the salt concentration is increased, the content of free solvent molecules decreases, and the solvation structure changes, resulting in more contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>.<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The change of the solvation structure affects electrolyte redox behaviors. The CIP and AGG structures shifted the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) from solvent towards salt, resulting in a stable inorganic species (LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub><italic toggle="yes">x</italic></sub>)-rich SEI derived from the decomposition of salt anions. LiF is believed to be a critical SEI component for passivating Li metal because of its high bulk modulus (70 GPa), wide bandgap and high interfacial energy to lithium metal.<sup><xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therefore, the LiF-rich SEI formed in HCEs enables stable cycling of LMBs even when carbonate and sulfonate based electrolytes were used, which are considered highly unstable with LMAs.<sup><xref rid="cit14" ref-type="bibr">14,15</xref></sup> HCEs could also be used to further improve the lithium metal passivation of ether electrolytes. For example, Zhang's group<sup><xref rid="cit1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> reported that when an electrolyte of 4 M LiFSI in DME was used, a high CE of up to 99.1% without dendrite growth in a Li&#x02016;Cu cell was achieved, and a long cycling life (&#x0003e;6000 cycles at 10 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) was obtained using the Li&#x02016;Li symmetric cell as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, demonstrating excellent lithium metal protection by the FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion derived SEI. Moreover, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of HCEs is also shifted to a lower value, making the electrolyte more oxidative resistant. Xu and co-workers<sup><xref rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> tested high voltage (&#x0003e;4.3 V) LMBs (Li&#x02016;NMC) using a HCE (4 M LiFSI in DME) electrolyte. A unique LiF-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) was formed to enable stable cycling of Li&#x02016;NMC batteries up to 4.5 V with high CE demonstrating the effect of the HCE on stabilizing the highly reactive NMC811 cathode surface at high voltages.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>(a) Electrolyte solvation structures of state-of-the-art (SOA) electrolytes, high concentration electrolytes (HCEs) and localized high concentration electrolytes (LHCEs).

Therefore, low viscosity and low dielectric constant co-solvent, co-called &#x0201c;diluent&#x0201d;, is added into HCEs to form LHCEs. Generally, hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), such as 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE), bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (BTFE) and tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)orthoformate (TFEO), are used as diluents for LHCEs. The LHCE preserves the HCE solvation structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and inherits the advantages of the HCE, while brings about better wettability and ionic conductivity at the same time. Xu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> compared the electrochemical performances of Li&#x02016;NMC811 cells using a HCE (LiFSI&#x02013;1.2DME (molar ratio)) and LHCE (LiFSI&#x02013;1.2DME&#x02013;3TTE (molar ratio)). In a cell of Li&#x02016;NMC811 using LiFSI&#x02013;1.2DME&#x02013;3TTE (LHCE), over 87% of its initial capacity after 250 cycles at a high cutoff voltage of 4.5 V was achieved, in comparison to the 76% retention using LiFSI&#x02013;1.2DME (HCE). This significantly improved cycling performance was ascribed to the excellent Li metal protection so that a more uniform and integrated surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) was observed on the Li anode after cycling in Li&#x02016;NMC811 for 300 cycles. Furthermore, better cathode protection was demonstrated in the LHCE as presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, and a higher crystallinity and thinner CEI on NMC811 particles was generated when using the LHCE. In addition, the utilization of the LHCE can also extend LMB operating temperature to a wider range. Wang's group used a non-polar HFE as a diluent in a fully fluorinated electrolyte, and the as-formed LHCE enabled the stable operation of a Li&#x02016;LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.15</sub>Al<sub>0.05</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCA) cell even at &#x02212;85 &#x000b0;C and delivered &#x0223c;50% of its room temperature capacity.<sup><xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Although an anion derived interphase is the key to LHCEs, using different solvents, diluents and solvent/diluent ratios greatly affects the SEI/CEI formed and overall electrochemical performance. Zhang's group systematically studied the solvation structures and electronic structures using theoretical methods as well as experimental interphase characterization techniques, demonstrating the importance of solvent and diluents and their synergetic effects with the salt and the solvating solvent in designing LHCEs.<sup><xref rid="cit19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.1.3</label><title>Fluorinated solvents and electrolytes</title><p>Apart from using HCEs/LHCEs, it's identified that solvent fluorination is another effective approach to improve oxidation stability<sup><xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and form a LiF-rich SEI.<sup><xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Carbonates and esters have high oxidation stability than ethers but suffer from instability with Li metal. So fluorinated carbonates, such as FEMC and FEC, were widely used as co-solvents for high voltage LMBs. Similarly, fluorinated esters were investigated as well. Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> studied the electrochemical performance using 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in methyl propionate (MP), and in its fluorinated counterpart, methyl 3,3,3-trifluoropionate (MTFP). To investigate the Li metal protection, Li&#x02016;Cu cells were tested, and the CE of the MTFP electrolyte was surprisingly high, 97.6%, close to that of DOL/DME electrolytes, while the CE of the MP electrolyte was only 6.2%. This huge difference was ascribed to the great protection provided by the LiF-rich SEI formed in the MTFP electrolyte. The MTFP electrolyte also showed excellent electrochemical performance cycling in a Li&#x02016;NMC811 cell (2.8&#x02013;4.5 V) as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, which had a capacity retention of 80% after 250 cycles at C/2, revealing that fluorination not only enhanced the carbonate/ester combability with lithium metal but also improved the oxidation stability or the CEI properties.

Therefore, dimethylsulfamoyl fluoride (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) was utilized as an electrolyte solvent by Li's group.<sup><xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Coupled with 2.5 M LiFSI and 0.2 M LiPF<sub>6</sub>, the &#x0201c;full fluorosulfonyl&#x0201d; electrolyte (FFS) provided surprisingly good protection of Li metal, yielded compact and flat Li deposition, and high stability on the cathode side, and thus the Li (60 &#x003bc;m thick)&#x02016;NMC622 cell retained 89% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles.</p><p>As mentioned before, ethers (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, DME) are compatible with LMAs but have low oxidation stability. HFEs have extended the electrochemical stability window but suffer from low salt solubility. To combine the merits, Bao's group synthesized a new compound, fluorinated 1,4-dimethoxylbutane (FDMB), which combined the ether group and &#x02013;CF<sub>2</sub>&#x02013; segment to be able to solvate Li<sup>+</sup> ions and form a stable SEI/CEI on LMA/cathodes (high voltage) at the same time.<sup><xref rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> A unique Li&#x02013;F interaction was observed in the FDMB electrolyte, which further leads to a FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> rich Li<sup>+</sup> solvation sheath, thereby generating a LiF-rich interphase and inhibiting Al corrosion by FSI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. Therefore, Li&#x02016;Cu cells using 1 M LiFSI in the FDMB electrolyte reached a very high CE of 99.52%, and it can be stably cycled inside Li&#x02016;NMC batteries for 420 cycles with 90% capacity retention. This excellent electrochemical behavior indicated that the covalently bonding of ether and fluorinated segments can effectively combine the merits of both of them into one single molecule, providing a new way for solvent molecule design.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Additives</title><p>To develop stable LMBs, another efficient approach is using additives to engineer electrolyte/electrode interphase formation for lithium dendrite suppression and CE improvement. Conventional electrolyte additives for LIBs such as vinylene carbonate (VC) can be used to protect LMAs as well. Yamaki's group demonstrated that the gel-like surface composed of polymeric VC reduction products can prevent the side reactions between lithium metal and electrolytes.<sup><xref rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Another extensively used additive is fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> added 5% FEC into a conventional carbonate electrolyte. Because of the lower LUMO energy of FEC, the resulting FEC-induced LiF-rich SEI prevented the reactions between carbonates and Li metal, forming uniform deposited lithium metal and improving coulombic efficiency to 98% in Li&#x02016;Cu cell as presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. Similarly, other organic additives used in LIBs such as tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphate (TTSP), prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone (PES), methylene methanedisulfonate (MMDS), and ethylene sulfate (DTD, also with the IUPAC name: 1,3,2-dioxathiolane 2,2-dioxide), were also investigated for Li metal protection.<sup><xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Inorganic species, for example, alkaline metal cations, were reported as additives for regulating Li metal deposition. In 2013, Xu, Zhang and co-workers proposed that alkaline ions (Cs<sup>+</sup> or Rb<sup>+</sup>) can be used as additives for suppressing lithium dendrite growth through a self-healing electrostatic shield (SHES) mechanism.<sup><xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> These cations have a lower reduction potential compared to Li<sup>+</sup>. During the lithium deposition process, the Cs<sup>+</sup> accumulated around the deposited Li dendrites and formed a positively charged electrostatic shield around growing Li dendrites, repelling incoming Li<sup>+</sup> and forcing deposited lithium to adjacent regions. Therefore, a self-smoothed film can be formed and the lithium dendrite formation can be suppressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>(a) CE at a current density of 0.10 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> with a capacity of 0.5 mA h cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

The synergistic effects of these two additives with lithium metal lead to the formation of a uniform SEI layer. Therefore, the Li&#x02016;Cu cell using an electrolyte containing both 0.18 M Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> and 5 wt% LiNO<sub>3</sub> maintains a high average coulombic efficiency (99.1%) from 100 to 400 cycles at a deposition current density of 1 mA cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

It is concluded that LiNO<sub>3</sub> may facilitate the formation of a protective SEI and slow down the dendrite formation. However, the inhomogeneous dendrite growth indicates that such a SEI film is not uniform and LiNO<sub>3</sub> alone is not effective enough to protect the lithium anode surface for long-term cycling. It was also reported that the Li dendrites could be chemically etched with a lithium polysulfide additive, leading to a smooth anode surface. <italic toggle="yes">In situ</italic> scanning TEM (STEM) was also used to study the formation, growth, and failure of a SEI at a high C rate (&#x0223c;34C) using a lithium ion microcell as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>.<sup><xref rid="cit60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> It was observed that a typical bilayer structure (inner inorganic layer and outer organic layer) SEI was formed.

During the discharge process, the rapid dissolution of an inorganic SEI layer after the SEI crack formation results in the delamination of the entire SEI film from the electrode.

In addition, sample transfer could easily introduce contamination since both Li metal and the interphase are extremely chemically reactive. Therefore, cryo-TEM developed for structural biology was introduced for studying the Li metal deposition and interphase structures of LMBs with atomic level resolution. By coupling cryogenic sample transfer and measurement, the morphology and chemical information can be well preserved. Cui's group successfully observed single crystalline Li dendrites with different growing directions well-preserved under cryogenic conditions.<sup><xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Also, the SEI structure was studied. A mosaic layer formed in a conventional carbonate electrolyte was observed, while a more ordered multilayer SEI was obtained in the presence of a FEC additive.

Besides the nanoscale morphology observation, composition characterization by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) makes cryo-TEM even more powerful.

Particularly, the &#x0201c;type II&#x0201d; dendrite is mainly composed of LiH instead of Li metal. This brittle LiH was easily disconnected from the electrode and became &#x0201c;dead Li&#x0201d;, disproportionally contributing to capacity fading. In addition, they proposed that the fluorinated electrolyte system has excellent Li metal passivation because of not only LiF formation, but also LiH dendrite deficiency due to limited hydrogen in the electrolyte. Following the successful demonstration of cryo-TEM for Li metal and SEI characterization, it's widely used for studying the interphase formed under different conditions, including different current densities,<sup><xref rid="cit65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> high/low operation temperature,<sup><xref rid="cit66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> and with/without additives.<sup><xref rid="cit67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Cryo-TEM has also been applied for investigating cathode electrolyte interphase (CEIs),<sup><xref rid="cit68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> solid-state electrolytes,<sup><xref rid="cit69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> and Na metal SEIs.<sup><xref rid="cit70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Although the interphase is highly complicated and dynamic during electrochemical cycling, the morphology and composition information obtained from cryo-TEM can give researchers atomic scale understanding of the metal anode and its interaction with the electrolyte during cycling.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)</title><p>As a non-destructive and quantitative method, NMR plays a critical role in LMB interphase characterization taking advantage of its solid/solution and <italic toggle="yes">ex situ</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> capabilities. Multinuclear NMR methods provide valuable compositional information of the interphase. For example, by using 1D and 2D solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>7</sup>Li), Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> demonstrated that lithium ethylene mono-carbonate (LEMC) might be more likely the major SEI component for Li ion batteries using EC/DMC electrolytes rather than the widely accepted lithium ethylene di-carbonate (LEDC) reported in the literature. This LEMC benefits the Li<sup>+</sup> transportation inside the SEI because of its high ionic conductivity (&#x0003e;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Recently, another study from Yang's group identified the existence of NaH inside a SEI that was collected from Na&#x02016;Cu cells after 50 cycles by using <italic toggle="yes">ex situ</italic><sup>23</sup>Na NMR.<sup><xref rid="cit72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> NaH and NaF passivated the Na metal and prevented further decomposition of the electrolyte due to their low electronic conductivity. Besides the insightful information of interphase composition provided by NMR, there are also reports using NMR to analyze the composition of electrolytes. In a specially designed <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> cell, electrolyte composition changes were monitored using NMR to study the electrolyte degradation during the electrochemical process.<sup><xref rid="cit73" ref-type="bibr">73,74</xref></sup> NMR was also utilized to analyze the collected electrolytes from cycled cells. Weber <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> demonstrated that the LiDFOB salt was consumed inside dual-salt electrolytes to form a SEI, stabilizing Li metal and achieving better electrochemical performance. Another significant aspect of NMR characterization is using solid state <sup>7</sup>Li NMR to distinguish microstructured Li at the surface from the bulk. Because of the skin-depth effect, a radiofrequency field can only penetrate a limited depth (14.7 &#x003bc;m using a 4.7 T magnet) of Li, and microstructures on the surface can be detected. In general, bulk Li metal resonates at 240&#x02013;250 ppm, while microstructure Li at the surface is at 260&#x02013;270 ppm. Meanwhile, Li<sup>+</sup> in the electrolyte and Li<sup>+</sup> trapping inside the SEI is at &#x0223c;0 ppm. Therefore, Li in different environments can be easily detected by <sup>7</sup>Li NMR. Using NMR to observe bulk Li and microstructure surface Li was first reported by Grey's group, and they used <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> solid state <sup>7</sup>Li NMR to monitor the Li microstructure plating and stripping inside Li symmetric cells using different ionic liquid electrolytes.<sup><xref rid="cit71" ref-type="bibr">71,76</xref></sup> Following this, the impacts of the electrolyte additive, pressure, and separator in Li microstructure development were also studied by <sup>7</sup>Li NMR.<sup><xref rid="cit77" ref-type="bibr">77,78</xref></sup> In addition, according to recent results, the microstructure morphology has an impact on NMR chemical shift as well. <italic toggle="yes">In situ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ex situ</italic><sup>7</sup>Li NMR were utilized to perform quantitative Li loss analysis by Hsieh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></sup> In <sup>7</sup>Li-NMR, signals for lithium ions within both the liquid electrolyte and the SEI appear at chemical shifts around 0 ppm, while metallic lithium due to Knight shifts has a higher <sup>7</sup>Li-NMR chemical shift at about 250 ppm. Lithium deposits with mossy or dendritic morphologies different from (&#x02018;smooth&#x02019;) bulk lithium and varying orientations with respect to the external magnetic field due to bulk magnetic susceptibility have higher chemical shifts in the range of 260&#x02013;300 ppm. However, <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic><sup>7</sup>Li NMR could not capture all individual lithium fractions, underestimating the actual amounts of active but also dead or SEI Li fractions. To fully elucidate all individual contributions to the overall lithium deposits and their resulting <sup>7</sup>Li NMR chemical shifts, an <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> cell was disassembled after the full stripping step, separating both the lithium and copper electrodes in a glove box, which were subsequently placed into pouch-type bags for complementary <italic toggle="yes">ex situ</italic> NMR measurements to determine the actual amounts of active lithium.

Synchrotron X-ray based techniques are powerful tools to study the SEI formation mechanism on LMAs due to the high flux and brilliance with a wide spectrum of X-ray beams which enables a variety of characterization capabilities including structural analysis, identification of newly formed phases and functional groups as well as determining the valence states of related elements. In recent years, synchrotron X-ray absorption, diffraction, and imaging techniques show unique capability in revealing the fundamental mechanism of SEIs and the stabilization effect of novel electrolytes, additives, and artificial SEIs.</p><p>X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a versatile technique that can provide information on the oxidation state and coordination environment of certain elements in crystalline and amorphous states. Taking advantage of the XAS technique which has high elemental selectivity, complicated SEIs can be studied by analyzing the chemical environment of different elements. Typically, SEIs contain inorganic components, such as Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>O, Li<sub>3</sub>N, and LiOH and organic species. Therefore, soft XAS (SXAS) using incident photon energy less than 2 KeV is a good choice to study the composition of SEIs, which are mainly made of light elements. In addition, total electron yield (TEY) and fluorescence yield (FY) modes can provide surface and bulk SEI information, respectively. A successful example of SEI study using XAS was presented by Sun's group.<sup><xref rid="cit82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup> Using energy dependent X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, the inhomogeneous chemical composition of the SEI is visualized for cells cycled at different temperatures in carbonate electrolytes and is further coupled with micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (micro-XANES) to provide information on SEI components present on the surface and at depth. XRF mapping is a chemically selective imaging technique for mapping the distribution of different chemical species. The incident energy used for collecting XRF images is tuned to the &#x0201c;fingerprint&#x0201d; spectral features in XANES. By controlling the energy of incident photons, the XRF mapping of different chemical species containing certain elements can be achieved. The normalized intensity of each spot in the XRF image then provides the relative concentration of that component at different parts of the electrode. XRF mappings at energies of 691.3 and 694.0 eV were presented in this work, which are associated with energies below and at the peak of the F 1s &#x02192; unoccupied 2p state white line transition of LiF, respectively, with the results shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. By analyzing F K-edge XAS and XRF mappings as well as O K-edge XAS, they directly visualized local variation in SEI formation, which cannot be achieved by the XPS technique since XPS can only provide average chemical information over a large area. Their result showed that the LiF formation in the SEI is inhomogeneously dispersed throughout the surface on the LMA cycled at 0 &#x000b0;C, with isolated regions having different bulk SEI species. For the LMA cycled at 25 &#x000b0;C and 60 &#x000b0;C, the spatial distribution of F species is more uniform across the entire surface, but still has certain differences in the chemical composition of the near surface region and bulk. Moreover, O K-edge XAS revealed that Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is a major inorganic component of the bulk SEI and the ratio of carbonate to other organic species differs depending on the operating temperature. XRF mapping using a tender energy X-ray source was also applied to the Li-sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) system to study the crosstalk of polysulfides and the additive effect on the Li deposition morphology of the LMA.<sup><xref rid="cit83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref></sup> XRF mapping not only showed the distribution of S contained SEI species but also exhibited the morphology of lithium metal underneath it.

However, the identification and quantification of the SEI using XRD face great challenges due to there being extremely small sample amounts and possible radiation damage as well as the complex nature of the SEI. Quantitatively studies of the composition of SEI on LMAs were reported by Shadike <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup> SEI samples collected from LMAs cycled in different electrolytes were studied by synchrotron based XRD. In addition to the detection of several well-known components in the SEI, such as Li metal, Li<sub>2</sub>O and LiOH (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), several important new findings were obtained by analyzing XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement results. Firstly, the Rietveld refinement result and <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> air exposure experiment of the SEI sample provided solid evidence for the existence of LiH as an important component in the SEI, which has been debated by research groups in recent years. LiH has the same crystal structure as LiF but slightly different lattice parameters making the differentiation of LiH from LiF quite difficult. The decomposition of LiH with moisture captured during <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> air exposure XRD clearly distinguished it from moisture stable LiF. Secondly, SEI-LiF was discovered to have nanocrystalline features with a grain size of around 3 nm, which is different from the regular bulk LiF with a much larger grain size. In addition, SEI-LiF has a larger lattice parameter than typical LiF, suggesting the possible formation of LiH<sub><italic toggle="yes">x</italic></sub>F<sub>1&#x02212;<italic toggle="yes">x</italic></sub> solid solution. These results give a good answer to the question of why LiF can play a critical role in the formation of a good SEI while the regular bulk LiF is an ionic insulator: the nanocrystalline form and the larger lattice parameter both favor Li ion transport. Quantitative analysis revealed that SEI-LiF is in high abundance in SEI samples collected from high concentration electrolytes, in which fluorine-containing anions in the solvation sheath provide a fluorine source to form SEI-LiF and result in a high coulombic efficiency compared with low concentration electrolytes. These results demonstrated that the XRD technique is a powerful tool to identify new phases in the SEI and analyze its components quantitatively. However, XRD is suitable to study samples in crystalline phases but not those in amorphous phases, which are also the major components of the SEI. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis is another advanced X-ray (or neutron) technique for SEI characterization. In PDF measurement, total scattering signals including both Bragg scattering and diffuse scattering are collected to provide atomic correlations regardless of the phase form (crystalline or amorphous).<sup><xref rid="cit85" ref-type="bibr">85,86</xref></sup> By utilizing this unique capability of the PDF technique, Shadike <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup> further examined SEI components collected in different electrolytes with low and high concentrations.

More recently, Pan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref></sup> employed micrometer-resolution X-ray computed tomography (XCT) with a low incident energy and a high-brightness liquid&#x02013;metal&#x02013;jet X-ray source to get good imaging contrast for Li plating. In their experimental set-up, the brightness of the X-ray source is approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of conventional microfocus Lab X-ray sources, enabling a tomography technique to achieve good data quality with a high signal-to-noise ratio and fine spatial resolution when used to study low-Z elements. Moreover, the feasibility of XCT for distinguishing the pore structure from deposited lithium was verified.

However, most of the measurements are conducted <italic toggle="yes">ex situ</italic> because the highly volatile liquid electrolyte in the <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> cell may evaporate under high vacuum in the chamber. Therefore, a specially designed <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> liquid cell is needed to capture intermediate phases and timely monitor SEI formation on LMAs in both static and dynamic modes.</p></sec><sec><label>3.7</label><title>Quantification of inactive lithium</title><p>It is well accepted that the low coulombic efficiency of LMAs is mainly caused by the repeated formation of the SEI layer and increased inactive lithium fraction. Inactive lithium is electrically and/or electrochemically isolated and composed of metallic lithium and Li<sup>+</sup> which are no longer able to contribute to the energy storage process during charge&#x02013;discharge cycling. However, these two different kinds of lithium cannot be easily distinguished since the metallic lithium might be surrounded by the SEI layer. Determining their roles in coulombic efficiency reduction of LMAs is critical to find an effective approach for improving the overall performance of LMAs. As mentioned in the previous section, the formation of the deposition layer can be visualized by the X-ray tomography technique, but it is not easy to quantify the inactive lithium. The titration gas chromatography (TGC) method was applied by Fang and Meng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup> to measure the amount of pristine and unreacted metallic lithium in different electrolytes and the calculation of the content of SEI-Li<sup>+</sup>. Combined with cryo-TEM analysis, they reported that the coulombic efficiency loss is governed by the formation of unreacted metallic lithium, significantly related to the electrolyte composition. They proposed effective approaches to improve coulombic efficiency including reactivation/minimization of the unreactive metallic lithium, optimization of the electrolyte, protection with an artificial SEI and application of a 3D host. More recently, Toney's<sup><xref rid="cit98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref></sup> group developed <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> synchrotron XRD with high flux to perform an <italic toggle="yes">operando</italic>, quantitative measurement of the amount of the Li metal on an electrode during the electrode plating and stripping process. Three different capacity loss mechanisms, such as electrolyte reduction, dead lithium formation, and corrosion, were successfully studies using this <italic toggle="yes">operando</italic> XRD.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4.</label><title>Summary and prospects</title><p>(1) In this paper, three approaches for stable SEI engineering for LMAs are discussed: the new formulation of electrolytes, the application of additives, and the introduction of artificial SEIs. It is important to point out that the solvation structure of electrolytes profoundly determines the interphasial properties, and HCEs/LHCEs will continue to play major roles in the near future. As mentioned in the first section, HCEs enable the formation of anion derived SEIs (mainly inorganic/F-rich) due to the unique solvation structure. In addition to the stable SEI formation, low viscosity for facile Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion is one of the great advantages of LHCEs. Although, LHCEs demonstrated various advantages in terms of improving the overall performance of LMAs, most of the fluorinated salts, solvents and diluents are more expensive than the conventional ones, due to the complex synthesis process. Therefore, the development of more cost effective chemicals and novel synthesis routes is needed. In addition to increasing salt concentration, altering solvent/salt combination can also change the solvation structure. Holoubek <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref></sup> prepared 1 M LiFSI in diethyl ether (DEE) as an electrolyte with a contact-ion pair (CIP) solvation structure leading to greatly improved LMA protection at room temperature and low temperatures compared with the 1 M LiFSI in DOL-DME electrolyte. A completely different approach than the high salt concentration in HCEs/LHCEs, results of low salt concentration at 0.4 M have been reported by Yu's group<sup><xref rid="cit100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup> for good Li metal protection (CE of 97.6%) and stable Li&#x02016;LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cycling (capacity retention of 95.4% after 300 cycles). These two examples provided alternative strategies to using HCEs/LHCEs for stable SEI electrolyte formulation, especially for low temperature application. Constructing artificial SEIs with designed structures and components is effective for LMA passivation. Taking multiple requirements for being a protective SEI layer into consideration, combining robust and ionic conductive inorganic species with a highly flexible organic layer is a more promising aspect. Apart from the protection nature of artificial SEIs, appropriate artificial SEI thickness without sacrificing energy density and simple scalable preparation methods should also be considered and optimized. In constructing artificial SEIs, the double layer structure of an inorganic inner layer and organic outer layer is an effective approach. The inorganic species have high ionic conductive and good mechanical strength while the organic layer is highly flexible against the volume change of LMAs. Anode engineering is one of the effective approaches for improving the electrochemical stability of LMAs. For example, the high specific area of 3D conductive hosts can homogenize the local current density and buffer Li<sup>+</sup> flux, resulting in a dendrite free deposition of lithium. However, the loading amount of Li and the thickness of the 3D host for LMAs should be tailored carefully to achieve high energy density.</p><p>(2) For the characterization studies of SEIs, it is getting more and more important to use the combination of different advanced techniques for the same set of SEI samples to overcome the limitation of using a single technique alone (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, imaging techniques can provide the morphological features of lithium deposition layers but not the quantitative analysis of the composition of SEIs. When imaging techniques are combined with spectroscopic techniques, more completed information of SEIs is provided. A good example is the SEI study using the combination of cryo-TEM (imaging) and titration gas chromatography (spectroscopic) techniques.<sup><xref rid="cit97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup> XRD is capable of providing the structural information of bulk SEIs but limited to the crystalline phase only. By combining XRD with PDF, which has the capability to study amorphous phases, both crystalline and amorphous phases in SEIs can be analyzed.<sup><xref rid="cit84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup> We expect that the trend of using the combination of different characterization tools will continue in the future and multidimension and multimodal information will be reported. In addition, we expect that more efforts will be made towards the development of <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">operando</italic> analytical techniques enabling the capability to study the evolution of SEIs continuously under realistic operating conditions.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tab1"><caption><title>Capabilities and limitations of different characterization techniques</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characterization Techniques</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Capabilities</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Limitations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">

Chemical and elemental sensitive soft XAS has shown great potential in interphase study and widely applied to identify the components in cathode/electrolyte interphases, but rarely used for SEI study on LMAs. Through the analysis of soft XAS at the K-edges of Li, O, C, N, and F, full patterns of both inorganic and organic species can be obtained. By analyzing data collected in total electron yield (TEY) and fluorescence yield (FY) modes, the components of surface and bulk SEIs can be determined, respectively. However, it is important to minimize the beam damage on SEI components by controlling the beam flux level to balance the high quality XAS spectra and tolerable flux for the reliability of XAS data.</p><p>Some new advanced techniques have been introduced for LMA studies recently. Synchrotron high energy XPS (HEXPS) is one of them with the capability to semi-quantitatively probe the depth-related evolution of SEI components through tuning the incident X-ray energy. Another example is the <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> liquid-SIMS technique with a special <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> cell which can be used in a high vacuum chamber and used for dynamic chemical mapping of the interfacial species. As reported by Zhu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref></sup> a complete picture of the structure and composition of the electric double layer as well as its link to interphasial chemistry in LIBs was revealed by liquid-SIMS.</p><p>(3) We expect that the studies on LiH in SEIs will be getting more attention. The presence or absence of LiH has been debated for a long time.<sup><xref rid="cit64" ref-type="bibr">64,97</xref></sup> The possible formation of LiH in SEIs was first proposed in 1999,<sup><xref rid="cit102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup> with the first experimental evidence reported in 2018<sup><xref rid="cit64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> using cryo-STEM mapping. However, the formation of LiH has remained controversial, as evidenced by multiple publications arguing no LiH observations in SEIs,<sup><xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62,97</xref></sup> including one that used a quantitative titration method.<sup><xref rid="cit97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup> However, a new study<sup><xref rid="cit84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup> using synchrotron-based XRD and PDF analysis provided new evidence about the presence of LiH in SEIs on LMAs. A separated study of Cui <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup> reported the LiH and metallic Li contents of a cycled LMA determined by the combination of deuterium-oxide (D<sub>2</sub>O) titration experiments in an on-line gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system. They also claimed that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with the cyclability of practical LMBs. However, the LiH content reported in this work is from the cycled cell not the SEI only. Therefore, it will be quite interesting to further study whether the effect of LiH content in the SEI is positive or negative on the cyclability, as well as the formation mechanism and the hydrogen source (solvent decomposition or H<sub>2</sub>O in the electrolyte) of LiH.</p><p>(4) Most of the mechanism studies on SEIs were conducted during the initial deposition process. However, for LMAs with unstable interphases, every cycle can be considered as the formation cycle due to the repeated formation of &#x0201c;fresh Li&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; SEIs. Achieving in-depth insight into the dynamic evolution of SEI formation is also an important direction for the rational design of stable SEIs. In addition to SEI engineering and advanced characterization techniques, theoretical study is essential for better understanding the relationship between the solvation structure of the electrolyte and SEI components. Calculation results could also provide guidance for selecting and screening electrolyte components and additives. In addition, electrolyte decomposition products and the formation mechanism of SEIs can be predicted by a theoretical study.</p><p>In summary, we believe that the studies of solid electrolyte interphases on the surface of Li-metal anodes will continuously play a critical role in enhancing our fundamental understanding of the interphase chemistry in batteries and providing valuable information for the development and improvement of LMBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Z.

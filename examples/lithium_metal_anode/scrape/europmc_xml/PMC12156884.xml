Rational modulation of solvation structures within the electrolytes emerged as one of the most effective strategies to enhance interfacial stability in LMBs; however, this approach often compromises the structural stability of the bulk electrolyte. Herein, we present an innovative method that improves interface stability without adversely affecting the bulk electrolyte&#x02019;s structural stability. By employing ZSM molecular sieves as efficient ion channels on the lithium metal anode surface&#x02014;termed ZSM electrolytes&#x02014;a more aggregated solvation structure is induced at the lithium metal interface, resulting in an anion-rich interphase. This anion-enriched environment promotes the formation of an SEI derived from anions, thereby enhancing the stability of the lithium metal interface. Consequently, Li||Cu cells utilizing the ZSM electrolyte achieve an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.76% over 700 h. Moreover, LiFePO<sub>4</sub>||Li batteries exhibit stable cycling performance exceeding 900 cycles at a current density of 1 C.

Introduction</title><p>With the rapid advancement of portable electronic devices and electric vehicle technologies, there is an urgent demand for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [<xref rid="B1-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Current commercial LIBs, particularly those utilizing graphite anodes, nearly reached their theoretical energy density limits. Transitioning to lithium metal anodes, which boast a significantly higher theoretical capacity (3860 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and lower electrochemical potential (&#x02212;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), could substantially elevate battery energy densities [<xref rid="B3-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the development of unstable solid&#x02013;electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on the lithium metal surface severely impacts the coulombic efficiency (CE) of lithium plating/stripping, potentially leading to uncontrolled dendrite growth [<xref rid="B8-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, rationally regulating SEI structures/properties is critical for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.</p><p>Over the past few decades, numerous strategies have been proposed to improve the interfacial stability of lithium metal anodes, including electrolyte structure optimization [<xref rid="B15-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], electrode surface modification [<xref rid="B16-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and interfacial property regulation [<xref rid="B17-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among these approaches, modulating the electrolyte structure to stabilize the SEI has proven particularly effective because it directly influences SEI composition and structure [<xref rid="B18-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. High-concentration electrolytes (HCEs) represent one such method, Fan et al. successfully inhibited the growth of lithium dendrites by increasing the concentration of LiFSI to 10 M in carbonate electrolytes; Xu et al. designed a &#x02018;water-in-salt&#x02019; electrolyte to improve lithium-ion battery performance [<xref rid="B23-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The solvation structures evolve from solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs) to contact ion pairs (CIPs), fostering more stable anion-derived SEI formation [<xref rid="B27-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, HCEs present challenges such as high cost due to expensive lithium salts, increased viscosity, and poor wettability, limiting their practical applications [<xref rid="B32-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To mitigate these issues, local high concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) have been developed by incorporating inert components into HCE. Lin et al. designed a THF-based localized high-concentration electrolyte to successfully improve the adaptability of lithium metal batteries in low-temperature environments [<xref rid="B34-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Yet, adding inert solvents can reduce the overall energy density of lithium batteries. Recently, weak solvating electrolytes (WSEs) emerged; using solvents with limited lithium salt solubility that promote aggregated solvation structures conducive to anion-derived SEI formation, Li et al. Developed a DPE-based low-polarity electrolyte, which successfully formed a more robust CEI at the anode interface [<xref rid="B37-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Despite this advantage, insufficient lithium salt dissolution in WSEs can impede Li<sup>+</sup> transport within the electrolyte. The essence of these strategies lies in forcing anions into the solvation sheath to encourage anion-derived SEI formation, thereby enhancing interface stability. However, excessive incorporation of anions into solvation structures in bulk electrolytes often introduces drawbacks, such as high viscosity, low conductivity, or instability. Consequently, there is an urgent need for methods that enhance the interfacial stability of lithium metal anodes while preserving the overall stability of the bulk electrolytes.</p><p>In this work, we employed ZSM-5 molecular sieves as effective ion-selective channels at the lithium-metal anode interface without changing the composition of the native electrolytes (hereafter referred to as ZSM electrolytes) [<xref rid="B42-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The uniform pore structure within the molecular sieve efficiently expels a portion of the solvent from the solvation shell, creating an anion-rich interphase that facilitates the formation of anion-derived SEIs (<xref rid="materials-18-02415-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The enhanced presence of LiF components in these anion-derived SEIs significantly improves the stability of the lithium metal interface. Consequently, Li||Cu cells utilizing ZSM electrolytes achieve an average CE of 98.76% over 700 h. Moreover, LiFePO<sub>4</sub>||Li batteries exhibit stable cycling performance for up to 900 cycles at a current density of 1 C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-materials-18-02415"><title>2.

For comparison, 2 M LiFSI DME electrolytes (hereafter referred to as DME electrolytes) were also analyzed (<xref rid="app1-materials-18-02415" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). In DME electrolytes (<xref rid="materials-18-02415-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a), Li<sup>+</sup> ions were predominantly surrounded by DME molecules within their solvation shells, which is detrimental to the stability of the lithium metal interface (<xref rid="materials-18-02415-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b) [<xref rid="B45-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

This reduced diffusion efficiency can be attributed to the extensive coordination of Li<sup>+</sup> with numerous DME molecules, hindering ion mobility.

Interfacial Properties of ZSM Electrolytes</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examined the lithium metal surface morphology after 50 cycles (<xref rid="app1-materials-18-02415" ref-type="app">Figure S16</xref>). DME electrolytes led to randomly distributed lithium dendrites on the lithium metal surface after continuous plating/stripping (<xref rid="materials-18-02415-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a), potentially causing short circuits.

Compared to ZSM electrolytes, DME electrolytes showed more ROCO<sub>2</sub>Li composition in the SEIs, likely due to higher reactivity towards lithium metal, which could obstruct ion transport in the SEIs. In ZSM cells, an enhanced LiF characteristic peak appeared at 648.8 eV, which is beneficial for lithium metal interface stability (<xref rid="materials-18-02415-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>d) [<xref rid="B52-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-materials-18-02415"><title>3.4. Performance of LFP||Li Full Batteries</title><p>To further demonstrate the effectiveness of ZSM electrolytes, LFP||Li batteries were tested at 1 C (<xref rid="materials-18-02415-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a). DME battery capacity sharply dropped after 200 cycles (capacity retention at 300 laps is only 41.33%). The results of this test are consistent with the study of Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B55-materials-18-02415" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The DME electrolytes are unable to maintain a stable long cycling. However, ZSM batteries stably cycled 900 times with a capacity retention of 50.5%, showing improved stability. Voltage curves under different cycle times (<xref rid="materials-18-02415-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>b,c) highlighted the superiority of ZSM batteries. After 200 cycles, the discharge capacity of DME batteries decreased to 109 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and this capacity rapidly decreased to 63 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 250 cycles. In addition, the DME batteries showed a certain degree of voltage decay during charging and discharging, with the discharge voltage dropping from 3.4 V to 3.3 V. In contrast, the ZSM battery exhibited a discharge capacity of 121 mAh g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 300 cycles without voltage degradation. These results underscore the critical role of the anion-rich interface in ZSM electrolytes for enhancing battery cycling stability. The inorganic-rich SEI film formed at the anion-rich interface has higher mechanical strength, induces uniform Li<sup>+</sup> deposition, and avoids the growth of lithium dendrites. This is particularly important for the cycling performance of lithium metal batteries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-materials-18-02415"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we utilized ZSM-5 zeolite molecular sieves as effective ion-sieving channels for the lithium metal anode interface without altering the bulk electrolyte structure. Li||Cu cells achieved an average CE of 98.76% over 700 h, and LiFePO<sub>4</sub>||Li batteries remained stable for 900 cycles at 1 C. The excellent electrochemical properties can be attributed to the following: (1) the uniform pore structure within the molecular sieve efficiently expels a portion of the solvent from the solvation structures, leading to an anion-rich interphase and promoting the formation of anion-derived SEIs; (2) sieved electrolytes have better interfacial dynamics and lower desolvation energy; and (3) the increased LiF component in these SEIs significantly enhances lithium metal interface stability. This design strategy may provide a new direction for effective interface regulation in lithium metal batteries, paving the way for advancements in high-energy-density storage systems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

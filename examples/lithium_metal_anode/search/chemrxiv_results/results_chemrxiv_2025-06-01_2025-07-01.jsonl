However, solid-state batteries fail through short-circuiting even at low charging rates (<1 mA\/cm2) due to lithium dendrite initiation and propagation. The location of dendrite initiation is still under debate, particularly between initiation at the surface and within the interior of the solid electrolyte. Here, we develop an in-plane biaxial compression method that provides direct evidence of dendrite initiation within the interior of garnet solid electrolytes. The biaxial compression also deflects dendrite propagation to be perpendicular to the electric field direction and prevents short-circuiting at extreme fast charging of 100 mA\/cm2. This approach demonstrates the use of mechanics to address pressing challenges in next generation batteries.","date":"2025-07-01","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Ceramics; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

The mechanism by which mechanically-soft lithium dendrites fracture hard ceramic electrolytes remains under debate, due to the challenges of characterizing nanoscale lithium distribution and its microstructure at the dendrite tip. Here, we investigate the fracture process driven by lithium dendrites in garnet electrolytes using multiscale cryogenic electron microscopy and micromechanical fracture models. We directly visualize lithium dendrites fully filling nanoscale crack tips and extending into micrometer-scale cracks. Limited crystal lattice rotation and plasticity in lithium dendrites indicate that the plated lithium generates significant hydrostatic stress, which induces tensile stress in the solid electrolyte and drives both intergranular and transgranular fracture. In contrast, the region ahead of the lithium dendrite tip showed no measurable enrichment of lithium or lithium metal nuclei. Building on the identified mechanical origin of lithium penetration, we introduce geometrically engineered voids into the electrolyte to redirect lithium dendrite growth and mitigate short-circuiting. These findings suggest that grain boundary toughening and defect engineering are effective strategies for designing dendrite-resistant solid electrolytes.","date":"2025-06-13","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Nanoscience; Energy","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

Rettie ","abstract":"Amorphous lithium solid electrolytes (SE) have enabled high performance lithium metal batteries, but sodium analogues are underexplored. Here, we report sodium aluminophosphate (NAPO) SEs synthesised via spin coating from aqueous solutions. Continuous, smooth, films with submicron thickness are produced after a mild annealing step. Exploration of  the Na\u2212Al\u2212P\u2212O phase space reveals nanocomposite materials comprising of an amorphous NAPO with crystalline NaNO3 domains, suggesting a Na+ saturation limit within the Al\u2212P\u2212O matrix. A maximum ionic conductivity of \u224810-8 S cm\u22121 is achieved, with the presence of the insulating NaNO3 precursor necessary for high ionic conductivity. Electron microscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and optical measurements reveal that at low concentrations the NaNO\u2083 phase is initially present as localised domains and at higher concentrations it forms into larger, isolated particles. The optimal NAPO SE has an activation energy of 0.8(1) eV, a moderate reduced Young\u2019s modulus \u2248 30 GPa and low electronic conductivity (\u224810\u221214 S cm\u22121), making these materials promising candidates for artificial solid electrolyte interphases or as solid electrolytes in sodium metal batteries.","date":"2025-06-17","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Composites; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

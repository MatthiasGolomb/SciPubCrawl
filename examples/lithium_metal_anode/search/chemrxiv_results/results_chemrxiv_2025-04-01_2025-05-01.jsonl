In this work, we present an aggregate-rich electrolyte that leverages the complementary features of ionic liquids and liquefied gas solvents, achieving a high conductivity of 17.7 mS\/cm at room temperature. The aggregate-rich solvation chemistry and enhanced fluidity result in superior performance of 20 \u00b5m Li\/NMC811 full cell batteries with 90.41% capacity retention at 4.4 V, 80% capacity retention after 150 cycles, and enhanced low-temperature compatibility till -60 \u2103. Additionally, we demonstrate a conceptual workflow for recovering individual electrolyte components, contributing to circularity of batteries. This work provides a pathway to sustainable, temperature-resilient high-voltage (> 4.4 V) lithium-metal batteries that maintain state-of-the-art electrochemical performance, potentially advancing the development of next-generation energy storage systems.","date":"2025-04-25","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

Nevertheless, the vaunted anion-reinforced solvation in concentrated electrolytes has non-negligible adverse effect on ion conduction and battery rate performance. Here, we propose a new solvent design strategy of ether monofluorination to tune the Li+-anion interaction for fast-charging LMBs. With the highly polar monofluoro functional groups, the ether-based electrolyte not only exhibits excellent high oxidation stability due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of F, but also has a greatly increased ionic conductivity because of reduced anion coordination. The unique solvation structure also enables the formation of robust and highly conductive interphases at both the Li anode and NMC811 surfaces. High Li CEs (~99.4%) and stable long-term cycling with low overpotential under ultrahigh current densities (10 mA cm-2) could be achieved for Li anode. Li||NMC811 cells exhibit outstanding cycling performance under ultrahigh cut-off voltages of 4.6 V and 4.7 V, or at high current densities (5.1 mA cm-2). This work provides critical insights into the ion-solvent interactions in the solvation complex and their profound influence on the battery electrochemical performances.","date":"2022-06-10","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Wendy Gu; William C. Chueh","abstract":"Solid-state electrolytes are an attractive option to increase the chemical stability and energy density of rechargeable lithium-metal batteries. However, they are susceptible to lithium-metal short-circuiting during charging, especially under high current densities. In this work, using a force-controlled electrical microprobe inside a focused-ion beam scanning electron microscope, we performed 48 experiments of electroplating lithium metal onto Li6.6La3 Ta0.4Zr1.6O12 (LLZO) and observed the initiation of lithium penetration (termed intrusions) into the solid electrolyte, with and without externally applied stress. Employing a statistical approach, we find that the cumulative probability of intrusion as a function of lithium metal diameter follows a two-parameter Weibull distribution, implying defect-governed fracture behavior for the intrusion initiation. Upon applying a contact force of 5 mN with a 5-10 \u00b5m microprobe, the characteristic failure diameter of lithium metal decreases by a factor of 2.6 due to the generation of nanoscale cracks as suggested by nanoindentation and finite element simulations. Furthermore, we introduce in-plane compressive strain to LLZO through a cantilever bending experiment and demonstrate that strain as small as 0.067% strongly influences the direction of intrusion propagation immediately following initiation. Overall, our results suggest that both mechanically-generated and pre-existing defects as well as mechanical strain dominate the intrusion behavior in LLZO, a phenomenon that could extend to other solid electrolytes.","date":"2022-06-20","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

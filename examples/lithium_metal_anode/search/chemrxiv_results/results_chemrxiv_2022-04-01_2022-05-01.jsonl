A lithium-mediated pathway is among the most promising ambient-condition electrochemical ammonia synthesis methods. However, the role of metallic lithium and its passivation layer, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), remains unresolved. Here, we apply a multiscale approach that leverages the powerful cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) technique to reveal new insights that were previously inaccessible with conventional methods. We discover that the proton donor (e.g. ethanol) governs lithium reactivity toward nitrogen fixation. Without ethanol, the SEI passivates lithium metal, rendering it inactive for ammonia production. Ethanol disrupts this passivation layer, enabling continuous reactivity at the lithium surface. As a result, metallic lithium is consumed via reactions with nitrogen, proton donor, and other electrolyte components. This reactivity across the SEI is vital to device-level performance of lithium-mediated ammonia synthesis.

Here we develop an anion-adsorption approach to altering the ether solvent environment within the electrical double layer (EDL) at the cathode, by adding a small amount of nitrate, so that the oxidation tolerance of nitrate-containing dilute ether electrolytes is enhanced up to 4.4 V (versus Li\/Li+), leading to complete compatibility with high-voltage cathodes and exhibiting superior cycling stability. Constant-potential molecular dynamics simulations reveal that ether molecules are mostly excluded from the cathode because of nitrate occupation in the inner layer of the EDL, thus suppressing ether oxidative decomposition. This work highlights that regulating the interfacial structure by adding surface adsorbates, rather than passivating cathode-electrolyte interphase or changing ion solvation, can help to enhance the oxidation stability of ether solvents. It also provides design criteria for adsorption-type additives to achieve high-voltage dilute ether electrolytes.","date":"2022-04-11","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

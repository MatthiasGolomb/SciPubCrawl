Here, we introduce HELENA (Hierarchical Electrolyte Learning with Embedded Neural Attention), the first electrolyte deep\u2011learning framework to encode moiety\u2011level chemistry and cooperative interactions across full formulations. HELENA constructs a three\u2011tiered representation and employs attention mechanisms to learn both established heuristics and potentially unseen design principles. Trained on a substantially expanded CE dataset of lithium metal batteries, HELENA outperforms state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art graph\u2011 and tree\u2011based models, while its attention mechanisms both recover established electrolyte trends and reveal novel moiety co\u2011dependencies. Applying HELENA as an in-silico screening engine, we experimentally validate several model\u2011predicted formulations achieving CE > 99.5%, demonstrating its practical utility. By fusing moiety-aware tokenizer with scalable attention\u2011based learning, HELENA establishes a new paradigm for rational electrolyte discovery and paves the way for generative, closed\u2011loop design workflows of exploring multicomponent chemical systems beyond energy.","date":"2025-05-14","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

A serious problem of metal electrodes is their non-uniform deposition and dissolution, which can lead to dendrites and voids. Here, we report on formation, growth, and shrinkage of voids based on operando SEM observations of lithium metal in contact with a Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolyte. Our observations reveal a general tendency for the replenishment of voids upon redeposition of lithium. We explain this by gradients in the mechanical stress that act as driving forces for atom motion inside the electrode and thus feed lithium away from the interface back into existing voids, which restores the original shape of the electrode. During operation, lithium atoms are inserted or extracted at the interface, creating stresses in the electrode. In electrodes with smaller lithium grains we observe that the shape of voids is strongly influenced by the microstructure of the lithium metal and that grain boundaries can obstruct void growth. We consider diffusion along lithium grain boundaries and the inner surface of voids as important pathways for metal transport. We suggest that the local balance of the diffusional metal fluxes is responsible for the evolution of the shape of the metal electrode.","date":"2025-05-19","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

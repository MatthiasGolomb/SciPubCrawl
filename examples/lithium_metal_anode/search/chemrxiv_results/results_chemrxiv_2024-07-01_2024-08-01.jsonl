In this study, a novel \u201cpolymer-in-high concentrated ionic liquid\u201d (PiHCIL) electrolyte composed of PEO, N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (C3mpyrFSI) ionic liquid (IL) and LiFSI is designed. The EO: [Li\/IL] ratio has been widely varied and their physical and electrochemical properties have been explored. The Li-coordination and solvation structure has been explored through FTIR spectroscopy and solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR. The designed electrolyte provides promisingly high oxidative stability of 5.1V and offers high ambient temperature ionic conductivity of 5.6 x10-4 S cm-1. Li|Li symmetric cell cycling showed very stable and reversible cycling of Li metal over 100 cycles and smooth, dendrite-free deposition morphology. All-solid-state cells using composite LFP cathode exhibited promising cycling with 99.2% capacity retention at C\/5 rate over 100 cycles. Therefore, the novel approach of PiHCIL enables a new pathway to design high-performing SPEs for high-energy density all-solid-state LMBs.","date":"2024-07-11","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Polymer Science; Elastic Materials; Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Conducting polymers; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

Bruce","abstract":"Avoiding lithium dendrites at the lithium\/ceramic electrolyte interface and as a result avoiding cell short-circuit when plating at practical current densities remains a significant challenge for all-solid-state batteries. Typically, values are limited to around 1 mA cm-2, even, for example, for garnets with a relative density of >99%. It is not obvious that simply densifying ceramic electrolytes will deliver high plating currents. Here we show that plating currents of 9 mA cm-2 can be achieved without dendrite formation, by densifying Argyrodite, Li6PS5Cl, to 99%. Changes in the microstructure of Li6PS5Cl on densification from 83 to 99% were determined by FIB-SEM tomography and used to calculate their effect on the critical current density (CCD). Not all changes in microstructure with densification act to increase CCD. While smaller pores and shorter cracks increase CCD, lower pore population and narrower cracks act to decrease CCD. Calculations show that the former changes dominate over the latter, predicating an overall increase in CCD, as observed experimentally.

Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the lithium metal anode in 3D at       nanometer resolution and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal atomic details in local regions. We imaged both freshly prepared and calendar aged Li metal anodes to reveal the development of LiH in Li dendrites and the Li-LiH interface, as well as the development of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). Using a convolutional neural network-based technique, the 3D arrangement of Li metal, along with nanoscale LiH and Cu heterogeneities in dendrites were visualized and annotated. In longer-term calendar aging, we observed more substantial LiH growth accompanied by extended SEI growth. Our results show that the growth of LiH and of the extended SEI during battery calendar aging are temporally and spatially separate processes","date":"2025-01-03","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

However, the factors that control lithium growth\/stripping at the anode current collector are not well understood. Here, we use operando X-ray microcomputed tomography to comprehensively image and quantify lithium deposition and stripping under various conditions in three different Li|Li6PS5Cl|current collector cells, revealing diverse behavior. A cell with high impedance exhibits extensive lithium filament growth, with filaments that grow around pre-existing pores in the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) rather than lithium filling these pores. Lithium filament formation is partially reversible, with the cracks shrinking as lithium metal is stripped. Uniform lithium deposition is achievable at low current densities in low-impedance cells, whereas higher current densities cause an increase in interfacial roughness, which is correlated with filamentary growth. These results provide insight into filamentary vs. planar lithium growth and highlight that the evolution of lithium is sensitively dependent on SSE microstructure and electrochemical process.","date":"2025-01-07","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we introduce a new interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, serving to enhance contact. Stripping of a lithium electrode containing 5-20% redox-inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium undergoing local plastic deformation as lithium is removed to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking transport channels. This process, characterized with operando X-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates void formation and substantially improves battery cycling performance at the low stack pressures needed for practical applications. The counterintuitive strategy of adding inactive alkali metal to improve performance demonstrates that interfacial self-regulation is a promising pathway to efficient solid-state batteries.","date":"2025-01-10","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

Despite significant developments, the chemomechanical degradation of solid-state batteries represents a significant challenge to their widespread adoption. Specifically, Li-filled cracks (called 'dendrites') and electronically isolated Li inclusions ('dead' Li) are key defects resulting from coupled electrochemical-mechanical degradation during cycling. In this study, we use a symmetrical Li|LLZO|Li cell with a single-crystal electrolyte and demonstrate that an electronically isolated Li-metal inclusion exhibits bipolarity under an external electrical field, which leads to further crack expansion. We suggest that this process of 'dead' metal activation accelerates chemomechanical degradation in solid-state batteries with alkali anodes.","date":"2025-01-13","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Ceramics; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Dendrite initiation and propagation in specific solid state electrolyte materials has been explained, at a microscopic scale, as emerging from the lithium-filling of pores within the solid state electrolytes via microcracks. At the atomistic scale, the thermodynamic instability of many solid state electrolyte materials can explain their susceptibility to crystal decomposition upon contact with the lithium anode. However, for a more complete picture of the dendrite formation mechanisms, an understanding of the dendrite initiation mechanism at the intermediate nanoscopic scale is required. This work applies a machine learning potential (DIEP) for simulating six different solid state electrolyte-lithium interfaces at 300 K and 1000 K, with model sizes ranging from 24k to 36k atoms, for durations exceeding 20 ps. Our simulations show that the lithium dendrite initiation process can have an underpinning nanoscopic mechanism, in which the crystal decomposition by direct lithium interaction leads to the clustering of lithium. The simulations also suggest a possible mechanism for the creation of voids within the solid-electrolyte interphase, which have been observed in the Li$|$Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl$|$Li interface.","date":"2025-01-10","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, there is a lack of reliable guidelines for screening suitable organic modulators. Through examining the effects of various organic molecules on the hydrogen bonding network of water, we found that the water-anchoring capabilities of organic modulators are positively correlated with their acceptor-donor index (IA-D)\u2014the sum of the products of donor and acceptor sites and their respective intensities. Furthermore, lithium metal titration-assisted differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (Li-DEMS) technique was developed to systematically investigate the charge-discharge behavior of three electrodes with different redox potentials (Li4Ti5O12, V2O5, and Zn) in nonaqueous\/aqueous hybrid electrolytes containing different organic modulators and salts. The contributions of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation to irreversible capacity were decoupled. For all the electrodes studied, a higher IA-D value correlates with a smaller contribution of HER to irreversible capacities and higher initial and average Coulombic efficiencies. Notably, HER becomes the dominant contributor to irreversible capacity after the initial cycles. For the high-potential electrode (V2O5), electrochemical performance is primarily influenced by IA-D, rather than SEI formation, while for the low-potential electrode (Li4Ti5O12), both IA-D and SEI formation play significant roles in determining performance. These findings not only validate IA-D as a reliable descriptor for assessing the water-anchoring capabilities of organic modulators, but also establish a link between organic modulators, electrolyte solution structure, interphase reactions, and battery performances, providing valuable insights for the development of high-performance aqueous batteries.","date":"2025-01-16","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Investigations into the origin of this stability may provide the insights needed to replicate it in the SEIs of alternative solid electrolyte materials. In this study we used in situ lithium plating X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the formation and evolution of the Li-LiPON SEI for the first time. We show that the SEI is chemically and structurally inhomogeneous, with the fully reduced compounds identified in previous studies (Li2O, Li3N and Li3P) concentrated near the lithium metal side and partially lithiated species, including Lix P, predominant closer to the LiPON side. Li3P and Lix P have recently been suggested as enablers of continuous SEI growth in thiophosphate solid electrolytes. We suggest that the stability of the Li-LiPON SEI is derived from a combination of the LiPON reduction potential (0.68 V vs. Li+\/Li), which is below the oxidation potentials of the fully reduced SEI compounds, and the graded structure of the SEI, which ensures that the most reduced species are not in physical or electrical contact with the LiPON layer.","date":"2025-01-17","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Thin Films; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

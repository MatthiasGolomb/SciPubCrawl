One key remaining challenge is identifying solid electrolytes that combine high ionic conductivity with stability in contact with the highly reducing potentials of next-generation anodes. Fully reduced electrolytes, based on irreducible anions, offer a promising solution by avoiding electrolyte decomposition altogether. In this study, we demonstrate the compositional flexibility of the disordered antifluorite framework accessible by mechanochemical synthesis and leverage it to discover irreducible electrolytes with high ionic conductivities. We show that the recently investigated Li9N2Cl3 and Li5NCl2 phases are part of the same solid solution of Li-deficient antifluorite phases existing on the LiCl-Li3N tie line with a general chemical formula of Li1+2xCl1-xNx (0.33<x<0.5). Using density functional theory calculations, we identify the origin of the 5-order of magnitude conductivity increase of the Li1+2xCl1-xNx phases compared to the structurally related rock salt LiCl phase. Finally, we demonstrate that SCl  and BrCl substituted analogues of the Li1+2xCl1-xNx phases may be synthesized, enabling significant conductivity improvements by a factor of 10, reaching 0.2 mS cm-1 for Li2.31S0.41Br0.14N0.45. This investigation demonstrates for the first time that irreducible antifluorite-like phases are compositionally highly modifiable; this finding lays the ground for discovery of new compositions of irreducible antifluorite-like phases with even further increased conductivities, which could help eliminate solid-electrolyte decomposition and decomposition-induced Li losses on the anode side in high-performance next-generation batteries.","date":"2024-12-16","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

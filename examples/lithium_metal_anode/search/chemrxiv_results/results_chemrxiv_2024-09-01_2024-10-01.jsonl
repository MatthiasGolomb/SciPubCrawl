However, they suffer from limited oxidation stability (up to 4 V vs. Li+\/Li). In this study, a newly designed crosslinked polymer-in-concentrated ionic liquid (PCIL) SPE consisting of PEO, C3mpyrFSI and LiFSI is developed. The adopted UV-crosslinking strategy synergistically reduces PEO crystallinity while increasing the amount of encompassed lithium salt and IL, and improves PEO oxidative stability, therefore leading to enhanced electrochemical performance. The physical and electrochemical properties of both linear and crosslinked SPEs are explored and compared. The designed crosslinked SPEs exhibited a promisingly high oxidative stability of 4.9V vs. Li+\/Li and high ambient temperature ionic conductivity of 4 x10-4 S cm-1. Stable and reversible lithium plating\/stripping is demonstrated in symmetrical Li||Li cells over hundreds of hours. High loading solid-state LFP||Li cells showed favourable cycling with over 90% capacity retention at 0.1C over 100 cycles at 50\u00b0C. High voltage solid-state LMO||Li cells exhibited promising cycling with 93% capacity retention at 0.2 C rate over 50 cycles at 50\u00b0C. Both cathodes utilized a high areal capacity of 1 mAh cm-2. The synergistic combination of crosslinking and concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte to a robust SPE enables a new pathway for designing high-performing PEO-based SPEs for high energy density solid-state LMBs.

Whereas previous studies employed either inorganic or organic additives, in this study we report the first organometallic additive, Mo2(mea)4 [1, mea = 2-(2- methoxyethoxy)acetate], a dimolybdenum paddlewheel complex that is stable under Li plating conditions. Unlike more classically used crown ether additives, complex 1 features cation binding sites in the second coordination sphere that promote reversible Li+ coordination. Furthermore, binding of Li+ ions to 1 induces aggregation of cationically charged coordination oligomers\/polymers that assemble at the LMA surface due to electrostatic attraction. Upon surface immobilization and incorporation into the solid- electrolyte interphase (SEI), the additive serves multiple beneficial functions. It was found to protect the LMA against parasitic side reactions by chemical passivation, produce modest but measurable improvements to Li plating properties (e.g. overpotential, surface structure, Coulombic efficiency), and modulate the composition and thickness of the SEI. The latter effect translates to significantly decreased resistance in battery settings due to improved interfacial charge transport properties. The most notable benefit to battery cycling performance comes from calendar aging tests, which show that the presence of the additive protects the LMA from parasitic side reactions that would otherwise decrease overall cell cycling efficiency Collectively, these data disclose a new tactic for designing electrolyte additives using principles of organometallic synthesis.","date":"2024-09-06","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Energy; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Electrochemistry; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A key to enabling this technology is the development of solid-state electrolytes with the elusive combination of high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability and the ability to form a conductive and stable interface with Li metal. Presently, oxide and sulfide-based materials, particularly garnet and argyrodite-type structures, have proved most promising for this application. However, these still suffer from a number of challenges, including resistive lithium metal interfaces, poor lithium dendrite suppression (at high current density) and low voltage stability. Here we report the first application of lithium imide, an antifluorite-structured material, as a solid electrolyte in a Li-metal battery. Low-temperature synthesis of lithium imide produces promising Li-ion conductivity, reaching > 1 mS cm-1 at 30 \u02daC using a modest post-synthetic mechanochemical treatment, as well as displaying at least 5 V stability vs Li+\/Li. In situ electrochemical operation of lithium imide with Li-metal electrodes reveals a 1000-fold increase in its measured ionic conductivity, whilst appearing to remain an electronic insulator. It is postulated that stoichiometry variation at the grain boundary leads to a highly disordered quasi-liquid state, facilitating this conductivity improvement. Furthermore, the material is shown to possess impressive stability under high current density conditions (70 mA cm-2) as well as the ability to operate in Li-metal battery cells. These results not only highlight the promising performance of lithium imide, but also its potential to be the basis for a new family of antifluorite based solid electrolytes.

LAGP shows slower SEI formation kinetics, as proven by the emergence of a metallic lithium signal, while LGPS exhibits rapid SEI growth that prevents metallic lithium from plating.

We have previously introduced a new family of solid electrolytes based on thiophosphates with inherent stability against metallic Li anode and high conductivity [JACS REF]. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) together with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the diffusion mechanisms and underlying factors contributing to the high ionic conductivity of these novel Li-P-S ternary electrolytes, including Li7PS2, Li5PS, Li8P2S, and Li11P3S. Our findings reveal that these materials exhibit ionic conductivities comparable to the well-known superionic conductor, Li7P3S11, positioning them as promising candidates for solid-state battery applications. Additionally, we assess the thermodynamic stability of these ternaries in contact with lithium metal anodes, a critical consideration for practical battery use. Unlike Li7P3S11, which forms a solid-electrolyte interphase, the novel Li-P-S ternaries exhibit remarkable stability against Li metal anode due to their unique Li2S-like structural framework. The absence of a solid-electrolyte interphase layer is particularly significant, as it eliminates additional resistance at the electrolyte-anode interface, a common challenge in many solid-state battery systems. Our study not only highlights the suitability of these novel ternaries, particularly Li5PS, as high-performance solid electrolytes but also underscores the importance of structural design in developing next-generation battery materials. The ability of these materials to maintain high ionic conductivity and stability over extended periods makes them ideal candidates for future solid-state lithium batteries, offering a pathway to safer, more efficient, and longer-lasting energy storage solutions.","date":"2024-09-30","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

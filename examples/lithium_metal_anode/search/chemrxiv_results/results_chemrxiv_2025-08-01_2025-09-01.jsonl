However, solid-state batteries fail through short-circuiting even at low charging rates (<1 mA\/cm2) due to lithium dendrite initiation and propagation. The location of dendrite initiation is still under debate, particularly between initiation at the surface and within the interior of the solid electrolyte. Here, we develop an in-plane biaxial compression method that provides direct evidence of dendrite initiation within the interior of garnet solid electrolytes. The biaxial compression also deflects dendrite propagation to be perpendicular to the electric field direction and prevents short-circuiting at extreme fast charging of 100 mA\/cm2. This approach demonstrates the use of mechanics to address pressing challenges in next generation batteries.","date":"2025-07-01","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Ceramics; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

Among promising candidates, polymer-succinonitrile composites have emerged as effective polymer plastic crystal electrolytes, demonstrating enhanced electrochemical performance. However, further improvements are needed to meet practical application requirements. In this study, we report a novel strategy for synthesizing electrochemically stable branched polyacrylonitrile through controlled\/living branching radical polymerization, employing 2-chloroacrylonitrile as an innovative inibramer. The unique branched architecture of the resulting polymer facilitates continuous pathways, enabling rapid lithium-ion transport when incorporated in polymer plastic crystal electrolytes. Electrochemical characterization reveals substantial improvements in both ionic conductivity and stability compared to conventional linear counterparts. These findings highlight the pivotal role of polymer architectural design in optimizing ion transport within solid electrolytes, offering new opportunities for developing safer and more efficient energy storage devices.","date":"2025-08-30","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Polymer Science; Energy; Polymerization (Polymers); Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

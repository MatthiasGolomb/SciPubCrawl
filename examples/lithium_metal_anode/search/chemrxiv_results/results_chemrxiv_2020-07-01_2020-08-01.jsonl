Howlett; Maria Forsyth","abstract":"We explore a novel ether aided superconcentrated\nionic liquid electrolyte; a combination of ionic liquid, <i>N<\/i>-propyl-<i>N<\/i>-methylpyrrolidinium\nbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (C<sub>3<\/sub>mpyrFSI) and ether solvent, <i>1,2<\/i> dimethoxy ethane (DME) with 3.2\nmol\/kg LiFSI salt, which offers an alternative ion-transport mechanism and\nimproves the overall fluidity of the electrolyte. The molecular dynamics (MD)\nstudy reveals that the coordination environment of lithium in the ether aided\nionic liquid system offers a coexistence of both the ether DME and FSI anion\nsimultaneously and the absence of \u2018free\u2019, uncoordinated DME solvent. These\nstructures lead to very fast kinetics and improved current density for lithium\ndeposition-dissolution processes. Hence the electrolyte is used in a lithium\nmetal battery against a high mass loading (~12 mg\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>) LFP cathode\nwhich was cycled at a relatively high current rate of 1mA\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> for\n350 cycles without capacity fading and offered an overall coulombic efficiency\nof >99.8 %.  Additionally, the rate\nperformance demonstrated that this electrolyte is capable of passing current\ndensity as high as 7mA\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> without any electrolytic decomposition\nand offers a superior capacity retention. We have also demonstrated an \u2018anode\nfree\u2019 LFP-Cu cell which was cycled over 50 cycles and achieved an average\ncoulombic efficiency of 98.74%. The coordination chemistry and\n(electro)chemical understanding as well as the excellent cycling stability\ncollectively leads toward a breakthrough in realizing the practical applicability\nof this ether aided ionic liquid electrolytes in lithium metal battery\napplications, while delivering high energy density in a prototype cell.","date":"2020-07-02","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we delineate the optimal solid electrolyte microstructure comprising of grains, grain boundary and voids possessing desirable ionic conductivity and elastic modulus for superior transport and strength. An analytical formalism is provided to discern the impact of external \u201cstack\u201d pressure induced mechanical stress on electrodeposition stability; stress magnitude obtained are in the megapascal range considerably diminishing the stress-kinetics effects. For experimental stack pressures ranging up to 10 MPa, the impact of stress on reaction kinetics is negligibly small and electrolyte transport overpotentials dictate electrodeposition stability. We detail the deposition stability phase map as a function of solid electrolyte to Li metal shear modulus and molar volume ratios under varying operating conditions including external pressure, surface roughness, applied current density and ambient temperature. High current density operation with stable deposition can be ensured with ample external pressure, high temperature and low surface roughness operation for low shear modulus ratio of the solid electrolyte to Li metal. \n<br \/>","date":"2020-07-16","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theory - Computational; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

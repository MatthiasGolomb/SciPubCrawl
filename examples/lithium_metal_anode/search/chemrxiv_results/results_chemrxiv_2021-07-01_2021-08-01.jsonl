The practical use of garnet electrolytes,  however,  is limited by pervasive lithium-dendrite growth,  which leads to short-circuiting and cell failure.   One possible mechanism for this lithium-dendrite growth is the direct reduction of lithium ions to lithium metal within the electrolyte, and lithium garnets have suggested to be particularly susceptible to this dendrite-growth mechanism due to high electronic conductivities relative to other solid electrolytes  [Hanet al.  Nature Ener.4187,  2019].   The electronic conductivities of  LLZO  and other lithium-garnet solid electrolytes,  however,  are not yet well characterised.   Here,  we present a  general scheme for calculating the intrinsic electronic conductivity of nominally insulating material under variable synthesis conditions from first principles and apply this to the prototypical lithium-garnet  LLZO.  Our model predicts that under typical battery operating conditions, electron and hole mobilities are low (<1 cm2V\u22121s\u22121), and bulk electron and hole carrier concentrations are negligible,  irrespective of initial synthesis conditions or dopant levels.  These results suggest that the bulk electronic conductivity of LLZOis not sufficiently high to cause bulk lithium-dendrite growth during cell operation, and that any non-negligible electronic conductivity in lithium garnet samples is likely due to extended defects or surface contributions.","date":"2021-07-02","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report the use of operando nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to observe electrolyte decomposition during Li stripping\/plating and identify the influence of individual components in LHCEs on Li metal battery performance. Data from operando 19F solution NMR indicates that both bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI\u2013) salt and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)ether (BTFE) diluent molecules play a key role in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, in contrast to prior reports that suggest diluents are inert. Using a combination of solution 17O NMR and cyclic voltammetry (CV), we assess differences in solvation and electrochemical reduction in LHCEs and compare to low concentration electrolytes (LCEs). We find that BTFE diluents are chemically (rather than electrochemically) reduced during Li metal battery operation, which can be detected with operando NMR, but not conventional electrochemical methods. Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements confirm that LHCEs decompose to form a SEI on Li metal that contains organic BTFE reduction products as well as high quantities of lithium fluoride from both BTFE and FSI\u2013 reduction. Insight into the (electro)chemical reduction mechanisms underpinning SEI formation in LHCEs suggests that fluorinated ethers exhibit tunable reactivity that can be leveraged to control Li deposition behavior.","date":"2021-07-16","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

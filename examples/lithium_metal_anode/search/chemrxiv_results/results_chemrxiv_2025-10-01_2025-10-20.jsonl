To address this knowledge gap, the present study employs a set of complementary techniques\u2014including scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and X-ray diffraction\u2014to assess the morphology and microstructure of thermally evaporated and commercial lithium films. These investigations show that crystallographic texturing of evaporated lithium is weakly influenced by the substrate\u2019s composition and grain orientation, whereas grain size and structure are heavily dependent on film thickness. Significant microstructural variations are also observed for lithium films acquired from three commercial vendors, likely due to differences in manufacturing and processing conditions. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the anode\u2019s microstructure has a major impact on lithium electroplating\/stripping in cells containing either oxide or polymer solid electrolytes. When tested under low stack pressure (<1 MPa), lithium\/electrolyte interfacial contact loss was the primary failure mode, and thicker, coarse-grained lithium films (55 vs. 4 \u03bcm average grain size) significantly enhanced cycling stability for both electrolyte classes. Notably, a direct correlation between microstructure and device performance could not be established for cells containing commercial lithium sources due to variations in other key properties such as the films\u2019 surface chemistry and purity. Collectively, these findings highlight the need to better understand and control the anode\u2019s microstructure to enable next-generation lithium metal batteries.","date":"2025-10-14","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}
{"title":"Using electrolyte solvent embeddings to guide battery electrolyte discovery","doi":"10.26434\/chemrxiv-2025-7nnbl","published_doi":"N.A.","published_url":"N.A.","authors":"Ritesh Kumar; Ke-Hsin Wang; Chibueze Amanchukwu","abstract":"Electrolyte development for next-generation batteries has largely relied on knowledge-driven trial-and-error. A significant reason for this approach is due to the vast, high-dimensional molecular design space for solvents and molecular mixtures. Popular dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) can facilitate chemical exploration by projecting this space into low dimensions, yet their applicability in electrolyte discovery remains underexplored. Here, we present a framework to assess the faithfulness of various dimensionality reduction methods in preserving chemically meaningful relationships. Then, we apply this framework to guide electrolyte solvent discovery by searching for electrolyte solvents with high cosine similarity to state-of-the-art systems, followed by formulation refinement using domain knowledge. We then performed experimental validation which revealed different failure modes for different electrolyte selections. We specifically focus on next generation lithium metal batteries (LMBs), and identified a non-fluorinated ether electrolyte solvent that exhibited high Coulombic efficiency (CE). Our findings demonstrate that rational navigation of the electrolyte chemical space, enabled by dimensionality reduction and guided by data, can complement traditional approaches and accelerate the discovery of advanced battery materials.

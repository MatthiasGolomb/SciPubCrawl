Given that experimental studies on polycrystalline materials are notoriously difficult to perform and interpret, computational techniques are invaluable for providing insight at the atomic scale. Here, we carry out first-principles calculations on representative grain boundaries in three important Li-based solid electrolyte families, namely, an anti-perovskite oxide, Li3OCl, a thiophosphate, Li3PS4, and a halide, Li3InCl6, to demonstrate the significantly different impacts that grain boundaries have on their electronic structure, ion conductivity and correlated ion transport. Our results show that even when grain boundaries do not significantly impact ionic conductivity, they can still strongly perturb the electronic structure and contribute to undesirable electrical conductivity and potential lithium dendrite propagation. We also illustrate, for the first time, how cor- related motion, including the so-called paddle-wheel mechanism, which has so far only been considered for the bulk, can vary substantially at grain boundaries. Our findings reveal the dramatically different behaviour of solid electrolytes at the grain boundary compared to the bulk and its potential consequences and benefits for the design of solid-state batteries.","date":"2023-04-12","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Nanoscience; Energy; Ceramics; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}
{"title":"Effect of FEC electrolyte additive on the electrochemical performance of \nnickel-rich NCM ternary cathode \n","doi":"10.26434\/chemrxiv-2023-v3rx4-v2","published_doi":"10.1021\/ACSAEM.3C01025","published_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acsaem.3c01025","authors":"Shengxian She; Yangfan Zhou; Zijian Hong; Yuhui Huang; Yongjun Wu","abstract":"It has been well established recently that fluorinated electrolyte additives such as \nFluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) could promote the formation of LiF-based solid \nelectrolyte interphase that can stabilize lithium metal anode. Meanwhile, the impact of \nFEC additive on the cathode side, particularly for the high energy density nickel-rich \nLiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2 (NCM) ternary cathodes, remains unclear. In this study, we \ninvestigated the structural and chemical composition of cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and its electrochemical performance to elucidate the effect of FEC additive on \nthe LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM90) cathode for high energy lithium-ion batteries. It is \ndiscovered that the FEC additive in carbonate electrolyte (BE-FEC) can produce LiFbased\nCEI, which could stabilize the NCM90 surface and improve the cycle \nperformance at low cut-off voltage. While the formation of a thick LiF layer under high \ncut-off voltage and high rate leads to a higher polarization and slower Li+ transport \nkinetics, which in turn deteriorates the battery performance. Whereas in carbonate \nelectrolyte (BE), under low voltage, the unstable Li2CO3-based amorphous CEI \ncomponents form on the NCM90 surface while an intermediate rock salt structure can \nalso be identified, leading to poor cycle life. While under high voltage, the BE sample \nshows superior electrochemical performance due to the formation of a thin LiF layer \nfrom the decomposition of the LiPF6. Our work provides a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the role of FEC in the CEI of nickel-rich cathodes, offering practical \nguidance for the design of electrolytes for high-energy nickel-rich cathodes.","date":"2023-04-24","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

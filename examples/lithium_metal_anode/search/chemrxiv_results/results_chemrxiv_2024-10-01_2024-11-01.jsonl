However, most highly conducting solid electrolytes decompose at the low operating voltages of next-generation anodes leading to irreversible lithium loss and increased cell resistance. Such performance losses may be prevented by designing electrolytes which are thermodynamically stable at low operating voltages (anolytes). Here, we report on the discovery a new family of irreducible (i.e. fully reduced) electrolytes by mechanochemically dissolving lithium nitride into the Li2S antifluorite structure, yielding highly conducting crystalline Li2+xS1-xNx  phases reaching > 0.2 mS cm-1 at ambient temperatures. Combining impedance spectroscopy experiments and ab initio density functional theory calculations we clarify the mechanism by which the disordering of the sulfide and nitride ions in the anion sublattice boosts ionic conductivity in Li2+xS1-xNx phases by a factor 10^5 compared to the Li2S host structure. This advance is achieved through a novel theoretical framework, leveraging percolation analysis with local-environment-specific activation energies and is widely applicable to disordered ion conductors. The same methodology allows us to rationalize how increasing nitrogen content in Li2+xS1-xNx antifluorite-like samples leads to both increased ionic conductivity and lower conductivity-activation energy. These findings pave the way to understanding disordered solid electrolytes and eliminating decomposition-induced performance losses on the anode side in solid-state batteries.","date":"2024-10-07","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

Novel solid state lithium ion batteries could be a compelling solution to these problems. In this work we unravel some of these new materials with potentially high lithium conductivity by using a Bayesian optimization approach. This involves exploring the material space for new solid-state electrolyte materials with the objective of maximising - lithium diffusivity. The materials selected by the Bayesian optimisation algorithm are then examined using ab initio molecular dynamics to estimate their diffusion energy barrier. We establish that the materials are electronic insulators, a requirement in electrolyte materials, by computing the electronic bandgaps of each of the selected materials using a hybrid exchange method, and then examine the stability of the materials at the lithium metal anode interface by computing the crystal decomposition energies. Out of the selected materials, we find that Li3YBr6 has a reasonably low diffusion barrier, a high bandgap and is potentially the most stable material at the lithium metal interface. In addition to introducing stable and high-diffusivity solid-state electrolyte materials, our work presents a material discovery method that can be applied for a broad range of applications.","date":"2024-10-17","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

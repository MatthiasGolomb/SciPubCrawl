However, several morphological and electro-chemo-mechanical challenges impede their development. Solid state electrolytes such as those based on polymers show great promise in replacing liquid electrolytes in lithium metal batteries. Polyether-based polymer electrolytes are the most investigated but are plagued by low room temperature ionic conductivity and poor oxidative stability. Hence, there is a great need for the development and understanding of ion transport in new classes of polymer electrolytes. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) based electrolytes have shown improved oxidative stability, but little is understood about their lithium solvation and transport mechanism. In this work, we use multinuclear solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the lithium cation environment and mobility in crosslinked single-ion and salt-in-polymer PFPE electrolytes and compare it directly to well-known polyethylene glycol (PEG) electrolytes. We show that the interaction of the lithium cation with the polymer backbone is weaker in PFPE systems compared to PEG, likely resulting in stronger ion pairing in the PFPE systems. Line shape analyses shows lower lithium mobility in PFPE electrolytes, despite lower activation energies being derived from spin-lattice relaxation (T1) measurements as compared to those for the PEG systems. The rapid relaxation is instead ascribed to the local fluctuations caused by polymer backbone mobility.  By studying different modes of ion binding (single-ion vs. salt-in-polymer), we show that differences across polymer backbones (PFPE vs PEG) have a greater effect on mobility than differences in ion binding modes within each polymer class (especially when single-ion conducting site density is not high). Our ability to use MAS NMR to study polymer electrolytes in their native state opens new opportunities to develop and understand novel polymer or hybrid solid state electrolytes for next generation lithium metal batteries.

Understanding the mechanics of lithium at the nanoscale is therefore essential. In this work, the elastic and plastic properties of lithium are measured by nanoindentation within an electron microscope. Lithium metal samples are characterised by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) before and after indentation to understand the dependence of the mechanical properties on crystallographic orientation, and determine the stiffness tensor components, moduli and Poisson\u2019s ratio using a method first proposed by Vlassak and Nix. The measured stiffness tensor components are C11=13.3, C12=11.2, and C44=8.8 GPa. Hardness measurements show a clear size effect with hardness in excess of 100 MPa observed for indent depths below 300 nm, which could contribute toward observed lithium filament propagation.","date":"2022-10-11","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study we investigate  Li5NCl2 (LNCl) a fully-reduced solid electrolyte  that is thermodynamically stable against lithium metal. Combining experiments and simulations we investigate the lithium diffusion mechanism, different synthetic routes and the electrochemical stability window of LNCl. Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments show that fast Li motion (\u03c3RT > 0.1 mS cm-1) is present in LNCl which is however not accessible in macroscopic LNCl pellets. Our ab-initio calculations indicate a disorder-induced wide spread of different lithium jumps in LNCl with certain jumps being much more diffusion limiting than others providing an explanation for the discrepancies in the NMR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) conductivity measurements. The fundamental understanding of the diffusion mechanism we develop herein will guide future synthesis optimizations for LNCl to further improve its conductivity (currently \u03c3RT = 0.015 mS cm-1) and may be applied to other highly-disordered fully-reduced antifluorite electrolytes. We further find that the previously reported anodic limit (>2V vs Li+\/Li) is an overestimate and find the true anodic limit at 0.6 V which is in close agreement with our first-principles calculations. Because of LNCl\u2019s stability against lithium metal we identify LNCl as a prospective artificial protection layer between highly-conducting solid electrolytes and strongly-reducing lithium metal anodes; Thus we also provide an investigation of the chemical compatibility of LNCl with common highly-conducting solid electrolytes.","date":"2022-10-25","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

The stability of SEI\/CEI mainly depends on their chemistry and structure. Current studies on SEI\/CEI design mainly focus on regulating their chemistry by tuning electrolyte formulations. In this work, we showcase that both the chemistry and structure of SEI\/CEI could be readily regulated via a temperature modulated formation strategy. Specifically, pre-charging under heated condition was used to regulate the types and kinetics of electrolyte decomposition reactions, followed by frozen at low-temperature storage to control the deposition behavior of decomposition products on the electrode interface. Studies show that high temperatures pre-charging can affect the coordination structure of Li+ and accelerate the decomposition reaction kinetics, leading to large amount of anion decomposition. The subsequent low-temperature storage rapidly reduces the solubility of decomposition products generated at high temperatures, promoting the deposition of insoluble products on both electrodes, resulting in a dense and stable SEI\/CEI. The robust SEI\/CEI enables stable cycling of a 4.5 V Li||NCM811 cell in a medium-concentration ether-based electrolyte, achieving a capacity retention of 88.7% after 200 cycles at 0.5C (areal capacity 1.5 mAh cm-2). Even under practical conditions with a high NCM811 areal loading of 4.5 mAh cm-2, the battery maintained over 80% capacity retention after 130 cycles at 0.5C. This study not only offers an economical and efficient approach to enhance the cycling stability of high-voltage lithium metal batteries but, more importantly, provides new insights into strategies for controlling the formation of SEI to improve overall battery performance.","date":"2025-02-26","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Stephens","abstract":"Although the Haber-Bosch process for industrial ammonia production is hailed by many as one of the most influential breakthroughs of the 20th century, its decarbonisation and decentralisation remain a critical challenge. One of the most promising and fast improving approaches is electrochemical nitrogen reduction mediated by lithium. However, the impact of electrolyte configuration on the formation of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) and its effect on selective nitrogen reduction is still elusive. In particular, the role of commonly added, supposedly sacrificial, proton donors on SEI chemistry and morphology remains a mystery. In this work, the impact of ethanol concentration in a 1 M LiNTf2 in THF electrolyte on SEI properties and nitrogen reduction is analysed via a multi-pronged characterisation approach. Post-mortem surface analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows a dependence in the relative proportion of LiF and Li2O on ethanol concentration, while depth profiling measurements via cluster source time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry reveals increasing SEI electrolyte permeability at higher ethanol concentrations. Cryogenic electron microscopy measurements show a reduction in SEI thickness with increased ethanol concentration, as well as increased SEI homogeneity. Lithium metal is also observed only in ethanol free condition. Analysis of bulk SEI components via titration corroborates the observation of lithium metal in cryo-microscopy measurements, as well as showing an increase in bulk Li2O\/LiOH content with ethanol concentration. A narrow \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 region is revealed, where the SEI has just the right properties for efficient nitrogen reduction.","date":"2025-02-27","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

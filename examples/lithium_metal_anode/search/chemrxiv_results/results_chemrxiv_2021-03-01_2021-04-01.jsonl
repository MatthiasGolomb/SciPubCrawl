This remains the greatest challenge in achieving high cycling performance in<\/p><p>LMBs. We report an ether-aided ionic liquid electrolyte which offers superior Li metal<\/p><p>deposition, high voltage (5 V) stability and non-flammability. High performance cycling of<\/p><p>LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (4.4 V) and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (4.3 V) cells is demonstrated with high<\/p><p>coulombic efficiency (>99.5%) at room temperature and elevated temperatures, even at high<\/p><p>practical areal capacity for the latter of 3.8 mAh\/cm2 and with a capacity retention of 91% after<\/p><p>100 cycles. The ether-ionic liquid chemistry enables desirable plated Li microstructures with<\/p><p>high packing density, minimal \u2018dead\u2019 or inactive lithium formation and dendrite-free long-term<\/p><p>cycling. Along with XPS studies of cycled electrode surfaces, we use molecular dynamics<\/p><p>simulations to demonstrate that changes to the electrolyte interfacial chemistry upon addition<\/p><p>of DME plays a decisive role in the formation of a compact stable SEI.<\/p>","date":"2021-03-22","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

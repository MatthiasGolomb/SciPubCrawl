Ford; Bumjun Park; Jizhou Jiang; Jennifer Schaefer","abstract":"The\ndevelopment of advanced electrolytes compatible with lithium metal and\nlithium-ion batteries is crucial for meeting ever growing energy storage\ndemands. One such class of materials, single-ion conducting polymer\nelectrolytes (SIPEs), prevents the formation of ion concentration gradients and\nbuildup of anions at the electrode surface, improving performance. One of the\nongoing challenges for SIPEs is the development of materials that are\nconductive enough to compete with liquid electrolytes. Presented herein is a\nclass of gel SIPEs based on crosslinked poly(tetrahydrofuran) diacrylate that\npresent enhanced room temperature conductivities of 3.5 \u00d7 10<sup>-5<\/sup> S\/cm\nwhen gelled with lithium metal relevant 1,3-dioxolane\/dimethoxyethane, 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>-4<\/sup>\nS\/cm with carbonate solutions, and approaching 10<sup>-3<\/sup> S\/cm with\ndimethyl sulfoxide. Remarkably, these materials also demonstrate high\nconductivity at low temperatures, 1.8 \u00d7 10<sup>-5<\/sup> S\/cm at -20 \u00b0C in certain\nsolvents. Most\nimportantly however, when contrasted with identical SIPEs formulated with\npoly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced\nconductivity are elucidated: decreasing Li<sup>+<\/sup>-polymer interactions and\ngel solvent-polymer interactions leads to an increase in Li<sup>+<\/sup>\nmobility, improving the ionic conductivity. These findings are generalizable to\nvarious SIPE chemistries, and can therefore be seen as an additional set of\ndesign parameters for developing future high conductivity SIPEs.","date":"2019-11-29","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Polyelectrolytes - Polymers; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) boosts sensitivity in NMR by harnessing the greater polarisation of unpaired electrons, however typical exogenous organic radicals are non-selective, could react with the SEI, and require cooling the sample to cryogenic temperatures. We instead exploit the inherent conduction electrons to hyperpolarise lithium metal at room temperature, utilising the Overhauser mechanism by which DNP was first discovered. This permits selective enhancement of the organic and inorganic SEI components, revealing their chemical nature and spatial distribution, via the <sup>7<\/sup>Li, <sup>1<\/sup>H and <sup>19<\/sup>F NMR spectra.<br \/>","date":"2019-11-29","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Electrochemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

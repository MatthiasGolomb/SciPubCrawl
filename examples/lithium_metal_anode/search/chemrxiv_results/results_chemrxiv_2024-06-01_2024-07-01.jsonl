Here we developed Ah-level 450 Wh kg\u20131 AFLMBs with >99% coulombic efficiency and examined their degradation comprehensively. Under high-energy conditions, battery degradation behavior is dictated by the major inactive lithium component, and the flexibility of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) proves more vital than Young\u2019s modulus for lithium metal stabilization. Two typical modes of \u201csudden death\u201d and \u201cgradual decay\u201d are revealed, which associate with \u201ctruffle-shaped\u201d dead lithium caused by brittle SEI and \u201cmushroom-shaped\u201d active lithium interwoven with flexible SEI, respectively. The SEI-dominated gradual-decay mode, with slower degradation and minimized dead lithium, exhibits superior lifespan and safety. These insights, contrasting with previous lower-energy-density battery studies, provide crucial guidance for developing practical, high-energy-density, and safe AFLMBs.","date":"2024-06-17","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we discover that nanoscale heterogeneous Ag+ doping dramatically affects lithium intrusion in Li6.6La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12 (LLZO), a brittle solid electrolyte. We generate nanoscale Ag+ doping by thermally annealing a 3-nm-thick metallic film. The metallic Ag undergoes Ag-Li ion exchange, completely disappears, and diffuses into LLZO bulk and grain boundaries to a depth of 20-50 nm. Density functional theory calculations predict this Ag-Li ion exchange exhibits negligible impact on electronic properties.  Mechanically, nanoindentation experiments (n = 69) show a fivefold increase in the force required to fracture Ag+ surface-doped LLZO (Ag+-LLZO), providing direct evidence that surface modification due to Ag+ incorporation prevents crack opening. Conducting 121 plating experiments via operando microprobe scanning electron microscopy, we further confirm that the Ag+-LLZO surface exhibits improved lithium plating even under a large local indentation stress of 3 GPa. Surprisingly, microprobe plating reveals that Ag+ increases the diameter of plated Li at failure by more than 4 times, demonstrating its role in enhancing the defect tolerance of LLZO. Our study reveals a chemo-mechanical mechanism via surface heterogeneous doping, complementing the present bulk design rules to prevent mechanical failures in solid-state batteries.","date":"2024-06-19","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Nanoscience; Energy; Ceramics; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries feature promising high energy density and sustainability, but are hindered by a short cycle life under lean lithium and electrolyte conditions. A critical hurdle for Li-S batteries is the selection of an optimal electrolyte solution, crucial for controlling effective polysulfide electrochemical reactions. The conventional ether- based Li-S electrolyte, consisting of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3), frequently suffers from LiNO3 depletion in high-energy-density applications. To address the capacity decay in Li-S batteries caused by LiNO3 depletion, this investigation introduces 2-nitrophenol lithium (NPL) as an alternative. By incorporating 25  1 mM NPL and 1 M LiTFSI in a 1,3-dioxolane\/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DOL\/DME) solvent, NPL mediates polysulfide oxidation during charging and prevents polysulfide corrosion, therefore improving Li retention and plating behavior. This results in Li-S batteries with NPL achieving 310 cycles, significantly surpassing the 75 cycles observed with traditional LiNO3-containing electrolytes using lean lithium anode. Pouch cells incorporating NPL exhibit stable cycling over 80 cycles, maintaining 75% of their capacity. The molecular structure of NPL prevents decomposition and facilitates interaction with polysulfides to minimize corrosion, positioning it as a strong substitute for LiNO3. This highlights NPL as a promising solution for extending the lifespan of Li-S batteries.","date":"2024-04-08","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For example, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) promise to double the energy density of current Li-ion batteries (LIBs) while next generation LIBs are desired for operations at extreme temperature conditions and with high voltage cathodes. However, there are no suitable electrolytes to support these battery chemistries. Electrolyte requirements are complex (conductivity, stability, safety) and the chemical design space (salts, solvents, additives, composition) is practically infinite; hence discovery is primarily guided through trial-and-error which slows the deployment of new battery chemistries. Inspired by artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled drug discovery, we usher in a new paradigm for electrolyte discovery. We assemble the largest small molecule experimental liquid electrolyte ionic conductivity dataset and build highly accurate machine learning (ML) and deep learning models to predict ionic conductivity across a wide range of electrolyte classes. The developed models outperform molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and are interpretable without explicit encoding of ionic solvation. While most ML-based approaches target a single property, we build additional models of oxidative stability and Coulombic efficiency and develop a new metric called the electrolyte score (eScore) to unify the predicted disparate electrolyte properties. Deploying these models on large unlabeled datasets, we discover new electrolyte solvents, experimentally validate that the electrolyte is conductive (> 1 mS cm-1), stable up to 6V, supports efficient anode-free LMB, and even LIB cycling at extreme temperatures. Our work heralds a new age in electrolyte design and battery materials discovery.

In addition, the metal-oxide discharge products are highly stable and passivating to many oxygen-reduction catalysts. Here we present an alterative way of utilizing the high specific energy lithium metal-oxygen reaction by combining both cation and anion transport in a single device, operated at 550\u00b0C. To do this, we combined a Li6.4La2.8Al0.2Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZO) cation solid electrolyte, yttria stabilized zirconia oxygen ion conductor, and KCl-LiCl eutectic salt as an interlayer between the two solid electrolytes. We find that the constructed battery shows an open circuit voltage consistent with the thermodynamic value predicted for the Li-O2 reaction at 550\u00b0C. Furthermore, we found that the cell could be discharged at 20 mA, showing no significant passivation of the reaction until all of the lithium metal was depleted. However, we were unable to re-deposit the lithium metal electrochemically, possibly due to parasitic reduction of the LLZO tube upon charging. This work presents a unique device which may inspire other high temperature electrochemical devices in the field.","date":"2021-11-05","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Ceramics; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

Substantial research effort has focused on increasing rate capabilities of SSBs by mitigating detrimental processes such as lithium filament penetration. Less attention has been paid to understanding how areal capacity impacts plating\/stripping behavior, despite the importance of areal capacity for achieving high specific energy. Here, we investigate and quantify the relationships among areal capacity, current density, and plating\/stripping stability using both symmetric and full-cell configurations with a sulfide solid-state electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl). We show that unstable deposition and short circuiting readily occur at rates much lower than the measured critical current density when a sufficient areal capacity is passed. A systematic study of continuous plating under different electrochemical conditions reveals average \u201cthreshold capacity\u201d values at different current densities, beyond which short circuiting occurs. Cycling cells below this threshold capacity significantly enhances cell lifetime, enabling stable symmetric cell cycling at 2.2 mA cm-2 without short circuiting. Finally, we show that full cells also exhibit threshold capacity behavior, but they tend to short circuit at lower current densities and areal capacities. Our results quantify the effects of transferred capacity and demonstrate the importance of using realistic areal capacities in experiments to develop viable solid-state batteries.","date":"2021-11-08","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

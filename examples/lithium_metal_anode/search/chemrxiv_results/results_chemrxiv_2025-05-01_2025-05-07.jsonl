Here, we introduce HELENA (Hierarchical Electrolyte Learning with Embedded Neural Attention), the first electrolyte deep\u2011learning framework to encode moiety\u2011level chemistry and cooperative interactions across full formulations. HELENA constructs a three\u2011tiered representation and employs attention mechanisms to learn both established heuristics and potentially unseen design principles. Trained on a substantially expanded CE dataset of lithium metal batteries, HELENA outperforms state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art graph\u2011 and tree\u2011based models, while its attention mechanisms both recover established electrolyte trends and reveal novel moiety co\u2011dependencies. Applying HELENA as an in-silico screening engine, we experimentally validate several model\u2011predicted formulations achieving CE > 99.5%, demonstrating its practical utility. By fusing moiety-aware tokenizer with scalable attention\u2011based learning, HELENA establishes a new paradigm for rational electrolyte discovery and paves the way for generative, closed\u2011loop design workflows of exploring multicomponent chemical systems beyond energy.","date":"2025-05-02","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0"}

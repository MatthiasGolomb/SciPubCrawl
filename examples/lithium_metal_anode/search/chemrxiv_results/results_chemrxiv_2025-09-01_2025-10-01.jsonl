However, lithium dendrite penetration and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation hinder stable cycling at high current densities. This work presents a synergistic strategy to address these challenges by combining mild sintering of LPSCl pellets with the deposition of a lithium fluoride (LiF) passivation layer on 50 \u00b5m thick lithium metal. Optimized sintering at 80\u202f\u00b0C improves surface uniformity and densifies the LPSCl pellets, reducing porosity and increasing ionic conductivity. Complementarily, the deposition of a uniform 65\u202fnm LiF layer on lithium via electron beam evaporation, reduces interfacial resistance, and stabilizes SEI formation. This dual modification doubles the critical current density of lithium symmetric cells from 1.1 to 2.2\u202fmA\u202fcm-2. In full cells configurations with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes, remarkable cycling stability is achieved over 2700 cycles (at 1\u202fmA\u202fcm-2, 1.5 mAh\u202fcm-2), with 75% capacity retained after 1500 cycles. This study provides a practical approach for improving both SE pellet quality and lithium-SE interfacial stability, paving the way for the reliable implementation of thin lithium metal in next-generation ASSBs.

However, the models and experimental conditions often raise concerns about the reliability of the results. In this work, we present an extensive EIS study of lithium metal in the model electrolyte lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in tetraglyme, analyzing the system at equilibrium as a function of time, temperature, and salt concentration using a setup designed to minimize artifacts. We apply information theory to determine the number of independent degrees of freedom and constrain the number of Voigt elements used in fitting. Our analysis reveals strong correlations among processes, warranting caution when assigning physical meaning. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements are used to support the interpretation and provide complementary insights into the chemical nature of the interphase. The unique and extensive dataset we have collected, comprising over 12,000 highly reproducible impedance spectra, will serve as a valuable resource to the community for further analysis and for supporting additional modeling and experimental efforts.","date":"2025-09-18","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, their oxidative stability deteriorates rapidly under high-voltage conditions, restricting their practical deployment. Previous approaches to extend electrochemical stability have primarily relied on interphase engineering or molecular modifications, under the assumption that oxidative limits are intrinsic and fixed. In this study, we demonstrate that oxidation tolerance is dynamically compromised by lithium-ion (Li\u207a) concentration polarization during the charging process. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals localized Li\u207a depletion at the cathode interface, which disrupts Li\u2013O coordination in the PEO matrix. This depletion increases the electron density on ether oxygen atoms, elevating their HOMO energy and accelerating oxidative degradation. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) directly confirms the correlation between Li\u207a desolvation and HOMO energy elevation. It is further shown that incorporating immobile Mg\u00b2\u207a ions stabilizes Li\u207a coordination, suppresses this polarization-induced HOMO shift and restores oxidative resilience. The resulting Mg2+ doped membrane extends the electrochemical stability window from 4.2\u202fV to 4.6\u202fV and supports over 200 cycles in NMC811||PEO||Li cells with suppressed interfacial degradation. These findings uncover a previously overlooked degradation pathway and establish a new framework for designing oxidation-tolerant polymer electrolytes via ionic coordination engineering.","date":"2025-09-17","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Analytical Chemistry; Energy; Electrochemical Analysis; Spectroscopy (Anal.

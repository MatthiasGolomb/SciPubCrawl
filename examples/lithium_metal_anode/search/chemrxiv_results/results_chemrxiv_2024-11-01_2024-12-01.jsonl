In our work, we show that those design metrics fail to account for performance differences in new high-performing electrolytes whereas galvanic corrosion does. This insight regarding the importance of galvanic corrosion is enabled by the combination of machine learning with rigorous experimental characterization. First, we partition our electrolyte data into low and high Coulombic efficiency (CE) segments to obtain an interpretable machine learning model which informs the design of high-performing (high CE) electrolytes. We design new model-guided, high-performing electrolytes and use spectroscopy and electroanalytical methods to demonstrate the weak correlation between common design metrics and performance in the high-performing electrolytes. Our work results in the design of a high-performing electrolyte with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6%, a new understanding that common performance indicators are not sufficient for informing the development of high-performing electrolytes, and the identification of galvanic corrosion as an important performance driver in high-performing electrolytes.","date":"2024-11-05","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces; Materials Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With this model, we simulated several chronoamperometry experiments considering different deposition probabilities, i.e. cell overpotentials. Since the planar geometry induces an ion concentration gradient profile that continues to evolve toward the bulk electrolyte, we studied the influence of the lithium reservoir and rationalized its role in the real system. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is conceptualized as a thin layer whose thickness determines the ion diffusion profile. Additionally, the impact of dendrite formations on electrode roughness and current density profiles was analyzed by comparison with test simulations assuming inhibited dendrite growth. By presenting current density profiles in quantitatively meaningful units, our work narrows the gap for further comparison with experimental measurements. The util- ity of our simulations for determining the electrode area in lithium metal batteries is addressed.","date":"2024-11-07","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC 4.0"}

Glassy or amorphous solid electrolytes could bring crucial benefits, but their lack of periodicity impedes structure-derived material design. Here, we report an approach for glassy electrolyte design based on well-defined lithium metal oxychloride linear oligomers. By packing these oligomers formed by oxygen-bridged chloroaluminates, a glassy solid model is constructed. Li ions in mixed-anion coordination with distorted polyhedra favor good lithium conductivity (1.3 mS.cm-1 at 30 \u00b0C). The frustrated Li-ion geometry and non-crystallinity promote conformational dynamics of the oligomer backbone that generates mechanical plasticity. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations depict the conformational motion that resembles that of organic molecules. Our all-solid-state battery based on this solid electrolyte shows exceptional long term electrochemical stability with a high-nickel NCM cathode. This work shows the impact of targeted structure models for rational design of glassy plastic electrolytes.","date":"2024-11-15","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

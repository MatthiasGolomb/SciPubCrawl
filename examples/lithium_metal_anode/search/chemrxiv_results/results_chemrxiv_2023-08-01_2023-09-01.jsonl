Despite recent progresses achieved in designing and synthesizing  novel fluoroether solvents, a systematic understanding of how fluorination patterns impact electrolyte performance is still lacking. We investigate the effects of fluorination patterns on fluorinated 1,2-diethoxyethane (FDEE) as electrolyte solvents. By employing quantum calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and interpretable machine learning, we establish significant correlations between fluorination patterns and electrolyte properties. Higher fluorination levels enhance FDEE stability but decrease conductivity.  The symmetry of fluorination sites is critical for stability and viscosity, while exerting minimal influence on ionic conductivity.  FDEEs with highly symmetric fluorination sites exhibit favorable viscosity, stability, and overall electrolyte performance.  Conductivity primarily depends on lithium-anion dissociation or association.  These findings provide design principles for rational fluoroether electrolyte design, emphasizing the trade-offs between stability, viscosity, and conductivity.  Our work underscores the significance of considering fluorination patterns and molecular symmetry in the development of electrolytes for advanced lithium metal batteries.","date":"2023-08-02","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Myriads of strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of polymer electrolytes, but with little success, and the state-of-the-art polymer electrolytes are still based on LiTFSI dissolved in PEO, which have been proposed for more than 40 years. New design concepts are indispensable to improving the performance of SPEs. Using molecular dynamics simulation,  we examine SPEs under nanoscale confinement, which has been demonstrated to accelerate the diffusion of neutral molecules such as water. While ion diffusion indeed shows an acceleration by more than two orders when the channel diameter decreases from 15~nm to 2~nm, the ionic conductivity does not show a paralleling increase. Instead, as the nanochannel diameter decreases,  ionic conductivity shows a non-monotonic variation, with an optimal value above yet on the same order as its bulk counterparts. The reason for this trend is due to enhanced ion association with decreasing channel size, which leaves a smaller amount of effective charge carriers. This effect competes with accelerated ion diffusion, leading to  the non-monotonicity in ion conductivity. We further show that this trend also appears in two-dimensional nanoslit pores. These findings not only manifest the intricacies of ionic transport behavior but also provide new concepts and necessary implications for designing composite SPEs.","date":"2023-08-02","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Replacing the low-capacity carbon anode with a safe, dendrite-free lithium anode provides a fast charge while reducing the cost of fabrication of a lithium battery, and increasing the cycle life of a rechargeable cell by eliminating the liquid-electrolyte ethylene-carbonate additive used to form a solid-electrolyte interphase passivation layer on the anode that is unstable during cycling.

Meanwhile, its molecule facilitates smooth lithium plating/stripping, and promotes the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface to suppress side-reactions. Moreover, the proportion of ionic liquid in the electrolyte influences the reaction mechanism, and a high proportion leads to the formation of amorphous lithium peroxide and a long cycling life (> 200 cycles).

However, the redox mediators usually introduce undesirable reactions. In particular, the so-called \"shuttle effect\" leads to the loss of both the redox mediators and electrical energy efficiency. In this study, an organic compound, triethylsulfonium iodide, is found to act bifunctionally as both a redox mediator and a solid electrolyte interphase-forming agent for lithium-oxygen batteries. During charging, the organic iodide exhibits comparable lithium peroxide-oxidizing capability with inorganic iodides. Meanwhile, it in situ generates an interfacial layer on lithium anode via reductive ethyl detaching and the subsequent oxidation. This layer prevents the lithium anode from reacting with the redox mediators and allows efficient lithium-ion transfer leading to dendrite-free lithium anode.

To circumvent the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and to improve the interfacial properties of the electrolyte with the lithium metal anode, numerous tactics have been employed. Therefore, in this work, hybrid electrolytes composed of room-temperature ionic liquids of different cations with the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anion and a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte [1 M LiTFSI in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether/1,3-dioxolane 1:1 (v/v)] have been prepared, and their physicoelectrochemical properties were thoroughly investigated. The lithium surface upon cycling was characterized by Raman, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The dendrite and shuttle current measurements also indicated the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase and lower polysulfide shuttling between the electrodes. Among the systems examined, the hybrid electrolyte composed of 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium TFSI exhibited appreciable charge-discharge characteristics, better interfacial properties with the lithium metal anode, and increased ionic conductivity which were attributed to the enhanced ion-pair interaction that is present between the 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium cation and the TFSI anion in the electrolyte which was substantiated by Raman analysis.", "affiliation": "CSIR-Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Karaikudi 630 003, India.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.8b03544"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6648866"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6648866?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 5, "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2019-08-29", "firstIndexDate": "2019-08-29", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-12", "dateOfRevision": "2020-10-01", "electronicPublicationDate": "2019-02-21", "firstPublicationDate": "2019-02-21"}

However, the formation of lithium dendrites and the continuous consumption of electrolyte during cycling lead to a serious safety problems. Developing stable lithium metal anode with uniform lithium deposition is highly desirable. Herein, a nitrogen plasma strengthening strategy is proposed for copper oxide nanosheet-decorated Cu foil as an advanced current collector, and deep insights into the plasma regulating mechanism are elaborated. The plasma-treated electrode can maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 99.6% for 500 cycles. The symmetric cell using the lithium-plated electrode can be cycled for more than 600 h with a low-voltage hysteresis (23.1 mV), which is much better than those of electrodes without plasma treatment. It is well confirmed that this plasma-induced nitrogen doping method can provide sufficient active sites for lithium nucleation to enhance the stability of lithium deposition on copper oxide nanosheets decorated on Cu foil and improve the electrical conductivity to greatly reduce the overpotential of the lithium nucleation, which can be extended to other modified current collectors for stable lithium metal anode.", "affiliation": "Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Power Sources College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Central South University Changsha 410083 P.

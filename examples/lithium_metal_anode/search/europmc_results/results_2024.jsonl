However, the practical application of flexible batteries faces great challenges, including the lack of good mechanical toughness of battery component materials and excellent adhesion between components, resulting in battery performance degradation or failure when subjected to different types of deformation. It is imperative to develop flexible batteries that can withstand deformation under different conditions and maintain stable battery performance. This paper reviews the latest research progress of flexible lithium batteries, from the research and development of new flexible battery materials, advanced preparation processes, and typical flexible structure design. First, the types of key component materials and corresponding modification technologies for flexible batteries are emphasized, mainly including carbon-based materials with flexibility, lithium anode materials, and solid-state electrolyte materials. In addition, the application of typical flexible structural designs (buckling, spiral, and origami) in flexible batteries is clarified, such as 3D printing and electrospinning, as well as advanced fabrication techniques commonly used in flexible materials and battery components. Finally, the limitations and coping strategies in the practical application of flexible lithium batteries are discussed, which provides new ideas for future research.", "affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["review-article", "Review", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Carbon Materials", "Flexible Electrodes", "Wearables", "Flexible Material Processing Technology", "Flexible Structure Design"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14221856"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11597871"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11597871?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 1, "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-11-26", "firstIndexDate": "2024-11-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-11-29", "dateOfRevision": "2024-11-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-11-20", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-11-20"}

Ensuring long-term cycle stability relies heavily on the stability of the interface between the electrode and electrolyte in Li|LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCM811) batteries. In this work, a denser, more stable and thinner nickel-rich cathode/electrolyte interface was constructed by electrolyte engineering with succinonitrile (SN) as an additive. The increase of organic compound content in the formed Ni-rich cathode/electrolyte interface can fully release the stress and strain generated during repetitive charge-discharge processes, and significantly reduce the irreversible phase transition during the nickel-rich cathode charge-discharge processes. Additionally, this interface impedes the breakdown of electrolytes and the dissolution of transition metals. Furthermore, the addition of SN additives also forms a more stable lithium metal anode/electrolyte interface. Notably, batteries containing SN additives (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt%) show excellent electrochemical performance compared to base electrolytes. Particularly, the improvement is most significant with an SN addition of 1.0 wt%. After 250 cycles at 1C rate, the capacity retention rate of the battery improved by 32.8%. Thus, this work provides a new perspective for simultaneously constructing a stable interface of nickel-rich cathode and lithium metal anode with a high energy density in lithium metal batteries.", "affiliation": "School of Materials Science & Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology Beijing 100081 P.R.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach by developing a composite separator, termed PVDF-INO, which integrates In(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (INO) into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to create a 12 \u03bcm thick layer. This addition significantly enhances the interaction between the separator and the electrolyte, creating a lithophilic matrix that ensures an even distribution of lithium ions. This uniform ion distribution promotes consistent lithium deposition and dissolution, resulting in a durable, dendrite-free lithium metal anode. Moreover, the PVDF-INO separator not only enhances the affinity with electrolytes but also maintains stable lithium-ion flux, which is essential for reliable and safe battery operation. Consequently, it sustains operation over 750 h in a Li||Li symmetric battery configuration, with a low overpotential of just 28 mV. Additionally, full cells equipped with LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathodes and the PVDF-INO separator exhibit superior cycling performance, maintaining a capacity retention of 92.9% after 800 cycles at 1 C.

Usually, flame-retardant solvents are necessary to be used, but most of them would react with anode/cathode easily and cause serious interfacial instability, which is a big challenge for design and application of nonflammable GPEs. Here, a nonflammable GPE (SGPE) is developed by in situ polymerizing trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFMA) monomers with flame-retardant triethyl phosphate (TEP) solvents and LiTFSI-LiDFOB dual lithium salts. TEP is strongly anchored to PTFMA matrix via polarity interaction between -P\u2009=\u2009O and -CH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>. It reduces free TEP molecules, which obviously mitigates interfacial reactions, and enhances flame-retardant performance of TEP surprisingly. Anchored TEP molecules are also inhibited in solvation of Li<sup>+</sup>, leading to anion-dominated solvation sheath, which creates inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interface/cathode electrolyte interface layers. Such coordination structure changes Li<sup>+</sup> transport from sluggish vehicular to fast structural transport, raising ionic conductivity to 1.03\u00a0mS cm<sup>-1</sup> and transfer number to 0.41 at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. The Li|SGPE|Li cell presents highly reversible Li stripping/plating performance for over 1000\u00a0h at 0.1\u00a0mA\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup>, and 4.2\u00a0V LiCoO<sub>2</sub>|SGPE|Li battery delivers high average specific capacity\u2009>\u2009120\u00a0mAh g<sup>-1</sup> over 200 cycles.

Among various cathode materials in LMBs, LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCM811) is extensively employed because of its notably high specific capacity (over 200 mA h g<sup>-1</sup>) and comparatively lower cost. However, structural stress, nickel ions migration, and uneven Li<sup>+</sup> deposition in NCM811 particles lead to cracking, irreversible decomposition of active substances, and the growth of mossy Li dendrites, causing severe capacity decline and low Coulomb efficiency in LMBs. In this study, we introduce an effective ethoxyl additive, 2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-benzoic acid (2,5BTBA), directly into the carbonate electrolyte. This additive forms a dense and conductive macromolecular protective film on the NCM811 cathode and lithium metal anode during initial cycles, preventing electrode contact with the electrolyte. Consequently, it safeguards the cathode's structural integrity and enables dense lithium deposition. Adding 3 wt% 2,5BTBA, the Li/NCM811 battery retains a high capacity of 150.60 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> and 89.41% retention after 700 cycles at 0.5C, maintaining an average Coulomb efficiency of 99.13%.

The poor cycle life of Li-S batteries stems from their commonly adopted catholyte-mediated operating mechanism, where the shuttling of dissolved polysulfides results in active material loss on the sulfur cathode and surface corrosion on the lithium anode. Here, we report <i>in situ</i> formation of a quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSSE) on the metallic 1T phase molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) host that extends the lifetime of Li-S batteries. We find that the metallic 1T phase MoS<sub>2</sub> host is able to initiate the ring-opening polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), forming an integrated QSSE inside batteries. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis reveals that the QSSE consists of \u223c13% liquid DOL in a solid polymer matrix. The QSSE efficiently mediates sulfur redox reactions through dissolution-conversion chemistry while simultaneously suppressing polysulfide shuttling. Therefore, while ensuring high sulfur utilization, it avoids degradation of both electrodes, as well as the concomitant electrolyte consumption, leading to enhanced cycling stability. Under a practical lean electrolyte condition (electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio = 2 \u03bcL mg<sup>-1</sup>), Li-S pouch cell batteries with the QSSE demonstrate a capacity retention of 80.7% after 200 cycles, much superior to conventional liquid electrolyte cells that fail within 70 cycles. The QSSE also enables Li-S pouch cell batteries to operate across a wider temperature range (5 to 45 \u00b0C), together with improved safety under mechanical damage.", "affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0FS, U.K.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "EP/L016087/1", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "King&apos;s College Cambridge, University of Cambridge", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/S003053/1", "agency": "Faraday Institution", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "FIRG014", "agency": "Faraday Institution", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "FIRG012", "agency": "Faraday Institution", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/P024947/1", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/R00661X/1", "agency": "Henry Royce Institute", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/S003053/1", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/T001038/1", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Quasi-solid-state Electrolyte", "Li\u2212s Battery", "Cycle Life", "Metallic 1T Phase", "2D Mos2"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c05002"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c05002"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11191740"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11191740?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 3, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-06-04", "firstIndexDate": "2024-06-05", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-06-24", "dateOfRevision": "2024-06-23", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-06-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-06-04"}

Recent studies have shown that bioinspired hydrophobic materials with low specific surface energies can protect battery components from corrosion caused by humid air. Air-stable inorganic materials that densely cover the surface of battery components can also provide protection, which improves the storage stability of the battery components, broadens their processing conditions, and ultimately decreases their processing costs while enhancing their safety.

high ionic conductivity, the sulfide-type solid electrolyte (SE) can potentially realize all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Nevertheless, challenges, including limited electrochemical stability, insufficient solid-solid contact with the electrode, and reactivity with lithium, must be addressed. These challenges contribute to dendrite growth and electrolyte reduction. Herein, a straightforward and solvent-free method was devised to generate a robust artificial interphase between lithium metal and a SE. It is achieved through the incorporation of a composite electrolyte composed of Li<sub>6</sub>PS<sub>5</sub>Cl (LPSC), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), resulting in the in situ creation of a LiF-rich interfacial layer. This interphase effectively mitigates electrolyte reduction and promotes lithium-ion diffusion. Interestingly, including PEG as an additive increases mechanical strength by enhancing adhesion between sulfide particles and improves the physical contact between the LPSC SE and the lithium anode by enhancing the ductility of the LPSC SE. Moreover, it acts as a protective barrier, preventing direct contact between the SE and the Li anode, thereby inhibiting electrolyte decomposition and reducing the electronic conductivity of the composite SE, thus mitigating the dendrite growth. The Li|Li symmetric cells demonstrated remarkable cycling stability, maintaining consistent performance for over 3000 h at a current density of 0.1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and the critical current density of the composite solid electrolyte (CSE) reaches 4.75 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Moreover, the all-solid-state lithium metal battery (ASSLMB) cell with the CSEs exhibits remarkable cycling stability and rate performance. This study highlights the synergistic combination of the in-situ-generated artificial SE interphase layer and CSEs, enabling high-performance ASSLMBs.", "affiliation": "Nano-electrochemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei City 106, Taiwan.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "111-3116-F-011-004", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "AS-KPQ-106-DDPP", "agency": "Academia Sinica", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "112-2923-E-011-001", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "112-2923-E-011-004-MY3", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Ministry of edutation, Taiwan", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "112-2923-E-011-005-", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "111-3116-F-011-006", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "112-2639-E-011-001-ASP", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Lithium Metal Anode", "Solid-state Battery", "Interfacial Stability", "Dendrite Suppression", "In Situ Lif Generation", "Solvent-free Solid Sulfide Composite Electrolyte"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c14763"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c14763"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10910511"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10910511?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 2, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-02-15", "firstIndexDate": "2024-02-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-03-06", "dateOfRevision": "2024-03-06", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-02-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-02-15"}

While this concept has many attractive aspects from a manufacturing and energy density standpoint, stable plating and stripping remain challenging. We have investigated gold, platinum, and amorphous carbon as seed layers placed between the copper current collector and the lithium phosphorus oxynitride thin-film solid electrolyte. These layers guide lithium nucleation and improve the plating and stripping dynamics. All seed layers facilitate reversible lithium plating and stripping even at high current densities up to 8 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Of particular note is the amorphous carbon seed layer, which allowed a significant reduction in plating potential from 300 mV to as low as 50 mV.

Yet, this process results in brittle electrolytes prone to fracture during manufacturing. To address these difficulties, solvent-free solid-state electrolytes with a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) coating on LLZTO particles are reported in this work. Most notably, the PAN-coated LLZTO (PAN@LLZTO) electrolyte demonstrates self-supporting characteristics, eliminating the need for high-temperature sintering.

It is well known that the most commonly used ether based electrolyte solvents in Li-S batteries have a lower flash point and higher volatility than the ester electrolyte solvents in Li-ion batteries. Hence, lithium-sulfur batteries have greater safety risks than lithium-ion batteries. Herein, ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN), which is commonly used as a flame retardant for ester electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries, is utilized as both a film-forming electrolyte additive and a flame retardant additive for the ether electrolyte to investigated its applicability in Li-S batteries. It is found that the ether electrolyte containing PFPN not only has good flame retardant properties and a wide potential window of about 5 V, but also can form a stable SEI film on the surface of a lithium anode. As a result, with the ether-based electrolyte containing 10 wt% PFPN, Li-Cu and Li-S batteries all delivered a stable cycling performance with a high coulombic Efficiency and a long-lifespan performance, which were all superior to the batteries using the ether-based electrolyte without PFPN.

Here, we discuss experimental approaches developed by some of the authors to understand the function and failure of lithium-oxygen batteries. For example, experiments in which nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to quantify dissolved oxygen concentrations and diffusivity are described. <sup>17</sup>O magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra of electrodes extracted from batteries at different states of charge (SOC) allowed the electrolyte decomposition products at each stage to be determined. For instance, the formation of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and LiOH in a dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent and their subsequent removal on charging was followed. Redox mediators have been used to chemically reduce oxygen or to chemically oxidise Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in order to prevent electrode clogging by insulating compounds, which leads to lower capacities and rapid degradation; the studies of these mediators represent an area where NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies could play a role in unravelling reaction mechanisms. Finally, recently developed coupled <i>in situ</i> NMR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are used to characterise the charge transport mechanism in lithium symmetric cells and to distinguish between electronic and ionic transport, demonstrating the formation of transient (soft) shorts in common lithium-oxygen electrolytes.

In this instance, stable SEI and CEI interface layers are constructed, and a 4.7\u00a0V high-voltage solid copolymer electrolyte (PAFP) with a fluoro-cyanogen group is generated by polymer molecular engineering. As a result, PAFP has an exceptionally broad electrochemical window (5.5\u00a0V), a high Li<sup>+</sup> transference number (0.71), and an ultrahigh ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm<sup>-2</sup>) at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, the Li||Li symmetric cell possesses excellent interface stability and 2000 stable cycles at 1\u00a0mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The LCO|PAFP|Li batteries have a 73.7% retention capacity after 1200 cycles. Moreover, it still has excellent cycling stability at a high charging voltage of 4.7\u00a0V.

CSEs are now capable of achieving homogeneous and fast Li-ion flux, but how to escape the trade-off between mechanical modulus and adhesion is still a challenge. Herein, a strategy to address this issue is proposed, that is, intercalating highly conductive, homogeneous, and viscous-fluid ionic conductors into robust coordination laminar framework to construct laminar solid electrolyte with homogeneous and fast Li-ion conduction (LSE-HFC). A 9\u00a0\u00b5m-thick LSH-HFC, in which poly(ethylene oxide)/succinonitrile is adsorbed by coordination laminar framework with metal-organic framework nanosheets as building blocks, is used here as an example to determine the validity. The Li-ion transfer mechanism is verified and works across the entire LSE-HFC, which facilitates homogeneous Li-ion flux and low migration energy barriers, endowing LSE-HFC with high ionic conductivity of 5.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup>\u00a0S\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> and Li-ion transference number of 0.78 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Combining the outstanding mechanical strength against punctures and the enhanced adhesion force with electrodes, LSE-HFC harvests uniform Li plating/stripping behavior.

This capacity gain is correlated with an observed electrochemically activated nanorestructuring of the cathode, characterized by cycling-induced coarsening (from 2.8 to 4.2 nm) of the metallic iron phase and its accumulation near the current collector interface, as well as lithium fluoride phase accumulation near the LiPON interface.", "affiliation": "Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics, Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"agency": "ETH Z??rich Foundation", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "SI/502460-01", "agency": "Eidgen??ssisches Departement f??r Umwelt, Verkehr, Energie und Kommunikation", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "95817", "agency": "European Commission", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Dutch Research Council (NWO)", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Thin film", "Li-ion Battery", "Battery", "Iron Fluoride", "Solid-state Battery", "Conversion Cathode", "Lipon"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.3c10146"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10851659"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10851659?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 1, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-01-29", "firstIndexDate": "2024-01-30", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-02-10", "dateOfRevision": "2024-02-10", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-01-29", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-01-29"}

"An anion-rich electric double\u00a0layer (EDL) region is favorable for fabricating an inorganic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) towards stable lithium metal anode in ester electrolyte. Herein, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), a cationic surfactant, is adopted to draw more anions into EDL by ionic interactions that shield the repelling force on anions during lithium plating. In situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy results combined with molecular dynamics simulations validate the enrichment of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/FSI<sup>-</sup> anions in the EDL region due to the positively charged CTA<sup>+</sup>. In-depth analysis of SEI structure by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry results confirmed the formation of the inorganic-rich SEI, which helps improve the kinetics of Li<sup>+</sup> transfer, lower the charge transfer activation energy, and homogenize Li deposition. As a result, the Li||Li symmetric cell in the designed electrolyte displays a prolongated cycling time from 500 to 1300\u00a0h compared to that in the blank electrolyte at 0.5\u00a0mA\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup> with a capacity of 1\u00a0mAh\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup>. Moreover, Li||LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and Li||LiCoO<sub>2</sub> with a high cathode mass loading of\u2009>\u200910\u00a0mg\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup> can be stably cycled over 180 cycles.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 3, Singapore, 117543, Singapore.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Cationic surfactant", "Electric Double Layer", "Lithium Metal Batteries", "Solid\u2013Electrolyte Interphase", "Lithium Nitrate Additive"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-024-01364-x"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-024-01364-x"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10912072"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10912072?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 5, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-03-04", "firstIndexDate": "2024-03-04", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-03-07", "dateOfRevision": "2024-10-11", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-03-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-03-04"}

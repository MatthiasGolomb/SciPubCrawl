Unfortunately, post-mortem methods reveal failure outcomes but often miss dynamic progressions, obscuring cause-and-effect relationships in failure evolution. Leveraging domain knowledge informed machine learning and a 4-year dataset of over 18\u00a0000 cycles and 12 million data points, from cells cycled to failure, we uncovered a correlation between initial lithium plating/stripping behavior and subsequent anode changes, enabling the identification of early indicators for distinct failure types. Our model accurately predicts failure types using only the first two cycles, less than 2% of the data, demonstrating the effectiveness of initial curve features as electrochemical fingerprints. Key electrochemical fingerprints describing lithium microstructure and its interphase with the electrolyte are validated to be critical to kinetics and reversibility degradation. Specifically, the fingerprints influence the formation of ineffective interphase regions (lacking intimate contact with the lithium metal) and inactive lithium, which in turn lengthen charge carrier (lithium-ion and electron) transport paths, leading to poorer kinetics and reversibility. The fingerprints and model generalize well across typical published electrolyte systems with low misidentification, demonstrating versatility and practicality. Broadly, this study using a pre-mortem prediction method deepens understanding of lithium metal anode failure mechanisms by uncovering the root causes of kinetics and reversibility degradation from fingerprints hidden in initial cycles instead of a post-mortem manner, facilitating the rapid assessment of battery reliability and development of electrolytes.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "2021YFB2500200", "agency": "National Key Research and Development Program of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "U21A20174", "agency": "Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "2023A1515110069", "agency": "Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "52402276", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "KQTD20210811090112002", "agency": "Shenzhen Science and Technology Program", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "2021ZT09L197", "agency": "Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Machine Learning", "Failure Mechanism", "Lithium Metal Batteries", "Lithium Metal Anodes", "Electrochemical Curves"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaf158"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12153722"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12153722?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 2, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2025-06-13", "firstIndexDate": "2025-06-15", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-06-13", "dateOfRevision": "2025-06-14", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-04-24", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-04-24"}

However, the high reactivity of lithium leads to side reactions with the electrolyte and dendritic growth which hinder their commercial application. In this study, a lithium metal anode material with a three-dimensional nanostructured interface was prepared through interfacial modification engineering. The linear flexible molecular chains of the chelating agent, which crosslink with lithium stearate, result in a highly entangled, strong, and flexible three-dimensional porous structure of composite lithium soap fibers.

This enhances the stability of the SEI layer and the Li<sup>+</sup> transport rate. The large specific surface area and abundant pores provide more reaction sites for lithium deposition and stripping. The unique mesh-like molecular structure, with high liquid transport performance, regulates the distribution of the electrolyte and homogenizes the lithium ion flux, effectively suppressing dendritic growth. The Li@DA symmetrical coin cells exhibits a long-term cycling performance of over 6800 hours, and the full battery maintains a high capacity retention of 92.04% after 530 cycles at a 2C rate with a high loading of 12 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>.

Herein, we present an innovative method that improves interface stability without adversely affecting the bulk electrolyte's structural stability. By employing ZSM molecular sieves as efficient ion channels on the lithium metal anode surface-termed ZSM electrolytes-a more aggregated solvation structure is induced at the lithium metal interface, resulting in an anion-rich interphase.

However, under high-rate charge and discharge conditions, lithium metal anodes are susceptible to dendrite formation, compromising battery safety. Creating multifunctional separators offers an effective and cost-efficient solution for addressing fast charging and safety challenges in LMBs. This study proposes a method to prepare a functional separator by in situ growing a polydopamine copper chelate (PDA(Cu)) coating on a polypropylene (PP)/polyethylene (PE)/PP separator (PP/PE/PP@PDA(Cu)). The PDA(Cu) exhibits excellent electrolyte wetting properties and ion exclusion effects, contributing to high ionic conductivity (5.02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-</sup>\u2074 S\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup>) and high lithium-ion (Li<sup>+</sup>) transference number (0.776). Owing to its strong adhesion to the lithium metal anode, the coating significantly suppresses the formation of lithium dendrites. The Li||Li symmetric cell with a PP/PE/PP@PDA(Cu) separator demonstrates highly stable lithium plating-stripping cycles, lasting over 900 h. Additionally, the PDA(Cu) promotes the formation of a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film on the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode surface. The LiFePO<sub>4</sub>||Li cell with a PP/PE/PP@PDA(Cu) separator maintains 85.1% of its capacity after 6000 cycles at 10 C.

"Electrolyte solidification holds great promise in addressing safety concerns. Nevertheless, integrating high electrochemical stability and intrinsic interfacial compatibility remains challenging for high-voltage lithium metal batteries. Herein, we report an ion-percolative quasi-solid electrolyte via concentration-driven self-assembly. At a concentration threshold (LiFSI(FEC)<sub>x</sub>, x\u00a0=\u00a00.37), the system triggers spontaneous crystallization of LiFSI to form a rigid, nonflammable framework at room temperature and generates dispersed [LiFSI-FEC] ionic clusters that simultaneously percolate within grain boundaries. This unique ion-percolative architecture (nano-LiFSI skeleton\u00a0+\u00a0[LiFSI-FEC] cluster network) enables autonomous Li-ion highways between dynamic clusters along grain boundaries of salt. The optimized electrolyte achieves a high ionic conductivity of 2.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> S/cm and an exceptional Li\u207a transference number (0.75) at room temperature.

electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) is critical for developing lithium metal batteries with high energy density, enhanced safety, and broad applicability. Lithium nitrate (LiNO<sub>3</sub>) is an attractive sacrificial additive for lithium metal anode, while its poor solubility in high-voltage-resistant ester/nitrile electrolytes severely limits its utility. To solve it, a novel suspension electrolyte strategy is proposed that uniformly disperses LiNO<sub>3</sub> particles in an ester/nitrile mixed electrolyte to stabilize the electrode interface. The suspended LiNO<sub>3</sub> particles exhibit dual functionality: LiNO<sub>3</sub> enhances the compatibility between the electrode and the electrolyte by affecting the Li<sup>+</sup> solvation environment and preferentially adsorb on the electrode surface; moreover, the in situ formed LiN<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>-rich EEI by LiNO<sub>3</sub> decomposition with accelerated Li\u207a transport kinetics, effectively suppresses parasitic reactions and improves rate performance. The optimized electrolyte makes Li||NCM523 battery run stably for 100 cycles with a high capacity retention of 90.05% at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and stably operated at low temperature (-10\u00a0\u00b0C). Moreover, the electrolyte shows excellent electrochemical stability at a high-voltage of 4.5\u00a0V.

The first is the trade-off between ionic conductivity (\u03c3) and lithium anode reactions, closely related to high-content residual solvents. The second, usually consciously overlooked, is the fluoropolymer's inherent instability against alkaline lithium anodes. Here, we propose indium-based metal-organic frameworks (In-MOFs) as a multifunctional promoter to simultaneously address these two challenges, using poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVH) as the typical fluoropolymer. In-MOF plays a trio: (1) adsorbing and converting free residual solvents into bonded states to prevent their side reactions with lithium anodes while retaining their advantages on Li<sup>+</sup> transport; (2) forming inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase layers to prevent PVH from reacting with lithium anodes and promote uniform lithium deposition without dendrite growth; (3) reducing PVH crystallinity and promoting Li-salt dissociation. Therefore, the resulting PVH/In-MOF (PVH-IM) showcases excellent electrochemical stability against lithium anodes, delivering a 5550\u00a0h cycling at 0.2\u00a0mA\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup> with a remarkable cumulative lithium deposition capacity of 1110 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup>.

of anode-free batteries presents an attractive approach to the lithium metal battery. However, challenges such as uneven plating of lithium and poor Coulombic efficiency limit their commercially viable applications. In response to these challenges, this study introduces poly{(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)-<i>co</i>-(butyl acrylate)} (PAMPS-<i>co</i>-PBA), an artificial interface engineered to enhance the cyclic stability of batteries by fortifying the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and enabling self-healing and single-ion conductivity. Synthesis outcomes, validated by FTIR and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, demonstrate successful production of PAMPS-<i>co</i>-PBA. Experimental results, including analyses of surface morphology, tensile strength, and Li plating/stripping tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of PAMPS-<i>co</i>-PBA in preventing dendrite formation and achieving >99% Coulombic efficiency. SEM analysis reveals better surface morphology and minimal lithium deposits for PAMPS-<i>co</i>-PBA compared with bare copper and other alternative interfaces. XPS analysis confirms the self-healing and single-ion conducting attributes of PAMPS-<i>co</i>-PBA postcycling. Density functional theory calculations elucidates the interface's behavior, confirming a pathway for Li-ion movement facilitated by the sulfonic acid group. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations highlight the potential for SEI formation, shedding light on the influence of LiTFSI on interface protection. Anode-free full cell testing demonstrates PAMPS-<i>co</i>-PBA enhancement in stability over bare copper, with 1.6 times capacity retention over 50 cycles, primarily attributed to self-healing and dendrite suppression. Nonetheless, observed capacity fading after prolonged cycling suggests the optimization of Li salt choice.

However, their practical use is largely hindered by the uncontrollable growth of dendrites and intricate problems associated with fabricating anodes that meet capacity requirements. Here, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin ZnF<sub>2</sub> layer deposited on the copper foil can produce a novel and efficient current collector to address these challenges. It is observed that ZnF<sub>2</sub> can be transformed into LiZn alloy and LiF salt in one step by simple electrochemical activation. The resulting LiZn alloy exhibits high lithiophilicity, which reduces overpotential and promotes uniform lithium nucleation, while the LiF salt enhances the solid electrolyte interphase, ensuring uniform lithium growth. This synergistic effect led to a dendrite-free, densely packed lithium anode with an extended lifespan, achieving over 900\u00a0h in symmetric cells at a high current density of 3\u00a0mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a high cut-off capacity of 3 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup>.

To address these issues, tuning lithium deposition by structuring a host for the lithium metal anode has been recognized as an efficient method. Herein, we report a supercritical water molecular scissor-controlled strategy to form a carbon framework derived from biomass wood. Proximate-supercritical water treatment is used to selectively cleave the \u03b2-O-4 bonds in lignin, with the extent of degradation controlled by adjusting the treatment environment's acidity. The enhanced thermal power of supercritical water molecules significantly accelerates the etching rate of lignin, increasing the porosity and permeability of the transformed carbon framework. Experimental results and multi-physics simulations show that the interconnected carbon-based pores and inner skeletal multilevel hierarchical structure facilitate rapid electron and ion transfer during battery operation and enhance electrolyte infiltration. Impressively, the as-obtained lithium metal anode exhibits long-term cycling stability for over 2000 hours at 0.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with low voltage overpotential.

In this study, succinonitrile (SN) is incorporated into a PEO composite electrolyte to fabricate an electrode-compatible electrolyte with good electrochemical performance. The SN-doped electrolyte successfully inhibits the lithium dendrite growth and facilitates the SEI layer formation, as determined by the operando nanofocus wide-angle X-ray scattering (nWAXS), meanwhile, stably cycled over 500 h in Li/SN-PEO/Li cell. Apart from the observation of lithium dendrite, the robust SEI layer formation mechanism in the first cycle is investigated in the SN-enhanced composite electrolyte by nWAXS.

lithium anode batteries. However, the underlying mechanism still remains under debate, due in part to a lack of in situ atomic-level observations of the dendrite penetration process. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reproduce the dynamic process of dendrite nucleation and penetration. Our findings reveal that dynamically generated lithium depositions lead to a continuous accumulation of internal stress, culminating in fracture of the solid electrolyte at dendrite tips. We demonstrate that the classical Griffith theory remains effective in assessing this fracture mode, but it is necessary to consider the electrochemical impact of local lithium ion concentration on the fracture toughness. Additionally, in polycrystalline solid electrolytes, we observe that dendrite nuclei within grains typically deflect towards and propagate along grain boundaries.

We showcase that the TFEE-DOL LHCE has a as high as 0.65 but, on the other hand, exhibits low Coulombic efficiency (<90%) and poor stability <i>vs</i> Li metal anodes, <i>i.e.</i>, in a lithium metal battery (LMB) setting. In contrast, the TFEE-DME LHCE shows high Coulombic efficiency (98.9%) and stability, despite a much lower (0.25). A significant migration resistance through the porous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for the former is the likely explanation, as revealed by EIS and assisted by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. We thus find the interfacial properties at the Li metal anode to be more crucial than the ionic transport through the bulk of the electrolyte for LMB performance.

However, the low-temperature Li metal batteries suffer from dendrite formation and dead Li resulting from uneven Li behaviors of flux with huge desolvation/diffusion barriers, thus leading to short\u00a0lifespan and safety concern. Herein, differing from electrolyte engineering, a strategy of delocalizing electrons with generating rich active sites to regulate Li<sup>+</sup> desolvation/diffusion behaviors are demonstrated via decorating polar chemical groups on porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). As comprehensively indicated by theoretical simulations, electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopies, electron microscope, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry, the sieving kinetics of desolvation is not merely relied on pore size morphology but also significantly affected by the \u2500NH<sub>2</sub> polar chemical groups,\u00a0reducing energy barriers for realizing non-dendritic and smooth Li metal plating.

However, they have so far only been demonstrated in an \"open-system\" with continuous gas supply, preventing practical application. Here, the utilization and reversibility of SO<sub>2</sub> along with the lithium stability are addressed, all essential for long-life, high-energy batteries. The study discovers that high SO<sub>2</sub> utilization is achievable only from SO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in electrolytes between the lithium anode and carbon cathode. This results from a unique osmosis phenomenon where SO<sub>2</sub> consumption increases salt concentration, driving the influx of organic solvents rather than SO<sub>2</sub> from outside the current path. This insight leads to configure a bobbin-cell with all electrolytes between the electrodes, realizing nearly 70% of SO<sub>2</sub> utilization, >\u00a012x greater than in conventional coin cells. To improve reaction rate and SO<sub>2</sub> reversibility, triphenylamine is employed to the electrolyte, creating an electron-rich environment that alleviates the disproportionation of discharge products. Incorporating this additive into a bobbin-cell with a lithium protective layer yields a cell with a projected energy density exceeding 183.2\u00a0Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>.

It consists of the following steps to reduce the loss of active sulfur and sulfides migrating in the liquid electrolyte to the anode and add electrocatalyst groups in the cathode or catholyte: (i) A hollow porous nanoparticle coating cathode host with a pseudocapacitive PEDOT:PSS binder that also contributes to trapping polysulfides. (ii) A thin interlayer of B-N-graphene (BNG) nanoplatelets on the above cathode trapping polysulfides while participating in the electron transfer and acting as an electrocatalyst, thus ensuring that the trapped sulfides remain active in the cathode. (iii) Added semiconductor phthalocyanine VOPc or CoPc to form an electrocatalyst network in the catholyte, trapping polysulfides and promoting their redox reactions with Li<sup>+</sup> ions.

batteries (LBs) are highly demanded in society owing to the high theoretical capacity and low reduction potential of metallic lithium. They are expected to see increasing deployment in performance critical areas including electric vehicles, grid storage, space, and sea vehicle operations. Unfortunately, competitive performance cannot be achieved when LBs operating under extreme temperature conditions where the lithium-ion chemistry fail to perform optimally. In this review, a brief overview of the challenges in developing LBs for low temperature (<0\u00a0\u00b0C) and high temperature (>60\u00a0\u00b0C) operation are provided followed by electrolyte design strategies involving Li salt modification, solvation structure optimization, additive introduction, and solid-state electrolyte utilization for LBs are introduced. Specifically, the prospects of using lithium metal batteries (LMBs), lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries, and lithium oxygen (Li-O<sub>2</sub> ) batteries for performance under low and high temperature applications are evaluated. These three chemistries are presented as prototypical examples of how the conventional low temperature charge transfer resistances and high temperature side reactions can be overcome.

Consequently, lithium-air batteries fabricated with the passivated Li anodes demonstrate a superb cycling performance up to 2300\u00a0h (230 cycles at 1000\u00a0mAh\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> , 200\u00a0mA\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> ). More strikingly, the anode recycled thereafter can be recoupled with a fresh cathode to continuously run for 400 extended hours. Comprehensive time-lapse and ex situ microscopic and spectroscopic investigations are further carried out for elucidating the fundamentals behind the extraordinary air and electrochemical stability.", "affiliation": "Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Energy, Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "SYG201934", "agency": "Key Technology Initiative of Suzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "TD-XCL-006", "agency": "Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "TD\u2010XCL\u2010006", "agency": "Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "18KJA480004", "agency": "Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "51911540473", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "22072101", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "22075193", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Lithium-air Batteries", "Artificial Solid/electrolyte Interphase", "Chemical Vapor Depositio-grown Graphene", "Water-resistant Anodes"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100488"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8373161"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8373161?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 13, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-06-03", "firstIndexDate": "2021-06-04", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-08-26", "dateOfRevision": "2023-11-07", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-06-03", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-06-03"}

In this study, a sandwich gel polymer electrolyte (SGPE) with a thermal shutdown function was developed to resolve the safety issues. By adjustment of surface pore size of the SGPE, lithium dendrite growth is suppressed. Due to the sandwich structure design, the SGPE can effectively respond to an overheating environment, regulate lithium ion transport and inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrite, demonstrating a remarkably high safety of the batteries, especially at high temperature or under thermal runaway circumstances. In addition, the LiFePO<sub>4</sub>/SGPE/Li battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 135 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 1C and maintains high capacity retention (>95%) after 200 charge-discharge cycles.

stability. Most instability stems from the release and transport of polysulfides from the cathode, which causes mossy growth on the lithium anode, leading to continuous consumption of electrolyte. Therefore, development of a durable cathode with minimal polysulfide escape is critical. Here, we present a saccharide-based binder system that has a capacity for the regulation of polysulfides due to its reducing properties. Furthermore, the binder promotes the formation of viscoelastic filaments during casting which endows the sulfur cathode with a desirable web-like microstructure. Taken together this leads to 97% sulfur utilisation with a cycle life of 1000 cycles (9 months) and capacity retention (around 700 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 1000 cycles).

In this study, we propose the modification of single-ion conducting polyelectrolytes by designing novel block copolymers, which combine one block responsible for high ionic conductivity and the second block for improved mechanical properties and outstanding electrochemical stability. To synthesize such block copolymers, the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) monomer by the RAFT-agent having a terminal hydroxyl group is used. It allows for the preparation of a poly(carbonate) macro-RAFT precursor that is subsequently applied in RAFT copolymerization of lithium 1-[3-(methacryloyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate. The resulting single-ion conducting block copolymers show improved viscoelastic properties, good thermal stability (<i>T</i> <sub>onset</sub> up to 155 \u00b0C), sufficient ionic conductivity (up to 3.7 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup> at 70 \u00b0C), and high lithium-ion transference number (0.91) to enable high power. Excellent plating/stripping ability with resistance to dendrite growth and outstanding electrochemical stability window (exceeding 4.8 V vs Li<sup>+</sup>/Li at 70 \u00b0C) are also achieved, along with enhanced compatibility with composite cathodes, both LiNiMnCoO<sub>2</sub> - NMC and LiFePO<sub>4</sub> - LFP, as well as the lithium metal anode. Lab-scale truly solid-state Li/LFP and Li/NMC lithium-metal cells assembled with the single-ion copolymer electrolyte demonstrate reversible and very stable cycling at 70 \u00b0C delivering high specific capacity (up to 145 and 118 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, at a C/20 rate) and proper operation even at a higher current regime.

"Lithium-rich antiperovskites (LiRAPs) hold great promise to be the choice of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) owing to their high ionic conductivity, low activation energy, and low cost. However, processing sheet-type solid-state Li metal batteries (SSLiB) with LiRAPs remains challenging due to the lack of robust techniques for battery processing. Herein, we propose a scalable slurry-based procedure to prepare a flexible composite electrolyte (CPE), in which LiRAP (e.g., Li<sub>2</sub>OHCl<sub>0.5</sub>Br<sub>0.5</sub>, LOCB) and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) serve as an active filler and as a polymer scaffold, respectively. The low-polar solvent helps to stabilize the LiRAP phase during slurry processing. It is found that the addition of LOCB into the NBR polymer enhances the Li ion conductivity for 2.3 times at 60\u00b0C and reduces the activation energy (max. 0.07\u00a0eV). The as-prepared LOCB/NBR CPE film exhibits an improved critical current of 0.4\u00a0mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and can stably cycle for over 1000\u00a0h at 0.04\u00a0mA cm<sup>-2</sup> under 60\u00b0C. In the SSLiB with the sheet-type configuration of LiFePO<sub>4</sub>(LFP)||LOCB/NBR CPE||Li, LFP exhibits a capacity of 137\u00a0mAh/g under 60 at 0.1\u00b0C. This work delivers an effective strategy for fabrication of LiRAP-based CPE film, advancing the LiRAP-family SSEs toward practical applications.", "affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Solid State Batteries, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Solid-state Electrolyte", "Composite Electrolyte", "Solid-state Batteries", "Sheet-type", "Anti-Perovskite"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2021.744417"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8634478"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8634478?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 2, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-12-06", "firstIndexDate": "2021-12-15", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-12-13", "dateOfRevision": "2021-12-07", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-11-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-11-15"}

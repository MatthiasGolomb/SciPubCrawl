Analysis showed that this method gives a mixed spinel, i.e. (Co,Mn)3O4, having 2+ and 3+ Co and Mn ions in both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure, with a nanocubic morphology roughly 20 nm in size. The nanocubes are bound onto the rGO nanosheet uniformly in a single hydrothermal process, then the as-prepared (Co,Mn)3O4/rGO composite was characterized as the anode materials for Li-ion battery (LIB).

The growth of dendrites is a major barrier to the development of high capacity, rechargeable Li batteries with lithium metal anodes, and hence, significant efforts have been undertaken to develop new electrolytes and separator materials that can prevent this process or promote smooth deposits at the anode. Central to these goals, and to the task of understanding the conditions that initiate and propagate dendrite growth, is the development of analytical and nondestructive techniques that can be applied in situ to functioning batteries. MRI has recently been demonstrated to provide noninvasive imaging methodology that can detect and localize microstructure buildup. However, until now, monitoring dendrite growth by MRI has been limited to observing the relatively insensitive metal nucleus directly, thus restricting the temporal and spatial resolution and requiring special hardware and acquisition modes. Here, we present an alternative approach to detect a broad class of metallic dendrite growth via the dendrites' indirect effects on the surrounding electrolyte, allowing for the application of fast 3D (1)H MRI experiments with high resolution. We use these experiments to reconstruct 3D images of growing Li dendrites from MRI, revealing details about the growth rate and fractal behavior. Radiofrequency and static magnetic field calculations are used alongside the images to quantify the amount of the growing structures.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, New York University, New York, NY 10003;", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "-", "agency": "New York State Energy Research and Development Authority", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "CHE 1412064", "agency": "National Science Foundation", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "DE-AC02-05CH11231", "agency": "U.S. Department of Energy", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "DE-SC0001294", "agency": "U.S. Department of Energy", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "DE-SC0012583", "agency": "U.S. Department of Energy", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Li-ion Batteries", "Dendrite Growth", "In Situ Mri"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/39/10779.full.pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607903113"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5047163"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5047163?pdf=render"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607903113"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "N", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 42, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-01-18", "dateOfCreation": "2016-09-14", "firstIndexDate": "2016-09-17", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-09-12", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-09-12"}

The cycling performance of Li-S battery with this electrolyte shows a long cycle life (300 cycles) and high coulombic efficiency (>98%), without any consuming additives in the electrolyte. Moreover, it also shows a remarkably decreased self-discharge (only 0.2%) after storage for two weeks at room temperature.

The prevailing understanding is that LiNO3 reacts with metallic lithium anode to form a passivation layer which suppresses redox shuttles of lithium polysulfides, enabling good rechargeability of Li-S batteries. However, this view is seeing more challenges in the recent studies, and above all, the inability of inhibiting polysulfide reduction on Li anode. A closely related issue is the progressive reduction of LiNO3 on Li anode which elevates internal resistance of the cell and compromises its cycling stability. Herein, we systematically investigated the function of LiNO3 in redox-shuttle suppression, and propose the suppression as a result of catalyzed oxidation of polysulfides to sulfur by nitrate anions on or in the proximity of the electrode surface upon cell charging. This hypothesis is supported by both density functional theory calculations and the nitrate anions-suppressed self-discharge rate in Li-S cells. The catalytic mechanism is further validated by the use of ruthenium oxide (RuO2, a good oxygen evolution catalyst) on cathode, which equips the LiNO3-free cell with higher capacity and improved capacity retention over 400 cycles.", "affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), 2 Fusionopolis Way, Innovis #08-03, Singapore 138634, Republic of Singapore.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/182429"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep33154"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5024100"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5024100?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 24, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-05-16", "dateOfCreation": "2016-09-16", "firstIndexDate": "2016-09-18", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-09-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-09-15"}

In this study, a first-principles approach including density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations is employed to theoretically elucidate the Li2S/Li metal surface interactions and the nucleation and growth of a Li2S film on the anode surface due to long-chain polysulfide decomposition during battery operation. DFT analyses of the energetic properties and electronic structures demonstrate that a single molecule adsorption on Li surface releases energy forming chemical bonds between the S atoms and Li atoms from the anode surface. Reaction pathways of the Li2S film formation on Li metal surfaces are investigated based on DFT calculations. It is found that a distorted Li2S (111) plane forms on a Li(110) surface and a perfect Li2S (111) plane forms on a Li(111) surface. The total energy of the system decreases along the reaction pathway; hence Li2S film formation on the Li anode surface is thermodynamically favorable. The calculated difference charge density of the Li2S film/Li surface suggests that the precipitated film would interact with the Li anode via strong chemical bonds.

The FMF can facilitate charge transfer in the porous layer, rendering it electrochemically more active. In addition, the FMF acted as a robust scaffold to accommodate Li deposits compactly in its interstitial sites. The FMF-integrated Li metal (FMF/Li) electrode operated with a small polarisation even at a current density of 10\u2009mA cm(-2), and it exhibited a seven times longer cycle-life than that of an FMF-free Li electrode in a symmetric cell configuration.

By introducing lanthanum nitrate into electrolyte, a composite passivation film of lanthanum/lithium sulfides can be formed on metallic lithium anode, which is beneficial to decrease the reducibility of metallic lithium and slow down the electrochemical dissolution/deposition reaction on lithium anode for stabilizing the surface morphology of metallic Li anode in lithium-sulfur battery.

Several transition-metal vanadates, which can in situ form an elastic buffer to adapt the volume expansion during lithium uptake/removal, have recently attracted much attention as anode materials, since they have high capacity and superior cycling stability. Herein, Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanostructures are successfully fabricated for the first time by a facile hydrothermal method and also first studied as lithium ion anode material. The ultrathin Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity close to 900 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) over 100 cycles. Even at a high current rate of 5 A g(-1), capacity retention as high as 83% (by compared with the second discharge capacity) is still obtained after 500 cycles, showing a high-rate capability. Moreover, we also carefully investigated the lithium-storage mechanism of Zn2(OH)3VO3, and corresponding results reveal that the Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanosheets have in situ transformed into ZnO nanoparticles anchoring on lithiated vanadium oxides matrix. The synergistic effect of zinc and vanadium oxides upon lithium ions intercalation and the stable conductive skeleton of amorphous lithiated vanadium oxides matrix both contribute to the excellent battery performance of Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanosheets. Finally, a full cell composed of lithiated Zn2(OH)3VO3/LiFePO4 with a high energy density of 293 Wh kg(-1) (vs total mass of active materials) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1) was successfully assembled, which could cycle well over 100 cycles with 79% capacity retention and also exhibit good rate stability.

An aprotic Li-O2 battery is made of a Li-metal anode, an aprotic electrolyte, and an O2-breathing cathode. The aprotic electrolyte is a solution of lithium salt with aprotic solvent; and porous carbon is commonly used as the cathode substrate. To improve the performance, an electrocatalyst is deposited onto the porous carbon substrate by certain deposition methods, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and wet-chemistry reaction. The as-prepared cathode materials are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). A Swagelok-type cell, sealed in a glass chamber filled with pure O2, is used for the electrochemical test on a battery test system. The cells are tested under either capacity-controlled mode or voltage controlled mode. The reaction products are investigated by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy to study the possible pathway of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Characterizations by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high resolution electron microscopy, and porous studies revealed that the phase pure Co3V2O8 nanoparticles are interconnected to form a sponge-like morphology with porous properties.

A notable rate performance of 430 mAh g(-1) at 3200 mA g(-1) was also observed, and ex situ investigations confirmed the morphological and structural stability of this material. These results validate that the unique nanostructured morphology arising from the use of the ordered array of MOF networks is favorable for improving the cyclability and rate capability in battery electrodes.

A promising candidate is the lithium-sulfur technology with the potential to increase the energy density of the battery by a factor of 3-5.

Here we report on a new approach utilizing a self-standing reduced graphene oxide based aerogel directly as electrodes, i.e. without further processing and without the addition of binder or conducting agents. We can thereby disrupt the common paradigm of \"no battery without binder\" and can pave the way to a lithium-sulfur battery with a high practical energy density. The aerogels are synthesized via a one-pot method and consist of more than 2/3 sulfur, contained inside a porous few-layered reduced graphene oxide matrix. By combining the graphene-based aerogel cathode with an electrolyte and a lithium metal anode, we demonstrate a lithium-sulfur cell with high areal capacity (more than 3\u2009mAh/cm<sup>2</sup> after 75 cycles), excellent capacity retention over 200 cycles and good sulfur utilization.

But the growth of Li dendrites limits the application of the Li metal battery. In this work, a type of modified Li metal battery with a carbon nanotube (CNT) buffer layer inserted between the separator and the Li metal electrode was reported. The electrochemical results show that the modified batteries have a much better rate capability and cycling performance than the conventional Li metal batteries. The mechanism study by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that the modified battery has a smaller charge transfer resistance and larger Li ion diffusion coefficient during the deposition process on the Li electrode than the conventional Li metal batteries. Symmetric battery tests show that the interfacial behavior of the Li metal electrode with the buffer layer is more stable than the naked Li metal electrode. The morphological characterization of the CNT buffer layer and Li metal lamina reveals that the CNT buffer layer has restrained the growth of Li dendrites.

This leads to rapid capacity decline and must be resolved in order to progress for realistic utilization of LIBs with ultrafast cycling stability. This article proposes a novel architecture of Sb-doped SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles sandwiched between carbon nanofiber and carbon skin (CNF/ATO/C) using electrospinning and hydrothermal methods.

CuP2 nanowires have progressive improvement for semiconductors and energy storages compared with bulk CuP2.

Cable-like copper oxide/carbon-nitride core-shell nanostructures accommodate the volume change during lithiation-delithiation processes, the three-dimensional arrays provide abundant electroactive zones and electron/ion transport paths, and the monolithic sandwich-type configuration without additional binders or conductive agents improves energy/power densities of the whole electrode.", "affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing 100081, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11774.pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11774"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4895809"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4895809?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 42, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-08-20", "dateOfCreation": "2016-06-04", "firstIndexDate": "2016-06-04", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-12", "dateOfRevision": "2019-01-11", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-06-03", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-06-03"}

Carbonization of these fiber mats at 800 \u00b0C generates metallic Ni-encapsulated NiO/MnOx/carbon composite fibers with average BET surface area (150 m(2)/g) almost 3 times higher than those reported for nonporous metal oxide nanofibers. The average diameter (\u223c900 nm) of these fiber composites is nearly invariant of chemical composition and can be easily tuned by the dope concentration and electrospinning conditions. The metallic Ni nanoparticle encapsulation of NiO/MnOx/C fibers leads to enhanced electrical conductivity of the fibers, while the block copolymers template an internal nanoporous morphology and the carbon in these composite fibers helps to accommodate volumetric changes during charging. These attributes can lead to lithium ion battery anodes with decent rate performance and long-term cycle stability, but performance strongly depends on the composition of the composite fibers. The composite fibers produced from a dope where the metal nitrate is 66% Ni generates the anode that exhibits the highest reversible specific capacity at high rate for any composition, even when including the mass of the nonactive carbon and Ni(0) in the calculation of the capacity. On the basis of the active oxides alone, near-theoretical capacity and excellent cycling stability are achieved for this composition.

Meanwhile, they also suffer from slow lithium diffusion and limited electrochemical and structural stability, especially at high charging/discharging rate. The structure design of TMO is an effective strategy to obtain desirable LIB performance. Herein, inspired by natural fibrous roots consisting of functional and supporting units that can enhance substances and energy exchange efficiently, fibrous-root-like Zn(x)Co(3-x)O4@Zn(1-y)Co(y)O binary TMO nanoarrays are designed and synthesized on Cu substrates through a facile one-pot, successive-deposition process for use as an integrated LIB anode. In a multilevel array ordered by orientation, ultrafine Zn(x)Co(3-x)O4 nanowire functional units and stable Zn(1-y)Co(y)O nanorod supporting units synergize, resulting in superior rate performance. At a high current density of 500 mAg(-1), they could maintain a discharge capacity as high as 804 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, working much higher than unary cobalt-based and zinc-based nanoarrays.

Here, the lithiation/delithiation processes of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles are observed dynamically using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our results suggest that during the first lithiation process the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles undergo a conversion process and generate a composite structure of 1-3\u2009nm Fe and Zn nanograins within Li2O matrix. During the delithiation process, volume contraction and the conversion of Zn and Fe take place with the disappearance of Li2O, followed by the complete conversion to Fe2O3 and ZnO not the original phase ZnFe2O4. The following cycles are dominated by the full reversible phase conversion between Zn, Fe and ZnO, Fe2O3. The Fe valence evolution during cycles evidenced by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques also exhibit the reversible conversion between Fe and Fe2O3 after the first lithiation, agreeing well with the in situ TEM results.

In addition, the hierarchical NiO/Ni/Graphene composites demonstrated promising performance as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Such a superior lithium and sodium storage performance is derived from the well-designed hierarchical hollow ball-in-ball structure of NiO/Ni/Graphene composites, which not only mitigates the volume expansion of NiO during the cycles but also provides a continuous highly conductive graphene matrix to facilitate the fast charge transfer and form a stable SEI layer.", "affiliation": "Department of Polymer Science, University of Akron , Akron, Ohio 44325, United States.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "1505943", "agency": "Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "53560-DNI 10", "agency": "American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "DE-SC0013831", "agency": "Small Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "1336057", "agency": "Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Lithium ion battery", "Nickel Oxide", "Hierarchical Structure", "Metal Organic Framework", "Sodium Ion Battery"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5b05041"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "N", "inEPMC": "N", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "N", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 119, "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-05-27", "dateOfCreation": "2015-11-24", "firstIndexDate": "2015-11-25", "dateOfRevision": "2016-01-26", "electronicPublicationDate": "2015-11-30", "firstPublicationDate": "2015-11-30"}

Overdischarge results in various side effects, such as capacity degradation and internal short circuit (ISCr). However, most of previous research on the overdischarge of a cell was terminated when the cell voltage dropped to 0\u2009V, leaving the further impacts of overdischarge unclear. This paper investigates the entire overdischarge process of large-format lithium-ion batteries by discharging the cell to -100% state of charge (SOC). A significant voltage platform is observed at approximately -12% SOC, and ISCr is detected after the cell is overdischarged when passing the platform. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the overdischarge-induced ISCr is caused by Cu deposition on electrodes, suggesting possible Cu collector dissolution at the voltage platform near -12% SOC. A prognostic/mechanistic model considering ISCr is used to evaluate the resistance of ISCr (RISCr), the value of which decreases sharply at the beginning of ISCr formation. Inducing the ISCr by overdischarge is effective and well controlled without any mechanical deformation or the use of a foreign substance.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep30248"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4957210"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4957210?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 24, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-04-05", "dateOfCreation": "2016-07-23", "firstIndexDate": "2016-07-24", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-07-22", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-07-22"}

The anode is made of an assembly comprising of silicon nanowires as active material densely and conformally grown on a 3D carbon mesh as a light-weight current collector, offering extremely high areal capacity for reversible Li storage of up to 9\u2009mAh/cm(2). The dense growth is guaranteed by a versatile Au precursor developed for homogenous Au layer deposition on 3D substrates. In contrast to metallic Li, the presented system exhibits superior characteristics as an anode in Li/S batteries such as safe operation, long cycle life and easy handling. These anodes are combined with high area density S/C composite cathodes into a Li/S full-cell with an ether- and lithium triflate-based electrolyte for high ionic conductivity. The result is a highly cyclable full-cell with an areal capacity of 2.3\u2009mAh/cm(2), a cyclability surpassing 450 cycles and capacity retention of 80% after 150 cycles (capacity loss <0.4% per cycle).

Based on correlative tomography, it allows for reliable ternary segmentation of Xt data into the pore space, CBD, and AM.

In this review, the mechanisms of SEI formation and models of SEI structure are briefly summarized. The analysis methods to probe the surface chemistry, surface morphology, electrochemical property, dynamic characteristics of SEI layer are emphasized. The critical factors affecting the SEI formation, such as electrolyte component, temperature, current density, are comprehensively debated. The efficient methods to modify SEI layer with the introduction of new electrolyte system and additives, ex-situ-formed protective layer, as well as electrode design, are summarized. Although these works afford new insights into SEI research, robust and precise routes for SEI modification with well-designed structure, as well as understanding of the connection between structure and electrochemical performance, is still inadequate.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries has been so far limited to the cyclability and the retention of active sulfur materials. Using co-electrospinning and physical vapor deposition procedures, we created a class of chloride-carbon nanofiber composites, and studied their effectiveness on polysulfides sequestration. By trapping sulfur reduction products in the modified cathode through both chemical and physical confinements, these chloride-coated cathodes are shown to remarkably suppress the polysulfide dissolution and shuttling between lithium and sulfur electrodes. From adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations, it is shown that not only the sulfide-adsorption effect but also the diffusivity in the vicinity of these chlorides materials plays an important role on the reversibility of sulfur-based cathode upon repeated cycles. Balancing the adsorption and diffusion effects of these nonconductive materials could lead to the enhanced cycling performance of an Li-S cell.

This work demonstrates that ambient CO2, considered as an environmental pollutant, can be attributed economic value in grid-scale and portable energy storage systems with STEP scale-up practicality in the context of combined cycle natural gas electric power generation.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, George Washington University , Washington, D.C. 20052, United States.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "1445197", "agency": "Division of Graduate Education", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "1230732", "agency": "Division of Chemistry", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "1505830", "agency": "Division of Chemistry", "orderIn": 0}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.5b00400"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.5b00400"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4827670"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4827670?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 22, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-05-10", "dateOfCreation": "2016-05-11", "firstIndexDate": "2016-05-11", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-30", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-03-02", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-03-02"}

Pseudocapacitance, which is associated with surface or near-surface redox reactions, can provide fast charge/discharge capacity free from diffusion-controlled intercalation processes and is able to address the above issue. In this work, we report the synthesis of macroporous CoV2O6 nanosheets through a facile one-pot method via acetylene black induced heterogeneous growth. When applied as lithium-ion battery anode, the macroporous CoV2O6 nanosheets show typical features of pseudocapacitive behavior: (1) currents that are mostly linearly dependent on sweep rate and (2) redox peaks whose potentials do not shift significantly with sweep rate. The macroporous CoV2O6 nanosheets display a high reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of 89% (against the second cycle) after 500 cycles at 500 mA g(-1), and high rate capability of 453 mAh g(-1) at 5000 mA g(-1).

Although several high-rate pseudocapacitive anode materials have been reported, cathode materials operating in a high potential range versus lithium metal are much less common. Here, we present a nanostructured version of the well-known cathode material, LiMn2O4. The reduction in lithium-ion diffusion lengths and improvement in rate capabilities is realized through a combination of nanocrystallinity and the formation of a 3-D porous framework. Materials were fabricated from nanoporous Mn3O4 films made by block copolymer templating of preformed nanocrystals. The nanoporous Mn3O4 was then converted via solid-state reaction with LiOH to nanoporous LixMn2O4 (1 < x < 2). The resulting films had a wall thickness of \u223c15 nm, which is small enough to be impacted by inactive surface sites.

However the critical challenges of Li metal anodes (most notably cycle life and safety) remain unsolved. This is attributed to the evolution of Li metal morphology during cycling, which leads to dendrite growth and surface pitting. Herein, we present a comprehensive understanding of the voltage variations observed during Li metal cycling, which is directly correlated to morphology evolution through the use of operando video microscopy. A custom-designed visualization cell was developed to enable operando synchronized observation of Li metal electrode morphology and electrochemical behavior during cycling. A mechanistic understanding of the complex behavior of these electrodes is gained through correlation with continuum-scale modeling, which provides insight into the dominant surface kinetics. This work provides a detailed explanation of (1) when dendrite nucleation occurs, (2) how those dendrites evolve as a function of time, (3) when surface pitting occurs during Li electrodissolution, (4) kinetic parameters that dictate overpotential as the electrode morphology evolves, and (5) how this understanding can be applied to evaluate electrode performance in a variety of electrolytes. The results provide detailed insight into the interplay between morphology and the dominant electrochemical processes occurring on the Li electrode surface through an improved understanding of changes in cell voltage, which represents a powerful new platform for analysis.", "affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States; Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "DGE 1256260", "agency": "Division of Graduate Education", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "DE-AC02-06CH11357", "agency": "Basic Energy Sciences", "orderIn": 0}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.6b00260"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5126712"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5126712?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 179, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2016-12-08", "firstIndexDate": "2016-12-08", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-29", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-10-14", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-10-14"}

The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge-discharge measurements.

Experimental reports of up to 40% increase in energy density of Si anode based LIBs (Si-LIBs) have been reported in literature. However, this increase in energy density is achieved when the Si-LIB is allowed to swell (volumetrically expand) more than graphite based LIB (graphite-LIB) and beyond practical limits. The volume expansion of LIB electrodes should be negligible for applications such as automotive or mobile devices. We determine the theoretical bounds of Si composition in a Si-carbon composite (SCC) based anode to maximize the volumetric energy density of a LIB by constraining the external dimensions of the anode during charging. The porosity of the SCC anode is adjusted to accommodate the volume expansion during lithiation. The calculated threshold value of Si was then used to determine the possible volumetric energy densities of LIBs with SCC anode (SCC-LIBs) and the potential improvement over graphite-LIBs.

However, such a strategy may not provide insight toward the complexities of electric energy storage, especially the inherent heterogeneity of ion and electron flux contributing to the local resistances at numerous interfaces found at several scale lengths within a battery. Thus, the ability to predict and ultimately tune these complex systems to specific applications, both current and future, demands not just parametrization at the bulk scale but rather specific experimentation and understanding over multiple length scales within the same battery system, from the molecular scale to the mesoscale.

The surface-dominated redox reaction rendered by our tailored ultrathin tin(II) sulfide nanostructures may also work in other layered materials for high-performance sodium-ion storage.", "affiliation": "School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637371, Singapore.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12122.pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12122"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4931321"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4931321?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 289, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-08-27", "dateOfCreation": "2016-07-01", "firstIndexDate": "2016-06-30", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2019-01-11", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-06-30", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-06-30"}

The framework of the density functional theory was applied in a generalized gradient approximation together with the hybrid functional method. It is revealed that lithium atoms intercalate in this material in a maximum concentration of one Li atom per formula unit forming LiNb2O2F3. Moreover, octahedral positions in between the layers of Nb-O-F appear as the Li preferred occupancy resulting in a structural volume expansion of only 5%. Electronic structure evolution with the insertion of lithium displays a transformation from semi-conductor to metal when half of the lithium atoms are added. This transformation occurs due to a symmetry break induced by the transition from the +8 to +7 oxidation state of half of the Nb2 dimers. Then, after full lithiation the symmetry is recovered and the material becomes a semiconductor again with a band gap amounting to 1 eV. The evaluated average deintercalation potential reaches 1.29 V vs. Li/Li(+) with activation energy for lithium ion migration of 0.79 eV.

In both cases, the Se molecules remain almost completely confined to the micropore slits to give a long cycle life.", "affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology , Hefei, Anhui 230009, People's Republic of China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "21521001", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "15-2798", "agency": "Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "1608085MB32", "agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "2013CB931800", "agency": "Ministry of Science and Technology of the People&apos;s Republic of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "21403050", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "21431006", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "2014CB931800", "agency": "Ministry of Science and Technology of the People&apos;s Republic of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "KJZD-EW-M01-1", "agency": "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "51225204", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "20140156", "agency": "Beijing national laboratory for molecular sciences", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "2014HGQC0015", "agency": "Ministry of Education of the People&apos;s Republic of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "J2014HGBZ0126", "agency": "Ministry of Education of the People&apos;s Republic of China", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Energy Storage", "Microporous Carbon", "Confined Selenium Chain", "Metal\u2212selenium Battery", "Selenium Electrochemistry"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01819"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "N", "inEPMC": "N", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "N", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 32, "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-08-28", "dateOfCreation": "2016-06-28", "firstIndexDate": "2016-06-28", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-30", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-07-01", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-07-01"}

However, there is still a missing link between the engineering developments for large-scale batteries and the fundamental science of each battery component. Elucidating reaction mechanisms under practical operation is crucial for future battery technology. Here, we report an operando diffraction technique that uses high-intensity neutrons to detect reactions in non-equilibrium states driven by high-current operation in commercial 18650 cells. The experimental system comprising a time-of-flight diffractometer with automated Rietveld analysis was developed to collect and analyse diffraction data produced by sequential charge and discharge processes. Furthermore, observations under high current drain revealed inhomogeneous reactions, a structural relaxation after discharge, and a shift in the lithium concentration ranges with cycling in the electrode matrix. The technique provides valuable information required for the development of advanced batteries.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Materials and Chemical Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 4259 Nagatsuta-cho, Midori-ku, Yokohama 226-8502, Japan.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep28843"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep28843"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4928065"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4928065?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 21, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-05-02", "dateOfCreation": "2016-07-01", "firstIndexDate": "2016-06-30", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2019-04-20", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-06-30", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-06-30"}

However, to harness this remarkable potential for high power density energy storage, one has to address the interfacial potential barrier that hinders the electron injection from the metal side. Herein, we present that, solely by inserting ultrathin amorphous germanium (a-Ge) (\u223c5 nm) at the interface of NiSix/amorphous Si (a-Si), the rate capacity was substantially enhanced, 477 mAh g(-1) even at a high rate of 40 A g(-1). In addition, batteries containing the NiSix/Ge+Si anodes cycled over 1000 times at 10 A g(-1) while the capacity retaining more than 877 mAh g(-1), which is among the highest reported. The excellent electrochemical performance is directly correlated with the significantly improved electrical conductivity and mechanical stability throughout the entire electrode. The potential barrier between the NiSix and a-Si was modulated by a-Ge, which constructs an electron highway.

Furthermore, their operation depends on the redox reactions of metal elements. We present an original battery system that depends on the redox of I(-)/I3 (-) couple in liquid cathode and the reversible enolization in polyimide anode, accompanied by Li(+) (or Na(+)) diffusion between cathode and anode through a Li(+)/Na(+) exchange polymer membrane. There are no metal element-based redox reactions in this battery, and Li(+) (or Na(+)) is only used for charge transfer. Moreover, the components (electrolyte/electrode) of this system are environment-friendly. Both electrodes are demonstrated to have very fast kinetics, which gives the battery a supercapacitor-like high power. It can even be cycled 50,000 times when operated within the electrochemical window of 0 to 1.6 V.

However, in addition to concerns about electrochemical performance, the limited availability of lithium is gradually becoming an important issue for further continued use and development of lithium ion batteries. Therefore, a significant shift in attention has been taking place towards new types of rechargeable batteries such as sodium-based systems that have low cost. Another important aspect of sodium battery is its potential compatibility with the all-solid-state design where solid electrolyte is used to replace liquid one, leading to simple battery design, long life span, and excellent safety. The key to the success of all-solid-state battery design is the challenge of finding solid electrolytes possessing acceptable high ionic conductivities at room temperature.

A radical new approach is to replace volatile, unstable and air-intolerant organic electrolytes common to prior research in the field with alkali metal nitrate molten salt electrolytes and operate the battery above the liquidus temperature (>80 \u00b0C). Here we demonstrate an intermediate temperature Li/O2 battery using a lithium anode, a molten nitrate-based electrolyte (e.g., LiNO3-KNO3 eutectic) and a porous carbon O2 cathode with high energy efficiency (\u223c95%) and improved rate capability because the discharge product, lithium peroxide, is stable and moderately soluble in the molten salt electrolyte. The results, supported by essential state-of-the-art electrochemical and analytical techniques such as in situ pressure and gas analyses, scanning electron microscopy, rotating disk electrode voltammetry, demonstrate that Li2O2 electrochemically forms and decomposes upon cycling with discharge/charge overpotentials as low as 50 mV.

The Fe2O3, SnO2, NiO, and Co3O4 hollow nanospheres are successfully prepared by the all-in-one beaker method. The detailed formation mechanism of aggregate-free hematite hollow nanospheres is studied. Dimethylformamide solution containing Fe acetate, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polystyrene (PS) transforms into aggregate-free Fe2O3 hollow nanospheres. The porous structure formed by the combustion of PS provides a good pathway for the reducing gas. The carbon matrix formed from PAN acts as a barrier, which can prevent the aggregation of metallic Fe nanopowders by surrounding each particle. The Fe-C bulk material formed as an intermediate product transforms into aggregate-free Fe2O3 hollow nanospheres by the nanoscale Kirkendall diffusion process. The mean size and shell thickness of the hollow Fe2O3 nanospheres measured from the TEM images are 52 and 9 nm, respectively.

The main challenge lies in their rapid capacity fading caused by the structural degradation and instability of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer during charge/discharge process. Herein, we address these problems by constructing a novel-structured SnO2-based anode. The novel structure consists of mesoporous clusters of SnO2 quantum dots (SnO2 QDs), which are wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets. The mesopores inside the clusters provide enough room for the expansion and contraction of SnO2 QDs during charge/discharge process while the integral structure of the clusters can be maintained. The wrapping RGO sheets act as electrolyte barrier and conductive reinforcement. When used as an anode, the resultant composite (MQDC-SnO2/RGO) shows an extremely high reversible capacity of 924\u2009mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 100\u2009mA g(-1), superior capacity retention (96%), and outstanding rate performance (505\u2009mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1000\u2009mA g(-1)). Importantly, the materials can be easily scaled up under mild conditions.

This combination of techniques facilitates the investigation of dynamic processes in lithium ion batteries containing amorphous and/or weakly attenuating active materials. While amorphous materials pose a challenge for diffraction techniques, weakly attenuating material systems pose a challenge for attenuation-contrast tomography. Furthermore, combining SXRD and SRXTM can be used to correlate processes occurring at the atomic level in the crystal lattices of the active materials with those at the scale of electrode microstructure. To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, we investigate a silicon powder electrode in lithium metal half-cell configuration. Combining SXRD and SRXTM, we are able to (i) quantify the dissolution of the metallic lithium electrode and the expansion of the silicon electrode, (ii) better understand the formation of the Li15Si4 phase, and (iii) non-invasively probe kinetic limitations within the silicon electrode.

high-energy-storage devices, the rechargeable metal-oxygen battery has attracted attention recently. Sodium-oxygen batteries have been regarded as the most promising candidates because of their lower-charge overpotential compared with that of lithium-oxygen system. However, conflicting observations with different discharge products have inhibited the understanding of precise reactions in the battery. Here we demonstrate that the competition between the electrochemical and chemical reactions in sodium-oxygen batteries leads to the dissolution and ionization of sodium superoxide, liberating superoxide anion and triggering the formation of sodium peroxide dihydrate (Na2O2\u00b72H2O). On the formation of Na2O2\u00b72H2O, the charge overpotential of sodium-oxygen cells significantly increases. This verification addresses the origin of conflicting discharge products and overpotentials observed in sodium-oxygen systems.

The HRGO were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultra violet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Raman spectroscopy. These novel HRGO exhibited high rate capability with excellent cycling stability as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The results have shown an excellent electrochemical response in terms of charge/discharge capacity (423\u2009mAh/g at 100\u2009mA/g). The cyclic performance was also exceptional as a high reversible capacity (400\u2009mAh/g at 100\u2009mA/g) was retained for 100 charge/discharge cycles. This fascinating electrochemical performance can be ascribed to their specific porous structure (2-5\u2009nm pores) and high surface area (457\u2009m(2)/g), providing numerous active sites for Li(+) insertion, high electrical conductivity, low charge-transfer resistance across the electrolyte-electrode interface, and improved structural stability against the local volume change during Li(+) insertion-extraction.

Dissolution of lithium polysulfides, volume expansion of sulfur and uncontrollable deposition of lithium sulfide are three of the main challenges for this technology. State-of-the-art sulfur cathodes based on metal-oxide nanostructures can suppress the shuttle-effect and enable controlled lithium sulfide deposition. However, a clear mechanistic understanding and corresponding selection criteria for the oxides are still lacking. Herein, various nonconductive metal-oxide nanoparticle-decorated carbon flakes are synthesized via a facile biotemplating method. The cathodes based on magnesium oxide, cerium oxide and lanthanum oxide show enhanced cycling performance. Adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that polysulfide capture by the oxides is via monolayered chemisorption.

SnO2 octahedrons exposed of {221} high energy facets were uniformly distributed and tightly anchored on multidimensional graphene/carbon nanotube (GCNT) composites. Vertically aligned pores can effectively prevent the emersion of \"closed\" pores which cannot load the active SnO2 nanoparticles, further ensure quick immersion of electrolyte throughout the aerogel, and can largely shorten the transport distance between lithium ions and active sites of SnO2. Especially, excellent electrical conductivity of GCNT-SnO2 aerogel was achieved as a result of good interconnected networks of graphene and CNTs. Furthermore, meso- and macroporous structures with large surface area created by the vertically aligned pores can provide great benefit to the favorable transport kinetics for both lithium ion and electrons and afford sufficient space for volume expansion of SnO2. Due to the well-designed architecture of GCNT-SnO2 aerogel, a high specific capacity of 1190 mAh/g with good long-term cycling stability up to 1000 times was achieved.

In this report, we show that atomic layer deposition (ALD) of titania (TiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) on Ni-rich FCG NMC and NCA active material particles could substantially improve LIB performance and allow for increased upper cutoff voltage (UCV) during charging, which delivers significantly increased specific energy utilization. Our results show that Al2O3 coating improved the NMC cycling performance by 40% and the NCA cycling performance by 34% at 1\u2009C/-1\u2009C with respectively 4.35\u2009V and 4.4\u2009V UCV in 2\u2009Ah pouch cells. High resolution TEM/SAED structural characterization revealed that Al2O3 coatings prevented surface-initiated layered-to-spinel phase transitions in coated materials which were prevalent in uncoated materials.

The in situ TEM observation reveals that the critical fracture diameter of porous Si particles reaches up to 1.52\u2009\u03bcm, which is much larger than the previously reported 150\u2009nm for crystalline Si nanoparticles and 870\u2009nm for amorphous Si nanoparticles. After full lithiation, solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires transform to crystalline Li15Si4 phase while porous Si nanoparticles and nanowires transform to amorphous LixSi phase, which is due to the effect of domain size on the stability of Li15Si4 as revealed by the first-principle molecular dynamic simulation. Ex situ TEM characterization is conducted to further investigate the structural evolution of porous and solid Si nanoparticles during the cycling process, which confirms that the porous Si nanoparticles exhibit better capability to suppress pore evolution than solid Si nanoparticles. The investigation of structural evolution and phase transition of porous Si nanoparticles and nanowires during the lithiation process reveal that they are more desirable as lithium-ion battery anode materials than solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires.", "affiliation": "Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep31334"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5004143"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5004143?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 19, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-04-23", "dateOfCreation": "2016-08-31", "firstIndexDate": "2016-09-03", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-08-30", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-08-30"}

The high performance is believed to be induced by the hybrid effect among MnO2 nanotubes, hollow Co3O4 and CNTs, which can produce a synergetic enhancement. When integrated into the practical primary and electrochemically rechargeable Zn-air batteries, such a hybrid catalyst can give a discharge peak power density as high as 450\u2009mW cm(-2).

Notably, based on the weight of hybrid materials, electrochemical performance is considerably better than that of previously reported Se-based cathode materials, attributed to the high Se loading content (80\u2009wt%) in hybrid materials.", "affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Oxides", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Graphite", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Selenium", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Lithium", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Electric Power Supplies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IS", "qualifierName": "instrumentation", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Oxides", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "Graphite", "registryNumber": "7782-42-5"}, {"name": "Selenium", "registryNumber": "H6241UJ22B"}, {"name": "Lithium", "registryNumber": "9FN79X2M3F"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep30865"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4969586"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4969586?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 8, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-06-26", "dateOfCreation": "2016-08-03", "firstIndexDate": "2016-08-03", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-08-02", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-08-02"}

Here, we will show how 3D patterned Si wafers, prepared by the sophisticated techniques from semiconductor industry, are to be electrochemically activated to overcome these limitations and to leverage their full potential being reflected in stable charge capacities (>1000\u2009mAhg(-1)) and high Coulomb efficiencies (98.8%).", "affiliation": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Lithium Batteries, Institute for Chemistry and Technology of Materials, Graz University of Technology (NAWI Graz), Stremayrgasse 9, 8010 Graz, Austria.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31712.pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep31712"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4987657"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4987657?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 8, "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-05-02", "dateOfCreation": "2016-08-18", "firstIndexDate": "2016-08-20", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-08-17", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-08-17"}

Testing of lithium-ion batteries in an academic setting has taken on several forms, but at the most basic level lies the coin cell construction. In traditional LIB electrode preparation, a multi-phase slurry composed of active material, binder, and conductive additive is cast out onto a substrate. An electrode disc can then be punched from the dried sheet and used in the construction of a coin cell for electrochemical evaluation. Utilization of the potential of the active material in a battery is critically dependent on the microstructure of the electrode, as an appropriate distribution of the primary components are crucial to ensuring optimal electrical conductivity, porosity, and tortuosity, such that electrochemical and transport interaction is optimized. Processing steps ranging from the combination of dry powder, wet mixing, and drying can all critically affect multi-phase interactions that influence the microstructure formation.

This in-situ gas chromatography technique monitoring the gas evolution during electrochemical reaction presents opportunities to clearly understand the effect of surface modification and predict on the cathode stability. The oxide cathode, 0.5Li2MnO3\u22190.5LiNi0.4Co0.2Mn0.4O2, surface modified by amorphous cobalt-phosphate nanoparticles (a-CoPO4) is prepared by a simple co-precipitation reaction followed by a mild heat treatment. The presence of a 40\u2009nm thick a-CoPO4 coating layer wrapping the oxide powders is confirmed by electron microscopy. The electrochemical measurements reveal that the a-CoPO4 coated overlithiated layered oxide cathode shows better performances than the pristine counterpart.

Additionally, the designed composite cathode further maximizes the lithium-polysulfide restriction capability by using the polar shells to prevent their outward diffusion, which avoids the need for chemically bonding all lithium-polysulfides on the surfaces of polar particles.", "affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 62 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637459, Singapore.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13065"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5080434"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5080434?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 161, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "Y", "dbCrossReferenceList": {"dbName": ["CHEBI"]}, "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-08-15", "dateOfCreation": "2016-10-21", "firstIndexDate": "2016-10-27", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-10-20", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-10-20"}

Here we designed a hierarchical and bicontinuous nanoporous structure by introducing secondary nanopores into the ligaments of coarsened nanoporous gold by two-step dealloying. The hierarchical and bicontinuous nanoporous gold cathode provides high porosity, large accessible surface area and sufficient mass transport path for high capacity and long cycling lifetime of Li-O2 batteries.", "affiliation": "WPI Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8577, Japan.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep33466"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5027567"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5027567?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 11, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-05-21", "dateOfCreation": "2016-09-20", "firstIndexDate": "2016-09-21", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2024-03-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-09-19", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-09-19"}

The synthesis of the GMNCs involves the two-step coating of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals with polydopamine and graphene, followed by heat treatment to form the GNS@MnO@N-doped carbon composites (GMNCs). When evaluated as anode materials for LIBs, the as-prepared GMNCs exhibit an improved cycling stability (754.3 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> after 350 cycles at 0.1 A g<sup>-1</sup>) compared to carbon-coated MnO and pure Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> due to the double carbon coating design. When evaluated as catalysts for ORR, the as-prepared GMNCs exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity than that of pure Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and MnO catalysts, and superior stability to a commercial Pt/C catalyst due to the synergetic effect between the MnO and N-doped double carbon coating.

However, research on controlling the pore structure and analyzing the carbon structures is still necessary to achieve enhanced electrochemical properties. In this study, mesoporous carbon nanotube (CNT)-carbon nanofiber electrodes were developed by heat-treatment of electrospun starch with carbon nanotubes, and then applied as a binder-free electrochemical electrode for a lithium-ion battery. Using the unique lamellar structure of starch, mesoporous CNT-carbon nanofibers were prepared and their pore structures were controlled by manipulating the heat-treatment conditions. The activation process greatly increased the volume of micropores and mesopores of carbon nanofibers by etching carbons with CO\u2082 gas, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific area increased to about 982.4 m\u00b2\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>. The activated CNT-carbon nanofibers exhibited a high specific capacity (743 mAh\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>) and good cycle performance (510 mAh\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> after 30 cycles) due to their larger specific surface area. This condition presents many adsorption sites of lithium ions, and higher electrical conductivity, compared with carbon nanofibers without CNT.

However, TiO2 anodes usually suffer from poor electrical and ionic conductivity, thus causing dramatic degradation of electrochemical performance at rapid charge/discharge rates, which has hindered its use in energy storage devices. Here, we present a novel strategy to address this main obstacle via using nanoarchitectured TiO2 anode consisting of mesoporous TiO2 wrapped in carbon on a tunnel-like etched aluminum substrate prepared by a simple one-step approach. As a result of this nanoarchitecture arrangement, the anode exhibits excellent rate performance and superior cyclability. A rate up to 100 C is achieved with a high specific capacity of about 95 mA h g(-1), and without apparent decay after 8,000 cycles.", "affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key laboratory of the Ministry of Education &International Center of Dielectric Research, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep20138"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4740746"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4740746?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 6, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-09-13", "dateOfCreation": "2016-02-05", "firstIndexDate": "2016-02-05", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2019-04-18", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-02-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-02-04"}

Here we explore the lithiation of nanosized magnetite by employing a strain-sensitive, bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy approach. This method allows direct, real-time, high-resolution visualization of how lithiation proceeds along specific reaction pathways. We find that the initial intercalation process follows a two-phase reaction sequence, whereas further lithiation leads to the coexistence of three distinct phases within single nanoparticles, which has not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge.

Besides, we show that the particle size and shape of discharge product strongly depend on current density, and on whether the particles are deposited close to the oxygen reservoir or near the separator. We correlate our findings to transport limitations for the supplied oxygen and gain crucial information for optimal operation of sodium-oxygen batteries.

X-ray diffraction patterns of the cell upon operation suggest the reversibility of the Li<sub>2</sub>S electrochemical process, while repeated electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicate the suitability of the electrode-electrolyte interface in terms of low and stable cell impedance. Furthermore, the EIS study clarifies the activation process occurring at the Li<sub>2</sub>S cathode during the first charge process, leading to the decrease of the cell polarization during the following cycles.

The calculated Debye temperatures show an interesting critical and peculiar behavior so that a steep increase in the Debye temperatures is observed by increasing the temperature. This critical behavior is fitted by the critical function and the adjusted critical temperatures are very close to the magnetic phase transition temperatures in LFP and FP. Hence, the critical behavior of the Debye temperatures is correlated with the magnetic phase transitions in these compounds.

However, the intrinsic mobile redox centers during the sulfur/Li<sub>2</sub>S-to-lithium polysulfides solid-to-liquid phase transition induce low sulfur utilization and poor cycling life. Herein, the Janus separator of mesoporous cellular graphene framework (CGF)/polypropylene membrane to promote the utilization of sulfur cathode is introduced. The porous polypropylene membrane serves as an insulating substrate in contact with lithium anode while CGFs that possess high electrical conductivity of 100 S cm<sup>-1</sup>, a large mesopore volume of 3.1 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, and a huge surface area of 2120 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> are adhered on cathode side to reactivate the shuttling-back polysulfides and to preserve the ion channels. Therefore, the Li-S cell with the \"two-face\" CGF Janus separator exhibit a high initial capacity of 1109 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and superior capacity preserved upon 800 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, which is 40% higher on sulfur utilization efficiency than the corresponding results with routine polypropylene separators. There are significant improvements on capacity as well as electrochemical kinetics. A very high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> combined with high sulfur content of 80% and areal loading amount of 5.3 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> is achieved for such advanced configuration. The negative impact of shuttle mechanism on lowering the utilization of sulfur and overall energy density of a Li-S battery is well eliminated by applying CGF separators. Consequently, employing carbonaceous materials as Janus face of separators enlightens new opportunities for improving the utilization of active materials and energy density of devices that involve complex phase evolution and conversion electrochemistry.", "affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Reaction Engineering and Technology Department of Chemical Engineering Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 P.R.

After linear sweep voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, copper electrodeposits are visualized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy in two different porous separators (cellulose nitrate, polyethylene), whose surfaces are modified by layer-by-layer deposition of positive or negative charged polyelectrolytes. Above the limiting current, surface conduction inhibits growth in the positive separators and produces irregular dendrites, while it enhances growth and suppresses dendrites behind a deionization shock in the negative separators, also leading to improved cycle life. The discovery of stable uniform growth in the random media differs from the non-uniform growth observed in parallel nanopores and cannot be explained by classic quasi-steady \"leaky membrane\" models, which always predict instability and dendritic growth. Instead, the experimental results suggest that transient electro-diffusion in random porous media imparts the stability of a deionization shock to the growing metal interface behind it.

Among various energy-storage technologies, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), electrochemical capacitors (ECs) and especially the already commercialized lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are playing very important roles in the portable electronic devices or the next-generation electric vehicles. Therefore, the research for finding new electrode materials with reduced cost, improved safety, and high-energy density in these energy storage systems has been an important way to satisfy the ever-growing demands. Symmetric electrodes have recently become a research focus because they employ the same active materials as both the cathode and anode in the same energy-storage system, leading to the reduced manufacturing cost and simplified fabrication process. Most importantly, this feature also endows the symmetric energy-storage system with improved safety, longer lifetime, and ability of charging in both directions. In this Progress Report, we provide the comprehensive summary and comment on different symmetric electrodes and focus on the research about the applications of symmetric electrodes in different energy-storage systems, such as the above mentioned SIBs, ECs and LIBs.

However, to date, its commercial application was hindered by the inherent problems of sulfur cathode. Additionally, with the rapid decline of non-renewable resources and active appeal of green chemistry, the intensive research of new electrode materials was conducted worldwide. We have obtained a sheet-like carbon material (shaddock peel carbon sheets SPCS) from organic waste shaddock peel, which can be used as the conductive carbon matrix for sulfur-based cathodes. Furthermore, the raw materials are low-cost, truly green and recyclable. As a result, the sulfur cathode made with SPCS (SPCS-S), can deliver a high reversible capacity of 722.5\u2009mAh g(-1) at 0.2\u2009C after 100 cycles with capacity recuperability of ~90%, demonstrating that the SPCS-S hybrid is of great potential as the cathode for rechargeable Li-S batteries. The high electrochemical performance of SPCS-S hybrid could be attributed to the sheet-like carbon network with large surface area and high conductivity of the SPCS, in which the carbon sheets enable the uniform distribution of sulfur, better ability to trap the soluble polysulfides and accommodate volume expansion/shrinkage of sulfur during repeated charge/discharge cycles.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, PR China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep20445"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4740814"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4740814?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 8, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-09-13", "dateOfCreation": "2016-02-05", "firstIndexDate": "2016-02-05", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-12", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-02-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-02-04"}

The main challenges associated with MoS2 anodes are the structural degradation and the low rate capability caused by the low intrinsic electric conductivity and large strain upon cycling. Here, we design hierarchical MoS2 tubular structures internally wired by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to tackle these problems. These porous MoS2 tubular structures are constructed from building blocks of ultrathin nanosheets, which are believed to benefit the electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from the unique structural and compositional characteristics, these CNT-wired MoS2 tubular structures deliver a very high specific capacity of ~1320 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1), exceptional rate capability, and an ultralong cycle life of up to 1000 cycles.

A specific change from ester (-COOR) to cyano (-CN) terminated peripheral groups in generation-one poly(propyl ether imine) (G<sub>1</sub>-PETIM)-lithium salt complexes results in a remarkable switchover from a high cation (<i>t</i><sub>Li<sup>+</sup></sub> = 0.9 for -COOR) to a high anion (<i>t</i><sub>PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup></sub> = 0.8 for -CN) transference number. This observed switchover draws an interesting analogy with the concept of heterogeneous doping, applied successfully to account for similar changes in ionic conductivity arising out of dispersion of insulator particle inclusions in weak inorganic solid electrolytes. The change in peripheral group simultaneously affects the effective ionic conductivity, with the room temperature ionic conductivity of PETIM-CN (1.9 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> \u03a9<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) being an order of magnitude higher than PETIM-COOR (1.9 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup> \u03a9<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>). Notably, no significant changes are observed in the lithium mobility even following changes in viscosity due to the change in the peripheral group.

Discovering high-performance anode materials is a great challenge for the commercial success of NIB technology. Transition metal oxides with tailored nanoarchitectures have been considered as promising anodes for NIBs due to their high capacity. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of a nanostructured oxide-only electrode, i.e., carbon- and binder-free NiCo2O4 nanoneedle array (NCO-NNA), and its feasibility as an anode for NIBs. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth experimental study of the Na storage reaction (sodiation and desodiation) in NCO-NNA. The NCO-NNA electrode is fabricated on a conducting substrate by a hydrothermal method with subsequent heat treatment. When tested in an electrochemical Na half-cell, the NCO-NNA electrode exhibits excellent Na storage capability: a charge capacity as high as 400\u00a0mAh\u00a0g(-1) is achieved at a current density of 50\u00a0mA\u00a0g(-1). It also shows a greatly improved cycle life (~215\u00a0mAh\u00a0g(-1) after 50\u00a0cycles) in comparison to a conventional powder-type electrode (~30\u00a0mAh\u00a0g(-1)).

Real-time electrode material displacement is captured in 3D allowing degradation mechanisms such as delamination of the electrode from the current collector and electrode crack formation to be identified. Continuum DVC of consecutive images during discharge is used to quantify local displacements and strains in 3D throughout discharge, facilitating tracking of the progression of swelling due to lithiation within the electrode material in a commercial, spiral-wound battery during normal operation. Displacement of the rigid current collector and cell materials contribute to severe electrode detachment and crack formation during discharge, which is monitored by a separate DVC approach. Use of time-lapse X-ray computed tomography coupled with DVC is thus demonstrated as an effective diagnostic technique to identify causes of performance loss within commercial lithium batteries; this novel approach is expected to guide the development of more effective commercial cell designs.", "affiliation": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab Department of Chemical Engineering University College London Torrington Place London WC1E 7JE UK.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "1528603", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "ST/N002385/1", "agency": "Science and Technology Facilities Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Royal Academy of Engineering", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/I02249X/1", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "National Physical Laboratory", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "ST/K00171X/1", "agency": "Science and Technology Facilities Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Science and Technology Facilities Council", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Degradation", "Lithium Batteries", "Digital Volume Correlation", "X\u2010ray Computed Tomography", "Operando Imaging"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.201500332"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4991305"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4991305?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 20, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2016-09-10", "firstIndexDate": "2016-09-13", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2023-11-12", "electronicPublicationDate": "2015-12-18", "firstPublicationDate": "2015-12-18"}

A specific energy density of 350\u2009Wh\u2009kg(-1), higher than that of conventional tubular sodium-nickel chloride batteries (280\u2009\u00b0C), is obtained for planar sodium-nickel chloride batteries operated at 190\u2009\u00b0C over a long-term cell test (1,000 cycles), and it attributed to the slower particle growth of the cathode materials at the lower operating temperature. Results reported here demonstrate that planar sodium-nickel chloride batteries operated at an intermediate temperature could greatly benefit this traditional energy storage technology by improving battery energy density, cycle life and reducing material costs.", "affiliation": "Electrochemical Materials and Systems Group, Energy Processes and Materials Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, 99352 Washington, USA.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10683"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10683"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4753253"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4753253?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 17, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-06-09", "dateOfCreation": "2016-02-12", "firstIndexDate": "2016-02-12", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-02-11", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-02-11"}

For the commercial success of this technology, significant progress should be made in developing robust anode (negative electrode) materials with high capacity and long cycle life. Sn-P compounds are considered promising anode materials that have considerable potential to meet the required performance of SIBs, and they have been typically prepared by high-energy mechanical milling. Here, we report Sn-P-based anodes synthesised through solvothermal transformation of Sn metal and their electrochemical Na storage properties. The temperature and time period used for solvothermal treatment play a crucial role in determining the phase, microstructure, and composition of the Sn-P compound and thus its electrochemical performance. The Sn-P compound prepared under an optimised solvothermal condition shows excellent electrochemical performance as an SIB anode, as evidenced by a high reversible capacity of ~560\u2009mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100\u2009mA g(-1) and cycling stability for 100 cycles.

Moreover, the conversion rate of Fe(3+)/Fe(2+) and utilization rate of H2O2 are significant factors in Photo-Fenton reaction. In this work, we reported three dimensional (3D) hierarchical cobalt ferrite/graphene aerogels (CoFe2O4/GAs) composites by the in situ growing CoFe2O4 crystal seeds on the graphene oxide (GO) followed by the hydrothermal process. The resulting CoFe2O4/GAs composites demonstrated 3D hierarchical pore structure with mesopores (14~18\u2009nm), macropores (50~125\u2009nm), and a remarkable surface area (177.8\u2009m(2\u2009)g(-1)). These properties endowed this hybrid with the high and recyclable Photo-Fenton activity for methyl orange pollutant degradation. More importantly, the CoFe2O4/GAs composites can keep high Photo-Fenton activity in a wide pH. Besides, the CoFe2O4/GAs composites also exhibited excellent cyclic performance and good rate capability. The 3D framework can not only effectively prevent the volume expansion and aggregation of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles during the charge/discharge processes for Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but also shorten lithium ions and electron diffusion length in 3D pathways.

The V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/graphene composites can deliver discharge capacities of 133, 131, and 122\u00a0mAh\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> at 16\u00a0C, 32\u00a0C, and 64\u00a0C, respectively, in the voltage range of 2.5-4.0\u00a0V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, the electrodes can retain 85% of their original capacity at 1C rate after 500 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances are attributed to the porous structures created by the connected V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanosheets and the electron conductivity improvement by graphene.", "affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, Hunan, China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "NCET-13-0594", "agency": "Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "14JJ3018", "agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "51302323", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "201301621200", "agency": "Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Nanoparticles", "Nanosheets", "Reduced Graphene Oxide", "Lithium-ion Batteries", "Vanadium Oxides"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-016-1764-3"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5153389"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5153389?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 4, "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2016-12-14", "firstIndexDate": "2016-12-20", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-29", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-12-12", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-12-12"}

However, their future commercialization depends critically on control over the solid electrolyte interface formation, as well as the degree of sodiation at the positive electrode. Here we report an easily scalable ball milling approach, which relies on the use of metallic sodium, to prepare a variety of sodium-based alloys, insertion layered oxides and polyanionic compounds having sodium in excess such as the Na4V2(PO4)2F3 phase. The practical benefits of preparing sodium-enriched positive electrodes as reservoirs to compensate for sodium loss during solid electrolyte interphase formation are demonstrated by assembling full C/P'2-Na1[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 and C/'Na3+xV2(PO4)2F3' sodium-ion cells that show substantial increases (>10%) in energy storage density.

Graphical abstractSemiconductor nanowires are attracting more and more interest for their applications in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The characteristic of the nanowires is their geometry with a diameter in the range of a few nanometers and a length far greater than their diameter. The structural defects often lead to mechanical defects. By reducing the number of defects per unit length, decreasing the lateral dimensions, crystalline nanowires are expected to be more resistant than the solid. Recently nanowires are attracting intense interest for solar energy conversion. In this review, we summarize the different methods of nanowires production and their applications.

These configurations are very attractive due to the possibility of exceptionally high energy densities and high (dis)charge rates, but they are far from being realized practically due to a number of issues including high interfacial resistance and difficulties associated with fabrication. One of the most promising solid electrolyte systems for these applications is Al or Ga stabilized Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZO) based on high ionic conductivities and apparent stability against reduction by Li metal. Nevertheless, the fabrication of dense LLZO membranes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistances remains challenging; it definitely requires a better understanding of the structural and electrochemical properties. In this study, the phase transition from garnet (<i>Ia</i>3\u0305<i>d</i>, No. 230) to \"non-garnet\" (<i>I</i>4\u03053<i>d</i>, No. 220) space group as a function of composition and the different sintering behavior of Ga and Al stabilized LLZO are identified as important factors in determining the electrochemical properties. The phase transition was located at an Al:Ga substitution ratio of 0.05:0.15 and is accompanied by a significant lowering of the activation energy for Li-ion transport to 0.26 eV. The phase transition combined with microstructural changes concomitant with an increase of the Ga/Al ratio continuously improves the Li-ion conductivity from 2.6 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup> to 1.2 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>, which is close to the calculated maximum for garnet-type materials. The increase in Ga content is also associated with better densification and smaller grains and is accompanied by a change in the area specific resistance (ASR) from 78 to 24 \u03a9 cm<sup>2</sup>, the lowest reported value for LLZO so far. These results illustrate that understanding the structure-properties relationships in this class of materials allows practical obstacles to its utilization to be readily overcome.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Physics of Materials, University of Salzburg , 5020, Salzburg, Austria.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "P25702", "agency": "Austrian Science Fund FWF", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "P 25702", "agency": "Austrian Science Fund FWF", "acronym": "FWF_", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "\u00d6sterreichische Nationalstiftung f\u00fcr Forschung, Technologie und Entwicklung", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "\u00d6sterreichische Forschungsf\u00f6rderungsgesellschaft", "orderIn": 0}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00579"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4836877"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4836877?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 44, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": ["doi"]}, "dateOfCreation": "2016-04-26", "firstIndexDate": "2016-04-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-12", "dateOfRevision": "2019-11-20", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-03-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-03-04"}

Since lignin is inexpensive, abundant and renewable, its utilization has attracted more and more attention. In this work, lignin was used for the first time as binder material for LiFePO\u2084 positive and graphite negative electrodes in Li-ion batteries. A procedure for pretreatment of lignin, where low-molecular fractions were removed by leaching, was necessary to obtain good battery performance. The lignin was analyzed for molecular mass distribution and thermal behavior prior to and after the pretreatment. Electrodes containing active material, conductive particles and lignin were cast on metal foils, acting as current collectors and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. Good reversible capacities were obtained, 148 mAh\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> for the positive electrode and 305 mAh\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> for the negative electrode. Fairly good rate capabilities were found for both the positive electrode with 117 mAh\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> and the negative electrode with 160 mAh\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> at 1C.

The carbon fibers in CF are successfully wrapped by vertically grown graphene nanowalls, which not only increase the electrode specific area, but also expose a high density of sharp graphene edges with good catalytic activities to the vanadium ions. As a result, the VRFB with this novel electrode shows three times higher reaction rate toward VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>/VO<sup>2+</sup> redox couple and 11% increased energy efficiency over VRFB with an unmodified CF electrode. Moreover, this designed architecture shows excellent stability in the battery operation.

sodium, but the low capacities of available cathode materials make them impractical. Sodium-excess metal oxides Na2MO3 (M: transition metal) are appealing cathode materials that may realize large capacities through additional oxygen redox reaction. However, the general strategies for enhancing the capacity of Na2MO3 are poorly established. Here using two polymorphs of Na2RuO3, we demonstrate the critical role of honeycomb-type cation ordering in Na2MO3. Ordered Na2RuO3 with honeycomb-ordered [Na(1/3)Ru(2/3)]O2 slabs delivers a capacity of 180\u2009mAh\u2009g(-1) (1.3-electron reaction), whereas disordered Na2RuO3 only delivers 135\u2009mAh\u2009g(-1) (1.0-electron reaction). We clarify that the large extra capacity of ordered Na2RuO3 is enabled by a spontaneously ordered intermediate Na1RuO3 phase with ilmenite O1 structure, which induces frontier orbital reorganization to trigger the oxygen redox reaction, unveiling a general requisite for the stable oxygen redox reaction in high-capacity Na2MO3 cathodes.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemical System Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11397"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4837481"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4837481?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 62, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-08-25", "dateOfCreation": "2016-04-19", "firstIndexDate": "2016-04-19", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2024-03-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-04-18", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-04-18"}

Thus, it is worthwhile to explore the possibility of using VO2(M) for LIB electrode application, and to investigate whether its electrochemical properties can be improved. In this study, VO2(M) nanoparticles, incorporated with a reduced graphene oxide composite (NP-VO2/rGO), were successfully synthesized via a sol-gel assisted hydrothermal process by the chemical reduction of V2O5 gel, using hydrazine as the reducing agent. The particle size was less than 50\u2009nm regardless of the presence of rGO.

Subtraction of the PDF of crystalline NaxSb phases from the total PDF, an approach constrained by chemical phase information gained from (23)Na ssNMR in reference to relevant model compounds, identifies two previously uncharacterized intermediate species formed electrochemically; a-Na(3-x)Sb (x \u2248 0.4-0.5), a structure locally similar to crystalline Na3Sb (c-Na3Sb) but with significant numbers of sodium vacancies and a limited correlation length, and a-Na(1.7)Sb, a highly amorphous structure featuring some Sb-Sb bonding. The first sodiation breaks down the crystalline antimony to form first a-Na(3-x)Sb and, finally, crystalline Na3Sb. Desodiation results in the formation of an electrode formed of a composite of crystalline and amorphous antimony networks. We link the different reactivity of these networks to a series of sequential sodiation reactions manifesting as a cascade of processes observed in the electrochemical profile of subsequent cycles. The amorphous network reacts at higher voltages reforming a-Na(1.7)Sb, then a-Na(3-x)Sb, whereas lower potentials are required for the sodiation of crystalline antimony, which reacts to form a-Na(3-x)Sb without the formation of a-Na(1.7)Sb. a-Na(3-x)Sb is converted to crystalline Na3Sb at the end of the second discharge. We find no evidence of formation of NaSb. Variable temperature (23)Na NMR experiments reveal significant sodium mobility within c-Na3Sb; this is a possible contributing factor to the excellent rate performance of Sb anodes.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge , University Chemical Laboratory, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, U.K.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"agency": "University of Cambridge", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/K002252/1", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "EP/L019469/1", "agency": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "European Research Council", "acronym": "ERC_", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "DE-AC02-06CH11357", "agency": "Argonne National Laboratory, Office of Science", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge", "orderIn": 0}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5b13273"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5b13273"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4819537"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4819537?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 32, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-08-10", "dateOfCreation": "2016-01-30", "firstIndexDate": "2016-01-30", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2024-03-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-02-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-02-15"}

The highly reactive radical intermediates generated during the sodiation/desodiation process could be a critical issue because of undesired side reactions. Here we present durable electrodes with a stabilized \u03b1-C radical intermediate. Through the resonance effect as well as steric effects, the excessive reactivity of the unpaired electron is successfully suppressed, thus developing an electrode with stable cycling for over 2,000 cycles with 96.8% capacity retention. In addition, the \u03b1-radical demonstrates reversible transformation between three states: C=C; \u03b1-C\u00b7radical; and \u03b1-C<sup>-</sup> anion. Such transformation provides additional Na<sup>+</sup> storage equal to more than 0.83 Na<sup>+</sup> insertion per \u03b1-C radical for the electrodes. The strategy of intermediate radical stabilization could be enlightening in the design of organic electrodes with enhanced cycling life and energy storage capability.", "affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, South University of Science and Technology of China, Shenzhen 518055, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13318"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13318"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5103065"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5103065?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 66, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-08-16", "dateOfCreation": "2016-11-08", "firstIndexDate": "2016-11-10", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2024-03-26", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-11-07", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-11-07"}

VNBs from vanadium pentoxides (VO) are formed in the presence of graphene oxide (GO), a mild oxidant, which transforms into reduced GO (rGO<sub>HT</sub>), assisting in enhancing the electronic conductivity coupled with the mechanical robustness of VNBs. From electron microscopy, surface sensitive spectroscopy and other complementary structural characterization, hydrothermally-produced rGO nanosheets/nanoribbons are decorated with and inserted within the VNBs' layered crystal structure, which further confirmed the enhanced electronic conductivity of VNBs. Following the electrochemical properties of GVNBs being investigated, the specific capacitance <i>C</i><sub>sp</sub> is determined from cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a varying scan rate and galvanostatic charging-discharging (<i>V-t</i>) profiles with varying current density. The rGO-rich composite V\u2081G\u2083 (i.e., VO/GO = 1:3) showed superior specific capacitance followed by VO-rich composite V\u2083G\u2081 (VO/GO = 3:1), as compared to V\u2081G\u2081 (VO/GO = 1:1) composite, besides the constituents, i.e., rGO, rGO<sub>HT</sub> and VNBs. Composites V\u2081G\u2083 and V\u2083G\u2081 also showed excellent cyclic stability and a capacitance retention of >80% after 500 cycles at the highest specific current density. Furthermore, by performing extensive simulations and modeling of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, we determined various circuit parameters, including charge transfer and solution resistance, double layer and low frequency capacitance, Warburg impedance and the constant phase element. The detailed analyses provided greater insights into physical-chemical processes occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface and highlighted the comparative performance of thin heterogeneous composite electrodes. We attribute the superior performance to the open graphene topological network being beneficial to available ion diffusion sites and the faster transport kinetics having a larger accessible geometric surface area and synergistic integration with optimal nanostructured VO loading. Computational simulations via periodic density functional theory (DFT) with and without V\u2082O\u2085 adatoms on graphene sheets are also performed.

The conformal P3HT coating on the nanocomposite surface does not alter or reduce superhydrophicity while maintaining its reversible enhanced thermochromism. The polymeric matrix of the superhydrophobic surface is comprised of a blend of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) copolymer and an acrylic adhesive. Based on detailed X-ray diffraction measurements, this long-lasting, repeatable and hysteresis-free thermochromic effect is attributed to the enhancement of the Bragg peak associated with the d-spacing of interchain directional packing (100) which remains unaltered during several heating-cooling cycles. We propose that the superhydrophobic surface confines \u03c0-\u03c0 interchain stacking in P3HT with uniform d-spacing into its nanostructured texture resulting in better packing and reduction in face-on orientation. The rapid response of the system to sudden temperature changes is also demonstrated by water droplet impact and bounce back on heated surfaces. This effect can be exploited for embedded thin film temperature sensors for metal coatings.", "affiliation": "Smart Materials, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Via Morego 30, 16163 Genova, Italy.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep27984.pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep27984"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4908389"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4908389?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 4, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-04-11", "dateOfCreation": "2016-06-16", "firstIndexDate": "2016-06-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-06-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-06-15"}

Recently, a new type of FIB source has emerged, which uses ionization of laser cooled neutral atoms to produce the ion beam. The extremely cold temperatures attainable with laser cooling (in the range of 100 \u03bcK or below) result in a beam of ions with a very small transverse velocity distribution. This corresponds to a source with extremely high brightness that rivals or may even exceed the brightness of the industry standard Ga<sup>+</sup> liquid metal ion source. In this review we discuss the context of ion beam technology in which these new ion sources can play a role, their principles of operation, and some examples of recent demonstrations. The field is relatively new, so only a few applications have been demonstrated, most notably low energy ion microscopy with Li ions. Nevertheless, a number of promising new approaches have been proposed and/or demonstrated, suggesting that a rapid evolution of this type of source is likely in the near future.", "affiliation": "Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "1353447", "agency": "National Science Foundation (NSF)", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "70NANB10H193", "agency": "National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)", "orderIn": 0}, {"grantId": "9999-NIST", "agency": "Intramural NIST DOC", "acronym": "ImNIST", "orderIn": 0}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4944491"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4944491"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4882766"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4882766?pdf=render"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4944491"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "N", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": 10, "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "Y", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "Y", "manuscriptId": "NIHMS784129", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2016-05-31", "firstIndexDate": "2016-05-31", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-10-22", "dateOfRevision": "2025-05-29", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-03-24", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-03-24"}

This report together with an earlier publication of our group provides for the first time comprehensive investigations of phase equilibria and respective phase diagrams. Most of the phase equilibria could be established based on our experimental results. Only in the Li-rich part where many binary and ternary compounds are present estimations had to be done which are all indicated by dashed lines.

microtubular, Fe-encrusted sheaths. The encrustation has been previously linked to bacterial Fe oxidases, which oxidize Fe(II) to Fe(III) and/or active groups of bacterial exopolymers within sheaths to attract and bind aqueous-phase inorganics. When L. cholodnii SP-6 cells were cultured in media amended with high Fe(II) concentrations, Fe(III) precipitates visibly formed immediately after addition of Fe(II) to the medium, suggesting prompt abiotic oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). Intriguingly, these precipitates were deposited onto the sheath surface of bacterial cells as the population was actively growing. When Fe(III) was added to the medium, similar precipitates formed in the medium first and were abiotically deposited onto the sheath surfaces. The precipitates in the Fe(II) medium were composed of assemblies of globular, amorphous particles (ca. 50 nm diameter), while those in the Fe(III) medium were composed of large, aggregated particles (\u22653 \u00b5m diameter) with a similar amorphous structure. These precipitates also adhered to cell-free sheaths. We thus concluded that direct abiotic deposition of Fe complexes onto the sheath surface occurs independently of cellular activity in liquid media containing Fe salts, although it remains unclear how this deposition is associated with the previously proposed mechanisms (oxidation enzyme- and/or active group of organic components-involved) of Fe encrustation of the Leptothrix sheaths.", "affiliation": "Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Okayama 700-0082, Japan. tkunoh06@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "NNA13AA92A", "agency": "NASA", "orderIn": 0}, {"agency": "JST(CREST)", "orderIn": 0}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Sheath", "Abiotic Oxidation", "Fe(iii) Particles", "Leptothrix Cholodnii Sp-6", "Direct Deposition"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/5/2/26/pdf?version=1464957926"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/biology5020026"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4929540"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4929540?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": 8, "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2016-06-09", "dateOfCreation": "2016-06-09", "firstIndexDate": "2016-06-10", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-29", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-06-03", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-06-03"}

A monolayer of hydrogen and chlorine terminated plasma-synthesized Si-QDs were spin-coated on silver oxide thin films. A clearly enhanced signal of surface modes, including Si-Clx and Si-Hx modes were observed from as-synthesized Si-QDs as a result of the plasmonic enhancement of the Raman signal at Si-QD/silver oxide interface. Upon oxidation, a gradual decrease of Si-Clx and Si-Hx modes, and an emergence of Si-Ox and Si-O-Hx modes have been observed. In addition, first, second and third transverse optical modes of Si-QDs were also observed in the SERS spectra, revealing information on the crystalline morphology of Si-QDs. An absence of any of the abovementioned spectral features, but only the first transverse optical mode of Si-QDs from thick Si-QD films validated that the spectral features observed from Si-QDs on silver oxide thin films are originated from the SERS effect.

Safety is here operationally defined by, and limited to, the absence of evidence for a Serious Adverse Effect, the criteria for which are rigorously defined. This review adopts an evidence-based approach, based on an aggregation of experience from human trials, taking care not to confuse speculation on potential hazards or lack of data to refute such speculation with evidence for risk. Safety data from animal tests for tissue damage are reviewed with systematic consideration of translation to humans. Arbitrary safety considerations are avoided. Computational models are used to relate dose to brain exposure in humans and animals. We review relevant dose-response curves and dose metrics (e.g. current, duration, current density, charge, charge density) for meaningful safety standards. Special consideration is given to theoretically vulnerable populations including children and the elderly, subjects with mood disorders, epilepsy, stroke, implants, and home users. Evidence from relevant animal models indicates that brain injury by Direct Current Stimulation (DCS) occurs at predicted brain current densities (6.3-13\u2009A/m(2)) that are over an order of magnitude above those produced by conventional tDCS.

In this respect, our focus is on the properties of the electric double layer (EDL) formed by the electrolytes at the electrode surface as a function of surface potential (\u03a8). The rates of EDL formation are found to be on the order of hundreds of picoseconds and only slightly influenced by the addition of Li-salt. The EDLs of three electrolytes are shown to have different energy storage capacities, which we relate to the EDL formation free energy. The differential capacitance obtained from our computations exhibits asymmetry about the potential of zero charge and is consistent with the camel-like profiles noted from mean field theories and experiments on metallic electrodes. The introduction of Li-salt reduces the noted asymmetry in the differential capacitance profile. Complementary experimental capacitance measurements have been made on our three electrolytes in their neat forms and with Li-salt. The measurements, performed on glassy carbon electrodes, produce U-like profiles, and Li-salt doping is shown to strongly affect capacitance at high magnitudes of \u03a8. Differences in the theoretical and experimental shapes and magnitudes of capacitance are rationalized in terms of the electrode surface and pseudocapacitive effects. In both neat and Li-doped liquids, the details of the computational capacitance profile are well described by \u03a8-induced changes in the density and molecular orientation of ions in the molecular layer closest to the electrode. Our results suggest that the addition of Li<sup>+</sup> induces disorder in the EDL, which originates from the strong binding of anions to Li<sup>+</sup>. An in-depth analysis of the distribution of Li<sup>+</sup> in the EDL reveals that it does not readily enter the molecular layer at the electrode surface, preferring instead to be localized farther away from the surface in the second molecular layer. This behavior is validated through an analysis of the free energy of Li<sup>+</sup> solvation as a function of distance from the electrode. Free energy wells are found to coincide with localized concentrations of Li<sup>+</sup>, the depths of which increase with \u03a8 and suggest a source of impedance for Li<sup>+</sup> to reach the electrode.

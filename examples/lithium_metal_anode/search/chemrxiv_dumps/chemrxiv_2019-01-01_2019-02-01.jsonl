The remaining part of the system is represented by an embedding potential treating the environment either by a discrete or continuum model. In order to successfully make use of minimally sized quantum chemical regions, the<br />embedding potential should represent the environment as authentic as possible. Here, the importance of exactly such an accurate description of the embedding potential is investigated by comparing the performance of the Polarizable Embedding scheme against larger sized full quantum mechanical calculations. Our main conclusion is that as long as the solute and solvent do not overlap in their absorption spectra, the Polarizable Embedding approach shows results consistent with full quantum chemical calculations. For partly overlapping absorption spectra the Polarizable Embedding approach can furthermore successfully be expanded within a Frenkel exciton approach based on only economical monomeric quantum chemical calculations. Thus, by extending the Polarizable Embedding scheme to the exciton picture it is possible to cover computations of the whole absorption spectrum and<br />still reduce the computational cost compared to costly cluster calculations.<br />", "date": "2019-01-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, for challenging systems, the limitations in the accuracy of force fields prevents a reliable assessment of the relative thermodynamic stability of potential structures. Here we present a method to rapidly improve force field lattice energies by correcting two-body interactions with a higher level of theory in a fragment-based approach, and predicting these corrections with machine learning. We find corrected lattice energies with commonly used density functionals and second order perturbation theory (MP2) all significantly improve the ranking of experimentally known polymorphs where the rigid molecule model is applicable. The relative lattice energies of known polymorphs are also found to systematically improve towards experimentally determined values and more comprehensive energy models when using MP2 corrections, despite remaining at the force field geometry. Predicting two-body interactions with atom-centered symmetry functions in a Gaussian process is found to give highly accurate results with as little as 10-20% of the training data, reducing the cost of the energy correction by up to an order of magnitude.

Tin(II) bis(trifluoroacetate) (1\u2032) eliminates trifluoroacetic anhydride upon sublimation to form the linear polymeric  hexatin(II)-di-\u03bc -oxy-octakis-\u03bc-trifluoroacetate (1F ), which itself sublimes (1 Torr at 191 C) as a 1:1 mixture of 1 and ditin(II)-\u03bc-oxy-bis-\u03bc-trifluoroacetate (1\u2032\u2032). Tin(IV) tetrakis(trifluoroacetate) (2F) is also polymeric in the solid state, but evaporates as a monomer at low temperatures (1 Torr at 84 \u25e6C). Together they make a family of multifunctional Lewis acidic and basic building blocks for supramolecular organization of clusters and polymers in the solid state. Anomalous trends in the volatility of these trifluoroacetates and their hydrogenated derivatives can be rationalized by consideration of their modes of polymerization with respect to the thermodynamics of evaporation.

Here we present a general approach to synthesize imine-linked 2D COF nanoparticles and control their size by favoring imine polymerization while preventing the nucleation of new particles. The method yields uniform, crystalline, and high-surface-area particles and is applicable to several imine-linked COFs. In situ X-ray scattering experiments reveal the nucleation of amorphous polymers, which crystallize via imine exchange processes during and after particle growth, consistent with previous mechanistic studies of imine-linked COF powders.

Palladium has been shown to make formate with a high selectivity at minimal overpotential. However, production of CO as a minor product quickly deactivates the catalyst during extended electrolysis. Here, we present nanoporous Pd alloys (np-PdX) formed by electrochemical dealloying of Pd15X85 alloys (X = Co, Ni, Cu, and Ag) as active free standing electrocatalysts with high formate selectivity and superior CO poisoning tolerance. Rate of deactivation under constant potential electrolysis, due to CO passivation, is strongly correlated to the identity of the transition metal alloying component. We purport that this composition dependent behavior is due to the induced electronic changes in the active Pd surface, affecting both the CO adsorption strength and the near surface hydrogen solubility which can impact the adsorption strength of active/inactive intermediates and reaction selectivity. Free-standing np-PdCo is found to exhibit high areal formate partial current densities, > 40 mA cm-2, with superior CO poisoning tolerance and minimal active area loss at cathodic potentials, demonstrating the utility of these materials for selective and stable CO2 electrolysis", "date": "2019-01-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To overcome this challenge toward realizing fully automated chemical discovery in transition metal chemistry, we have developed the first machine learning models that predict the likelihood of successful simulation outcomes. We train support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers to predict simulation outcomes (i.e., geometry optimization result and degree of  deviation) for a chosen electronic structure method based on chemical composition. For these static models, we achieve an area under the curve of at least 0.95, minimizing computational time spent on non- productive simulations and therefore enabling efficient chemical space exploration. We introduce a metric of model uncertainty based on the distribution of points in the latent space to systematically improve model prediction confidence. In a complementary approach, we train a convolutional neural network classification model on simulation output electronic and geometric structure time series data. This dynamic model generalizes more readily than the static classifier by becoming more predictive as input simulation length increases.

The results show that both the basal siloxane surfaces and protonated broken edge surfaces of montmorillonite both prefer CO2 relative to CH4 suggesting that methods of enhanced oil and gas production using CO2 will readily displace CH4 from such pores.

Hence, there remains a need to develop a deeper, more robust understanding of the connections between molecular and polymer chemistry, structure, processing, solid-state order, and materials properties to enable judicious materials design principles. Towards this goal, we employ fully-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b\u2019]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7), a donor\u2013acceptor copolymer that has been widely investigated in the organic solar cell literature, to unravel some of these associations.

When a dispersion of zirconium oxide nanoparticles and MTMS was used as a starting material, a macroporous monolith was also obtained by the same simple process. The colloidal gelation occurs because the silanol moiety is more likely to react with the colloid surface of ceramic materials than with other silanols derived from MTMS and their oligomer. Due to the development of material chemistry, colloidal dispersions having various shapes and compositions are becoming available as products. Based on this mechanism, it is expected to be feasible to fabricate various porous monoliths with characteristic morphologies and properties depending on the colloid.<br />", "date": "2019-01-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Ceramics; Materials Processing; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Physical and Chemical Processes; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Graphene can be prepared in controlled orientation by changing the surface chemistry of GO flakes in suspensions via reduction which causes the graphene to coagulate and self-assemble in specific patterns. Tuning the structure and porosity of oriented graphene is possible by varying the synthesis conditions. Herein, we report the growth of oriented graphene from a relatively small flake size GO suspension. The prepared electrode material demonstrated an excellent electrochemical performance with a supercapacitance value of 195 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1 and low real impedance with good stability and integrity after 4000 cycles of continuous charge-discharge in 1 M KOH electrolyte. This excellent performance is due to the unique architecture of the oriented graphene which comprises micro-slits and meso-channels among the sheets. The meso-channels were suggested to allow rapid diffusion of charge carriers and ions while the micro-slits increase more surface area for electrochemical interactions per unit volume. The observations reported herein create a new understanding of the structure-stability-performance trade-off in oriented graphene and layout the foundation for further investigations on their sustainable utilization in energy storage applications.", "date": "2019-01-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Thermal Conductors and Insulators; Electrochemistry; Energy Storage; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

By\nminimizing the variance of the free energy differences along the pathway in an\noptimized way, a new type of adaptive SMD (ASMD) is introduced. As exhibits in\nthe alchemical case, this adaptive sampling method outperforms the traditional\nequal-time SMD in nonequilibrium stratification. Also, the method gives much more\nefficient calculation of potential of mean force than the selection criterion\nbased ASMD scheme, which is proven to be more efficient than traditional SMD. The\nvariance-linearly-dependent minus time derivative of overall variance proposed\nfor OBAR and OCE criterion is extended to determine the importance rank of the nonequilibrium\npulling in the configurational space.

In the non-periodic CV case, the end-state discrimination in\nthe SD rank is eliminated in the TDV rank, while in the periodic CV case the\ncorrection introduced in the TDV rank is not that significant.

Crucial questions regarding selectivity and reaction time waited to be addressed.

Using DMDO, the oxidation yields acetone as the only side-product, which reduces the work-up to mere evaporation of solvents and excessive reagent.

This makes them extremely attractive for practical applications, including CO<sub>2</sub> capture from industrial emission sources; however, the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of Zr-MOFs is moderate compared to that of the best performing MOFs reported to date. Functionalization of Zr-MOFs with amino groups has been demonstrated to increase their affinity for CO<sub>2</sub>. In this work, we assessed the potential of post-synthetic defect exchange (PSDE) as an alternative approach to introduce amino functionalities at missing-cluster defective sites in formic acid modulated UiO-66. Both pyridine-containing (picolinic acid and nicotinic acid) and aniline-containing (3-aminobenzoic acid and anthranilic acid) monocarboxylates were integrated within defective UiO-66 with this method. Non-defective UiO-66 modified with linkers bearing the same amino groups (2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and 2-aminoterephthalic acid) were prepared by classical post-synthetic ligand exchange (PSE), in order to compare the effect of introducing functionalities at defective sites versus installing them on the backbone. PSDE reduces the porosity of defective UiO-66, but improves both the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity, whereas PSE has no effect on the porosity of non-defective UiO-66, improving the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake but leaving selectivity unchanged. Modification of defective UiO-66 with benzoic acid reveals that pore size reduction is the main factor responsible for the observed uptake improvement, whereas the presence of nitrogen atoms in the pores seems to be beneficial for increasing selectivity. <br />", "date": "2019-01-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Solid State Chemistry; Ligands (Organomet.); Clusters", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, such motions can be slow compared to simulation timescales, yet critical. Specifically, adequate sampling of sidechain motions in protein binding pockets proves crucial for obtaining accurate estimates of ligand binding free energies from molecular simulations. The timescale of sidechain rotamer flips can range from a few ps to several hundred ns or longer, particularly in crowded environments like the interior of proteins. Here, we apply a mixed non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC)/molecular dynamics (MD) method to enhance sampling of sidechain rotamers.  The NCMC portion of our method applies a switching protocol wherein the steric and electrostatic interactions between target sidechain atoms and the surrounding environment are cycled off and then back on during the course of a move proposal. Between NCMC move proposals, simulation of the system continues via traditional molecular dynamics. Here, we first validate this approach on a simple, solvated valine-alanine dipeptide system and then apply it to a well-studied model ligand binding site in T4 lysozyme L99A. We compute the rate of rotamer transitions for a valine sidechain using our approach and compare it to that of traditional molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we show that our NCMC/MD method substantially enhances sidechain sampling, especially in systems where the torsional barrier to rotation is high (>10 kcal/mol). These barriers can be intrinsic torsional barriers or steric barriers imposed by the environment.</div><div>Overall, this may provide a promising strategy to selectively improve sidechain sampling in molecular simulations.</div>", "date": "2019-01-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this successor to the DFT-D3 model, the atomic coordination-dependent dipole polarizabilities are scaled based on atomic partial charges which can be taken from various sources. For this purpose, a new charge-dependent parameter-economic scaling function is designed. Classical charges are obtained from an atomic electronegativity equilibration procedure for which efficient analytical derivatives are developed. A numerical Casimir-Polder integration of the atom-in-molecule dynamic polarizabilities yields charge- and geometry-dependent dipole-dipole dispersion coefficients. Similar to the D3 model, the dynamic polarizabilities are pre-computed by time-dependent DFT and elements up to radon are covered. For a benchmark set of 1225 dispersion coefficients, the D4 model achieves an unprecedented accuracy with a mean relative deviation of 3.8% compared to 4.7% for D3. In addition to the two-body part, three-body effects are described by an Axilrod-Teller-Muto term. A common many-body dispersion expansion was extensively tested and an energy correction based on D4 polarizabilities is found to be advantageous for some larger systems. Becke-Johnson-type damping parameters for DFT-D4 are determined for more than 60 common functionals. For various energy benchmark sets DFT-D4 slightly outperforms DFT-D3. Especially for metal containing systems, the introduced charge dependence improves thermochemical properties. We suggest (DFT-)D4 as a physically improved and more sophisticated dispersion model in place of DFT-D3 for DFT calculations as well as for other low-cost approaches like semi-empirical models.<br /><br />", "date": "2019-01-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bonding; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Yet, the relative thermodynamic stability of its most common polymorphs (diamond-like cubic and graphite-like hexagonal) has not been resolved satisfactorily because of the crucial role played by kinetic factors in the formation of BN phases at high temperatures and pressures (experiments), and by competing bonding, electrostatic and many-body dispersion forces in BN cohesion (theory). This lack of understanding hampers the development of potential technological applications, and challenges the boundaries of fundamental science.  Here, we use high-level first-principles theories that correctly reproduce all important electronic interactions (the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the random phase approximation) to estimate with unprecedented accuracy the energy differences between BN polymorphs, and thus overcome the accuracy hurdle that hindered previous theoretical studies. We show that the ground-state phase of BN is cubic and that the frequently observed two-dimensional hexagonal polymorph becomes entropically stabilized over the cubic at temperatures slightly above ambient conditions (Tc = 63+-20'C). We also reveal a new low-symmetry monoclinic phase that is extremely competitive with the other low-energy polymorphs and which could explain the origins of the experimentally observed ``compressed h--BN'' phase.

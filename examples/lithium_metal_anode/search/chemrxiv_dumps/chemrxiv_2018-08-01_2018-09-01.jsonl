The rates of spin-forbidden reactions are mediated both by the free energy barrier connecting reactants and products, as well as the strength of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between the relevant electronic states. Since the 1950\u2019s, there have been numerous demonstrations of external heavy-atom effects on organic molecules, in which a heavy atom, not chemically bonded to the molecule undergoing a change in spin state, perturbs the strength of SOC via an intermolecular effect. However, the potential role of external heavy atom effects on the rates of reactions involving transition metal complexes remains almost entirely unexplored. We report a computational investigation into the changes in SOC that occur along a bimolecular reaction coordinate when an incoming atom coordinates to the prototypical triplet reaction intermediate Fe(CO)4. The calculated changes in SOC are compared for molecules containing atoms ranging in atomic number from Z = 8 to Z = 53 approaching the Fe center (ZFe =26). No evidence for an external heavy atom effect was found, and the changes in SOC with the approach of each incoming group were similar in magnitude. In fact, when taking into account the different minimum energy crossing point geometries for the different incoming groups, the opposite of an external heavy atom effect trend is predicted for this reaction. The results of this computational study suggest that external heavy atom effects are unlikely to have a significant effect on the rates of spin-forbidden reactions for transition metal complexes.   <br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Theory - Inorganic; Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

But macroscale surface alignment of MOF crystals has only been demonstrated in a few cases. To accelerate the materials discovery process, we have developed a high-throughput computational screening algorithm to identify MOFs that are likely to undergo macroscale aligned heterepitaxial growth on a substrate. Screening of thousands of MOF structures by this process can be achieved in a few days on a desktop workstation. The algorithm filters MOFs based on surface chemical compatibility, lattice matching with the substrate, and interfacial bonding. Our method uses a simple new computationally efficient measure of the interfacial energy that considers both bond and defect formation at the interface. Furthermore, we show that this novel descriptor is a better predictor of aligned heteroepitaxial growth than other established interface descriptors, by testing our screening algorithm on a sample set of copper MOFs that have been grown heteroepitaxially on a copper hydroxide surface. Application of the screening process to several MOF databases reveals that the top candidates for aligned growth on copper hydroxide comprise mostly MOFs  with rectangular lattice symmetry in the plane of the substrate. This result indicates a substrate-directing effect that could be exploited in targeted synthetic strategies. We also identify that MOFs likely to form aligned heterostructures have broad distributions of in-plane pore sizes and anisotropies. Accordingly, this suggests that aligned MOF thin films with a wide range of properties may be experimentally accessible.", "date": "2018-08-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Thin Films; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Structures are defined in hierarchical trees in which subunits can be represented by geometric or atomic models. Repeating subunits can be docked into their assembly symmetries, describing their locations and orientations in space. The scattering amplitude of the entire structure can be calculated by computing the amplitudes of the basic subunits on 3D reciprocal-space grids, moving up in the hierarchy, calculating the RGs of the larger structures, and by repeating this process for all the leaves and nodes of the tree. For very large structures, a Hybrid method can be used to avoid numerical artifacts. In the Hybrid method, only grids of smaller subunits are summed and used as subunits in a direct computation of the scattering amplitude. D+ can accurately analyze both small- and wide-angle solution X-ray scattering data. We present how D+ applies the RG algorithm, accounts for rotations and translations of subunits, processes atomic models, accounts for the contribution of the solvent as well as the solvation layer of complex structures in a scalable manner, writes and accesses RGs, interpolates between grid points, computes numerical integrals, enables the use of scripts to define complicated structures, applies fitting algorithms, accounts for several coexisting uncorrelated populations, and accelerates computations using GPUs. D+ may also account for different X-ray energies to analyze anomalous solution X-ray scattering data. An accessory tool that can identify repeating subunits in a protein data bank (PDB) file of a complex structure is provided. The tool can compute the orientation and translation of repeating subunits needed for exploiting the advantages of the RG algorithm in D+. In addition, a python wrapper is also available, enabling more advanced computations and integration of D+ with other computational tools.

The reaction consists of a primary non-observable zymogen activation reaction that it is coupled to an indicator (observable) reaction. The product of the first reaction is the enzyme of the indicator reaction, and both reactions are governed by the Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism. Using singular perturbation methods, we derive asymptotic solutions that are valid under the quasi-steady-state and reactant-stationary assumptions. In particular, we obtain closed form solutions that are analogous to the Schnell-Mendoza equation for Michaelis-Menten type reactions. These closed-form solutions approximate the evolution of the observable reaction and provide the mathematical link necessary to measure the enzyme activity of the non-observable reaction. Conditions for the validity of the asymptotic solutions are also derived, and we demonstrate that these asymptotic expressions are applicable under reactant-stationary kinetics.</div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemical Analysis; Biophysical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The key question is how to explore this vast parameter space in a practical way.  Computational methods can guide experimental work however, even the most efficient electronic structure methods such as density functional theory, are too time consuming to explore more than a tiny fraction of all possible hybrid 2D materials. Here we demonstrate that a combination of DFT and machine learning techniques provide a practical method for exploring this parameter space much more efficiently than by DFT or experiment. As a proof of concept we applied this methodology to predict the interlayer distance and band gap of bilayer heterostructures. Our methods quickly and accurately predicted these important properties for a large number of hybrid 2D materials. This work paves the way for rapid computational screening of the vast parameter space of van der Waals heterostructures to identify new hybrid materials with useful and interesting properties.</p>", "date": "2018-08-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Multilayers; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In cyanobacteria, the photoprotective role is played by a specialized complex, the Orange Carotenoid Protein which is activated by strong blue-green light. This photoactivation involves a unique series of structural changes which terminate with an opening of the complex into two separated domains, one of which acts as a quencher for the light-harvesting complexes. Many experimental studies have tried to reveal the molecular mechanisms through which the energy absorbed by the carotenoid finally leads to the large conformational change of the complex. Here for the first time, these mechanisms are revealed by simulating at atomistic level the whole dynamics of the complex through an effective combination of enhanced sampling techniques. On the basis of our findings, we can conclude that the carotenoid does not act as a spring that, releasing its internal strain, induces the dissociation, as it was previously proposed but as a \"latch\" locking together the two domains. The photochemically triggered displacement of the carotenoid breaks this balance, allowing the complex to dissociate. <br />", "date": "2020-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thus far, reaction networks have been limited in size by chemically inconsistent graph representations of multi-reactant reactions (e.g. A + B reacts to C) that cannot enforce stoichiometric constraints, precluding the use of optimized shortest-path algorithms. Here, we report a chemically consistent graph architecture that overcomes these limitations using a novel multi-reactant representation and iterative cost-solving procedure. Our approach enables the identification of all low-cost pathways to desired products in massive reaction networks containing reactions of any stoichiometry, allowing for the investigation of vastly more complex systems than previously possible. Leveraging our architecture, we construct the first ever electrochemical reaction network from first-principles thermodynamic calculations to describe the formation of the Li-ion solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is critical for passivation of the negative electrode. Using this network comprised of nearly 6,000 species and 4.5 million reactions, we interrogate the formation of a key SEI component, lithium ethylene dicarbonate. We automatically identify previously proposed mechanisms as well as multiple novel pathways containing counter-intuitive reactions that have not, to our knowledge, been reported in the literature.

For eventual deployment as viable sub-nanoscale components that are compatible with current electronic device technology, conformational switching should controllable by a local electric field (i.e. E-field gateable) and accompanied by a rapid change in conduction. In organic chemical systems the degree of \u03c0-conjugation is linked to the degree of electronic delocalisation, and thus largely determines the conductivity. Here, by means of accurate first principles calculations, we study the prototypical biphenyl based molecular system in which the dihedral angle between the two rings determines the degree of conjugation. In order to make this a gateable system we create a net dipole by asymmetrically functionalising one ring with electronegative substituents (F, Br and CN) with different polarisabilities. In this way, the application of an E-field interacts with the dipolar system to influence the dihedral angle, thus controlling the conjugation. For all three considered substituents we consider a range of E-fields, and in each case extract conformational energy profiles. Using this data we obtain the minimum E-field required to induce a barrierless switching event for each system. We further extract the estimated switching speeds, the conformational probabliities at finite temperatures, and the effect of applied E-field on electronic structure.

Still, to date the reaction mechanism is poorly understood which hampers further development. Here, we show that the mechanism of the SuFEx reaction for the prototypical example of methanesulfonyl fluoride reacting with methylamine can be understood as an SN2-type reaction. By analyzing the reaction path with the help of density functional theory in vacuo and under consideration of solvent and co-reactant influence we identify the often used complementary base as crucial ingredient to lower the reaction barrier significantly by increasing the nucleophilicity of the primary amine. With the help of energy decomposition analysis (EDA) at the transition state structures we quantify the underlying stereo-electronic effects and propose new avenues for experimental exploration of the potential of SuFEx chemistry.", "date": "2020-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Bioinspired complexes that form high valent metal-oxo intermediates capable of hydrogen abstraction and rebound hydroxylation are promising candidates. This promise has made them a target for computational high-throughput screening, typically simplified through the use of linear free energy relationships (LFERs). However, their mid-row transition-metal centers have numerous accessible spin and oxidation states that increase the combinatorial scale of design efforts. Here, we carry out a computational design screen of over 2,500 mid-row 3<i>d</i> transition-metal complexes with four metals in numerous spin and oxidation states. We demonstrate the importance of spin/oxidation state in dictating design principles, limiting the generalization of strategies derived for widely studied high-spin Fe(II) catalysts to other metals or spin/oxidation states. Combined assessment of the effect of ligand field tuning on reaction step energetics and on the identity of the ground state allows us to propose refined design strategies for spin-allowed methane-to-methanol catalysis. We observed weak coupling of energetics and design principles between reaction steps (e.g., oxo-formation vs methanol release), meaning that LFERs do not generalize across our larger catalyst set. To rationalize relative reactivity in known catalysts, we instead compute independent reaction energies and propose strategies for further improvements in catalyst design.", "date": "2020-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "High-throughput Screening; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For canonical asparagine glycosylation, the recognition sequence that directs glycosylation at specific asparagine residues is well-established. It generally holds for protein glycosylation that the primary amino acid sequence is most important for substrate recognition. Here we reveal that a recently discovered bacterial enzyme called EarP, that transfers rhamnose to a specific arginine residue in its acceptor protein EF-P, specifically recognizes a \u03b2-hairpin loop. Notably, while the rhamnosyltransferase activity of EarP is abolished when presented with linear substrate peptide sequences derived from EF-P <i>in vitro</i>, the enzyme readily glycosylates the same sequence when presented in a cyclized \u03b2-hairpin mimic containing an l-Pro-d-Pro motif. Additional studies with other substrate-mimicking cyclic peptides revealed that EarP activity is sensitive to the method used to induce cyclization and in some cases is tolerant to amino acid sequence variation. Using detailed NMR approaches, we established that the active peptide substrates all share some degree of \u03b2-hairpin formation, and therefore conclude that the \u03b2-hairpin epitope is the major determinant of arginine-rhamnosylation by EarP. Our findings add a novel recognition motif to the existing knowledge on substrate specificity of protein glycosylation, and are expected to inform future identifications of rhamnosylation sites in other protein substrates.</p>", "date": "2020-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Simulations reported here use a mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) framework in a very large periodic simulation cell, in order to avoid finite-size artifacts and to facilitate testing of various density functionals, in order to probe the effects of delocalization error.  The preponderance of hemibonded structures predicted by generalized gradient approximations persists in simulations using the hybrid functionals B3LYP and PBE0, but is reduced to a minor population if the fraction of exact exchange is increased significantly.   The hemibonded population is also small in simulations employing the long-range corrected functional LRC-wPBE.

The term \"pi-stacking\" is considered by some to be a misnomer, in part because overlapping pi-electron densities are thought to incur steric repulsion, and the physical origins of the widely-encountered \"slip-stacked\" motif have variously been attributed to either sterics or electrostatics, in competition with dispersion.  Here, we use quantum-mechanical energy decomposition analysis to investigate pi-pi interactions in supramolecular complexes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ranging in size up to realistic models of graphene, and for comparison we perform the same analysis on stacked complexes of polycyclic <i>saturated</i> hydrocarbons, which are cyclohexane-based analogues of graphane.  Our results help to explain the short-range structure of liquid hydrocarbons that is inferred from neutron scattering, trends in melting-point data, the interlayer separation of graphene sheets, and finally band gaps and observation of molecular plasmons in graphene nanoribbons.  Analysis of intermolecular forces demonstrates that aromatic pi-pi interactions constitute a unique and fundamentally quantum-mechanical form of non-bonded interaction.  Not only do stacked pi-pi architectures enhance dispersion, but quadrupolar electrostatic interactions that may be repulsive at long range are rendered attractive at the intermolecular distances that characterize pi-stacking, as a result of charge penetration effects.   The planar geometries of aromatic sp<sup>2</sup> carbon networks lead to attractive interactions that are \"served up on a molecular pizza peel\", and adoption of slip-stacked geometries minimizes steric (rather than electrostatic) repulsion.  The slip-stacked motif therefore emerges not as a defect induced by electrostatic  repulsion but rather as a natural outcome of a conformation landscape that is dominated by van der Waals interactions (dispersion plus Pauli repulsion), and is therefore fundamentally quantum-mechanical in its origins.   This reinterpretation of the forces responsible for pi-stacking has important implications for the manner in which non-bonded interactions are modeled using classical force fields, and for rationalizing the prevalence of the slip-stacked pi-pi motif in protein crystal structures.<br /><br />", "date": "2020-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Following photon absorption by the photocatalyst, electron transfer from an organic reagent is the most common mechanistic outcome for this class of reaction. Reduction potentials for organic reagents are therefore useful to predict reactivity and DFT proved to be useful as a predictive tool in this regard. Due to the complex mechanisms that follow electron transfer, kinetics play a crucial role in the success of photoredox reactions. We extend the predictive tools of DFT to estimate the electron transfer <i>rates</i> between an excited photocatalyst and various organic substrates. To calibrate our model, 49 electron transfer rate constants were experimentally measured in acetonitrile for the catalyst Ir[dF(CF<sub>3</sub>)ppy]<sub>2</sub>(dtbpy)<sup>+</sup>. The rate constants, k<i><sub>q</sub></i>, gave a clear predictive trend when compared to calculated ionization energies in \u201cfrozen solvent\u201d, which was a better predictor than standard reduction potentials in our case.

Recently, the idea of a solid-electrolyte inductive effect was proposed, whereby changes in bonding within the solid-electrolyte host-framework modify the potential-energy landscape for the mobile ions, resulting in an enhanced ionic conductivity.

While sales have increased worldwide, a growing body of experimental and epidemiological evidence has suggested APAP as a possible risk factor for various health disorders. To perform internal exposure-based risk assessment, the use of accurate and optimized biomonitoring methods is criticical. However, retrospectively assessing pharmaceutical use of APAP in humans is challenging because of its short half-life. The objective of this study was to address the key biomonitoring issues with APAP using current standard analytical methods based on urinary analyses of free APAP and its phase II conjugates. Using non-targeted analyses based on high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified in a controlled longitudinal exposure study with male volunteers, unrecognized APAP metabolites with delayed formation and excretion rates. We postulate that these metabolites are formed via the thiomethyl shunt after the enterohepatic circulation as already observed in rodents. Importantly, the conjugated thiomethyl metabolites were (i) of comparable diagnostic sensitivity as the free APAP and its phase II conjugates detected by current methods; (ii) had delayed peak levels in blood and urine compared to other APAP metabolites and therefore potentially extend the window of exposure assessment; and (iii) provide relevant information regarding metabolic pathways of interest from a toxicological point of view. Including these metabolites in future APAP biomonitoring methods provide an option to decrease potential underestimation of APAP use and challenges the notion that the standard methods in biomonitoring based exclusively on the parent compound and its phase II metabolites are adequate for human biomonitoring of non-persistant chemical such as APAP. <br />", "date": "2020-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The dynamics of the lowest member of these series, the <i>3s\u03c3g</i> state around 21 eV, has been challenging to study owing to its ultra-short lifetime (< 10 fs). Here, we apply transient wave-mixing spectroscopy with an attosecond XUV pulse to investigate the decay dynamics of this electronic state. Lifetimes of 5.8\u00b10.5 fs and 4.5\u00b10.7 fs at 95% confidence intervals are obtained for v=0 and v=1 vibrational levels of the 3s Rydberg state, respectively. A theoretical treatment of predissociation and electronic autoionization finds that these lifetimes are dominated by electronic autoionization. The strong dependence of the electronic autoionization rate on the internuclear distance because of two ionic decay channels that cross the <i>3s</i> Rydberg state results in the different lifetimes of the two vibrational levels. The calculated lifetimes are highly sensitive to the location of the <i>3s</i> potential with respect to the decay channels; by slight adjustment of the location, values of 6.2 and 5.0 fs are obtained computationally for the v=0 and v=1 levels, respectively, in good agreement with experiment. Overall, an intriguing picture of the coupled nuclear-electronic dynamics is revealed by attosecond XUV wave-mixing spectroscopy, indicating that the decay dynamics are not a simple competition between isolated autoionization and predissociation processes.", "date": "2020-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Because RP quantization uses extended phase space to describe the photon field, it significantly reduces the computational costs compared to the commonly used Fock states description of the radiation field. Compared to the other quasi-classical descriptions of the photon field, such as the classical Wigner model, the RP representation provides a much more accurate description of the polaritonic quantum dynamics, because it properly preserves the quantum distribution of the photonic DOF throughout the quantum dynamics propagation of the molecule-cavity hybrid system, whereas the classical Wigner model fails to do so.

For this purpose, we used aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) to gain chirality pure (6,5)-, (7,5)-, (9,4)- and (7,6)-\nSWCNTs (emission at ~ 990, 1040, 1115 and 1130 nm). Exchange of the surfactant sodium deoxycholate (DOC) to specific singlestranded (ss)DNA sequences yielded monochiral sensors for small analytes (dopamine, riboflavin, ascorbic acid, pH). DOC used in\nthe separation process was completely removed because residues impaired sensing. The assembled monochiral sensors were up to 10\ntimes brighter than their non-purified counterparts and the ssDNA sequence affected absolute fluorescence intensity as well as colloidal (long-term) stability and selectivity for the analytes. (GT)40-(6,5)-SWCNTs displayed the maximum fluorescence response to\nthe neurotransmitter dopamine (+140 %, Kd = 1.9 x10-7 M) and a long-term stability > 14 days. Furthermore, the specific ssDNA\nsequences imparted selectivity to the analytes independent of SWCNT chirality and handedness of (+/-) (6,5)-SWCNTs. These\nmonochiral/single-color SWCNTs enabled ratiometric/multiplexed sensing of dopamine, riboflavin, H2O2 and pH. In summary, we\ndemonstrated the assembly, characteristics and potential of monochiral (single-color) SWCNTs for multiple NIR fluorescent sensing\napplications.", "date": "2020-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Carbon-based Materials; Analytical Chemistry - General; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Transfer entropy analysis holds the potential to reveal pathways or networks of residues that are coupled in their information flow and thus give new insights into folding and binding dynamics. Most current methods for calculating transfer entropy require very long simulations and almost equally long calculations of joint probability histograms to compute the information transfer that make these methods either functionally intractable or statistically unreliable. Available approximate methods based on graph and network theory approaches are rapid but lose sensitivity to the chemical nature of the biomolecules and thus are not applicable in mutation studies. We show that reliable estimates of the transfer entropy can be obtained from the variance-covariance matrix of atomic fluctuations, which converges quickly and retains sensitivity to the full chemical profile of the biomolecular system. We validate our method on ERK2, a well-studied kinase involved in the MAPK signaling cascade for which considerable computational, experimental, and mutation data are available. We present the results of transfer entropy analysis on data obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of wild type active and inactive ERK2, along with mutants Q103A, I84A, L73P, and G83A. We show that our method is consistent with the results of computational and experimental studies on ERK2, and we provide a method for interpreting networks of interconnected residues in the protein from a perspective of allosteric coupling. We introduce new insights about possible allosteric activity of the extreme N-terminal region of the kinase, which to date has been under-explored in the literature and may provide an important new direction for kinase studies. We also describe evidence that suggests activation may occur by different paths or routes in different mutants.

To this end, we measure the rates of decarbonylation and hydrogenation of butyraldehyde, the reactive intermediate for the industrially relevant Guerbet condensation, and correlate the selectivity and reactivity with the properties of the catalysts via a range of characterization efforts. Data obtained from EXAFS and XANES show that the bulk of the catalyst metallic nanoparticles is enriched in Pd, while the surface is enriched in Cu and Ag. The data for PdCu show clear dominance of geometric (ensemble) effects on the selectivity. Conversely, the electronic (ligand) effects of alloying dominate over the reaction rate of the catalysts, as electron donation from Cu to Pd promotes the Cu and increases the desired (de)hydrogenation reactions. In contrast, in PdAg catalysts, the weaker electronic exchange, as indicated by Pd L edge XANES and theoretical calculations, is not sufficient to promote Ag, resulting in monotonic loss of activity with increasing Ag content and without selectivity improvement.

Many charge models exist and it is unclear which model provides the best assignment of partial atomic charges in response to the local molecular environment. In this work, we systematically scrutinize various electronic structure methods and charge models (Mulliken, Natural Population Analysis, CHelpG, RESP, Hirshfeld, Iterative Hirshfeld, and Bader) by evaluating their performance in predicting the dipole moments of isolated water, water clusters, and liquid water as well as charge transfer in the water dimer and liquid water. Although none of the seven charge models is capable of fully capturing the dipole moment increase from isolated water (1.85 D) to liquid water (about 2.9 D), the Iterative Hirshfeld method performs best for liquid water, reproducing its experimental average molecular dipole moment, yielding a reasonable amount of intermolecular charge transfer, and showing modest sensitivity to the local water environment. The performance of the charge model is dependent on the choice of the density functional and the quantum treatment of the environment. The computed molecular dipole moment of water generally increases with the percentage of the exact Hartree-Fock exchange in the functional, whereas the amount of charge transfer between molecules decreases. For liquid water, including two full solvation shells of surrounding water molecules (within about 5.5 A of the central water) in the quantum-chemical calculation converges the charges of the central water molecule. Our final pragmatic quantum-chemical charge assigning protocol for liquid water is the Iterative Hirshfeld method with M06-HF/aug-cc-pVDZ and a quantum region cutoff radius of 5.5 A.<br />", "date": "2020-10-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To tackle this problem, TiO2\nnanoparticles were attached on the surface of PES membranes using polydopamine as adhesive\nagent.

However, SM tracking (SMT) remains unreliable at molecular length scales, as the localization-error (LE) of SM trajectories (~30-50 nm) is considerably larger than size of molecular tracers (~1-3 nm). Thus, instances of tracer (im)mobility in heterogeneous media, which provide indicator for underlying anomalous-transport mechanisms, remains obscured within the realms of SMT. Since translation of passive tracers in an isotropic network is associated with fast dipolar rotation, we propose authentic pauses within LE can be revealed upon probing SM reorientational dynamics. Here, we demonstrate how polarization-resolved SMT (PR-SMT) can provide emission-anisotropy at each super-localized position, thereby revealing tumbling propensity of SMs during random walk. For Rhodamine 6G tracers undergoing heterogeneous transport in a hydrated polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) network, analyses of PR-SMT trajectories enabled us to discern instances of genuine immobility and localized motion within the LE. Our investigations on 100 SMs in hydrated (plasticized) PVP films reveal a wide distribution of dwell-times and pause-frequencies, which demonstrate that majority of probes intermittently experience complete translational and rotational immobilization. This indicates tracers serendipitously encounter compact, rigid polymer cavities during transport, implying the existence of nanoscale glass-like domains sparsely distributed in a redominantly deep-rubbery polymer network far above the glass transition.

We further benchmark the simulation predictions of sodium carbonate\nand bicarbonate formation in the clay interlayers using Small and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering\nmeasurements. Subsequently, leveraging the benchmarked forcefield, we interrogate the pathway\nof speciation reactions with emphasis on carbonate, formate, and hydroxide groups elucidating the\nenergetics, transition states, intermediates, and preferred products. We also delineate the\ndifferences in reactivities and catalytic effects of clay edges, facets, and interlayers owing to their\nlocal chemical environments, which have far reaching consequences in their speciation behavior.\nThe experimental and simulation approaches described in this study and the transferable\nforcefields can be applied translationally to advance the science of clay-fluid interactions for\nseveral applications including subsurface fluid storage and recovery and clay-pollutant dynamics", "date": "2020-10-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Environmental Science; Geochemistry; Soil Science; Space Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One of the methods to improve the lifetime of LIBs is by the inclusion of additive molecules to stabilize the SEI. To understand the effect of additive molecules on the initial stage of SEI formation, we compare the decomposition and oligomerization reactions of a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive on a range of oxygen functionalized graphitic anode to those of an ethylene carbonate (EC) organic electrolyte. A series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations augmented by ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that EC decomposition on an oxygen functionalized graphitic (1120) edge facet through an SN2 mechanism is spontaneous, even in an uncharged cell. Decomposition of EC through an SN2 reaction pathway results in alkoxide species regeneration which is responsible for continual oligomerization along the graphitic surface. In contrast, FEC prefers to decompose through an SN1 pathway, which does not promote alkoxide regeneration. The ability of FEC as an additive to suppress alkoxide regeneration results in a smaller and thinner SEI layer that is more flexible towards lithium intercalation during the charging/discharging process. In addition, the presence of different oxygen functional groups at the surface of graphite dictates the oligomerization products and LiF formation in the SEI.", "date": "2020-10-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The structural modifications brought up by the elemental substitutions were investigated via Rietveld refinements against high\u2012resolution neutron diffraction data that allowed a precise characterization of the anionic framework and the lithium substructure. The analyses show that the anionic and cationic substitutions influence the polyhedral and unit cell volumes in different fashions and that the size of the polyanionic groups alone is not enough to describe lattice expansion in these materials. Moreover, we show that the lithium disorder that is crucial to achieve fast ionic mobility may be correlated to the lithium polyhedral volumes. The correlation of these structural modifications with the transport properties, investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and <sup>7</sup>Li nuclear magnetic resonance spin-lattice relaxation measurements, shows a non-monotonic behavior of the ionic conductivity and activation energy against the lithium polyhedral volumes, hinting to an optimal size of the conduction pathways for the ionic diffusion. Ultimately, the results obtained in this work will help to establish new guidelines for the optimization of solid electrolytes and to gain a more profound understanding of the influence of the substituents on the structure and transport properties of Li\u2012ion conductors", "date": "2020-10-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Yet, there are only few papers in literature reporting about such effects. Nevertheless, it is clear that the symmetry of the superlattice is decisive for the desired emergent phenomena. An interesting question is, how the symmetry of the initial monodisperse nanoparticles affects the structure of the colloidal crystal during self-assembly processes. For instance, particles with hexagonal cross-section show self-organization which is very similar to spherical colloids. Like-wise one would also expect that trigonal nanoparticles behave similar. Unfortunately, it is very hard to obtain monodisperse semiconductur colloids with trigonal shape, because this requires a symmetry break during morphogenesis of the nanocrystal. While such a symmetry-break is known in literature for structures attached to a solid substrate, it is shown here, colloidal synthesis of trigonal ZnO nanorods is successful, and the mechanism is elucidated by experimental and theoretical methods. 2D-superlattices formed by such particles with trigonal cross-section were compared to hexagonal analogues.

However, antibody chemical reactivity and covalent antigen binding are constrained, or even prevented, by the narrow range of chemistries encoded in the canonical amino acids. In this work, we investigate strategies for leveraging an expanded range of chemical functionality to augment antibody binding properties. Using yeast displayed antibodies, we explored the presentation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) in or near antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and evaluated the properties of the resulting constructs. To enable systematic characterization of ncAA incorporation sites, we first investigated whether diversification of a single antibody loop would support isolation of binding clones. We constructed a billion-member library containing canonical amino acid diversity and loop length diversity only within the 3rd complementarity determining region of the heavy chain (CDR-H3). Screens against a series of immunoglobulins from three species resulted in the isolation of antibodies exhibiting moderate affinities (double- to triple-digit nanomolar affinities) and, in several cases, single-species specificity. These findings confirmed that antibody specificity can be mediated by a single CDR. With this constrained diversity, we were able to utilize additional CDRs for the installation of chemically reactive and photo-crosslinkable ncAAs. Apparent binding affinities of ncAA-substituted synthetic antibodies on the yeast surface revealed that ncAA incorporation is generally well tolerated. However, changes in binding affinities did occur upon substitution, and varied based on factors including ncAA side chain identity, location of ncAA incorporation, and the ncAA incorporation machinery used. We further investigated chemical modifications facilitated by ncAA installation. Multiple azide-containing ncAAs supported both <a>copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition </a>(SPAAC) without abrogation of binding function following the installation of bulky probes. Similarly, several alkyne substitutions facilitated CuAAC without apparent disruption of binding function. Finally, antibodies substituted with a photo-crosslinkable ncAA were evaluated for ultraviolet-mediated crosslinking on the yeast surface. Competition-based assays revealed position-dependent linkages that could not be displaced by excess soluble antigen, strongly suggesting successful crosslinking. Key findings regarding CuAAC reactions and photo-crosslinking on the yeast surface were confirmed using soluble forms of ncAA-substituted clones. These consistent behaviors between the yeast surface and in solution suggest that chemical diversification can be incorporated into yeast display screening approaches. Taken together, our results highlight the power of integrating the use of yeast display and ncAAs in search of proteins with \u201cchemically augmented\u201d binding functions.

The ab initio description of such systems - starting from the electronic Schrodinger equation - represents one of the greatest challenges of modern quantum chemistry, requiring highly multiconfigurational treatments. We propose a theoretical framework of simple and physically motivated molecular-orbital transformations that enable the resolution and characterization of targeted electronic wave functions with ease. This paradigm allows us to unravel the complicated electronic correlations in PNTM clusters. We apply it to two super-oxidized iron-sulfur cubane [Fe4S4] structures, and accurately characterize their singlet ground and low-lying excited states. Through direct access to their wave functions, we identify the important correlation mechanisms and their interplay with the geometrical distortions observed in these clusters. Our results unambiguously reveal a hidden magnetic order in the manifold of singlet states. Namely, that in all low-energy singlet states of the two compounds, well-defined spin structures are formed within two pairs of magnetic sites. For instance, in the ground state of one compound two iron sites of local S = 5/2 spins are strongly ferromagnetically correlated to form two S = 5 intermediate pair states; two such pairs are then anti-ferromagnetically coupled to yield an overall singlet. In the five excited singlets, the spin of these hidden pair-states is reduced in steps to zero. We find that the ab initio results for these compounds can be mapped with high fidelity onto a four-site Heisenberg\u2013Dirac\u2013van Vleck Hamiltonian with two anti-ferromagnetic coupling constants. Thus, the complexes are intrinsically frustrated anti-ferromagnets, and the obtained spin structures, together with the geometrical distortions represent two possible ways to release spin frustration. The geometrical distortions may be seen as the result of a spin-driven Jahn-Teller distortion, that lifts the electronic ground state degeneracies. Our paradigm provides a simple yet rigorous wave function-based route to uncover the electronic structure of PNTM clusters, and may be applied to a wide variety of such clusters.</p>", "date": "2020-10-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recently, non-targeted tandem mass spectrometry approaches are gaining momentum for the analysis of global organic matter chemotypes including a wide array of natural and anthropogenic compounds. In line with these efforts, we developed a non-targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry workflow that utilizes advanced data analysis approaches such as feature-based molecular networking and repository-scale spectrum searches. This workflow allows the scalable comparison and mapping of seawater chemotypes from large-scale spatial surveys as well as molecular family level annotation of unknown compounds.

The observed seawater chemotype shifted significantly after a major rain event. Molecular drivers of this shift could be attributed to multiple anthropogenic compounds, including pesticides (Imazapyr and Isoxaben), cleaning products (Benzyl-tetradecyl-dimethylammonium) and chemical additives (Hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine) and potential degradation products. By expanding the search of identified xenobiotics to other public tandem mass spectrometry datasets, we further contextualized their possible origin and show their importance in other ecosystems.

Attempts to use the isotopic composition of methane to constrain its sources are complicated by incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of variation in methane's isotopic composition. Knowledge of the equilibrium isotope fractionations among the large organic intracellular intermediates in the microbial pathways of methane production and consumption must form the basis of any exploration of the mechanisms of isotopic variation, but estimates of these equilibrium isotope fractionations are currently unavailable. To address this gap, we calculated the equilibrium isotopic fractionation of carbon (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) and hydrogen (D/H) isotopes among compounds in anaerobic methane metabolisms, as well as the abundance of multiple isotope substitutions (\"clumping,\" e.g., <sup>13</sup>C--D) in these compounds.

The computed <sup>13</sup>beta and <sup>2</sup>beta values decrease with decreasing average oxidation state of the carbon atom in the molecules, resulting in a preference for enrichment of the molecules with more oxidized carbon in <sup>13</sup>C and D. Using the computed $\\beta$ values, we calculated the equilibrium isotope fractionation factors in the prominent methanogenesis pathways (hydrogenotrophic, methylotrophic and acetoclastic) and in the pathway for anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) over a temperature range of 0-700 degrees Celsius. Our calculated equilibrium fractionation factors compare favorably with experimental constrains, where available, and we used them to investigate the relation between the apparent isotope fractionation during methanogenesis and AOM and the thermodynamic drive for these reactions. We show that a detailed map of the equilibrium fractionation factors along these metabolic pathways allows an evaluation of the contribution of equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects to apparent isotope fractionations observed in laboratory, natural and artificial settings. The comprehensive set of equilibrium isotope fractionation factors calculated in this study provides a firm basis for future explorations of isotope effects in methane metabolism.", "date": "2020-10-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Geochemistry; Microbiology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Current understanding states that the partition between surface adsorbed and dissolved LiO2 governs whether Li2O2 grows as a conformal surface film or larger particles, leading to low or high capacities, respectively. However, governing factors for Li2O2 packing density and capacity need better understanding, requiring in situ metrologies with structural sensitivity from the atomic to sub-micron scale. Here, we establish in situ small and wide angle X-ray scattering as a suitable method to record the Li2O2 phase evolution with atomic to sub-micrometer resolution during cycling a custom-built in situ Li-O2 cell. Combined with sophisticated data analysis, SAXS allows retrieving rich quantitative structural information from complex multi-phase systems. Surprisingly, we find that features are absent that would point at a Li2O2 surface film formed via two consecutive electron transfers, even in poorly solvating electrolytes thought to be prototypical for surface growth. All scattering data can be modeled by stacks of thin Li2O2 platelets eventually forming large toroidal particles. Higher discharge overpotentials (high currents) lead to smaller Li2O2 particles, but there is no transition to an electronically passivating, conformal Li2O2 coating. This implies that mass transport of reactive species rather than electronic transport through a Li2O2 film limits the discharge capacity. Provided that species mobilities and carbon surface areas are high, this allows for high discharge capacities even in poorly solvating electrolytes. The currently accepted Li-O2 reaction mechanism ought to be reconsidered.<br />", "date": "2020-10-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we focus on the task of molecular optimization, where the goal is to optimize a given starting molecule towards desirable properties. This task can be framed as a machine translation problem in natural language processing, where in our case, a molecule is translated into a molecule with optimized properties based on the SMILES representation. Typically, chemists would use their intuition to suggest chemical transformations for the starting molecule being optimized. A widely used strategy is the concept of matched molecular pairs where two molecules differ by a single transformation. We seek to capture the chemist's intuition from matched molecular pairs using machine translation models. Specifically, the sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism, and the Transformer model are employed to generate molecules with desirable properties. As a proof of concept, three ADMET properties are optimized simultaneously: <i>logD</i>, <i>solubility</i>, and <i>clearance</i>, which are important properties of a drug. Since desirable properties often vary from project to project, the user-specified desirable property changes are incorporated into the input as an additional condition together with the starting molecules being optimized. Thus, the models can be guided to generate molecules satisfying the desirable properties. Additionally, we compare the two machine translation models based on the SMILES representation, with a graph-to-graph translation model HierG2G, which has shown the state-of-the-art performance in molecular optimization. Our results show that the Transformer can generate more molecules with desirable properties by making small modifications to the given starting molecules, which can be intuitive to chemists. A further enrichment of diverse molecules can be achieved by using an ensemble of models.", "date": "2020-10-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this report, we propose a separation of concerns for de novo drug design, categorizing the task into three main categories: generation, discrimination, and exploration. We demonstrate that changes to any of these three concerns impacts benchmark performance for drug design tasks. In this report we present Deriver, an open-source Python package that acts as a modular framework for molecule generation, with a focus on integrating multiple generative methods. Using Deriver, we demonstrate that changing parameters related to each of these three concerns impacts chemical space traversal significantly, and that the freedom to independently adjust each is critical to real-world applications having conflicting priorities. We find that combining multiple generative methods can improve optimization of molecular properties, and lower the chance of becoming trapped in local minima. Additionally, filtering molecules for drug-likeness (based on physicochemical properties and SMARTS pattern matching) before they are scored can hinder exploration, but can improve the quality of the final molecules. Finally, we demonstrate that any given task has an exploration algorithm best suited to it, though in practice linear probabilistic sampling generally results in the best outcomes, when compared to Monte Carlo sampling or greedy sampling.

Generally, it is understood that hydrophobic components are energetically favoured to adsorb within the hydrophobic interior of a biomimetic bilayer. However, how such NPs interact in the presence of heterogeneous aggregates in the bilayer has been the subject of much debate. To better understand the effects of the integration of nanoscale components on heterogeneous mixed bilayer, we have simulated a series of generic hydrophobic NPs interacting with a phase-separating two-component surfactant bilayer.

We examined the mechanical properties of NR/SBR vulcanizates including tensile strength, tear strength, elongation at break, modulus, Shore A hardnessand and relative volume abrasion. The results indicated that NR/SBR vulcanizates prepared in different systems differed in mechanical properties. Vulcanizates prepared via CV showed higher tensile and tear strength; vulcanizates prepared via EV had high modulus and hardness, and vulcanizates prepared via SEV performed high abrasion resistance. </div>", "date": "2020-10-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer blends", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

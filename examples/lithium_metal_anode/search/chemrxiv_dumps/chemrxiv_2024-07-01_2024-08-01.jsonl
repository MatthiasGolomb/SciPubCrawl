Classical PSs (type-II), however, primarily transfer excited energy to ground state O2 rather than undergoing photoinduced electron transfer, posing a tough challenge in promoting the type-I pathway through existing strategies. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and straightforward approach using bioinspired supramolecular assembly to convert classical type-II PSs into type-I supramolecular PSs with augmented ROS production. The phosphate-templated assembly facilitated the formation of nanoscale aggregates with orderly and efficient packing of PSs, effectively suppressing the energy transfer pathway by promoting photoinduced charge- separation between PSs (resulting in PS+\u00b7 and PS\u2212\u00b7), thereby enhancing the generation of superoxide radicals (O2\u2212\u00b7) through electron transfer from PS\u2212\u00b7 to O2 (Scheme 1). Additionally, this shift of photosensitization pathway also enhances overall ROS production, overcoming the typical inhibition usually associated with PS aggregation and indicating the highly efficient ROS generation via the type-I pathway. Consequently, the type-I supramolecular PSs demonstrated excellent ROS generation capability in the treatment of hypoxic tumors, thus achieving outstanding therapeutic outcomes. This study not only addresses a critical challenge in PDT under hypoxic conditions but also opens a new avenue for modifying the sensitization behavior of clinically approved type-II PSs to achieve superior therapeutic outcomes.", "date": "2024-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, a modified commercially available liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (LC-IRMS) interface is presented that enables automated measurement of \u03b415N signatures from nitrate by online reduction of nitrate in two consecutive steps. First, vanadium(III)-chloride is used as a reducing agent to convert NO3- to NxOy under acidic conditions. The mix of nitrogen oxides is then transferred into a stream of helium and reduced to nitrogen (N2) analysis gas via a hot copper reactor. Prior to the online conversion of aqueous nitrate into elemental nitrogen, the sample was chromatographically separated from potential matrix effects on a PGC column. Precision was achieved at a level below 1.4 \u2030 by injecting 10 \u00b5L of 50 mg L-1 N, using five different nitrate standards and reference materials. These materials spanned a range of more than 180 \u2030 in \u03b415N.

To assist in the rational design of macrocyclic drugs, there is need for computational methods that can accurately predict conformational ensembles of macrocycles in different environments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain one of the most accurate methods to predict ensembles quantitatively, although the accuracy is governed by the underlying force field. In this work, we benchmark four different force fields for their application to macrocycles by performing replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) simulations of eleven macrocyclic compounds and comparing the obtained conformational ensembles to nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) upper distance bounds from NMR experiments. Especially, the modern force fields OpenFF 2.0 and XFF yield good results, outperforming force fields like GAFF2 and OPLS/AA.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of FAIVE by obtaining modified DNA aptamers capable of disrupting the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and hACE2, targeting protein-protein interaction inhibition. Furthermore, we investigated the criteria for validating the quality of the bead library generated for selection by modeling the process of emulsion PCR, thus providing theoretical insights for future applications. The concept of incorporating fluorescent signal reporting of aptamer functionality into the aptamer selection process has the potential of facilitate the identification of aptamers with diverse functionalities, and is readily adaptable to various research contexts.", "date": "2024-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; High-throughput Screening; Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

These foams demonstrate utility for capturing-sensing gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), as well as for detecting and quantifying various metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+).

Here we present a proximity-based screening system for class A GPCRs, which adopts the natural two-step activation mech-anism of class B GPCRs. In this approach, class A/B chimeras with the extracellular domain of the class B receptor CRF1R, grafted to the transmembrane domain of target class A recep-tors are stimulated with hybrid ligands.

Additionally, it showed high mechanical strength and a low diffusion barrier. However, monolayer borophene suffers from stability issues in its free-standing form, which restricts its real-life applications. Inspired by the recent experimental investigations, which proved the higher stability of bilayer borophene polymorphs (BBPs) over their monolayer counterparts, in this work, we investigated the dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities of both AA and AB\u2013stacked BBPs in their \u03b212 phase using first-principles calculations.

Our investigations show that AB\u2013stacked \u03b212\u2013BBP exhibits good electrical conductivity before and after metal atom (Li/Na/K) adsorption onto it. Further, AB\u2013stacked \u03b212\u2013BBP adsorbs the metal atoms strongly with adsorption energies ranging between -0.89 to -1.44 eV, indicating that there is a lesser possibility of forming dendrites on this anode.

Electrosynthesis at a polarisable liquid|liquid interface using an aqueous oxidant and organic soluble monomer provides a route to free-standing and scalable CP thin films, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), in a single step at ambient conditions. Here, using the potentiodynamic technique of cyclic voltammetry, interfacial electrosynthesis involving ion-exchange, electron transfer, and proton adsorption charge transfer processes is shown to be mechanistically distinct from CP electropolymerisation at a solid electrode|electrolyte interface. The applied interfacial Galvani potential difference controls the interfacial concentration of the oxidant, EDOT monomers and oligomers, but not the CP redox state. Nevertheless, typical CP electropolymerisation electrochemical behaviours, such as steady charge accumulation with each successive cycle and the appearance of a nucleation loop, were observed. By combining (spectro)electrochemical measurements and theoretical models, this work identifies the underlying mechanistic origin of each feature on the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) due to charge accumulated from Faradaic and capacitive processes as the PEDOT thin film grows.

In this study, we investigated the predictive potential of indigo production as an indicator of promiscuous hydroxylation in non-native aromatic compounds. Following site- saturation mutagenesis on 42 residues in the active-site region, we rapidly identified 97 previously unreported variants at 18 unique positions, significantly increasing the database of indigo-positive variants. From this expanded pool, we isolated 80 well-expressed indigo-positive variants and evaluated them alongside 46 well-expressed indigo-negative variants for their hydroxylation activity on the representative non-native aromatic compounds, anisole and naphthalene. We observed a strong correlation between indigo formation and aromatic compound hydroxylation, with 73-80% of indigo-positive variants hydroxylating these compounds, compared to 40-45% of indigo-negative variants. Notably, only indigo-positive variants showed greater than 3-fold higher activity than the wild-type P450 BM3. Furthermore, a positive correlation was obtained between promiscuous hydroxylation of anisole and naphthalene. The approach also allowed identification of new variants that hydroxylate a further aromatic compound, 4-phenyl-2-butanone, suggesting generality.

A recent study (Gensler, W.  {\\it Plant Signal.

This hypothesis is tested by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, using ad-hoc models consisting of callose and cellulose chains forming networks (gels) in water, spanning a wide range of polysaccharide-water concentrations. The simulation results highlight systematic differences in the coordination and H-bonding of callose and cellulose by water. These structural differences are reflected in the different dynamical properties of water in samples made of callose or cellulose in water, to some extent validating the water-ordering hypothesis. However, mechanical properties, characterised by the computation of the Young's modulus of the polysaccharide / water gels, are nearly the same in the callose/water and in the cellulose/water samples, lending support to the view that callose's ability to link cellulose nanofibres into networks is the main mechanism underlying the strengthening of the plant cell wall.

In general, rSCAN provides a better match to experimentally observed excitation energies of spectral features compared to both PBE and PBE+U, especially at energies close to the main edge. Projected density of states of core-hole calculations show that the O orbitals are better described by rSCAN. Hybridisation, structural distortions, chemical composition, and magnetism significantly influence the spectra. The O K-edge spectrum of LiNiO2 obtained using rSCAN shows a closer match to the experimental XAS when derived from a simulation cell which includes a Jahn-Teller distortion, showing that the DFT-calculated pre-edge feature contains information about not only chemical species but also geometric distortion. Core loss spectra derived from DFT can also differentiate between materials with the same structure and magnetic configuration but comprising different TMs; these differences are comparable to those observed in experimental XAS from the same materials. This foundational work helps establish the extent to which DFT can be used to bridge the interpretation gap between experimental spectroscopic signatures and ab initio methods describing complex battery materials, such as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides.

A widely adopted computational approach frames synthesis prediction as a sequence-to-sequence translation task, using the common SMILES representation for molecules. Current evaluation of machine learning methods for retrosynthesis assume perfect training data, overlooking imperfections in reaction equations in popular datasets, such as missing reactants, products, other physical and practical constraints such as temperature and cost, primarily driven by a focus on the target molecule. This limitation leads to an incomplete representation of viable synthetic routes, especially when multiple sets of reactants can yield a given desired product.

Our novel metrics not only assess absolute accuracy by comparing predicted outputs with ground truth but also introduce a nuanced evaluation approach. We provide scores for partial correctness and compute adjusted accuracy through graph matching, acknowledging the inherent complexities of retrosynthetic pathways.

This study compares the evolution of transient cavitating flow over a NACA4412 base hydrofoil and over the same hydrofoil modified with a pimple and a finite (circular) trailing edge. The assessment covers sheet, cloud, and supercavitation regimes at an 8\u00b0 angle of attack and Reynolds number of 1\u00d7$10^6$, with cavitation numbers ranging from 0.9 to 0.2. The study aims to comprehensively understand the role of the rectangular pimple in controlling cavitation and its impact on hydrodynamic performance across these regimes. Numerical simulations were performed using a realizable  model and the Zwart Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) cavitation model to resolve turbulence and cavitation effects. The accuracy of the present numerical predictions has been verified both quantitatively and qualitatively with available experimental results. The present analysis includes the time evolution of cavities, temporal variation in total cavity volume, time-averaged total cavity volume, distributions of vapor volume fractions along the chord length, and their hydrodynamic performance parameters.

Lewis", "abstract": "Organohalogen compounds are extensively used as building blocks, intermediates, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals due to their unique chemical and biological properties. Installing halogen substituents, however, frequently requires functionalized starting materials and multistep functional group interconversion. Several classes of halogenases evolved in nature to enable halogenation of a different classes of substrates; for example, site-selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic compounds is catalyzed by flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs). Mechanistic studies have shown that these enzymes use FADH2 to reduce O2 to water with concomitant oxidation of X- to HOX (X = Cl, Br, I). This species travels through a tunnel within the enzyme to access the FDH active site. Here, it is believed to interact with an active site lysine proximal to bound substrate, enabling electrophilic halogenation with selectivity imparted via molecular recognition, rather than directing groups or strong electronic activation.\n\nThe unique selectivity of FDHs led to several early biocatalysis efforts, preparative halogenation was rare, and the hallmark catalyst-controlled selectivity of FDHs did not translate to non-native substrates. FDH engineering was limited to site-directed mutagenesis, which resulted in modest changes in site-selectivity or substrate preference. To address these limitations, we optimized expression conditions for the FDH RebH and its cognate flavin reductase (FRed), RebF. We then showed that RebH could be used for preparative halogenation of non-native substrates with catalyst-controlled selectivity. We reported the first examples in which the stability, substrate scope, and site selectivity of an FDH were improved to synthetically useful levels via directed evolution. X-ray crystal structures of evolved FDHs and reversion mutations showed that random mutations throughout the RebH structure were critical to achieving high levels of activity and selectivity on diverse aromatic substrates, and these data were used in combination with molecular dynamics simulations to develop predictive model for FDH selectivity. Finally, we used family-wide genome mining to identify a diverse set of FDHs with novel substrate scope and complementary regioselectivity on large, three-dimensionally complex compounds.\n\nThe diversity of our evolved and mined FDHs allowed us to pursue synthetic applications beyond simple aromatic halogenation. For example, we established that FDHs catalyze enantioselective reactions involving desymmetrization, atroposelective halogenation, and halocyclization. These results highlight the ability of FDH active sites to tolerate different substrate topologies. This utility was further expanded by our recent studies on the single component FDH/FRed, AetF. While we were initially drawn to AetF because it does not require a separate FRed, we found that it halogenates substrates that are not halogenated efficiently or at all by other FDHs and provides high enantioselectivity for reactions that could only be achieved using RebH variants after extensive mutagenesis. Perhaps most notably, AetF catalyzes site-selective aromatic iodination and enantioselective iodoetherification. Together, these studies highlight the origins of FDH engineering, the utility and limitations of the enzymes developed to date, and the promise of FDHs for an ever-expanding range of biocatalytic halogenation reactions.", "date": "2024-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Energy localization at and around the pore collapse site leads to high-temperature hotspots, initiating chemical reactions. Because chemical reaction rates depend sensitively on temperature, predictive continuum models need to get the pore-collapse dynamics and resulting hotspot temperatures right; this imposes stringent demands on the fidelity of thermophysical model forms and parameters, and on the numerical methods employed to perform high-resolution meso-scale calculations. Here, continuum material models for beta-HMX are examined in the context of nanoscale shock-induced pore collapse, treating predictions from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as ground truth. Using MD-consistent material properties, we show that the currently available strength models for HMX fail to correctly capture pore collapse and hotspot temperatures. Insights from MD are then employed to advance a Modified Johnson-Cook (M-JC) strength model form that captures aspects of shear strain and strain-rate dependency not represented by the standard JC form, but which are shown to be critical for accurately describing the nanoscale physics of shock-induced localization in HMX. The study culminates in a fully MD-determined strength model for beta-HMX that produces continuum pore-collapse results well aligned in all aspects with those predicted by MD, including pore-collapse mechanism and rate, shear-band formation in the collapse zone, and temperature, strain, and stress fields in the hotspot zone and surrounding material.

Copolymers, synthesized from multiple monomers, offer unique material properties compared to their homopolymers. Optimizing the synthesis of terpolymers is a complex and labor-intensive task due to variations in monomer reactivity and their compositional shifts throughout the polymerization process. The present work focuses on polymerization of styrene, myrcene, and dibutyl itaconate (DBI) with the goal of achieving a high glass transition temperature (T_g) in the resulting terpolymer. While the copolymerization of pairwise combinations of styrene, myrcene, and DBI have been previously investigated, the terpolymerization of all three at once remains unexplored. Terpolymers with monomers like styrene would provide high glass transition temperatures as the resultant polymers exhibit a rigid glassy state at ambient temperatures. Conversely, minimizing styrene incorporation also reduces reliance on petrochemical-derived monomer sources for terpolymer synthesis, thus enhancing the sustainability of terpolymer usage. To balance the objectives of maximizing T_g while minimizing styrene incorporation, we employ multi-objective Bayesian Optimization to efficiently sample in a design space comprising 5 experimental parameters. We perform two iterations of optimization for a total of 89 terpolymers, reporting terpolymers with a T_g above ambient temperature while retaining less than 50% styrene incorporation. This underscores the potential for exploring and utilizing renewable monomers such as myrcene and DBI, to foster sustainability in polymer synthesis. Additionally, the dataset enables the calculation of ternary reactivity ratios using a system of Ordinary Differential Equations based on the Terminal Model, providing valuable insights into the reactivity of monomers in complex ternary systems compared to binary copolymer systems.

Nevertheless, untargeted approaches are now becoming a promising tool for a broader investigation of the exposome, covering additional compounds, their biotransformation products and possible metabolic alterations (metabolomics). However, despite broad compound coverage, untargeted metabolomics still underperforms in ultra-trace biomonitoring analysis. To overcome these analytical limitations, we present the development of the first combined targeted/untargeted LC-MS method, merging MRM-HR and SWATH experiments in one analytical run, making use of the Zeno technology for improved sensitivity. MRM transitions were optimized for 135 highly diverse toxicants including mycotoxins, plasticizers, PFAS, personal care products ingredients and industrial side products as well as potentially beneficial xenobiotics such as phytohormones. As a proof of concept, standard reference materials of human plasma (SRM 1950) and serum (SRM 1958) were analyzed with both, Zeno MRM-HR + SWATH and SWATH-only methodologies. Results demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity represented by the detection of lower concentration levels in spiked SRM materials (mean value: 2.2 times and 3 times lower concentrations for SRMs 1950 and 1958, respectively). Overall, detection frequency was increased by 68% (19 to 32 positive detections) in MRM-HR+SWATH mode compared to the SWATH-only. This work presents a promising avenue for addressing the outstanding challenge in the small-molecule omics field: finding balance between high sensitivity and broad chemical coverage.

However, because of the complexity of chemical space, such models often have difficulty extrapolating beyond the chemistry contained in the training set. Augmented model with quantum mechanical (QM) descriptors is anticipated to improve its generalizability. However, obtaining QM descriptors often requires CPU-intensive computational chemistry calculations. To identify when QM descriptors help graph neural networks predict chemical properties, we conduct a systematic investigation of the impact of atom, bond, and molecular QM descriptors on the performance of directed message passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) for predicting 16 molecular properties. The analysis surveys computational and experimental targets, classification and regression tasks, and varied dataset sizes from several hundred to hundreds of thousands of datapoints. Our results indicate that QM descriptors are mostly beneficial for D-MPNN performance on small datasets, provided that the descriptors correlate well with the targets and can be readily computed with high accuracy. Otherwise, using QM descriptors can add cost without benefit or even introduce unwanted noise that can degrade model performance. Strategic integration of QM descriptors with D-MPNN unlocks potential for physics-informed, data-efficient modeling with some interpretability that can streamline de novo drug and material designs. To facilitate the use of QM descriptors in machine learning workflows for chemistry, we provide a set of guidelines regarding when and how to best leverage QM descriptors, a high-throughput workflow to compute them, and an enhancement to Chemprop, a widely adopted open-source D-MPNN implementation for chemical property prediction.", "date": "2024-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, it is not straightforward to apply the TDVP to surface hopping trajectories because there exists momentum jump during surface hops. To solve this problem, we here propose a multiconfigurational surface hopping (MCSH) method, where continuous momenta are obtained by linear interpolation and the interpolated trajectories are used to construct the basis functions for TDVP in a post-processing manner. As demonstrated in a series of representative spin-boson models, MCSH achieves high accuracy with only several hundred trajectory bases and can uniformly improve the performance of surface hopping.

For accurate results, hybrid functionals with a large amount of exact exchange are often needed and there is no clear \"one-for-all\" functional, which describes the hyperfine coupling interaction for a large set of nuclei. To alleviate this unfavorable situation, we apply the adiabatic connection random phase approximation (RPA) in its post-Kohn-Sham fashion to this property as a first test. For simplicity, only the Fermi-contact and spin--dipole terms are calculated within the non-relativistic and the scalar-relativistic exact two-component framework.

Under such circumstances, there is the development of an induced pressure-gradient-driven transport dictated (similar to diffusioosmotic transport) by the presence of an axial gradient in the concentration of the active particles. This pressure-driven transport has a profile different from the standard Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a nanocapillary. This induced pressure-driven flow drives electrokinetic effects, which are characterized by the generation of a streaming electric field, associated electroosmotic (EOS) transport opposing pressure-driven flow, and electroviscous effect. We quantify these effects as functions of dimensionless parameters that vary inversely as the strength of the activity-induced pressure-driven flow and salt concentrations. Overall, we anticipate that this paper will draw immense attention towards a new type of activity-induced pressure-driven flow and associated electrokinetic phenomena in charged nanoconfinements.

However, current GP-based DRT implementations can only handle one spectrum at a time. This work extends these models to allow concurrent analysis of multiple impedance spectra as a function of experimental conditions. The new method, called the quasi-Gaussian process distribution of relaxation times, treats the DRT as a GP with respect to the experimental state and as a finite approximation of a positively constrained GP with respect to timescales.

A direct acidic treatment of the resulting aza-BCOs efficiently cleaves the aminal moiety, leading to a series of medicinally intriguing cis-cyclobutyl diamines.

Here, we develop a computational technique to predict when achiral cages form chiral cavities in the solid-state through the combination of atomistic calculations and coarse-grained modelling to predict the crystalline phase behaviour. Our focus is on the achiral cage B11, which contains rotatable arene rings on the vertices of the cage that can form propeller-like orientations, inducing a chiral cavity. We show that by using dimer pair calculations, we can inform coarse-grained models to predict the packing of the cage.

However, challenges persist due to the sluggish kinetics of polysulfides conversion and migration. Our study, employing operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and operando Raman spectroscopy, reveals that the 16-electron transfer reaction from S8 to Li2S during the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) remains incomplete, contrary to the prevailing understanding. To address this issue, we introduce a novel bifunctional electrolyte additive, bis(4-nitrophenyl) carbonate (BNC), aimed at enhancing discharge kinetics, particularly for short-chain polysulfides conversion, while simultaneously immobilizing soluble polysulfides. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirm that BNC modifies the lithium-ion solvation structure, leading to stronger interactions with Sx2-. The BNC-containing electrolyte exhibits an average reduction of 40.6% in activation energy associated with polysulfide formation compared to the baseline. Additionally, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping corroborated that the addition of BNC reduced sulfur deposition on the anode, thus mitigating the polysulfide shuttling effect. Moreover, via X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis, the cathode with the baseline electrolyte demonstrated a pre-edge peak at 2471.5 eV, indicative of sluggish SRR kinetics. Furthermore, this study explores the optimal concentration of BNC, recognizing that excessive concentrations may exacerbate sulfur depletion and accelerate capacity decay. The 0.01 M BNC-containing electrolyte enhances kinetics and suppresses polysulfide shuttling, standing favorable against literature results with an areal sulfur loading of 4 mg/cm2.

Despite extensive studies on isolated lichen pigments, the potential role of exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the photoprotective system of lichens has remained unclear.

Solid phase studies demonstrate that the pigment\u2019s photostability is greatly enhanced in the pullulan polysaccharide matrix. Analysis of ultrafast transient absorption infrared spectroscopy indicates potential interactions of the polysaccharide inhibiting the relaxation pathway of vulpinic acid upon UV photoexcitation.

This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of AlbC, a CDPS that produces cyclo(L-Phe-L-Phe). We employed small-model quantum mechanics (QM) calculations to propose an intrinsic pathway and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify key catalytic residues involved in this process. The mechanism involves three main steps: activation of Ser37 and the first tRNAPhe to form a Phe-enzyme intermediate, binding of the second tRNAPhe to form a dipeptidyl enzyme intermediate, and intramolecular cyclization to yield the cyclodipeptide. Our QM calculations suggest that Ser37 can be activated through direct transfer of its hydroxyl proton to the O3\u2019 atom of the first substrate. MD simulations highlight the roles of Gly35, Asn40, and His203 in stabilizing the Phe-enzyme intermediate, thus lowering the calculated intrinsic barrier. In the second step, the dipeptidyl enzyme intermediate is favored over the nucleoside intermediate and is stabilized by Asn40, Gln182, and His203 in the AlbC active site, where Gln182 may act as a catalytic base. Additionally, Asn159 and His203 contribute to lowering the significant energy barrier observed in QM calculations for intramolecular cyclization, with Glu182 potentially serving as a catalytic base during this process. Overall, our results support the roles of Asn40 and His203 throughout all mechanistic steps, while highlighting Glu182's involvement in the formation of the dipeptidyl enzyme intermediate and intramolecular cyclization steps.

FTIR spectra showed three bands located around 548.18 cm-1, 973. cm-1, and 1577.01 cm-1 attributed to the stretching vibrations of Bi-O, Fe-O, Mg-O, and O-H, respectively. The SEM images revealed a highly porous and irregular structure beneficial for the effective diffusion of dye molecules. The sample contains a notable proportion of holes with different sizes of pores. The microcavities observed on the adsorbent surface were conducive to good diffusion of the dye molecules. The composite's mesoporous structure was deduced by BET analysis, which allowed us to determine the material's specific surface area of 20.289 m2/g and its pore diameter of 7.54 nm.

Herein, we profiled the nonenzymatic partitioning of randomized RNA overhangs into ligated products via two competing prebiotic pathways: loop-closing ligation and splint-directed ligation, using deep sequencing. Comprehensive sequence-reactivity profiles demonstrate that loop-closing ligation preferentially yields hairpin structures with loop sequences UNNG, CNNG, and GNNA (N represents A, C, G, or U). These loop sequences significantly overlap with the most common biological tetraloops. Conversely, splinted ligation products favor CG-rich overhangs. Leveraging these sequence rules, we successfully achieved high-efficiency template-free assembly of functional ribozymes from short RNAs. Our results support the notion that a one-step, prebiotic chemical process could have selectively created elementary RNA structures that are common in biology.

These PI-COFs feature layers with pore channels embedded with 18 carbonyl groups, facilitating rapid lithium-ion diffusion and enhancing structural stability under high current densities.

They have been extensively studied and utilized as reaction intermediates, organic salts, and dyes. Among them, cationic arenes are of particular interest because they can act as charge carrier intermediates in p-type organic semiconductors. Although heteroatom-containing cationic arenes have been reported, those without heteroatoms, namely cationic aromatic hydrocarbons, are still rare and relatively unexplored due to their instability in air. Nanobelts are cyclic arenes that only consist of annulated structures. Recently, various types of nanobelts have been synthesized, and several unique properties of nanobelts have been unveiled. However, cationic nanobelts without heteroatoms have never been synthesized, and their properties are of significant interest from both fundamental and application perspectives. Herein, we report the first synthesis of cationic hydrocarbon nanobelts (radical cation and dication) obtained via the chemical oxidation of methylene-bridged [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]MCPP). These cationic species turned out to be remarkably stable in air, which made it possible to measure and uncover their structural and electronic properties. Notably, the [6]MCPP dicationic salt has sharp absorption and fluorescence bands at much longer wavelengths than those of neutral [6]MCPP, close to the near-infrared region. From both experimental and theoretical investigation, the existence of a strong diatropic belt current in [6]MCPP dication has been indicated. In addition, a longer lifetime was observed for the hexamethyl[6]MCPP dicationic salt than for the [6]MCPP dicationic salt in solution. These findings regarding cationic hydrocarbon nanobelts contribute to a novel molecular design for stable cationic aromatic hydrocarbons.

In this work, thermodynamic quantities for metal\u2013water interface formation are computed for a range of FCC(111) surfaces (Pd, Pt, Au, Ag, Rh, and PdAu) through extensive density functional theory based molecular dynamics and the two-phase entropy model. We show that metal\u2013water interface formation is thermodynamically favorable and that most metal surfaces studied in this work are completely wettable, i.e., have contact angles of zero. Interfacial water has higher entropy than bulk water due to the increased population of low-frequency translational modes. The entropic contributions also correlate with the orientational water density and the highest solvation entropies are observed for interfaces with a moderately ordered first water layer; the entropic contributions account for up to ca. 25 % of the formation free energy. Water adsorption energy correlates with the water orientation and structure, and is found to be a good descriptor of the internal energy part of the interface formation free energy but it alone cannot satisfactorily explain the interfacial thermodynamics; the interface formation is driven by the competition between energetic and entropic contributions.

The probes contain a fluorescent base surrogate, such as quinoline blue (QB) or thiazole orange (TO), which is weakly fluorescent in the single-stranded state. In this state, the QB/TO nucleotides quench the fluorescence of auxiliary dyes. Upon target recognition, QB/TO stack with adjacent base pairs, resulting in enhanced fluorescence quantum yields.

The previously introduced pair-selected multi-level extension to domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and semi-canonical perturbative triples [DLPNO-CCSD(T0)] partitions the orbital pairs according to relative changes in pair correlation energies [J. Chem. Phys. 157, 064102 (2022)]. To this end, maps between localized orbitals are required which in turn require maps between the atoms of structures along reaction paths. So far, these atom maps have been manually determined, which can be a (human) time-consuming procedure. In order to automatize this procedure, we present an atom mapping algorithm based on the principle of minimum chemical distance that incorporates the orientation through dihedral angles. Within the methodology of this algorithm, linear assignment problems are addressed and explicitly solved, giving rise to the idea of considering the orbital mapping problem as such. This led to a new strategy to obtain orbital maps that proves advantageous over the previously used direct orbital selection. Along with a modified orbital pair prescreening, this results in an improved variant of the pair-selected multi-level DLPNO-CCSD(T0) method. For given combinations of pair selection thresholds, the performance of this approach is demonstrated for various reaction types showing a significant efficiency gain and accurate results due to beneficial, systematic error cancellation. The presented method operates in a black-box manner due to its fully-automatized algorithms with only the need to specify a single target-accuracy parameter. Core orbitals can be included in the correlation treatment in a computationally cheap way such that there is no need for the frozen-core approximation. Additionally, we demonstrate that basis set extrapolation techniques can be applied. In this context, the approach shows deficiencies for the use of large basis sets, especially with diffuse basis functions, which can be traced back to the semi-canonical triples correction.", "date": "2024-07-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Their active site is composed of a copper ion that is coordinated by the so-called histidine brace, consisting of two histidine residues that coordinate the metal ion in a T-shaped arrangement. The unique structure of this motif and its suggested ability to generate and stabilize highly oxidizing intermediates has sparked considerable interest, leading to various hypotheses on its role for LPMOs and LPMO-inspired biomimetic complexes. To gain detailed insights into the electronic and geometric structure of the histidine brace and test its chemical variability, we have used advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques, in combination with isotopic labelling (15N, 2H) of the AA10 LPMO SmAA10A over a wide pH range (pH 4.0 - pH 12.5), in which the monocopper site remains intact and the protein does not exhibit permanent damage. Between pH 4 and 11.5, Electron Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy identifies and discriminates between coordinating waters and hydroxo ions (pKa1 = 9.65) at an open-site of the histidine brace. Above pH 11.5, deprotonation of the two remote nitrogen nuclei of the coordinating imidazole moieties and of the coordinating N-terminal amine function was observed via ENDOR, Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) and Hyperfine Sublevel Correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopies.  This is associated with major electronic changes in the histidine brace, including increased \u03c3-donor capabilities of the imidazolates and an overall reduced interaction of the deprotonated amine function with the copper center.

In this work, we investigated the HOR/HER kinetics on a polycrystalline platinum electrode in alkaline electrolyte using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique. Unlike typically done, we rigorously performed data treatment and analysis on a fixed potential scale with a fixed reference potential, which has implications for the use and assessment of RDE mass-transport corrections and the definition of reaction orders. Analyzing the kinetic current curves on a fixed potential scale, we find reaction orders with respect to the hydrogen partial pressure of essentially one and zero for the HOR and HER, respectively, at larger overpotentials. In contrast, fitting the kinetic current curves in a potential range around equilibrium with a generalized Butler-Volmer model yields differing kinetic parameters and fractional reaction orders. Our findings can be explained with a potential-dependent transition in the HOR mechanism from Tafel-Volmer with a rate-determining Volmer step at small overpotentials to Heyrovsky-Volmer with a rate-determining Heyrovsky step at more positive overpotentials, with a concomitant change in the H2 reaction order from fractional to unity, thus reconciling previous propositions in the debate on the alkaline HOR/HER mechanism. Our results demonstrate the strength and advantages of using a fixed potential scale rather than the commonly employed overpotential, and we expect this approach to be beneficial also for kinetic studies of other electrocatalytic reactions.", "date": "2024-07-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Chemical Kinetics; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Surface-enhance Raman scattering (SERS) is an emerging technique used for nanoplastic detection. However, the identification and classification of nanoplastics using SERS have challenges regarding sensitivity and accuracy, as nanoplastics are sparsely dispersed in the environment. Metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) have the potential to rapidly concentrate and separate various types and sizes of nanoplastics. SERS combined with machine learning may improve prediction accuracy. Herein, for the first time, we report the integration or MPNs-mediated separation with machine learning-aided SERS methods for the accurate classification and high-precision quantification of nanoplastics which is tailored to include the complete region of characteristic peaks across diverse nanoplastics in contrast to the traditional manual analysis of SERS spectra on a singular characteristic peak.

Engine studies have shown that lactones can reduce soot emissions as well as net carbon dioxide emissions. In this study quantitative sooting tendencies were measured for 10 lactones with a wide range of molecular structures. They included compounds with ring sizes varying from three to six carbons, unsubstituted compounds, substituted compounds with side chain lengths ranging from one to seven carbons, and one compound with a double bond in the ring. Two alkenoic acids were also tested since they are possible isomerization products of lactones. The sooting tendencies were characterized by yield sooting index (YSI), which is based on the soot yield when a methane/air nonpremixed flame is doped with 1000 \u03bcmol/mol of the test fuel. The results show that the lactones have lower sooting tendencies than conventional gasoline, diesel fuel, and Jet A aviation fuel, even when accounting for their lower heats of combustion. However, the sooting tendencies depend strongly on molecular structure, so the right lactones must be chosen to maximize the emissions benefits. The measured sooting tendencies are generally larger than those predicted with a group contribution method, which indicates that the lactones have high sooting tendencies given the set of atoms they contain. To explain this observation, reactive molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations were performed. The results show that the lactones tend to decompose directly to CO2, so the oxygen atoms are being used inefficiently to sequester only one carbon atom.", "date": "2024-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

When isotopically substituted precursors are not available commercially or synthetically, inverse stable isotopic labeling (InverSIL) is a useful alternative. With InverSIL, an organism is grown on an isotopically substituted medium and then fed precursors of natural isotopic abundance which can be tracked by mass spectrometry, thereby bypassing issues with precursor availability. Currently, there is no automated way to identify precursor incorporation in untargeted metabolomic data using InverSIL without specifying an expected change in the mass-to-charge ratio of metabolites that have incorporated the precursor. This makes it difficult to identify unknown natural products that may incorporate portions of precursors of interest using new biochemistry, or to rapidly identify incorporation of multiple precursors into different metabolites simultaneously. To address this, we developed a new, robust workflow for the automated identification of inverse stable isotopic labeling in untargeted metabolomic data. We then use this method to identify metabolites that incorporate para-aminobenzoic acid and different portions of L-methionine, including in the same sample, and in the process discover the likely biosynthetic origin for the C-7 and C-9 methyl groups of the pterin portion of dephosphotetrahydromethanopterin; a C1 transfer coenzyme produced by methylotrophic bacteria.

Many decades of synthetic methodology development have democratized access to flat, high sp2 (for example biaryl linkages) which has led to the commercialization of innumerable medicines. Those approaches rely heavily on electrophilic aromatic substitution (such as halogenation) followed by Pd-based cross coupling.

Targeted acylation of lysine residues has thus emerged as a strategic approach to exert biomimetic control over protein function. However, existing strategies for targeted lysine acylation in cells often rely on genetic intervention, recruitment of endogenous acylation machinery, or nonspecific acylating agents, and lack methods to quantify the magnitude of specific acylations on a global level. Here, we develop activity-based acylome profiling (ABAP), a chemoproteomic strategy that exploits elaborate N-(cyanomethyl)-N-(phenylsulfonyl)amides and lysine-centric probes for site-specific induction and proteome-wide mapping of posttranslational lysine acylations in cells. Harnessing this framework, we quantify various artificial acylations and rediscover numerous endogenous lysine acylations. We validate site-specific acetylation of target lysines and establish structure-activity relationship for N-(cyanomethyl)-N-(phenylsulfonyl)amides in proteins from diverse structural and functional classes. We identify a paralog-selective chemical probe that acetylates a conserved lysine within an interferon-stimulated antiviral RNA-binding protein, generating a de novo proteoform with obstructed RNA interactions. We further demonstrate that targeted acetylation of a key enzyme in retinoid metabolism engenders a proteoform with a conformational change in protein structure, leading to a gain-of-function phenotype and reduced drug potency. These findings underscore the versatility of our strategy to induce and quantify biologically relevant posttranslational lysine acylations on a global scale, without relying on genetic intervention, endogenous acylation machinery, cellular acyl pools, or being limited to proteins with preexisting ligands.

By means of global minima search and mechanistic studies at the density functional theory (DFT) level, a screening of size, composition and support material has been carried out to obtain the optimal catalyst compositions that will boost the catalytic performance. Alloying and support effects work in two directions. On the one hand, the support increases the stability and modifies the electronic structure of the cluster via metal-support interaction. On the other hand, the cluster can change the electronic properties and catalytic activity of the support, which can be modulated with its size and composition. In addition, the 2D support assists pure Pt clusters in reducing the propensity to undergo CO poisoning, which can be further reduced by Ge alloying. This effect can be exploited to the point that the interaction with CO is not even favorable, as in Pt5Ge5/germanene, thus completely inhibiting the CO poisoning on the catalyst. Regarding the catalytic activities, all the catalysts studied in this work yield too high overpotentials for the ORR in acidic conditions, due to the presence of too oxophilic active sites which results in the overbinding of oxygenated species. However, the combination of Ge alloying and 2D support yield remarkable results in the HOR performance.

Polymer electrolytes are solid materials that can conduct ions and are safer than liquid electrolytes. However, they have lower ionic conductivity, which means they cannot transport ions as fast or as far. This limits their performance in batteries. Developing high ionic conductivity polymer electrolytes will result in high energy density and high-power density energy storage devices with rapid charging ability. Furthermore, polymer electrolytes need to have high mechanical stability to make safer solid-state batteries. However, developing new polymer electrolytes using multiple experiments is a tedious process. As such, machine learning can help in identifying the important parameters responsible for the discovery of high ionic conductivity polymer electrolytes. As part of this project, we study different copolymer electrolytes in context to their ionic conductivities and build a framework to identify the parameters governing the ionic conductivity of these electrolytes. We use different machine learning models including random forest, XGboost, KNN, linear regression, and chemprop model to predict the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes based on their chemical composition. The chemprop model uses a message-passing neural network, which is a type of deep learning that can learn from graph data, such as molecular structures. The model was trained on data from experimental publications, particularly, from Bradford et al. [1] that measured the ionic conductivity of different polymer electrolytes. The results showed that XG boost outperformed other models in predicting the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes. The significance of discovering new polymer electrolytes lies in addressing the current limitations of ionic conductivity. By identifying materials that exhibit improved conductivity, this work contributes to the development of high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Enhanced ionic conductivity translates to batteries with faster and more efficient ion transport, leading to improved battery performance and durability.

To control and direct peptide aggrega-tion, a complete characterization of all species present and an understanding of the molecular processes along the aggregation pathway are essential. However, this is extremely challenging due to the transient nature of oligomers and the complexity of the reaction networks.

A key enzyme in these processes, acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), is a promising target for treating conditions involving ferroptosis and certain cancers. Rosiglitazone (ROSI) is a known ACSL4 inhibitor but its potent activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), a nuclear receptor strongly involved in lipid metabolism constitutes an important limitation. This study focuses on developing novel ACSL4 inhibitors derived from ROSI, which lack PPAR\u03b3 activity. Binding of the most potent compound of this series (9) relies on the prior binding of ATP. Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDx-MS) demonstrated that ATP binding stabilizes the ACSL4 C-terminus, an effect enhanced by compound 9, which also alters important peptide sequences, including the fatty acid gate-domain. Photoaffinity Labeling (PAL) with a diazirine-based probe identified residue A329 in the fatty acid pocket. Molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis highlighted Q302 as critical for compound 9 binding. Thus, compound 9 (LIBX-A401) is a promising tool for studying ACSL4 in ferroptosis-related diseases and cancer, and the elucidation of its binding mode paves the way to the rational design of optimized inhibitors", "date": "2024-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this mode, halving the pixel size quadruples the analytical time, which presents a practical limit on high spatial resolution MSI throughput. Fast mass microscopy (FMM) is, in contrast, a microscope-mode MSI technique which decouples spatial resolution and imaging speed. FMM circumvents the linear-quadratic relationship of pixel size and analytical time which enables increased the imaging size area and the analytical speed achievable.

Computational screening can accelerate the discovery of more conductive materials, provided that ionic conductivity can be estimated with sufficient accuracy and efficiency. The present study examines whether vibrational properties can be used to predict energetic barriers for cation migration in 24 prototypical multivalent solid electrolytes. Phonon band centers (i.e. mean frequencies), which have been previously used to predict Li-ion conductivity, are calculated using density functional theory. Band centers alone are found not to correlate with migration barriers (R^2 = 0.02), perhaps due to poor alignment of low-frequency phonon eigenmodes with ion migration pathways in some materials. A new metric that incorporates both frequencies and alignments\u2014the mean alignment-weighted frequency\u2014is more strongly correlated with migration barriers (R^2 = 0.25). Materials in this study with the lowest migration barriers consistently exhibit the lowest mean alignment-weighted frequencies, suggesting the utility of this metric for filtering out materials with high barriers in screening efforts. Comparisons to previous studies suggest that phonon band centers may be correlated with migration barriers only in compositionally similar materials, and that adding alignment information may enable more reliable predictions among more diverse sets of materials. These results quantify the promise of using phonon frequencies and alignments, perhaps in combination with other properties, to efficiently screen for materials with high multivalent ionic conductivity.", "date": "2024-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In light of this knowledge gap, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling and experimental validation to  systematically characterize how ligand chemistry in seven (R-NH3)2PbI4 systems impacts halide diffusion, particularly in the out-of-plane direction. We find that increasing stiffness and length of ligands generally inhibits ion transport, while increasing ligand polarization generally enhances it. Structural and energetic analyses of the migration pathways provide quantitative explanations for these trends, which reflect aspects of the disorder of the organic layer. Overall, this mechanistic analysis greatly enhances the current understanding of  halide migration in 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and yields insights that can inform the design of future passivation materials.", "date": "2024-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Non-covalent interactions are sensitive to tails of the electron density and involve nonlocal dispersion that is discarded or approximated if the screening of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) is too aggressive. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the DLPNO approximation is known to  deteriorate as molecular size increases. Here, we test the DLPNO approximation at the level of second-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and coupled-cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)], for a variety of large supramolecular complexes.   DLPNO-MP2  interaction energies are within 3% of canonical values for small dimers with $\\lesssim 10$ heavy atoms, but for larger systems the DLPNO approximation is often quite poor unless the results are extrapolated to the canonical limit, where the  threshold for discarding PNOs is taken to zero.  Counterpoise correction proves to be essential in reducing errors with  respect to canonical results. For a sequence of nanoscale graphene dimers up to (C96H24)2,  extrapolated DLPNO-MP2 interaction energies agree with canonical values to within 1%,  independent of system size, provided that the basis set does not contain diffuse functions, as these cause the  DLPNO approximation to behave erratically, such that results cannot be extrapolated in a meaningful way. DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations are typically performed using looser PNO thresholds as compared to DLPNO-MP2, but this  significantly impacts the accuracy for large supramolecular complexes.  Standard DLPNO-CCSD(T) settings afford errors of 2-6 kcal/mol for dimers involving coronene (C24H12) and circumcoronene (C54H18), even at the DLPNO-CCSD(T1) level.

However, the lipophilic cyclohexyl group facilitates precipitation of crystalline microsheets with submicron thicknesses from an aqueous solution containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1-dodecanol.  These microsheets have horizontal dimensions on the order of 200 m and are composed of a metastable crystal polymorph that permits the EZ isomerization to proceed.  EZ photoisomerization using visible light caused these microsheets to rapidly roll up into multilayer micro-cylinders with diameters ranging from 20-40 m.

Continued exposure to visible light uncurled these cylindrical structures, reversing the mechanical process but not the photochemical reaction.  The unrolled microsheets retained their crystallinity and could bend and twist under alternating UV and visible light, behaving as a photoreversible crystal but without additional rolling up.  The initial high curvature rolling up can be attributed to the creation of a surface layer of Z-isomer, while prolonged irradiation distributes this photoproduct more uniformly throughout the crystal and relieves the interfacial stress.

The deprotonated malononitrile carbanion, [CH(CN)2]\u2212, has shown close to equimolar capacity for reactive CO2 capture. Although formation of the [C(CN)2COOH]\u2212 carboxylic acid was found to be the final product, how the hydrogen atom on the [CH(CN)2]\u2212 carbanion transfers to the carboxylate group as a proton is unclear. In this work, we employ density-functional-theory calculations with an implicit solvation model to investigate the proton transfer mechanisms in forming carboxylic acid from the reaction of the [CH(CN)2]\u2212 carbanion with CO2. We find that the intramolecular proton-transfer pathway in [CH(CN)2COO]\u2212 to form [C(CN)2COOH]\u2212 is unlikely due to the high energy barrier of 152 kJ/mol. Instead, the intermolecular proton transfer pathway between two [CH(CN)2COO]\u2212 anions is more feasible to form two molecules of [C(CN)2COOH]\u2212, with a significantly lower activation energy of 50 kJ/mol. Moreover, the [C(CN)2COOH]\u2212 dimer is further stabilized by the intermolecular hydrogen bonds of the two -COOH groups in the Z-configuration of the \u03c0-conjugated planar geometry.

Among these, formamidinium-lead-iodide (FAPbI3) is a promising photoabsorber owing to its narrow bandgap and is mainly used in n\u2013i\u2013p-structured PSCs. The property modulation of FAPbI3 photoabsorbers while retaining their narrow bandgap is imperative for further development of PSCs. Molecular tetrafluoroborate anion (BF4\u2212)-based materials can be used as additives in perovskite layers to prevent bandgap widening, while facilitating perovskite crystal growth; thus, they are suitable for FAPbI3 photoabsorbers in principle. However, BF4\u2212-based additives for narrow-bandgap FAPbI3 photoabsorbers have not been developed. This is presumably because of the higher temperatures required for FAPbI3 formation than that for other wide-bandgap perovskites, which likely changes the effects of BF4-based additives from those for wide-bandgap perovskites. In this study, we verified the applicability of methylammonium tetrafluoroborate (MABF4) as an additive in narrow-bandgap FAPbI3 photoabsorbers for improving their PV performance primarily via the spontaneous modulation of the heterointerfaces between FAPbI3 and carrier-transport materials, rather than through crystal growth facilitation. At the interface of the hole-transport material and FAPbI3, MABF4 addition effectively eliminates the surface defects in all FAPbI3 components, even in the absence of BF4\u2212 anions over the heated FAPbI3 surface, suggesting a defect-suppression mechanism, which differs from that observed in conventional ones. Moreover, at the interface of FAPbI3 and the TiO2 electron-transport material, the BF4\u2212-derived species, which likely includes decomposed BF4\u2212 anions owing to the high-temperature heating, spontaneously segregates upon deposition, thereby modulating the heterointerface. Furthermore, in addition to the carrier mobility ratio in FAPbI3 (e\u2212:h+ \u2248 7:3), time-resolved microwave conductivity measurement revealed that BF4 addition eliminates carrier traps at the heterointerfaces.

Conventional analyses based on the Sabatier principle, using binding energies or effective electronic structure properties such as the d-band center as descriptors, are able to grasp overall trends in catalytic activity in specific groups of catalysts. However, thermodynamic approaches often fail to account for a plethora of electrolyte effects that arise in the EDL, including pH, cation, and anion effects. These effects have been observed to exert strong impacts on electrocatalytic reactions. There is growing consensus that the local reaction environment (LRE) prevailing in the EDL is the key to deciphering these complex and hitherto perplexing electrolyte effects. Increasing attention is thus paid to designing appropriate electrolytes, positioning the LRE at center stage. To this end, unraveling the LRE is becoming essential for designing electrocatalysts with specifically tailored properties, which could enable much needed breakthroughs in electrochemical energy science.\nTheory and modeling are getting more and more important and powerful in addressing this multifaceted problem that involves physical phenomena at different scales and interacting in a multidimensional parametric space. Theoretical models developed for this purpose should treat intrinsic multistep kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions, EDL effects from sub-nm scale to the scale of 10 nm, and mass transport phenomena bridging scales from < 0.1 to 100 \u03bcm. Given the diverse physical phenomena and scales involved, it is evident that the challenge at hand surpasses the capabilities of any single theoretical or computational approach.\nIn this Account, we present a hierarchical theoretical framework to address the above challenge. It seamlessly integrates several modules: (i) microkinetic modelling that accounts for various reaction pathways; (ii) an LRE model that describes the interfacial region extending from the nanometric EDL continuously to the solution bulk; (iii) first-principles calculations that provide parameters, e.g., adsorption energies, activation barriers and EDL parameters. The microkinetic model considers all elementary steps without designating an a priori rate-determining step. The kinetics of these elementary steps are expressed in terms of local concentrations, potential and electric field that are co-determined by EDL charging and mass transport in the LRE model. Vital insights on electrode kinetic phenomena, i.e., potential-dependent Tafel slopes, cation effects, and pH effects, obtained from this hierarchical framework are then reviewed. Finally, an outlook on further improvement of the model framework is presented, in view of recent developments in first-principles based simulation of electrocatalysis, observations of dynamic reconstruction of catalysts, and machine-learning assisted computational simulations.\n", "date": "2024-07-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Interfaces; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The phase memory time, Tm, obtained by the Hahn echo sequence at X-band is compared to the one previously determined at higher frequency/magnetic field (240 GHz). The combined information from these experiments allows to gain insight into the contributions to decoherence originating from various relaxation mechanisms such as spin-lattice relaxation, electron and nuclear spin diffusion and instantaneous diffusion. We show that while at high magnetic fields Tm is limited by spin-lattice relaxation seemingly attributed to a direct process, at lower fields the limiting factor is spectral diffusion. At X-band, for Gd@Y(trensal) we determine a Tm in the range 1 \u2013 11 \u03bcs, at 5 K, depending on the magnetic field and concentration of Gd(trensal) in the isostructural diamagnetic host Y(trensal).

Focusing on methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation to toluene, an industrially relevant hydrogen carrier, we introduce a machine learning approach to accelerate the design of selective and cost-effective catalysts. Using inputs to a gaussian process regression model that are inspired by physical theories of chemisorption, we predict the adsorption energies of large hydrocarbon intermediates that are encountered during methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation.

Modifying Pt nanoclusters with IB, IIB, and post-transition elements like Cu and Sn increases dehydrogenation rates, reduces unselective reactions, and lowers Pt utilization, consistent with prior experiments.

They avoid the need to convert molecules into molecular fingerprints with a fixed vector length. However, like most deep learning models, GNNs are not interpretable and common explainability methods fail because of the variable input size. We introduce a novel method to interpret the predictions of GNNs based on Myerson values from cooperative game theory. Myerson values are closely related to Shapley values , which have been adapted to explain a wide variety of machine learning model predictions. Applying these approaches to GNNs have, however, proven to be challenging because of their varying graph size. Our approach treats a GNN as a coalition game and the nodes of an input layer graph as players. The Myerson value of a node then determines the contribution to the prediction of the model, with only connected nodes contributing to coalitions. All Myerson values add up to the predicted value of the model allowing for a simple and intuitive interpretation of the prediction. Because calculating Myerson values becomes computationally infeasible for large graphs, we have also implemented a scalable approximation technique using Monte Carlo sampling. We developed the technique for applications in cheminformatics and drug discovery, but it can also be used in any application that uses GNNs. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through successful applications to two proof-of-concept datasets (logP and molecular weight) as well as a real-world dataset featuring kinase inhibitors, highlighting its broad applicability and promise in explaining graph-based cheminformatic models.", "date": "2024-07-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Leveraging the enantioselectivity data that we obtained, a complex mechanistic scenario different from those originally proposed is uncovered. Specifically, an unexpected dependence of the product enantiomeric ratio on both the halide identity (aryl chloride vs. bromide substrates) and the Ni source was observed. Stoichiometric experiments and time course analyses of the evolution of product enantioselectivity with time revealed a different initial behavior for reactions carried out with Ni(II) and Ni(0) pre-catalysts that later converge into a common mechanism. For studying the predominant pathway, this paper describes a rare example of the syntheses of chiral bisoxazoline Ni(II) aryl halide complexes, which proved essential for probing enantioselectivity via stochiometric experiments. These experiments identify the Ni(II) aryl halide complex as the primary species involved in the key THF radical trapping event. A multivariate linear regression model is presented that further validates the dominant mechanism and delineates structure-selectivity relationships between ligand properties and enantioselectivity. EPR analysis of Ni(0)/aryl halide mixtures highlights the fast access to a variety of Ni complexes in 0,+1, and +2 oxidation states that are proposed to be responsible for the initial divergence in mechanism observed when using Ni(0) pre-catalysts.

This is achieved due to the singlet and triplet states' short-range charge transfer character (SRCT). Thus, obtaining quantitative information about SRCT would help developing new MR-TADF emitters. This work studies three different families of MR-TADF emitters: DOBOA, DiKTa and OQAO. First, we compute their adiabatic \u0394E_ST with four different methods (TDA-CAM-B3LYP, STEOM-DLPNO-CCSD, ADC(2) and SCS-CC2). Then, we compute fluorescence (k_r), direct (k_ISC), and reverse (k_rISC) intersystem crossing rate constants. For k_r, we assess the effect of different levels of approximations on the rate calculations.  We show that k_r do not depend significantly on the different harmonic models (adiabatic Hessian or vertical Hessian), coordinate systems, and broadening widths. Moreover, Herzberg-Teller effects are negligible for k_r but they are the main contribution for k_ISC and k_RISC. The computed rate constants agree well with the experimental results. Moreover, we propose the use of two wavefunction descriptors \u2013 Q_a^t and LOCa \u2013 based on the 1-particle transition density matrix, which assigns the amount of charge centered on the atoms.

Although 3(d-d) states are commonly invoked in the photophysics of ferrocene complexes, mention of the high-spin 5(d-d) state is scarce. Here, we provide clear evidence of 5(d-d) formation in a bimetallic D-A molecule, ferrocenyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate ([FcCc]PF6). Femtosecond optical transient absorption (OTA) spectroscopy reveals two distinct electronic excited states with 30 ps and 500 ps lifetimes. Using a combination of ultraviolet, visible, nearinfrared, and short-wave infrared probe pulses, we capture the spectral features of these states over an ultrabroadband range spanning 320 nm to 2200 nm. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations of the lowest triplet and quintet states, both primarily Fe(II) (d-d) in character, qualitatively agree with the experimental OTA spectra, allowing us to assign the 30 ps state as the 3(d-d) state and the 500 ps state as the high-spin 5(d-d) state. To confirm the ferrocene-centered high-spin character of the 500 ps state, we performed X-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy at the Fe and Co K edges. The Fe K-edge XTA spectrum at 150 ps shows signatures of bond-length expansion and a Jahn-Teller distortion, consistent with an Fe(II) high-spin state. No transient signal is detected at the Co K-edge, confirming the ferrocene-centered character of the excited state. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the high-spin state of ferrocene should be considered when designing donor-acceptor assemblies for photocatalysis and photovoltaics.", "date": "2024-07-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Due to their thermal stability, we successfully isolated the colored isomer. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed for the first time that the colored isomer adopts a closed-ring structure with a bond between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Remarkably, these aza-diarylethenes exhibited not only photochemical ring-closing and ring-opening reactions but also thermal ring-closing and ring-opening reactions, driven by a thermal equilibrium between the open- and closed-ring isomers. This behavior, unprecedented for common diarylethenes, was elucidated through kinetic analysis, revealing an energy-level diagram for the thermal equilibrium between these isomers.

In recent years, numerous deep learning-based methods for molecular docking have emerged. State-of-the-art approaches such as DiffDock formulate the docking problem using diffusion generative models, exhibiting superior performance than traditional docking algorithms. However, despite the strong performance of these deep learning-based docking methods in predicting binding poses, they often lack a well-defined scoring function. This limitation poses challenges in effectively distinguishing between the strong and weak inhibitors during virtual screening. To address this limitation, we introduce FeatureDock, a transformer-based deep learning framework, which can accurately predict the protein-ligand binding poses as well as achieve a strong scoring power for virtual screening. FeatureDock extracts chemical features from local environments within protein structures and utilizes a Transformer encoder to predict probability density envelopes indicating where ligands are most likely to bind in the protein pocket. We also designed a scoring function, which encodes the predicted probability density envelope, to optimize and score the ligand poses. In addition, the attention mechanism in FeatureDock\u2019s Transformer further enhances the model\u2019s interpretability by providing the attention weights of each chemical feature from the protein structures in predicting the binding probabilities. When applied to virtual screening, we demonstrated that FeatureDock outperforms DiffDock, Smina and AutoDock Vina in distinguishing strong inhibitors from weak ones for both Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2, an inactivated form) and Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The performance was assessed using Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence and area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) evaluation metrics. We also demonstrate that FeatureDock can accurately predict the binding poses, achieving an average RMSD of 2.4 \u00c5 when compared to CDK2-ligand co-crystal structures.  We anticipate that our FeatureDock holds promise to be widely applied in virtual screening to assist in drug design.

From the outer arc to the inner arc of the bent crystal, a significant decrease in the lifetime of ~1.9 ns was observed, with a gradual bathochromic shift of ~10 nm in the emission wavelength.

Cathodes, crucial for determining capacity and voltage, face challenges like degradation, thermal runaway, and battery failure. Understanding these degradation phenomena is vital for developing mitigation strategies. Experimental techniques such as XAS, XPS, PES, UV-Vis spectroscopy, RIXS, NMR, and OEMS are commonly used, but theoretical modelling, particularly atomistic modelling with density-functional theory (DFT), provides key insights into the microscopic electronic behaviours causing degradation. While DFT offers a precise formulation, its approximations in the exchange-correlation functional and its ground-state, 0K limitations necessitate additional methods like ab initio molecular dynamics. Recently, many-body electronic structure methods have been used alongside DFT to better explain electron-electron interactions and temperature effects. This review emphasizes material-specific methods and the importance of electron-electron interactions, highlighting the role of many-body methods in addressing key issues such as polaron formation and electron-phonon coupling in cathodes.", "date": "2024-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Theory - Computational; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For proteins, surfactant complexation can also lead to unfolding processes and loss in bioactivity. In this study, we investigated the impact of two surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and dioctyl sulfosuccinate (DOSS) on lysozyme\u2019s solubility, activity, and structure. SDS and DOSS were combined with lysozyme at increasing charge ratios (4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4) via hydrophobic ion pairing at pH 4.5. Maximum complexation efficiency at the 1:1 charge ratio was confirmed by protein quantitation assays and zeta potential measurements, showing a near neutral surface charge. Lysozyme lipophilicity was successfully increased, with log D n-octanol/PBS values up to 2.5 with SDS and 1.8 with DOSS. Bioactivity assays assessing lysis of M. lysodeikticus cell walls showed up to a 2-fold increase in lysozyme\u2019s catalytic ability upon complexation with SDS at ratios less than stoichiometric, suggesting favourable mechanisms of stabilisation. Secondary structural analysis using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that lysozyme underwent a partial unfolding process upon complexation with low SDS concentrations. Molecular dynamic simulations further confirmed that at these low concentrations, a positive conformation was obtained with the active site residue Glu 35 more solvent-exposed. Combined, this suggested that sub-stoichiometric SDS altered the active site\u2019s secondary structure through increased backbone flexibility, leading to higher substrate accessibility.  For DOSS, low surfactant concentrations retained lysozyme\u2019s native function and structure while still increasing the protein\u2019s lipophilic character. Our research findings demonstrate that modulation of protein activity can be related to surfactant chemistry and that controlled ion-pairing can lead to re-engineering of lysozyme solubility, activity, and structure.

Crystal similarity indices measure the degree of similarity between two crystal structures, and are essential in CSP because they are used to identify duplicates. In addition, powder-based indices, which are based on comparing X-ray diffraction patterns, also allow the use of experimental X-ray powder diffraction data to inform the CSP search. Powder-assisted CSP presents two unique difficulties: i) the experimental and computational structures are not entirely comparable because the former is subject to thermal expansion from lattice vibrations, and ii) experimental patterns present features (noise, background contribution, varying peak shapes, etc.)  that are not easily predictable computationally. In this work, we present a powder-based similarity index (GPWDF) based on a modification of de Gelder et al.'s index using cross-correlation functions that can be calculated analytically. Based on GPWDF, we also propose a variable-cell similarity index (VC-GPWDF) that assigns a high similarity score to structures that differ only by a lattice deformation and takes advantage of the analytical derivatives of GPWDF with respect to the lattice parameters. VC-GPWDF can be used to identify similarity between: two computational structures generated using different methods, a computational and a experimental structure, and two experimental structures measured under different conditions (e.g. different temperature and pressure). In addition, VC-GPWDF can also be used to compare crystal structures with experimental patterns in combination with an automatic pre-processing step. The proposed similarity indices are simple, efficient, and fully automatic. They require no indexing of the experimental pattern or a guess of the space group, account for deformations caused by varying experimental conditions, give meaningful results even when the experimental pattern is of very poor quality, and have a cost does not increase with the flexibility of the molecular motif.

To mitigate these limitations, a novel organic compound-based nanozyme with smaller physical dimensions and a wide range of materials is desired.

However, frequently cited research targets were set without quantitatively predicting their impact on the economic viability of CO\u2082 reduction. Using a physics-informed techno-economic assessment, we offer guidance on the most pressing research priorities for CO\u2082 reduction based on state-of-the-art electrolyzer performance. We find that the levelized product cost is dominated by the cost of electricity used to drive electrolysis, and the capital cost of the process mostly arises from separations, especially of unreacted CO\u2082 to be recycled. At a cell resistance as low as 1 \u03a9\u00b7cm\u00b2 and retail electricity prices, operating at a total current density >475 mA/cm\u00b2 drives up electricity demands and increases the cost of producing CO. High current density operation is therefore undesirable unless low cell voltages can be maintained. Although wholesale wind and solar electricity are cheaper than retail electricity, their capacity factors are too low for economical process operation. Adding energy storage to increase the capacity factor of solar electricity triples the capital cost from $34.4 million to $112.6 million for a plant making 50 tCO/day. Improving single-pass conversion is not a priority because it leads to selectivity loss in contemporary membrane electrode assemblies, giving an optimum conversion at <15%. To overcome this limitation, we identify the opportunity to modify reactor design to improve CO\u2082 availability to the catalyst. Decoupling selectivity and single-pass conversion by moving away from a plug flow reactor design, without adding cell voltage, would reduce the base case levelized cost of $1.22/kgCO to $0.97/kgCO and save 36% on capital cost. Finally, we conclude that resolving the \u201ccarbonate crossover problem\u201d in neutral electrolytes is not a priority for improving the levelized cost of product.", "date": "2024-07-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Petrochemicals; Reaction Engineering", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study employed pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) to examine eight different coated paper types. A key finding was the minimal interference of the paper substrate with the pyrolysis products of the coatings, ensuring reliable analysis. The study initially utilized machine learning techniques, specifically random forests and support vector machines, to analyze the pyrolysis data, achieving notable accuracy. However, these traditional methods necessitated complex preprocessing steps. In response, 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) were explored as a more streamlined approach. The 1D-CNN directly processed the extracted ion chromatograms, bypassing conventional intermediate steps, and achieved a predictive accuracy of 95.2% in identifying various coated paper compositions. Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of selecting an optimal pyrolysis temperature for effective feature extraction in machine learning models. Specific markers for coated papers, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene succinate (PBS), polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), polyhydroxy alkanoate (PHA), and waterborne polyacrylates (WP), were identified.

To address this gap, we introduce product-of-experts (PoE) chemical language models, a modular and scalable approach to navigating ultra-large virtual chemical spaces. This method allows for controlled compound generation within a desired chemical space by combining a prior model pre-trained on the target space with expert and anti-expert models fine-tuned using external property-specific datasets. We demonstrate that the PoE chemical language model can generate compounds with desirable properties, such as those that favorably dock to the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and are predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), while ensuring that the majority of generated compounds are present within the target chemical space.

The initial orthorhombic InS nanoribbons bare octylamine ligands and display a highly curved geometry with a characteristic figure of eight shapes. Exchanging the native ligand by oleylamine induces their complete unfolding to yield flat board-shaped nanoribbons. Significant strain variations in the InS crystal structure accompany this shape-shifting. By tuning the linear alkyl chain length from 4 to 18 carbon atoms, we show using SAXS in solution and TEM that the curvature of the nanoribbon subtly depends on the ligand-ligand interactions at the nanoribbon's surface. The curvature decreases gradually as the chain length increases, while carbon unsaturation has an unexpectedly significant effect at constant chain length. These experiments shed light on the critical role of the ligand monolayer on the curvature of ultrathin 2D crystalline nanosheets and demonstrate that weak supramolecular forces within the organic part of colloidal nanocrystals can dramatically impact their shape. This transduction mechanism, in which changes in the organic monolayer impact the shape of a nanocrystal, will help devise new strategies to design stimuli-responsive systems that take advantage of both the flexibility of organic moieties and the physical properties of the inorganic core.

Several of these RBPs interact with NOT9 through an evolutionary conserved (C)NOT9 binding motif (CBM) which we used as a starting point for inhibitor design.

The electronic conductivity increased with applied bias due to an increase in Ce3+ sites. The addition of H2 (~5%) resulted in reverse Water Gas Shift reaction and an additional Raman band at 480 cm-1 (\u03c6). The CO formation was more facile in presence of H2 at a lower bias compared to the pure CO2 stream. The electronic conductivity showed a slight dip at low biases (5% H2) due to the reoxidation of Ce3+ sites to Ce4+-H- (hydridic) sites. Both H2 and CO2 concentrations positively correlated with CO formation and supressed H2O electrolysis. First principles-based calculations indicate that adsorption of H into bulk makes it easier to create oxygen defect in CeO2 making the creation of Ce3+ sites easier.

This phenomenon can alter protein quantification (e.g., Label-Free Quantification, LFQ) if no appropri-ated data processing is applied. Our study is based on understanding this adsorption phenomenon to establish recommenda-tions for minimizing peptide loss. To address this issue, we evaluated the nature of surface material and buffer additives to reduce peptide-surface non-covalent binding. Here, we report that using vials made of polymer containing polar monomeric units such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) drastically reduces the hydrophobic peptide loss, increasing the global proteomics performances (fourfold increase in identified peptides for the single-cell equiv-alent peptide content range).

Via solid state and molecular density functional theory calculations, we quantify the total relative energy, conformational energy, and intramolecular strain of guest molecules, as well as framework strain. Our results show that while CS structures induce some distortion in guest geometries (total relative energies up to 41 kJ/mol), they generally adopt low-energy conformations, often within 2 kJ/mol of the global energy minimum. Intramolecular strain in CS structures is often lower than in conventional crystal structures, suggesting a more neutral packing environment where molecules are closer to their favoured isolated-molecule geometries.

A one-pot formulation protocol enabled us to replace the prodrug by the BY-aniline-Palm label in various proportions up to 100%. Increasing the dye content exhibited complex but gradual transformations of the SLNs in terms of optical absorption and PA spectra, and the formation of aggregates at high concentration. A comprehensive and quantitative PA spectrometric study revealed a photoacoustic generation efficiency (PGE) that is spectrally varying and notably greater than 1. A joined spectral decomposition of the absorption and PA spectra into a sum of three Gaussian functions displayed a per-band evolution of the PGE when the concentration of BY-aniline-Palm varied and showed an interplay between the bands with a constant spectrum area. Finally, a novel quantitative PA spectroscopic approach, involving measurements at three different ambient temperatures, demonstrated that the remarkable PGE values arise from a significant thermo-elastic expansion of the SLN during the PA signal generation independently of the absorption band.

Spatiotemporally controlled lipid generation promotes de novo vesicle formation, growth, and division. Several photoredox catalysts, including those activated by nucleic acids, can drive lipid synthesis. Additionally, we show that the synthesis of bioactive lipids can trigger signaling in living cells.", "date": "2024-07-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Bioorganic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.); Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A crucial aspect of these processes is to expand the number of candidate polymer structures, as the currently known real polymer structures are very limited. In contrast, small molecule databases are vast, offering extensive opportunities for the design of new molecules, such as drug discovery. In this study, we collected extensive small molecule compounds from GDB-17, GDB-13, and PubChem, and selected polymerization reaction pathways for eight types of polymers, including polyimide, polyolefin, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, epoxy, polybenzimidazole (PBI), and vitrimer. These small molecule datasets and polymerization reactions enabled us to generate hundreds of quadrillions of hypothetical polymer structures. For each of the eight polymers, along with one promising copolymer, poly(imide-imine), we randomly generated over one million hypothetical structures, except for PBI, for which we created 10,000 structures. Chemical space visualization using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and synthetic accessibility scores were employed to assess the feasibility of synthesizing these new polymers. Customized feedforward neural network models predicted thermal, mechanical, and gas permeation properties for both real and hypothetical polymers. Results show that many hypothetical polymers, especially polyimides, exhibit significant potential, often surpassing real polymers in performance, particularly for high-temperature applications and gas separation. Our findings highlight the immense potential of large-scale hypothetical polymer libraries for materials discovery and design. These libraries not only aid in identifying promising polymer materials through high-throughput screening but also provide valuable datasets for training advanced machine learning models, such as large language models.

Micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) data could provide the necessary input for these models, but the poor contrast between the carbon fibers and the polymer matrix does not allow automatic geometry extraction. To overcome this issue, hafnium oxide nanocrystals (HfO2 NCs) were introduced as CT contrast agents to the polymer matrix to provide the required contrast.

Here, based on configuration-interaction theory, we derive a new effective expression for \u0394ES1T1, in which \u0394ES1T1 positively depends both on 2KHL (where KHL is the exchange energy between the HOMO and LUMO levels) and on the energy gap between the LUMO and LUMO+1 levels (\u0394ELUMO-LUMO+1).

Here we demonstrate that sorbitol, T_g\u2248267 K, advantageously replaces glycerol to carry out DNP at higher temperature while maintaining an identical 13C NMR spectrum footprint and thus minimizes spectral overlap. DNP stops being effective in glycerol/water at ~180 K, but DMSO/sorbitol gives significant enhancement at 230 K, with AsymPol-POK biradicals at 600 MHz / 395 GHz. The effect of biradical concentration, the temperature dependence of the enhancement, the buildup times and signal-to-noise ratio are rationalized for the first time with a simple analytical model. The model reveals that electron spin relaxation is the limiting factor for high temperature DNP in the case of AsymPol-POK.

In an application to the ground and excited states of a Be atom, UMRSF-TDDFT successfully recovers the degenerate states, with its energies slightly reduced compared to its RO counterpart, due to the additional variational flexibility of UKS. A clear difference between UMRSF and U-SF-TDDFT is evident in the bond breaking of the hydrogen fluoride system, as the latter misses an important configuration.

In this view multi-molecular catalysis is essential. It is achieved through Multiple catalytic sites. The Multiple catalytic sites are created through a novel intercrossing framework catalyst. The intercrossing framework is created between MgO framework and AlPO4 framework by the template (TPAOH). The catalyst has multiple acidic sites on superoxide ion, oxyanion, octahedral Al3+ and Mg2+. The intercrossing frameworks is achieved in first time and the material is named as Kankarlite-2. The active sites and intercrossed framework are confirmed in the crystal structure drawn by XRD data. The surface area is 60m2/g and pore volume is 2.9cm3/g. The TGA and TEM analysis are the supportive evidence for the intercrossing of the two frameworks. Though the surface area and pore volume is low, the activity is too high due to the intercrossing framework. The effective catalytic activity at lower temperature may be due to the cooperative effect of such multiple active sites which leads to the multi-molecular assembling of CO2 molecules. This assembling reduces the CO2 decomposition temperature (63%). The multi-molecular assembling is calculated by a new formula of P n = R mT/(W t)\nThus we have achieved intercrossing framework catalyst and multi-molecular catalysis for Carbon capturing at lower temperature.\n", "date": "2024-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Catalysts; Atmospheric Chemistry; Acid Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Important circulating miRNAs, serving as biomarkers, have been correlated to breast cancer (BC) metastasis and therapy efficiency. In particular, among the BC, the Triple negative BC (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous subtype, accounting for 40% of BC related mortality. Rapid detection of these miRNAs through non-invasive liquid biopsy can significantly enhance diagnosis and prognosis, thereby improving survival rates. Considering these emerging biomarkers within the framework of personalized medicine, affordable and portable devices could enable quicker monitoring for cancer patients, including those in remote areas. In this context, we have developed an enzyme-assisted electrochemical point-of-care (POC) test. The proposed miRNA detection system is boosted by the use of duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) as the recognition element of miRNA. The DSN enzyme exhibits high selectivity to discriminate DNA-RNA heteroduplexes triggering isothermal target recycling and signal enhancement. This capability is crucial for overcoming the limitations often associated with detecting trace amounts of miRNA in biofluids. In our study, the specific probe for the miRNA target was labelled with a redox mediator, methylene blue, to enable the detection of enzymatic products via electrochemical measurements on screen-printed electrode. Optimization studies have been performed to obtain the enzymatic reaction in terms of probe and enzyme concentration. A calibration graph was obtained for various target concentrations ranging from 0.1 pM to100 nM, and a detection limit down to the fM level was achieved. Specificity studies were performed with random miRNA targets, and finally the device was applied in spiked commercial serum samples.

The computation of the DNA-based neural network has recently emerged as a focal point of research due to its versatility, scalability, energy efficiency and potentially other huge benefits and implications, as compared to electronic computation. Despite notable advancements, the development of the current DNA neural networks, based on the complementary pairing of DNA nucleobases, is restricted by the lack of reusability of the DNA computing materials, one of key bottlenecks impeding their progression towards neural network learning and evolution. As a result, even the state-of-the-art DNA neural network computations are limited to one-time use currently. Here we report the design of an unprecedented, reusable DNA based non-complementary perceptron (NCP) strategy that implements thresholding and weighted summation functions like neurons and the corresponding neural networks capable of 4-bit molecular pattern recognition. To facilitate the scaling-up of the non-complementary circuits, a modulated concept employing \u201ctagging\u201d domains is also coined. We demonstrate that non-complementary \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d circuit can be rationally constructed with a non-complementary annihilator strand. Such NCP based neural network architecture is capable of 4-bit pattern recognition, evidenced by its success in playing the \u201cI Spy\u201d game. Most importantly, when removable input strands (lipid-oligonucleotide conjugates) are utilized, this NCP-based pattern recognition neural network shows high fidelity in multiple-cycle computing.

We identify two groups of MOFs that exhibit excellent process performance: one with relatively small pores in the range of 3-5\u00c5 and another with larger pores of 6-30\u00c5. The performance of the first group is driven effectively by the exclusion of N2 from adsorption, with binding sites able to accommodate only CO2 molecules. The second group, with larger pores, features binding sites where CO2 molecules form multiple interactions with oxygen and functional groups of several building blocks, leading to high CO2/N2 selectivity.

In this study, we employed a novel bioinformatics approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of the state of TB/HIV coinfection. Using a multidimensional graph-based clustering methodology, we identified several key pathways associated with infectious and autoimmune diseases, immune and inflammatory responses, cardiovascular dysfunctions, and metabolic processes. We identified therapeutic biomarkers regulated by established therapeutic chemicals and developed robust machine learning-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (ML-QSAR) models to identify effective drug candidates. Our models successfully identified S5105 proanthocyanidin as a promising modulator of the key inflammatory biomarkers TNF, IL1B, and IFNG. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of environmental factors, such as arsenic, air pollutants, and carbon monoxide, on the progression and occurrence of TB/HIV coinfection. Our findings revealed that these toxicants can trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses, leading to lung fibrosis and a cytokine storm that exacerbates immune dysregulation in coinfected individuals. Additionally, the impact of air pollutants on cardiovascular health and neurological complications, such as AIDS-Dementia Complex, adds to the complexity of managing TB/HIV coinfection. Again, with the findings of multidimensional graphs, we tried to elucidate the correlation between the air quality indices and the occurrence of TB/HIV coinfection. The models highlighted particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 concentrations as critical predictors, indicating that poor air quality is positively correlated with higher rates of HIV testing among TB patients and an increased percentage of HIV-positive TB patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). This suggests regions with worse air quality may have more comprehensive health monitoring. By identifying these associations, we can better understand how arsenic and air pollutants might contribute to immune deterioration and disease progression in TB and HIV patients.

The gold standard to correct for this phenomenon, whereby compounds co-eluting with the analyte-of-interest cause ionization enhancement or suppression, is to quantify an analyte based on the peak area ratio with an isotopologue added to the sample as an internal standard. However, these stable isotopes are expensive and sometimes unavailable. Here we describe an alternative approach: matrix effect correction and quantifying analytes using signal ratio with a post-column infused standard (PCIS). Using an LC-MS/MS method for 8 endocannabinoids and related metabolites in plasma, we provide strategies to select, optimize and evaluate PCIS candidates. Based on 7 characteristics, the structural endocannabinoid analogue arachidonoyl-2'-fluoroethylamide was selected as a PCIS. Three methods to evaluate the PCIS correction vs. no correction showed that PCIS correction improved values for matrix effect, precision and dilutional linearity of at least six of the analytes to within acceptable ranges. PCIS correction also resulted in parallelization of calibration curves in plasma and neat solution, for 6 of 8 analytes even with higher accuracy than peak area ratio correction with their stable isotope labeled internal standard, i.e. the gold standard. This enables quantification based on neat solutions, which is a significant step towards absolute quantification. We conclude that PCIS has great, but so far under-appreciated, potential in accurate LC-MS quantification.

The rather polarized ligand binding site of influenza virus neuraminidase was also optimized by FDPD optimization, which relaxed steric repulsion around the ligand in the crystal structure and optimized hydrogen bonding.

Recent studies suggest that hematological toxicity linked to CDK4/6 dual inhibitors may be due to strong CDK6 inhibition. To address these challenges, small molecules targeting different CDK subfamily members could provide clinical advantages in specific patient subgroups and expand CDK inhibitor indications beyond breast cancer. However, the high conservation of CDK's binding pocket makes designing molecules selectively targeting different CDKs challenging. In this study, we use in-depth in silico modeling and structural biology analysis of co-crystal data to analyze subtle variations in several CDKs' key binding pockets. Our findings indicate that a sequential difference of a \u03b1D-helix motif between CDK4 and CDK6 represents an ideal \"sweet spot\" that influences binding selectivity. To achieve this selectivity, we designed small molecules with a 1,4-trans-cyclohexanediamine sidechain that specifically promotes interactions with the \u03b1D-helix motif in CDK4 but not in CDK6. Interestingly, the same \u03b1D-helix motif in CDK9 presented an opportunity to develop a CDK4/9 inhibitor, potentially improving acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our rational approach identified a series of analogs exhibiting distinct in vitro selectivity among CDK4, CDK6, and CDK9. The lead compound (29) was further evaluated for in vivo pharmacokinetics. This work revealed key molecular insights for developing next-generation CDK inhibitors with unique selectivity profiles.

The feasibility of each technology depends on the cost and availability of methane, green electricity, and the existence of carbon markets. To assess the feasibility of green and blue ammonia, we developed a detailed process model for each system and examined the energy, cost, and emissions associated with each system. We also assessed integration with the grid and intermittent operation from variable renewable energy resources on site. Our results suggest that an effective carbon tax of 50 USD/tCO2 would make blue ammonia feasible. However, for green ammonia to be a viable alternative to gray ammonia in all scenarios, the required carbon tax would be between 100 USD/tCO2 and 200 USD/tCO2. Furthermore, we find that green ammonia is only the preferred alternative over blue ammonia with advanced projections for renewable electricity and electrolysis technologies and with high natural gas price projections. Finally, we discuss the integration of emerging ammonia production routes with the grid and variable renewable power systems and their social impacts in future deployments.

To evaluate different generative AI models quantitatively, computational metrics such as rule of five, validity, novelty, uniqueness and FCD are needed. However, conventional metrics still have limitations in terms of comprehensive evaluation including drug-likeness, diversity, and novelty.\n\nMethod: In this paper, we propose a metric, novelty, and coverage (NC), which measures the structural similarity between the generated set and the actual ligand set. Novelty and coverage filters the generated set by comparing molecular properties with known drugs, and then calculates structural similarity and diversity, allowing a comprehensive evaluation based on the trade-off relationship between them. For the comparison of conventional metrics and NC, we used models from the MOSES platform in addition to the latest deep learning models. We built the two representative sets for the comparison of molecular properties (ChEMBL) and structural similarity (ZINC).\n\n  Result: The results show that conventional metrics can be grouped into three clusters (drug-likeness, external diversity, internal diversity) and point out their limitations. We compared the results of conventional metrics and NC, and then verified that NC explained conventional metrics.

The intensity of the regained fluorescence is directly linked to the nature of the analyte, and it shows some dose-response relationships with saccharides and phosphorylated molecules that are not compatible with a displacement assay, thus suggesting an allosteric mechanism. Interestingly, when fluorescein is trapped by the metalla-rectangle in the presence of D-fructose, half of the maximum fluorescence intensity is recovered at a fructose concentration of 17.2 \u00b1 4.7 \u03bcM, while for D-glucose a concentration of 50.6 \u00b1 2.5 \u03bcM is required for the same effect.

To remedy this, we employ an alternative method based on steady-state cyclic voltammetry. By adding a mobile redox acceptor molecule to the electrolyte, the additional cross reaction between the film and the acceptor mimics a source-drain electrode configuration, generating a steady state with negligible counter ion flux. Additionally, we construct a bespoke physical model and derive an analytical expression to correct the current response for any electric field effects.

Using models that simulate the storage system and associated fuel cell of a light-duty vehicle (LDV), we compared performance of the bulk hydrides with a nanoscaled version in porous carbon, (LiNH2+2LiH)@(6-nm PC). Using experimental material properties, the simulations show that (LiNH2+2LiH)@(6-nm PC) counterintuitively has higher usable gravimetric and volumetric capacities than the bulk counterpart on a system basis despite having lower capacities on a materials-only basis. Nanoscaling increases the thermal conductivity and lowers the desorption enthalpy, which consequently increases heat management efficiency.

Porous adsorbent materials are of particular interest due to their diverse design possibilities and computational screening has accelerated the search for optimal materials. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) has recently been used as a faster alternative to state-of-the-art computational methods for screening of porous materials. However, extensive validation of cDFT predictions has not been performed for many materials, in a wide range of conditions, and with guest molecules exhibiting strong Coulombic interactions. In this paper, we validate the cDFT predictions by calculating the adsorption properties for more than 500 Metal-Organic Frameworks with three adsorbate molecules (CH4, N2, and CO2) and comparing them to state-of-the-art results from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. For CO2, we introduce the computation of Coulombic interactions between the MOF and the molecule, which are necessary to accurately describe this system. Our results demonstrate cDFT's ability to accurately replicate GCMC adsorption isotherms and enthalpies of adsorption while needing a median time of only 6 minutes per material. These features position cDFT as a serious candidate for adsorption properties estimations of porous materials for a wide range of physical adsorption-based processes.", "date": "2024-07-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

It is easily synthesized by ring expansion after cyclopropanation of the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand. The Cnt ligand can be reported as the cis-cis-cis-cis (cis) isomer, where the aromatic ring is flat, and all carbon atoms form a homogenous ring, and as the cis-cis-cis-trans (trans) isomer, where one carbon places itself inside the ring. The isomerization from the trans to the cis form has been reported numerous times in previous articles, but no quantitative analysis has been proposed due to contradictory data. This article proposes a detailed analysis involving light in order to rationalize this intrigue concerning isomerization. A careful synthesis at low temperatures and with light protection yields the ligand in its trans form (Cnt-trans). The controlled photo-isomerization of the Cnt-trans ligand is reported herein. A series of divalent or trivalent rare earth complexes, (Cnt)2Sm, and (Cot)(Cnt)Ln (Ln= Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Er, Ho), which synthesis, solid-state X-ray diffraction and solution 1H NMR and UV-Visible measurements, have been revised according to the synthesis using the Cnt-trans ligand.

Analogous to selection rules that govern outcomes in small molecule chemistry, we investigated both thermally and photochemically mediated polymerizations of skipped and conjugated dienes (1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexadiene) under high pressure and explored the resultant product selectivity. For 1,3-cyclohexadiene, both approaches yield largely amorphous products owing to competing reaction pathways. Thermally mediated polymerization of 1,4-cyclohexadiene yields a crystalline product; however, the identification of the backbone composition is consistent with multiple different reaction pathways being accessible. While support for cyclobutane structures is present, comparison to the simulated structures suggests multiple products are obtained from the thermal polymerization of 1,4-cyclohexadiene. In contrast, the recovered product obtained from photochemically mediated polymerization of the skipped diene has different d-spacings and is consistent with simulations that support a single reaction pathway toward cyclobutane-linked nanothreads.

Recently, the Shannon Entropy Correlation has shown superior performance over several other measures, including the Cosine Correlation, in LC-MS-based metabolomics, particularly concerning receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and false discovery rates. However, previous comparisons did not consider the weight factor transformation, which is critical for achieving higher accuracy with the cosine correlation. This study conducted a comparative analysis of the Cosine Correlation and Shannon Entropy Correlation, incorporating the weight factor transformation during preprocessing. Additionally, we developed a novel entropy correlation measure, the Tsallis Entropy Correlation, which offers greater versatility than the Shannon Entropy Correlation. Our results indicate that the weight factor transformation is essential for achieving higher accuracy in both LC-MS and GC-MS-based compound identification.

Here we report an electrified tungsten filament method for depolymerizing polyolefin plastics into olefin monomers with competitive selectivities. In this system, a high temperature zone exceeding 1000 \u00b0C enables plastic depolymerization within 1 s, while the flow field transfers the products to a zone near room temperature, preventing nonselective further conversion. For depolymerizing polyethylene to ethylene, this method achieves a selectivity of 48%, substantially improved compared with that of traditional methods, such as catalytic pyrolysis (typically <20%). Moreover, polyethylene and polypropylene of various molecular weights and their mixtures have been depolymerized with monomer selectivities of 45\u201358% without the formation of tars and chars.

However, the method cannot be directly hyphenated with mass spectrometry (MS), preventing direct identification of separated charge variants due to the non-volatile background electrolyte (BGE), which hinders reliable charge variant identification. This study presents a CZE-UV/MS method using a neutral static capillary coating of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose combined with a volatile BGE at pH 5.0 to allow MS-compatible mAb charge variant separations. The effect of several parameters, including pH and concentration of BGE, voltage, and injected mAb concentrations in terms of separation performance on a panel of mAbs was investigated. The final method was tested with mAbs of IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG4) with different pI (7.4-9.2), and degrees of heterogeneity. Basic and acidic variants were separated from the parent mAb using a BGE of 50 mM acetic acid adjusted at pH 5.0. A linear correlation in relative charge variant abundance was obtained between our method and the EACA method. CZE-MS coupling was accomplished using the nanoCEasy, a low-flow sheath liquid interface, which enabled the identification and quantitation of basic, acidic, and incomplete pyroglutamate variants, and glycoforms of the tested mAbs.This method can be a useful tool for in-depth charge variants characterization of mAbs. \n", "date": "2024-07-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the thermal steps of the rotation cycle have been rather well understood by now, our understanding of the photoisomerization reactions of overcrowded alkene-based motors still misses key points that would allow for explaining striking differences in operation efficiency of the known systems. Here, we employ quantum-chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the excited-state decay and photoisomerization mechanisms in a prototypical alkene-based first-generation rotary motor, considering the excitation of all its four ground-state isomers.

In this work, we show that in contrast to cracking of small molecules, plastic cracking activity using ultrastable zeolite Y materials does not depend on the bulk Br\u00f8nsted acid site content, but rather on the concentration of acid sites located on the outer surface and in mesopores. This external acidity, however, fails to capture all the observed performance trends. Detailed kinetic experiments revealed that the scaling of the reaction rate with the catalyst loading differs drastically between highly similar catalyst materials. More specifically, doubling the catalyst loading leads to doubling of the reaction rate for one material, while for another it leads to more than fivefold increase.

Upon irradiation, \u2018linear\u2019 dialkyldiazirines produce dialkylcarbenes which are susceptible to both intramolecular reactions and unimolecular elimination processes, as well as diazoalkanes, which also participate in intermolecular labeling. Cyclobutylidene has a nonclassical bonding structure and is stable enough to be captured in bimolecular reactions. Cyclobutanediazirines have more recently been studied as photoaffinity probes based on cyclobutylidene, but the mechanism, especially with respect to the role of putative diazo intermediates, was not fully understood. Here, we show that photolysis (365 nm) of cyclobutanediazirines can produce cyclobutylidene intermediates as evidenced by formation of their expected bimolecular and unimolecular products, including methylenecyclopropane derivatives. Unlike linear diazirines, cyclobutanediazirine photolysis in the presence of tetramethylethylene produces a [2+1] cycloaddition adduct. By contrast, linear diazirines produce diazo compounds upon low temperature photolysis in THF, whereas diazo compounds are not detected in similar photolyses of cyclobutanediazirines. Diazocyclobutane, prepared by independent synthesis, is labile, reactive toward water and capable of protein alkylation. The rate of diazocyclobutane decomposition is not affected by 365 nm light, suggesting that the photochemical conversion of diazocyclobutane to cyclobutylidene is not an important pathway. Finally, chemical proteomic studies revealed that a likely consequence of this primary conversion to a highly reactive carbene is a marked decrease in labeling by cyclobutanediazirine- based probes relative to linear diazirine counterparts both at the individual protein and proteome- wide levels. Collectively, these observations are consistent with a mechanistic picture for cyclobutanediazirine photolysis that involves carbene chemistry with minimal formation of diazo intermediates, and contrasts with the photolyses of linear diazirines where alkylation by diazo intermediates plays a more significant role.", "date": "2024-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

ML models developed from these RASAR descriptors use similarity-based information from the close source neighbors of a particular query compound. We have employed different  classification modeling algorithms on the selected QSAR and RASAR descriptors to develop predictive models targeted towards the efficient prediction of hepatotoxicity of query compounds.

The application of various unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and UMAP, and the supervised ARKA framework showed the usefulness of the RASAR descriptors over the selected QSAR descriptors in their ability to group similar compounds, enhancing the modelability of the dataset and efficiently identifying activity cliffs.

A diagnostic consequence of H+, as opposed to Zn2+, insertion is the precipitation of layered double hydroxide (LDH) crystals, which can be readily identified by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. Absence of LDH formation has been perceived as evidence for Zn2+ insertion. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we reveal a different charge compensation mechanism in a vanadyl phosphate electrode, where H+ insertion predominates in an aqueous Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. The H+ insertion induces a conformal deposition of an amorphous ZnO layer on the electrode particle, which cannot be captured by scanning electron microscopy or X-ray diffraction. Our work underlines the complexity of the charge compensation mechanism in aqueous Zn-ion batteries, which is relevant to other multivalent systems.", "date": "2024-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Derivatives exhibit two different crystal packing motifs:  head-to-head (HH) in which the molecules stack with the phenyl rings on the same side of the stack, and head-to-tail (HT) in which the phenyl rings of adjacent molecules are on opposite sides. The [2+2] photodimerization is only observed for HT packing motif.  Attempts to identify chemical substitution patterns that favor the reactive HT packing based on simple steric and electrostatic considerations fail to reliably predict crystal packing, and fluorination generated both motifs in more-or-less random fashion.  Empirically, substitution at the 3-position favors HT packing while substitution at the 4-position favors HH packing.  Computational modeling suggests that the tendency for HH or HT packing arrangements stems from complex many-body interactions with the rest of the lattice.  Modeling with periodic density functional theory shows that interactions with the rest of the lattice also explain why the HT motif is photochemically active while the HH motif is inert.  Chemical substitution can also affect the photomechanical work output, with a significant variation in work between HT polymorphs composed of different molecules.  In order to obtain a reactive HT polymorph, the best strategy appears to entail placing a strong electron-withdrawing group at the 3-position of the phenyl, and we confirm that an HT polymorph of 3-trifluoromethyl-cinnamalmalononitrile is a highly photosalient crystal, with a predicted ideal work density of 40 MJ/m3.

The proton transport through polycrystalline microstructures of yttrium doped barium zirconates is hindered by the presence of a positive space charge potential at grain boundaries. During high temperature sintering, the positive charge acts as a driving force for acceptor dopant segregation to the grain boundary. Acceptor segregation to grain boundaries has been observed in sintered ceramics, but the fundamental relationship between the segregation kinetics and the protonic conductivity is poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the influence of acceptor dopant segregation on the electrochemical properties of grain boundaries in barium zirconate based protonic ceramics. To facilitate this study, we designed an out-of-equilibrium model material that is not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and displays no detectable Y segregation at its grain boundaries. This model material served as a starting point to measure the kinetics of segregation and the induced changes in grain boundary conductivity upon varying thermal histories. Furthermore, we correlated the electrochemical results from impedance spectroscopy to atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. We discovered that acceptor dopant segregation drastically increases the proton conductivity in both our model system and several other application-relevant compositions. In all cases, high-temperature thermal treatments were necessary to equilibrate the space charge zones, allowing the segregation of cationic point defects to grain boundaries, compensating the core charge and resulting in high performance protonic ceramics.", "date": "2024-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Ceramics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Gaining mechanistic insight into the spin relaxation process has proven challenging owing to a lack of spectroscopic observables relative to the many degrees of freedom involved. Here, we use pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to profile systematic changes in the spin relaxation anisotropy as a function of temperature for two Cu(II) coordination compounds. For randomly-oriented powder samples, large anisotropy changes arise between 20 and 50 K that delineate multiple regimes of relaxation for each molecule studied. Local mode fitting of the average T1 value fails to consistently extract the anisotropy regime crossover. Single-crystal T1 anisotropy experiments reveal a surprising difference between the symmetry of the spin relaxation tensor in these two regimes. In the high-temperature regime, spin relaxation is fastest and slowest along the principal axes of the molecular g-tensor, which obeys the symmetry of the molecular point group. In the low-temperature regime, spin relaxation is fastest and slowest along arbitrary directions of the g-tensor, instead responding to the crystal packing. We interpret this switch as arising from a change in the localization of the phonons driving spin relaxation at different temperatures, consistent with delocalized lattice phonons in the low-temperature regime and localized molecular vibrations in the high-temperature regime. Variable-temperature T1 anisotropy thus provides a unique method of interrogating the character of nuclear motions causing the spin relaxation process.", "date": "2024-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Magnetism; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Since the cycle consistency condition relates free energy differences on edges of a cycle, it could be used to improve the accuracy of free energy estimates.

We apply CBayesMBAR to compute free energy differences among harmonic oscillators and relative protein-ligand binding free energies.

Understanding the spectral tuning mechanism not only helps explain the diversity of colors observed in nature, but also provides principles for bioengineering new color variants for practical applications. In this study, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations have been employed to understand the fluo-rescence spectral tuning mechanism of bacterial luciferase, with a focus on the electrostatic effect. The spectrum can be tuned by both the homogeneous dielectric environment and oriented external electric fields (OEEFs). Increasing solvent polarity leads to a redshift of the fluorescence emission maximum, \u03bbF, accompanied by an increase in density. In contrast, applying an OEEF along the long axis of the isoalloxazine ring leads to a significant red- or blue-shift in \u03bbF, depending on the direction of the OEEF, but with negligible changes in its intensity. The effect of polar solvents is directionless, and the red-shifts can be attributed to the larg-er dipole moment of the S1 state compared to the S0 state. However, the effect of OEEFs directly correlates with the difference dipole moment between the S1 and S0 states, which is directional and determined by the charge redistribution upon excitation. Moreover, the electrostatic effect of bacterial luciferase is in line with the presence of an internal electric field (IEF) pointing in the negative X direction with a magnitude of ca. 30 MV/cm.

Since a key artifact in optical PM sensors is aerosol hygroscopic growth, we explore the viability of an alternative LCS calibration method: a hygroscopic growth correction factor using particle composition data from the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset. We compare 3 different LCS located in 3 different areas of SSA \u2013 Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa - with 3 different calibration techniques: traditional linear calibrations with a reference-grade monitor, a \u03ba-K\u00f6hler-derived correction with MERRA-2 data, and a random forest machine learning regression utilizing MERRA-2 and the regulatory-grade monitor. Random forest regressions using MERRA-2 particle composition data and collocation with a reference-grade monitor improve sensor performance to near that of regulatory-grade monitors. But even without collocation, a hygroscopic growth correction based on MERRA-2 particle composition alone can improve LCS PM2.5 performance by reducing mean-normalized bias to near-zero and reducing error by up to 40%.", "date": "2024-07-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, challenges and open questions persist in characterizing disordered and hierarchically structured porous materials. This study introduces a pore network model aiming to enhance the textural characterization of nanoporous materials. Our model, based on percolation theory on a finite sized Bethe lattice, includes all mechanisms known to contribute to adsorption hysteresis in mesoporous pore networks during capillary condensation and evaporation. The model accounts for delayed and initiated condensation during adsorption as well as equilibrium evaporation, pore blocking and cavitation during desorption. Coupled with dedicated non-local-density functional theory (NLDFT) kernels, the proposed method provides a unified framework for modeling the entire experimental adsorption-desorption isotherm, including desorption hysteresis scans. The applicability of the method is demonstrated on a selected set of nanoporous silica materials exhibiting distinct types of hysteresis loops (types H1, H2a, H1/H2a and H5), including ordered mesoporous silica networks, i.e, KIT-6 silica, hybrid SBA-15/MCM-41 silica with plugged pores, but also two disordered silica pore networks, i.e., a hierarchical meso-macroporous monolith and porous Vycor glass. For all materials, good correlation is found between calculated and experimental primary adsorption and desorption isotherms as well as desorption scans. The model allows to determine key pore network characteristics such as pore connectivity and pore size distributions as well as a parameter correlated with the impact of pore network disorder and corresponding effects on the adsorption behavior. The versatility and enriched textural insights provided by the proposed novel network model allow for a comprehensive characterization previously inaccessible, and hence will contribute to a further advancement in the textural characterization of novel nanoporous materials. It has the potential to provide important guidance for the design and selection of porous materials for optimising various applications, including separation processes (such as chromatography), heterogeneous catalysis, gas- and energy storage.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns characterize a wide range of diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, and serve as both validated therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Among the proteins involved in the regulation of DNA methylation are the DNA methylation reader proteins (MBPs), which bind methylated DNA and initiate a signalling cascade involving different protein complexes, predominantly resulting in gene repression, thereby playing a significant role in gene regulation. Notably, the Methyl-CpG Binding Domain 2 (MBD2) protein exhibits a strong preference for methylated DNA and is implicated in tumour formation and maintenance. Here, we developed chemical compounds designed to interfere with MBD2 and its interaction with DNA. Building on our previous findings, we chemically modified 5-methylcytosine at position N4 and synthesized the corresponding deoxynucleosides and CpG dimers through convergent chemical pathways. We tested 60 compounds in two optimized screening assays to assess their interaction with MBD2 and their ability to disrupt the DNA-MBD2 complex. The incorporation of the modified nucleobase into the CpG dimers significantly enhanced the biological activity of these compounds. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the configuration (D/L) of the modified nucleoside on their activity. NMR experiments confirmed that the compounds interact with the amino acids involved in DNA binding.

We present here 5-amino-4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole as an alternative and versatile synthon for generating metallo-MIIs. In this approach, we make use of metallation at the N-pyridyl/N3-traizole chelating pocket (instead of quarternisation of N3-triazole) and subsequent deprotonation to generate highly versatile and tunable metallo-MIIs. These unprecedented metallo-MIIs contain a highly nucleophilic N-donor site, and a tunable electrophilic metal site within the same platform. Apart from displaying strong and directed H-bonding interactions like their \u201cclassical\u201d MII analogues, the metallo-MIIs engage in aromatic C-F activation as well as meta-C-H activation reactions. Facile synthesis of homo and heterodincuelar complexes which contain a mixed coordinative saturation/unsaturation with these metallo-MICs is presented.

The dynamics of the emission trace are analyzed by fitting a histogram of on- and off- times to power-law distributions. These histograms in turn, reveal non-exponential kinetics, arguing for a distribution of electron or hole traps. What is not revealed is the origin of these distributed states, whether they arise from various trap energetic depths, long-range electron or hole tunneling, or any other process which gives rise to distributions of rates. We explore a model which invokes both a distribution of trap energies, combined with the chemical intuition of charge transfer via Marcus theory. We find that a self-consistent Marcus theory model can explain different power-law slopes for on- and off- times, and the observed changes in intensity as a function of temperature in films of CdTe nanoplatelets (NPLs).

The present study reports some antimicrobial classes of compounds and explores their molecular interaction with DNA using molecular modeling methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) studies. Molecular docking calculations were performed to predict binding pocket and Molecular Dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) highly support the predicted binding mode.

Thus, there is an urgent need to replace fluorinated refrigerants with non-fluorinated working fluids to avoid direct emissions due to leakage, incorrect loading or removal. It is important, however, also to select refrigerants with high efficiencies to avoid indirect CO2 emissions due to a (too) high energy consumption during the use phase.

While P1 centers have been studied by EPR spectroscopy for decades, only recently did their behavior at ultra-high (> 12 T) magnetic fields become of interest. This is because P1 centers were recently found to be very efficient polarizing agents in Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) experiments, which are typically carried out at high magnetic fields. The P1 ultra-high field EPR spectra show multiple peaks which the lower fields spectra do not. In this paper, we present an account of the EPR spectra of P1 centers at ultra-high fields and show that the more complex spectra at 12\u201320 T are the result of significant state mixing in the \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc46=+\u00bd electron spin manifold.

Each ML model was used to screen a diverse set of drug-like compound collections to identify orthosteric binders of two therapeutic targets, Casein kinase 1\ud835\udefc/\u03b4 (CK1\ud835\udefc/\u03b4). Overall, 10% and 94% of the predicted binders and not-binders were confirmed in biophysical assays, including two nanomolar binders (187 and 69.6 nM affinity for CK1\ud835\udefc and CK1\u03b4, respectively). Our study provides insights into the DEL+ML paradigm for hit discovery: the importance of an ensemble ML approach in identifying a diverse set of confirmed binders, the usefulness of large training data and chemical diversity in the DEL, and the significance of model generalizability over accuracy. We shared our results via an open-source repository for further use and development of similar efforts.", "date": "2024-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Conventional analytical methods suffer from low accuracy and precision in NP detection due to their limited reliability and quantitative ability. To address these challenges, we developed a dual-functional model NP that allows for in-situ imaging by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and ex-situ quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In this study, the model NP has a core-shell structure with Raman reporter-functionalized gold nanoparticles as the core and a layer of plastic as the shell. The gold core can enhance the Raman reporter signals and make model PS detectable, which can be used to visualize the uptake of the model NP in plant tissue by SERS. Meanwhile, the model NP particle numbers in the collected plants can be quantified by ICP-MS based on the presence of gold in the core. The model PS demonstrated stability in structure, size, and surface charges over one year, with no indication of chemical leaching. In this study, garlic plants were used as our experimental matrix to evaluate the potential of the dual-functional model PS for application in living organisms. Our aim was to determine whether the model PS in the garlic plants could be effectively quantified and qualified by SERS and ICP-MS. Garlic plants were grown in various concentrations of model NP suspensions for a 30-day period. The results showed that the NP uptake was concentration-dependent with higher concentrations of model NP leading to higher uptake by the garlic roots. The study also investigated the changes in NP uptake over time, showing that longer NP exposure resulted in more NP uptake in garlic roots. The study also demonstrated the effective coordination between SERS and ICP-MS. In cases where SERS had limitations in detecting the presence of model PS, ICP-MS proved capable of facilitating detection in garlic tissue. This study demonstrates the potential use of this dual-functional model NP for studying NP behavior with SERS and ICP-MS in living organisms, which holds significant implications for better understanding their impact on crops for future studies.", "date": "2024-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Environmental Analysis; Imaging; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Raman scattering spectra indicated that B atoms mainly formed isolated planar BO3 triangles similar to those of crystalline LaBO3. This was independent of the ratio of La2O3 and Y2O3. 11B magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectra confirmed that the BO4 units that should have disappeared in the glass with highly modified compositions remained as fragmented species. Approximately 4% of the B atoms formed BO4 in the 50La2O3\u201350B2O3 glass. This ratio increased with the increase in the Y2O3 content, and it reached its maximum value (14%) in the 50Y2O3\u201350B2O3 glass. Comparison of the electron density distribution was conducted based on Ab initio calculations of the LaBO3 and YBO3 crystals and indicated that Y\u2013O was more ionically bonded than La\u2013O. Thus, the unconventional existence of BO4 in highly modified glass is attributed to the presence of highly ionic modifier ions that can efficiently compensate for the charge of the BO4 unit, which is more negatively charged than BO3. Thus, the ratio of BO4 and BO3 in highly modified glass can be controlled by tuning the glass content of modifier rare-earth oxides, which opens a new door in glass science.", "date": "2024-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To transduce the chemical interaction with the analyte into an optical signal, the interplay between surface chemistry and nanomaterial photophysics has to be optimized. Understanding these aspects promises major opportunities for tailored sensors with optimal performance.

However, only few inorganic photovoltaic materials have such quality, and the underlying chemical properties that enable it are unknown, which poses a significant limit to our ability to study and discover new self-healing semiconductors. Recently, we have found antimony trichalcogenide (Sb2Se3, Sb2S3) and chalcohalides (e.g., SbSeI) can undergo a reversible photo-induced phase transition (PIPT) in which the structure is restored after photo-induced damage is incurred to the materials. This group of materials offer a unique opportunity for studying PIPT and its limits. In particular, this group of materials facilitates the study of functional permutation to specific crystalline sites, and to finding the limits of PIPT occurrence, which sheds light on the origin of the PIPT and self-recovery of this class of materials. We found that PIPT magnitude decays upon gradual BiSb(1) substitution in a Sb2-xBixSe3 homologous series, until nearly one in five Sb ions is substituted with Bi. Then, PIPT diminishes completely. The homologous series occurs along a transition from a covalent to metavalent chemical bonding. By expanding our search, we find a correlation between bonding type and photoreactivity does exist but is an insufficient condition. Instead we suggest that sufficient bonding states at the bottom of the conduction band are also required.

A rigorous theoretical treatment of such systems requires handling matter and photon degrees of freedom on an equal quantum mechanical footing. In the regime of molecular electronic strong or ultra-strong coupling to one or a few molecules, it is desirable to treat the molecular electronic degrees of freedom using the tools of ab initio quantum chemistry, yielding an approach referred to as ab initio cavity quantum electrodynamics (ai-QED), where the photon degrees of freedom are treated at the level of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We analyze two complementary approaches to ai-QED: (1) a parameterized ai-QED, a two-step approach where the matter degrees of freedom are computed using existing electronic structure theories, enabling the construction of rigorous ai-QED Hamiltonians in a basis of many-electron eigenstates, and (2) self-consistent ai-QED, a one-step approach where electronic structure methods are generalized to include coupling between electronic and photon degrees of freedom. Although these approaches are equivalent in their exact limits, we identify a disparity between the projection of the two-body dipole self-energy operator that appears in the parameterized approach and its exact counterpart in the self-consistent approach. We provide a theoretical argument that this disparity resolves only under the limit of a complete orbital basis and a complete many-electron basis for the projection.  We present numerical results highlighting this disparity and its resolution in a particularly simple molecular system of helium hydride cation, where it is possible to approach these two complete basis limits simultaneously. In this same helium hydride system, we examine and compare the practical issue of computational cost required to converge each approach towards the complete orbital and many-electron bases limit.  Finally, we assess the aspect of photonic convergence for polar and charged species, finding comparable behavior between parameterized and self-consistent approaches.", "date": "2024-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Optics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we present a microstructure-sensitive chemo-mechanical model to study the impact of grain-level chemo-mechanics on the degradation of composite cathodes. We reveal that crystalline anisotropy, state-of-charge-dependent Li diffusion rates, and lattice dimension changes drive dislocation formation in cathodes and contact loss at the cathode/electrolyte interface. These dislocations induce large lattice strain and trigger oxygen loss and structural degradation preferentially near the surface area of cathode particles. Moreover, contact loss is caused by the micromechanics resulting from the crystalline anisotropy of cathodes and the mechanical properties of solid electrolytes, not just operating conditions.

In this work, we show that CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices undergo a reversible order-disorder transition upon cooling to 90 K. The transition consists of the loss of structural coherence, i.e. increased nanocrystal misalignment, and contraction of the superlattices, as revealed by temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction, and is ascribed to the solidification of ligands (on the basis of Raman spectroscopy). Introducing shorter amines on the nanocrystal surface allows to mitigate these changes, improve order, and shorten interparticle distance. We demonstrate that the low temperature phase of the short ligand-capped nanocrystal superlattices is characterized by a strong exciton migration observable in the photoluminescence decay, which is due to the shrinkage of the inter-nanocrystal distance.", "date": "2024-07-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Self-Assembly; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Isolated borate units (monomers, dimers, and trimers) terminated with non-bridging oxygen were found in the structures. Polymer units containing four or more boron atoms were identified with and without three-membered boron rings (Bring). Increasing the proportion of La2O3 in La2O3-B2O3 glasses resulted in an increased number of isolated units, indicating that La3+ acts as a network modifier, breaking the borate glass network. The formation of these units via the melt-quenching process was detected by labeling boron species at each AIMD step from $1500$ to 300 K. Representation with transition matrices clarified the specific reaction routes leading to the formation of isolated boron units in solid glass.

Such compounds are mostly discovered experimentally, for example, by multi-stage screening campaigns or target profiling. However, multi-target compounds are also topical in drug design. In medicinal chemistry, design of compounds with desired activity against two targets is typically attempted by pharmacophore fusion. In addition, machine learning models can be constructed for multi-task (target) prediction or virtually screening of compound libraries against arrays of single-target classifiers (computational target profiling). Furthermore, multi-target compounds can also be predicted by deep generative modeling. However, compared to pharmacophore approaches and classification models, generative design of multi-target compounds is still in its very early stages. Herein, we introduce transformer-based chemical language model variants for the design of dual-target compounds. Alternative models were pre-trained by learning mappings of single- to dual-target compounds of increasing similarity. Then, different models were optimized for generating compounds with defined activity against pairs of functionally unrelated targets using a new technique termed cross fine-tuning, applying compound similarity constraints corresponding to pre-training. Control models were devised to confirm that pre-trained and fine-tuned models indeed charted chemical space of dual-target compounds.

The mechanism is a selective reversal of the unwanted redox reaction during periods of opposite polarity, reflected in the final reaction outcome as a time-averaged effect. In the ideal scenario of all redox reactions being reversible, square AC waveform biases the outcome towards more overoxidation/overreduction, whereas sine AC waveform exhibits the opposite effect.

The redox Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases - LPMOs, a key enzyme for cellulose degradation, had been shown to benefit from photobiocatalysis settings thanks to the in-situ photocatalytic reduction of O2 into H2O2, a co-substrate of the enzyme and perhaps through a faster reduction of its catalytically active metal Cu-II to Cu-I. Despite the successful photoactivation of LPMO, a clear gain in saccharification yield during enzymatic hydrolysis of industrial-relevant lignocellulosic substrate was never achieved. The previous attempts had seen the use of externally added photosensitizers i.e. chlorophyllin or melanin, or settings where the lignin already present in the biomass was exploited as photosensitizer, in both cases undergoing an uncontrolled photocatalytic production of the H2O2. Eventually, it appears that the choice of the lignocellulosic pretreatment technology - PT, the ratio between glycoside hydrolases - GHs and LPMO in the enzymatic cocktail, and the light irradiation could all be key to set a yield-gaining light-driven biorefinery. In this work, we successfully found that the reductive catalytic fractionation \u2013 RCF, a lignin-first PT, is suitable to fractionate birchwood lignin so to provide lignin-oil, and a remaining lignocellulose consisting of a photoactivable lignin and highly digestible cellulose. Up to 20% yield gain was obtained when conducting the enzymatic hydrolysis under intermitted light irradiation using a lab-made cocktail containing GHs and LPMOs.

In this work, a simple multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry method based on dissociation mechanisms was developed for the de novo determination of fucose linkages in N-glycans. Using collision induced dissociation (CID), fucose linkages in intact N-glycans (i.e., without permethylation, reduction, or other derivatization) extracted from pine nuts and human milk were identified. We demonstrate that fucose linkages in N-glycans, including the 1-3 linkage in the core of N-glycans, the 1-6 linkage in the core of N-glycans, the linkage in the (13) antenna of biantennary N-glycans, and the linkage in the (16) antenna of biantennary N-glycans, were identified through CID spectra. The procedure does not require the N-glycan standards, and the entire structural determination process is summarized in a flowchart for automation.

Despite its popularity, Bpin is not without drawbacks as it is intrinsically reversible in the presence of water or alcohols, which may cause issues of premature release leading to losses during reactions and purification. This reversibility complicates the hydrolytic regeneration of free boronic acids, which often requires additional steps to destroy the pinacol by-product.

Due to the noisy nature of currently available quantum hardware, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have emerged as a reliable option for near-term simulations. Mixed quantum-classical dynamics methods effectively capture nonadiabatic effects by integrating classical nuclear dynamics with quantum chemical computations of the electronic properties. However, these methods face challenges due to the high computational cost of the quantum chemistry part. To mitigate the computational demand, we propose a method where the required electronic properties are computed through a hybrid quantum-classical approach on combination of classical and quantum hardware. This framework employs the variational quantum eigensolver and variational quantum deflation algorithms to obtain ground and excited state energies, gradients, nonadiabatic coupling vectors, and transition dipole moments. These quantities are used to propagate the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics using the Tully\u2019s fewest switches surface hopping method, although the implementation is also compatible with other molecular dynamics approaches. The approach, implemented by integrating the molecular dynamics program package SHARC with the TEQUILA quantum computing framework, is validated by studying the cis-trans photoisomerization of methanimine and the electronic relaxation of ethylene.

Herein, we develop a methodology for imaging variations in the rate of thermochemical redox catalysis using electrochemical microscopy. Using Pt-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of formic acid oxidation as a test reaction, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) imaging reveals grain-dependent variations in catalytic rate for the underlying oxygen reduction and formic acid oxidation half-reactions, implying inter-grain cooperativity during ensemble thermochemical catalysis via lateral current flows that galvanically couple disparate active sites. Tafel analysis of current-potential profiles in the presence of both reactants reveals the nature of cross-talk between the two half-reactions and provides quantitative spatially-resolved images of catalytic rates for the net thermochemical reaction.

The water monomers, treated as rigid, have their centers of mass (cm's) at the corners of an equilateral triangle, and the intermonomer cm-to-cm distance is set to a value slightly larger than that in the equilibrium geometry of the trimer. The remaining nine strongly coupled large-amplitude bending (angular) degrees of freedom (DOFs) enter the 9D bend Hamiltonian of the three coupled 3D rigid-water hindered rotors. Its 9D eigenstates encompass excited librational vibrations of the trimer, as well as their torsional and bifurcation tunneling splittings which have been the subject of much interest. For this reason, the calculation of these eigenstates by diagonalizing the 9D bend Hamiltonian represents the most rigorous high-dimensional quantum treatment to date of the intermolecular vibrational states of the water trimer and its excited-state tunneling splittings. Such calculations are extremely demanding, and a sophisticated computational scheme is developed that exploits the molecular symmetry group of the water trimer, G48, in order to make them feasible in a reasonable amount of time. The spectrum of the low-frequency vibrations of the water trimer simulated using the eigenstates of the 9D bend Hamiltonian agrees remarkably well with the experimentally observed far-infrared (FIR) spectrum of the trimer in helium nanodroplets over the entire frequency range of the measurements from 70 to 620 cm\u22121. This shows that most peaks in the experimental FIR spectrum are associated with the intermolecular bending vibrations of the trimer.

Ther-modynamics of H-atom transfer has a complex dependence on the synthetic protocol and chemical history of the elec-trode, the reaction medium, and many others; together, these complications preclude the understanding of the H-atom transfer thermochemistry with atomic-level structural knowledge.

This modification facilitated opposite optical responses towards these neurotransmitters, where DA significantly increased the fluorescence of the defect-induced SWCNTs (D-SWCNTs) six-fold, while serotonin notably decreased it.

Importantly, the divergent optical response between DA and serotonin by D-SWCNTs via the introduction of defects was validated in complex biological environments, such as serum.

While polymers are highly promising, they face challenges with stability, synthesis, erasing temperatures, surface roughness, and elasticity. In this study, we report a low-cost and robust polymer system that allows repeated writing, reading and erasing. The polymer was made by inverse vulcanization, a process that provides polysulfide networks with S-S bonds that can be broken and re-formed repeatedly. This property was leveraged in mechanical indentation to encode information, and thermal S-S metathesis and polymer re-flow to erase the information. Exquisite control of depth was possible for making indents over a range of 1-30 nm. This control of depth allowed encoding information using a ternary method, where the data encoded is not just a function of the presence or absence of an indent, but also the depth of the indent. This ternary coding method\u2014the first reported for mechanical information storage on polymers\u2014increases the data density in comparison to binary coding four-fold.

When synthesized as ceramics or single crystals, these materials do not tolerate large deviations from ideal RE3Al5O12 stoichiometry, and their luminescence properties are typically controlled by dopant selection. Here, we use glass crystallization as a nonequilibrium synthesis route to a new family of highly nonstoichiometric gadolinium aluminate garnet (GAG) phosphor hosts Gd3+xAl5-xO12 with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.60.

The accessible nonstoichiometry range for GAG extends far beyond that of nonstoichiometric YAGs (Y3+xAl5-xO12, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.4), enabled by a broader glass-forming domain in the Gd2O3 \u2013 Al2O3 system. We investigate three model phosphor systems based on nonstoichiometric GAG, and determine the crystallographic distributions of the dopant ions where possible, to evaluate the response of upconversion and photoluminescence to extreme nonstoichiometry. In particular, upconversion from the small rare-earth activator Tm3+ is found to be sensitive to nonstoichiometry in GAG. These results demonstrate that highly nonstoichiometric garnet aluminates are not limited to small rare-earth hosts such as YAG and should be realizable across the full 4f series, highlighting the potential for color tuning of new upconversion phosphors by control of host stoichiometry and opening new opportunities for development of different garnet-based optical and magnetic materials.", "date": "2024-07-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

C, H, O, and N are the elements of life, and yet ribosomes are only capable of forming C\u2013N bonds as amides, C\u2013O bonds as esters, and C\u2013S bonds as thioesters; there is no current strategy to form C\u2013C bonds as ketones embedded in the backbone of ribosomal products. We discovered that peptides containing a dehydrolactic acid motif rapidly isomerize to generate a backbone-embedded \u03b1,\u03b3-diketoamide via a spontaneous formal O to C acyl shift. The dehydrolactic acid motif can be introduced into peptides ribosomally or via solid-phase synthesis using \u03b1-hydroxy phenylselenocysteine followed by oxidation. Subsequent incubation at physiological pH produces an \u03b1,\u03b3-diketoamide that can be diversified using a variety of nucleophiles, including hydrazines and hydroxylamines to form pyrazoles and oximes, respectively. All of these groups remain embedded directly within the polypeptide backbone. This general strategy, predicated on an intricate cascade of acyl rearrangements, provides the first example of a C\u2013C bond forming reaction to take place within the peptide backbone, as well as the first ribosomal strategy for generating protein-like materials with diverse, backbone-embedded heterocycles.

ML can effectively utilize vast datasets to build and train complex models, enabling prediction and simulation. In this study, we conducted a performance comparison of deep potential for molecular dynamics (DeePMD), recursively embedded atom neural network (REANN), and neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP) based on the Transition1x dataset. The most efficient model, NequIP, was selected for further analysis.

The results demonstrate that the success ratio of NequIP combined with the NEB method can reach 96.6%, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.32 kcal/mol for barrier prediction. By adding a modest number of data points, NequIP achieves a MAE of 4.01 kcal/mol for barrier prediction in unexplored chemical reaction space.

The more recent shift to a spacing of 3 mm, and even 1.8 mm has delivered a further step change in the separation of gangue minerals from dense minerals. In this new work, we have introduced changes to the lower fluidised bed, removing the fluidisation distributor and installing a slow-moving rake with water addition. This change produced a much more robust fluidisation boundary condition, removing the vagaries of the minimum fluidisation condition, producing a stronger dense medium effect, hence significant step change in gravity separation performance well beyond anything that was previously possible.

This strategy can be readily applied to the rapid and efficient identification of multivalent glycoclusters by introducing a protein into the equilibrating library for the selection of the fittest glycocluster for this protein. 1,4-Dithiophenols conjugated to monosaccharides were equilibrated into dynamic combinatorial libraries providing a diverse mixture of glycoclusters.

The computed spin\u2013state energetics are highly variable with the choice of method and credible reference data are scarce, making it difficult to conduct conclusive computational studies of open-shell TM systems. Here, we present a novel benchmark set of first-row TM spin\u2013state energetics, which is derived from curated experimental data of 17 representative complexes containing Fe(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Co(III), Mn(II), and Ni(II) with chemically diverse ligands. The reference values of adiabatic or vertical energy differences are derived from spin-crossover enthalpies (9 complexes) or energies of spin-forbidden absorption bands in reflectance spectra (8 complexes). These are carefully back-corrected for relevant vibrational and environmental effects (due to solvation or crystal lattice) in order to provide the reference values directly comparable with computed electronic energy differences. The new benchmark set makes it possible to assess the accuracy of spin\u2013state energetics from approximate density functional theory (DFT) and wave function methods with a level of statistical reliability not attained in earlier studies. The lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.5 kcal/mol and maximum error of \u22123.5 kcal/mol are found for the coupled-cluster CCSD(T) method, which outperforms all tested multireference methods: CASPT2, MRCI+Q, CASPT2/CC and CASPT2+\u03b4MRCI.

In the textbook description of oxidative addition reactions, charge flow predominately occurs from the metal centre to the substrate, leading to a net increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal; this occurs with simultaneous bond breaking at the substate. The majority of known reactions, however, involve substrates bearing relatively electronegative elements (e.g. H, C, N, O, halogen) and there has been little discussion of how addition processes may fundamentally change if substrates were constructed from more electropositive elements. Here we show that the zinc\u2013zinc bonded complex, Cp*ZnZnCp*, which is isoelectronic with dihydrogen, undergoes facile addition to the metal (or semi-metal) centres of a series of main group carbene analogues based on aluminium, gallium, or silicon.

One of the key properties that has been studied is the band gap. This work systematically benchmarks several widely used density functional theory (DFT) functionals as well as the impact of spin-orbit coupling on band gap predictions for 115 experimentally reported LD-OMHHs. Surprisingly, it was found that the band gap predicted by GGA aligns similarly or better with experimentally measured values compared with two meta-GGA methods. Moreover, the inclusion of spin-orbital coupling has limited influence on band gap prediction. Such behavior can be understood by the potential existence of large excitonic effects in LD-OMHHs, which deviate computed fundamental gap from high-level DFT theory from experimental optical bandgap.

Employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO), our research addresses the challenge of accurately representing the environmental effects on POMs, particularly the influence of counter-cations and solvent molecules. A critical finding of this work is the demonstration that traditional models, like COSMO, often fail to capture the physical distancing effects of solvents, leading to an overestimation of the proximity of counter-cations to POM anions and resulting in over-stabilized frontier orbital energies. By implementing geometry constraints on lithium cations, we achieve a more realistic depiction of POM-cation interactions in solution, enhancing model accuracy. Additionally, our results suggest that explicit counter-cation inclusion is essential for accurate simulations pertinent to POM applications in electronic devices, though it can be computationally intensive in solution environments.

To date, computational studies that explicitly compare the dry and solvated photoelectrode energetics at finite temperature and the impact of photoelectrode surface composition, including the presence of surface defects, are lacking. In this study, we used first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the solvation and thermal effects on the energetics of the BiVO4 (010) surface with different surface compositions and oxygen vacancies, a common defect responsible for the intrinsic n-type behavior of BiVO4.

Ice nucleation rates can be studied in laboratory assays that gradually lower the temperature of pure water droplets.  These experiments can be performed with different cooling rates, different droplet sizes, and often with a distribution of droplet sizes.  We combine nucleation theory, survival probability analysis, and published data on the fraction of frozen droplets as a function of temperature to understand how cooling rate, droplet size, and size dispersity influence the nucleation rates.  The framework, implemented in the Python code AINTBAD, provides a temperature dependent nucleation rate on a per volume basis, in terms of approximately temperature-independent prefactor (A) and barrier (B) parameters.  We find that less than an order of magnitude dispersion in droplet diameters, if not properly included in the analysis, can cause apparent nucleation barriers to be underestimated by 50\\%.  This result highlights the importance of droplet size-dispersion in efforts to model  glaciation in the polydisperse droplets of clouds.  We also developed a theoretical framework, implemented in the Python code IPA, to predict the fraction of frozen droplets at each temperature for arbitrary droplet size dispersions and cooling rates.

This study involved reassessing the standard reference thermodynamic data for Si and Al aqueous species and relevant solids (quartz, gibbsite, boehmite) and producing a new consistent set of polythermal Pitzer interaction parameters for Si and Al species within the oceanic salt system Al\u2013Si\u2013Ca\u2013Mg\u2013Na\u2013K\u2013Cl\u2013SO4\u2013CO3\u2013H2O. Experimental data done for a range of compositions and temperatures were used optimize the interaction parameters and their temperature coefficients. In the absence of data, estimation methods using analogous species or correlations with the SIT aqueous activity model parameters were applied. For Si in acidic to neutral pH regions, interaction parameters for Si(OH)4(aq) were determined from extensive binary and ternary experimental data. The formation constant for the first silicic acid hydrolysis and its temperature dependence were assessed, while the second hydrolysis species required estimation methods due to limited data. Interaction parameters with K+ were estimated, and the effect of Ca and Mg at high pH was accounted for using complexes between Si and alkaline earth metals.  At high Si concentrations, polymeric species impact aqueous Si speciation. Due to limited data, selecting the silica tetramer (Si4O8(OH)44\u2013) and its binary IPs sufficed to reproduce amorphous Si solubility data in NaCl solutions. For Al, standard thermodynamic properties of ions, hydrolyzed species, and hydroxide phases were derived using gibbsite solubility measurements. No temperature coefficients were required for interactions in the Al\u2013Cl\u2013H2O system, yielding similar results in ternary and quaternary systems. Complexes between aluminum and sulfate were accounted for by the \u03b2(2) interaction parameter. At intermediate pH, few measurements exist to derive IPs for hydrolyzed aluminum species, with only Cl\u2013 interactions derived. Al(OH)3(aq) IPs were assumed similar to Si(OH)4(aq). At high pH, extensive gibbsite solubility data enabled consistent IPs for the Na\u2013K\u2013Cl\u2013OH\u2013Al(OH)4 system. Potential IPs with Ca2+ and Mg2+ were not selected due to precipitation of hydrates in cementitious systems and the use complexes instead. Ternary IPs with SO42\u2013 and CO32\u2013 were estimated using OH\u2013 as an analog for Al(OH)4\u2013. This provided satisfactory predictions from gibbsite solubility measurements in Na2CO3 and Na2SO4 solutions. No significant Si and Al interactions were expected in high pH cement system due to the low Si concentration maintained by cement phases like C\u2013S\u2013H or M\u2013S\u2013H precipitation. The updated Pitzer model for Si and Al aqueous speciation was compared with independent data on cement hydrate phases and solutions in moderate concentrations up to 85 \u00b0C, showing good performance.

The well-defined chemical structures of these crystalline porous electrodes facilitate structure-performance studies, however there is a fundamental lack in the molecular-level understanding of charge storage mechanisms in conductive layered MOFs. To address this, we employ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study ion adsorption in nickel 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene, Ni3(HITP)2. In this system, we find that separate resonances can be observed for the MOF\u2019s in-pore and ex-pore ions.

Quantification of the electrolyte environments by NMR was also found to provide a proxy for electrochemical performance, which could facilitate the rapid screening of synthesised MOF samples. Finally, the charge storage mechanism was explored using a combination of ex-situ NMR and operando electrochemical quartz-crystal microbalance (EQCM) experiments. These measurements revealed that cations are the dominant contributor to charge storage in Ni3(HITP)2, with anions contributing only a minor contribution to the charge storage.

The simulations successfully capture the structural transition from low to high symmetry phases with rising temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. The phase transition initiates at two critical interfaces: the first is between the inorganic and organic layers, where the melting of N-H bonds in BA leads to significant reduction in hydrogen bonding between BA and iodides, and the second is at the interface between top and bottom organic layers, where the melting of the tail bonds in BA triggers the phase transition. Following this, BA cations exhibit a patterned and synchronized motion reminiscent of a conical pendulum, displaying a mix of ordered and disordered behaviors, prior to evolving into a completely molten and disordered state. While the melting of BA cations is the primary driver of the phase transition, the rotational dynamics of MA cations also plays a critical role in determining the phase transition temperature, influenced by the BA-MA interaction. Such interaction alters the polarization patterns of MA cations across the phase transition. In particular, an anti-parallel polarization pattern is observed in low temperature phase. Additionally, displacive elements of the phase transition are identified in the simulations, characterized by the shear and distortion of the inorganic octahedra. Notably, at lower temperatures, the octahedral distortion follows a bimodal distribution, reflecting significant variations in distortion among octahedra. This variation is attributed to an anisotropic hydrogen bonding network between iodides and BA cations.

However, it is still at emerging state to combine chemical knowledge and data-driven methods to make practical predictions for regioselectivity. At the same time, metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have profoundly transformed medicinal chemistry, and thus become one of the most frequently encountered types of reactions in synthesis planning.

Integrating both first principle methods and data-driven methods, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96.51% on the test set of eight typical metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction types, including Suzuki-Miyaura, Stille, Sonogashira, Buchwald-Hartwig, Hiyama, Kumada, Negishi, and Heck reactions, outperforming other commonly used model types. To integrate electronic effects with steric effects in regioselectivity prediction, we propose a quantitative method to measure the steric hindrance effect. Our steric hindrance checker can successfully identify regioselectivity induced solely by steric hindrance. Notably under practical scenarios, our model outperforms 6 experimental organic chemists with an average working experience of over 10 years in the organic synthesis industry in terms of predicting major products in regioselective cases. We have also exemplified the practical usage of our model by fixing routes designed by open-access synthesis planning software and improving reactions by identifying low-cost starting materials. To assist general chemists in making prompt decisions about regioselectivity, we have developed a free web-based AI-empowered tool.

One such enzyme is human nuclear-associated deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase), which has emerged as an interesting drug target in combination therapy with traditional nucleotide analogue treatment of cancer. We report, for the first time, a full structural dynamics study of human dUTPase by NMR. dUTPase has been investigated in terms of structural dynamics in its apo form, in complex with the modified substrate resistant to hydrolysis, 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-a,b-imido-triphosphate (dUpNHpp), as well as the product, 2'-deoxy-uridine-monophosphate (UMP). \nThe apo form of the enzyme displayed slow dynamics in the milli- to microsecond regime in relaxation dispersion experiments, which was further slowed down to observable heterogeneity upon substrate-analogue binding. The results suggest that the non-hydrolysable substrate-analogue traps the enzyme in the conformational isomerization step that has been previously suggested to be part of the enzyme catalysis kinetics cycle. The observed heterogeneity fits well with the pattern expected to emerge from the suggested kinetic model, and no evidence for homotropic allosterism was found.\n\nThe heatmaps of the slow dynamics, chemical shift perturbation upon substrate binding and conserved regions of the enzyme sequence all displayed a similar pattern, which suggests that the structural dynamics is finely tuned and important for the biological function of the enzyme for binding, conformational shift, catalysis and substrate release.

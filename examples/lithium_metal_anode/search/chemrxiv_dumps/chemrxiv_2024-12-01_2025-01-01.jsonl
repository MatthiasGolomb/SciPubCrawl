By fully automating these three process steps for seven different materials from five representative, completely different classes of nano and advanced materials (metal, metal oxide, silica, metal organic framework, and core-shell particles) that follow different reaction mechanisms, we demonstrate the great versatility and flexibility of the platform. We further study the reproducibility and particle size distributions of these seven representative materials in depth and show the excellent performance of the platform when synthesizing these material classes.

In PDT, photosensitizers (PSs) are frequently administered directly, without the ability to selectively target cancer cells. In order to address the delivery of a PS to TNBC and enhance cellular uptake, i.e. after surgery, we prepared the Ru-NH2-modified avidin bioconjugate (RuAvi) via Tyr-specific modification using the Mannich reaction. We further assembled RuAvi to the cinnamoyl peptide-F(D)LF(D)LFK-NH2 (FK), that binds to Formyl Peptide Receptor 1, overexpressed in TNBC. Notably, the modified Avi still possesses the ability to efficiently bind biotin for assembly of up to four copies of the FK peptides and the resultant FK4-RuAvi exhibited an IC50 value of 0.36 \u00b1 0.08 microM, which is about 3.5-fold lower than that of RuAvi (1.25 \u00b1 0.09 microM), upon irradiation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. FK4-RuAvi also showed efficient uptake in MDA-MB-231 tumor spheroids and exhibited significant toxicity after irradiation in comparison to the control RuAvi. The presented strategy has the potential to improve the efficacy of targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) to meet the high demand for targeted therapies to treat TNBC, for example as a targeted adjuvant treatment after breast cancer surgery.", "date": "2024-12-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Photosensitizers; Biopolymers; Drug delivery systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our main objective in this work is not to criticize the classical theorya task that has been largely accomplishedbut to present a more general and coherent approach, which perfectly reconciles the thermodynamic and mechanical points of view and makes the interpretation of various configurations clearer. This new perspective can serve as a platform to guide researchers efforts toward more promising results. In the first part of this work, we discuss the theoretical basis of the new formula using common examples.

Bimetallic NiCu catalysts are highly active in hydrogenation reactions. However, published studies do not allow us to conclude whether the addition of Cu to NiCu catalysts produces the same effect in HDO reactions. For this reason, in this work we study the influence of Cu in NiCu catalysts on the HDO of guaiacol. For the study, the acidity of the Al2O3 was modified by impregnating different amounts of SiO2. Results showed that regardless of the support used, monometallic Ni catalysts were the most active and that the addition of Cu promoted the formation of large Cu-rich alloy particles, which are less active, decreasing the apparent initial reaction rate. On the other hand, the modification of the support promoted the deoxygenation reactions, increasing the formation of cyclohexane, even in monometallic Cu catalysts. It was also established that Ni is responsible for directing the reaction route towards the hydrogenation pathway in the bimetallic catalysts, while the Cu monometallic catalysts followed the deoxygenation route.", "date": "2024-12-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Alloys; Catalysts; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We explored the consequences of Li substitution, as well as the challenge of elevating the Na content in the pristine materials through solid-state synthesis. By in situ temperature-resolved x-ray diffraction (XRD) we observed the synthesis process, clearly showing the formation of an intermediate Li2MnO3 structure with increasing Li content. Structurally, honeycomb ordering is observed in all samples, while we show that Li induces the loss of Na+/vacancy ordering hence it leads to more disordered Na positions. Electrochemically, this family of materials exhibits an increasing trend of polarized hysteresis in the first cycle, suggesting the contribution of oxygen redox. We coupled semi-simultaneous operando x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and XRD to appreciate the structural evolution and redox behavior during this process. We verified that Li in the transition metal site eliminates phase transitions at high voltage and modifies the activation of O-redox. As confirmed by our XANES analysis and by Density Functional Theory calculations, the Li-free sample already surprisingly show anionic redox despite the residual availability of Ni-redox, due to the peculiar density of states dominated by Ni-O hybridized states at high state of charge. On the other hand, Li-containing samples have O non-bonding states that lead to increasing O-redox contribution as expected due to the limited Ni content. One composition (Na0.745(6)Li0.164(4)Ni0.238(1)Mn0.599(3)O2) proves to have the lowest proportion of O-redox among all samples, coupled with reduced phase transitions, disordered occupancy of Na sites, and small volume change during cycling (4.8%). This material hence delivers the best balance of cycling stability (\u223c92% after 100 cycles in half cells), capacity (> 100 mAh/g) and rate capability.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced hydrolysis of ceftazidime by E. cloacae Ent385 AmpC \u03b2-lactamase with the deletion using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations. First, we used constant pH molecular dynamics simulations of the \u03b2-lactamase-ceftazidime acyl-enzyme complex to verify the likely protonation states, confirming Tyr150 primarily exists as a tyrosinate. We then used QM/MM (DFTB2/ff14SB) umbrella sampling to calculate reaction free energy barriers (\u0394\u2021G) for the deacylation step of cephalosporin hydrolysis. This reveals that Tyr150 (rather than the substrate) acts as the base. Importantly, the difference in \u0394\u2021G between the canonical E. cloacae AmpC (P99) and the Ent385 variant was in very good agreement with the difference deduced from experimental kinetic data. Detailed analysis of the transition state ensembles, alongside additional simulations, show that the Ala294-Pro295 deletion allows the entrance of an additional water molecule, that helps stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate. Overall, our QM/MM simulations provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons for enhanced ceftazidime breakdown. This can contribute to understand other reported Class C beta-lactamase variants that confer reduced susceptibility to antibiotic treatment.", "date": "2024-12-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Recycling of precious metals is important in terms of re-using the high precious metal content wastes. In this study, pyrogallol-formaldehyde polymer (PGNR) material was synthesized as an adsorbent. The obtained PGNR was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. The adsorption performance of solutions containing gold (III) ions was evaluated under variables such as different pH values, adsorbent amounts, initial concentrations, time and temperature. Data obtained from the experiments were used to perform adsorption isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic calculations. The results indicated that the \"Pseudo Second Order Equation\" provided the best fit for the kinetic data, while the \"Langmuir Equation\" was the most suitable for the isotherm data. The Langmuir isotherm revealed that the monolayer saturation capacity for Au(III) ions on the PGNR polymer was found to be 2456.78 mg/g at a temperature of 328 K. The FTIR analysis conducted after adsorption revealed that polyphenolic groups played a key role in the adsorption of Au(III) species. XRD and XPS characterization studies showed that nearly all of the Au(III) ions were reduced to metallic gold following adsorption. It was found that the PGNR polymer chosen as the adsorbent exhibited a high efficiency in adsorbing Au(III) from the actual leach solution derived from electronic waste. PGNR polymer particles are a potential adsorbent for the selective recovery of gold metal in leach solutions of electronic waste containing high concentrations of base metals.", "date": "2024-12-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Polymerization (Polymers); Physical and Chemical Processes; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To this end, we recently developed the first analytical theory for chemoselectivity prediction in AC electrolysis by considering the diffusion dynamics near the electrode surface. In this follow-up study, we introduce approximations to the aforesaid model that provide valuable new insights to the problem.

This configuration facilitates the formation of hybrid light-matter states, known as polaritons, which enable efficient energy transfer between spatially separated donor and acceptor layers.

Griffith", "abstract": "Careful control over the defect chemistry of crystalline compounds is typically critical to transport phenomena (ion, electron, phonon, etc.). In battery materials, particularly in one-dimensional (1D) ion conductors, even small concentrations of defects in the diffusion pathway can be pernicious. Wadsley\u2013Roth block phases are interesting as 1D ion conductors that possess high (multi-electron) redox capacity and amongst the highest ionic diffusion coefficients of any electrode materials. The origin of their high-rate transport has been heavily studied and attributed, in part, to the existence of parallel one-dimensional long-range diffusion pathways that ions can interchange between with low activation barriers. These parallel channels could impart defect tolerance to this 1D conductor, but no direct evidence for this behavior has been reported. Herein, a new lithium-ion battery negative electrode material, NaNb7O18, is described that exhibits extreme defect tolerance. Multimodal characterization combining neutron diffraction, 23Na solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveals that more than half of the Na+ in NaNb7O18 is in diffusion-tunnel-blocking cuboctahedral environments (similar to the perovskite A-site) within Wadsley\u2013Roth-like blocks of octahedra. Despite the high point defect concentration, NaNb7O18 can reversibly lithiate to Li7NaNb7O18 and cycle 200 mAh g\u20131. There is still 100 mAh g\u20131 accessible capacity in 3 mins in large 4\u201323 \u00b5m (D10\u2013D90) particles. Operando synchrotron diffraction shows an asymmetric lithiation/delithiation process with two first-order phase transitions including one with nearly zero volume change. LixNaNb7O18 also exhibits evidence for reversible Nb\u2013Nb bond formation. From the same operando diffraction measurements, the Nb\u2013Nb distances of niobium atoms in edge-sharing octahedra at the block peripheries vary from ca. 3.4 \u00c5 to 2.8 \u00c5 back to 3.4 \u00c5 over one lithium insertion/extraction cycle, which is in quantitative agreement with the Nb\u2013Nb bond formation charge storage mechanism recently proposed from the computational lithiation of several different Wadsley\u2013Roth compounds. Experimental determination of the defect chemistry of NaNb7O18 and its (i) tolerance to tunnel-blocking defects, (ii) two-phase structure evolution, and (iii) reversible Nb\u2013Nb bond formation during intercalation are presented.

Naturally evolved proteins exhibit unique, sequence-defined functions and self-assembly behavior. Some microbial protein filaments are electronically conductive, evolved to support access to remote electron acceptors outside the cell, which serve as a design platform for bioelectronic materials with applications in biosensors and enzymatic electrocatalysis. Recapitulating their self-assembly and conductive behavior, however, is challenging in de novo proteins. Peptides, on the other hand, represent a more well-defined and rationally designable space with the potential for sequence-programmable, stimuli responsive design for structure and function, making them ideal building blocks of bioelectronic interfaces. In this work, we design peptides that exhibit stimuli-responsive self-assembly and the capacity to transport electrical current over micrometer long distances. A lysine-lysine (KK) motif inserted at solvent exposed positions of a coiled coil forming peptide sequence introduces pH dependent control over a transition from random coil to \u03b1-helical peptide structure.

Understanding the intricate dynamics between the two ionic species can aid the rational design of RTIL as electrolytes facilitating electron- or proton-transfer reactions useful for energy applications. Here, we investigate the temperature dependency of the intermolecular interactions via magnetization transfer between oppositely charged ions by means of 1H-19F heteronuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (HOESY) for two ionic liquids, namely [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6]. We find that cross-relaxation rates vary significantly over a rather small temperature range, crossing the null point and changing sign. Other NMR observables such as chemical shifts, scalar couplings or auto-relaxation rates are less affected by temperature, making intermolecular Overhauser transfer a sensitive tool to study the dynamics and especially intermolecular interactions in RTILs. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on neat RTILs systems were performed to identify the origin of the observed behavior. Good agreement between simulated and experimental cross-relaxation rates was found at different temperatures. On this basis, we could attribute the observed temperature behavior to the modulation of dynamic properties rather than coordination changes of RTILs.

We confirm charge transfer pathways consistent with previous experiments within our 2 ps timescale, and note that the directionality of the electron transfer stems primarily from the nucleic acid type. Additionally, we find that the functionalization point on specific nucleobases, along with key dihedral angles and orbital overlap, directly influences the probability of charge transfer and thus the final SFN fluorescence properties.

To precisely investigate the impact of structural variations on their properties, the most rational approach involves controlling the stacking of molecules with diverse substituents in an identical geometric configuration. However, this idealized scenario encounters formidable obstacles in practical synthesis.  Thus, a central question revolves around the feasibility of discovering novel non-covalent or non-coordinated interactions that possess fixed connection modes, maintaining the directional assembly of molecules into identical geometric configurations. Inspired by the traditional wooden mortise and tenon structure, which combines the features of directional precision allowing for intricate wooden pieces to intertwine seamlessly and forming connections that endure rigorous use, we report the first series of crystalline and stable molecular frameworks entirely constructed by mortise-and-tenon joints (MTF-1, MTF-2, and MTF-3). Despite functional group diversity, the supramolecular assembly of MTFs remains unchanged, demonstrating their robust capability for directed assembly.  A surprising revelation emerged: the ethyl groups imparted a more intricate and intriguing mortise-and-tenon joint to MTF-3. Since the ethyl groups are not coplanar with the benzene groups, they effectively introduce additional \"tenons\" to MTF-3. Consequently, the ethyl groups on type II mortise-and-tenon joints act as \"locking pins\", preventing the easy disengagement of type I mortise-and-tenon joints. This intricate structure endows MTF-3 with a fascinating Luban lock-like construction and exceptional mechanical stiffness. Additionally, ethyl groups in MTF-3 enhance intermolecular interactions, facilitating the separation and transport of photogenerated charge carriers. Ultimately, MTF-3 demonstrates superior photocatalytic H2O2 activity compared to its counterpart, MTF-2 and MTF-1.

However, due to the high reactivity of these species, the reactions are usually done under an inert atmosphere at low temperature. Recent work has demonstrated the possibility to carry out these procedures safely on the benchtop, in air at room temperature using deep eutectic solvents (DES) to dissolve the organic substrate. Surprisingly the organometallic reagent, added in an organic solution, is compatible with these unconventional conditions, and instead of undergoing fast decomposition by the DES, better yields and selectivities are observed than when working under standard conditions. Earlier it was posited that the choline chloride component of the DES might chemically activate the ketone substrate making it more amenable to reaction. Here we probe this hypothesis with experiments; liquid diffraction, neutron reflectometry, NMR and interfacial tension measurements for acetophenone in DES and with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We show instead that the role of the choline chloride is to reduce the solubility of the ketone, forcing it to accumulate at the air-solvent (or organic solvent/DES) interface. Molecular dynamics simulations for isopropyl magnesium chloride in the same DES/tetrahydrofuran bi-phase system also indicate a preference to localize at the interface. These results suggest that surface accumulation promotes the addition reaction and account for these remarkable experimental conditions.

However, achieving and manipulating levitation at the microscopic level poses significant challenges, including the non-ideal behavior of microscopic particles, maintaining long-term stability, and precise control of particle motion. This paper introduces an innovative strategy that utilizes the spontaneous electrostatic equilibrium established between ionic charges and polar molecules in solution within confined spaces to create a stable microscopic levitation state over a broad temperature range. This novel state of matter transcends traditional classifications of solid, liquid, and gas, with a density between that of a solid and a gas, and exhibits unique structural features. Through the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations, we have discovered, for the first time, a levitated water form with a density nearly a thousand times that of water vapor, existing in a suspended state with charged ions at room or near-room temperatures. In this unique state of matter, chloride ions achieve an electrical mobility equivalent to that of hydrogen ions and higher than that of hydroxyl ions due to the unique structure of levitated water. As the temperature further decreases, water molecules arrange orderly into chain-like networks, forming porous, atomically precise charged ice structures. We have also identified levitated clusters with a density over a hundred times that of water vapor and about one-ninth that of a solid. Compared to the aforementioned levitated water, these clusters have a lower density and an increased ion ratio, transforming levitated water into a system composed of isolated ions and molecular clusters. These clusters, in the form of several water molecules combined with charged ions or individual ions, levitate independently in space, filling the confined space with a spacing much larger than that of a solid lattice. Even at temperatures below the freezing point of water, this new state of matter remains unfrozen and retains high electrical mobility similar to hydrogen ions. Furthermore, this paper elucidates the principles of preparing charged solutions and pure single-ion charged solutions, as well as the design of related instrumental systems. Finally, we discuss the observability of microscopic levitation states and their potential applications. In summary, microscopic levitation states offer a promising yet challenging research frontier.

This study investigates the hydrolysis and spontaneous defluorination mechanisms of 2-TFMP, 3-TFMP, 4-TFMP, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP under environmentally relevant aqueous conditions, and under alkaline pH to investigate the mechanism of defluorination. 3-TFMP did not undergo hydrolysis.

High-resolution mass spectrometry identified a benzoyl fluoride intermediate in the hydrolysis of 4-TFMP and other dimer-like transformation products of the 4- and 2-Cl-4-TFMP. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the key defluorination step proceeds via an E1cb mechanism, driven by \u03b2-elimination. Experimental and computational results demonstrated substituent-dependent differences in reactivity, and the importance of the deprotonation of TFMPs for the hydrolysis reaction to proceed.

Triethanolamine-radicals act as electron relays in the efficient two-electron activation of the catalyst, regardless whether a homogeneous or a heterogeneous catalyst is used.

The present study adopts an aqueous photosystem consisting of EDTA, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2\u2019-bipyridine), and MV2+ (MV2+ = methylviologen) at pH = 5. Both catalysts are shown to promote HER in a similar efficiency (TON = 12-13 in 6 h), revealing a minor contribution of the electron-donating methoxy substituents. The catalyst degradation is shown to proceed during the photocatalysis, leading to afford [Co(edta)]\u2212 (EDTA = H4edta) as a dead-end species. The lack of any heterogeneous species was evidenced by DLS (dynamic light scattering). It was also found that nitrate involved as a counter anion in the photocatalysis components substantially inhibits the photocatalytic HER, giving rise to a large diminishment in TON from 12.7 to 7.2.

Although there is almost a systematic use of such chemicals in the literature, a range of surfactant-free, or additive-free, colloidal syntheses have been reported. In those syntheses, the solvent plays the role of source of reducing agents and/or stabilizers.

Here, with the example of gold nanoparticles obtained at room temperature, it is shown that adding commonly reported stabilizers, such as trisodium citrate, PVP, SDS, poly(NIPAM), CTAB, or chemicals such as hydroquinone, actually does not lead to any advantages compared to the surfactant-free colloidal synthesis performed in alkaline mixture of water and 20 v.% ethanol.

All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to evaluate the binding free energy, typically by thermodynamic integration, and to probe binding mechanisms, including the description of protein conformational dynamics. The advantages of MD come at a high computational cost, which limits its use. Such cost could be reduced by using coarse-grained models, but their use is generally associated with an undesirable loss of resolution and accuracy. To address the trade-off between speed and accuracy of MD simulations, we describe the use of the recently introduced multi-eGO atomic model for the estimation of binding free energies.

One of the challenges in this field is increasing the solubility and targeted delivery of hydrophobic drugs. One approach to design nanoparticles for hydrophobic drugs loading is the use of cyclodextrins, which are capable of binding hydrophobic regions of small molecules via host-guest interactions. However, rational design of drug carriers requires studying the interactions between nanoparticles and drugs and assessing the effect of the bound drug on the surface properties of nanoparticles at the molecular level. In this work, we applied molecular dynamics simulations to study the interaction of core\u2013shell micelles functionalized with alpha and beta CDs and a common drug, paclitaxel. Nanoparticle surfaces before and after interaction were analyzed using topographic mapping. It was found, that although paclitaxel molecules are able to partially penetrate into the cavities of both alpha and beta CD and form inclusion complexes, the fraction of molecules bound in this way is small, the majority of drug molecules ends up in cavities and grooves on the surface of the nanoparticles, the walls of which are lined with hydrophobic fragments of the spacer. In addition, paclitaxel molecules often cluster and adsorb on the surface of the hydrophobic core, but do not penetrate into it.

In this work, we focus on determining the properties of the most intense peak in the electronic absorption spectra of organic molecules. For this purpose, we employed the quantum chemistry QM-symex dataset, which has approximately 173,000 organic molecules and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) data of the first ten electronic absorption transitions. Each one is identified by its Cartesian coordinates. From data in the original QM-symex, we built a new dataset named QM-symex-modif that contains molecules in Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) format and properties related to the main electronic transition. We then employed twenty machine learning (ML) algorithms to investigate oscillator strengths, excitation energies, transition orbitals, and the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs). As inputs for the ML algorithms, we used several chemical descriptors for each molecule generated in the RDKit tool employing the corresponding SMILES format. The generated input descriptors significantly improved the accuracy of the ML predictions for these key photophysical properties. Very good mean absolute errors (MAEs) were obtained for the test set composed of 45,056 molecules, namely, an MAE of 0.035 for oscillator strengths, 0.09 eV for excitation energies, 1.24 and 0.62 for the initial and final transition molecular orbital (MO) numbers (i.e., for each molecule, their position in the MO listing) respectively, and 0.014 for HOMO numbers, with R\u00b2 values consistently exceeding 0.94, thus demonstrating the accuracy of the models. Additionally, a Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis was carried out to evaluate the importance of the input parameters for the investigated ML models. We found several interesting relationships involving the input parameters. In particular, molecular weight holds significant importance in our ML models for determining the target HOMO numbers and the transition orbitals.

Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes, affecting over 32 million people globally. Current AD treatments that focus on single-target intervention often fail to significantly slow disease progression and may not be effective for all patients. Given AD's complex nature, a more effective approach may involve targeting multiple pathways simultaneously. METHODS. This study proposes the use of a cycle-consistent adversarial network to design multi-target directed ligands (MTDL-GAN), drugs designed to inhibit two primary AD target enzymes simultaneously. Our targets of interest are acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3), which are known to have significant impacts on the progression and development of AD, each with a different mechanism of action. Inhibitor libraries were curated from ChEMBL27 and further characterized to represent each inhibitor domain, resulting in 69 AChE, 572 BACE1, and 246 GSK3 inhibitors. The MTDL-GAN was trained on these unpaired datasets to generate MTDL-like molecules. During the model training, all generated molecular structures were stored to create in silico MTDL libraries. From each MTDL library, 300 molecules were sampled for further analysis. Tanimoto similarity scores were computed to assess the structural similarity of the generated molecules to the target inhibitor domain, and molecular docking simulations were carried out to validate their \\textit{in silico} binding affinities to the target enzymes. RESULTS. The proposed method effectively transformed molecules from the original inhibitor domains into MTDL-like molecules while maintaining their structural similarity to the original inhibitors. Less than 0.15% of the generated molecules have a Tanimoto similarity score above 0.85 to the known bioactive molecules in ChEMBL27, highlighting their structural novelty and potential for exploring new chemical space. Further investigation revealed that the sampled MTDLs demonstrate promising in silico dual-binding affinity while having favourable physicochemical properties and synthetic tractability. Among these, several MTDLs surpassed the in silico binding affinities of investigational drugs in phase 2/3 clinical trials.

Plasma electrochemistry, which replaces a conventional solid electrode with plasma in electrochemical cells, offers new avenues for chemical synthesis by combining charge transfer with alternative energy transfer processes at the plasma-liquid interface. To understand how plasma electrochemistry differs from conventional electrochemistry, we investigated plasma reactions with acrylonitrile, an industrially relevant molecule used as the precursor in the well-characterized electrosynthesis of adiponitrile. We demonstrate that non-charge transfer processes dominate plasma-driven chemistry through systematic variation of plasma polarity, current, and reactant concentration, combined with comprehensive quantitative analysis of solid, liquid, and gas products. Most notably, we observed no adiponitrile formation (the desired electrochemical product) while total product yields exceeded the theoretical charge-transfer maximum by up to 32-fold. Substantial polyacrylonitrile formation occurred under all conditions, a product not typically seen in conventional electrochemistry. The plasma anode yielded consistently higher products than the plasma cathode, producing hydrogen and propionitrile at 21 and 2 times the charge-transfer maximum, respectively. Electron scavenger experiments confirmed these transformations occurred primarily through non-Faradaic processes rather than charge transfer.

Using commercial Na-LTA, Na-X, and Na-Y zeolites (Si/Al 1.00, 1.26, 2.79, respectively), we evaluated the NH3 equilibrium adsorption up to 15 bar and temperatures of 323, 373, 423, and 473 K.

It is of high priority to find new therapies that target the ESKAPEE group of pathogens and their drug-resistant strains.

This review focuses on case studies that give novel insights about the mechanisms of action, resistance and selectivity of some relevant AMPs, exemplifying the importance of microscopic, computational and experimental tools.

Despite its significance, microbiological measurements are currently difficult to make in-situ and in real time. Evaluation of microbially-mediated soil processes usually involves manual sampling followed by laboratory analysis, which can be costly, time consuming, physically intensive, non-continuous, and reduces capacity for measuring changes at high temporal and spatial resolution, thereby limiting the ability to make prompt informed land management decisions. Low-cost soil sensors manufactured using printing techniques offer a potential scalable solution to these issues, allowing for wide distribution of sensors that collect time-series data for decomposition rates. Here, we tested the use of novel sensors for the evaluation of soil microbial processes. This comprises the first large-scale field deployment of these sensors, which use a biodegradable composite conductor that transduces microbial decomposition of substrates to a change in electrical resistance. Sensors were installed for 50 days across 44 experimental plots of a long-term grassland biodiversity restoration experiment, including treatments with additions of synthetic fertilizer, manure, mixed seed, and red clover, causing significant differences in soil microbial activity. Soil biological properties commonly used as soil health indicators, including microbial biomass and enzymatic activities related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, were measured using standard laboratory methods. Sensor responses were compared to these conventional soil health measures to better understand their potential utility by considering the signals of sensors within a set decomposition window and individual sensor degradation rates across various timescales, and correlating changes in signal variability with soil measured properties. All statistical approaches found positive correlations between the sensor signal and laboratory measurements of microbial biomass carbon and soil organic carbon, and some approaches found correlations with enzymatic measurements. These findings demonstrate the potential for the proxy measurement of soil microbial processes in-situ using readily distributable printed decomposition sensors, thereby supporting their potential for low-cost, high-resolution temporal and spatial monitoring of complex soil biological parameters and their ability to provide new insights into soil health.", "date": "2024-12-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Biodegradable Materials; Environmental Science; Soil Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The influence of a magnetic field on either electrochemical equilibria or electron-transfer kinetics remains controversial, partially due to the difficulty of eliminating the mass-transfer related effects. In this work, a magneto-electrochemical system, which contains a thin-layer flow cell allowing a forced convection flow, is designed to decouple the magnetic effects on mass transfer from those on the reaction kinetics. When OER is catalyzed by magnetic materials, the active species on the surface, rather than the composition and magnetic property of the bulk material, determine the magneto-enhancement of the reaction kinetics. The enhancement at monometallic active sites follow the order Ni3+ < Co3+ < Fe3+, corresponding to the change in kinetic overpotential (\u0394Ek) of 2.7, 18.8, and 42.9 mV at 1 mA\u00b7cm-2, respectively.

Herein, a strategy of lone pairs-mediated multiple through-space interactions is proposed to availably induce RTP. By introducing through-space nn and n interactions by dint of heteroatoms, the lone pairs are delocalized within the structure, causing dense excited-state energy level splitting. Thus, more matched energy levels with small energy gap between singlet and triplet states appear, resulting in multiple ISC transition channels which assist triplet excitons generation. The strong TSIs also effectively rigidify the molecular structures and thus stabilize generated triplet excitons for radiation. Furthermore, the manipulation of TSIs intensity allows efficiency enhancement, lifetime prolongation, and tolerance to high temperature of RTP. This work not only explores the fundamental principle of RTP mechanism from a new view, but also provides a universal strategy for ISC promotion and triple excitons stabilization.", "date": "2024-12-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here, we present a computational investigation of the reported abiotic phosphorylation of ribose and the subsequent formation of ribonucleosides, focusing on acidity and oriented external electric field (OEEF) effects. The most plausible reaction mechanism identified involves the protonation of ribose, followed by carbocation formation and an S$_N$2 substitution step. Without an OEEF, all considered pathways are thermally inaccessible. However, in the presence of a significant OEEF, the S$_N$2-based pathway, leading to the $\\beta$-ribonucleoside isomer, becomes highly stabilized, reducing the energetic span to a thermally accessible 12-13 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, the OEEF-mediated reaction closely mirrors the enzymatic mechanism of phosphorolysis via S$_N$2 substitution, including a pronounced anomeric selectivity.

Here, we synthesized a 2D molybdenum carbonitride of the MXene family, Mo2(C,N)Tx, and applied it as a catalyst for ammonia synthesis and decomposition, the essential reactions to establish NH3 as an energy vector. We determine the thermal stability limit of Mo2(C,N)Tx under H2 flow to be ca. 575 C. Exceeding this temperature results, under H2, in a transformation of the predominantly defunctionalized Mo2(C,N)Tx to a 3D Mo2(C,N) phase, which prevents the complete defunctionalization of Mo2(C,N)Tx while retaining its 2D morphology. Before this phase transformation occurs, the remaining Tx species reside in the interior layers of the mostly defunctionalized Mo2(C,N)Tx nanoplatelets, with the amorphous exterior being free from Tx groups, rendering the Mo2(C,N)Tx nanoplatelets chemically anisotropic in the direction orthogonal to the basal plane. The effect of this structure on catalytic properties is highlighted in the thermocatalytic synthesis and decomposition of NH3. In the latter reaction, Mo2(C,N)Tx shows similar gravimetric rates to a reference bulk \u03b2-\u039c\u03bf2\u039d catalyst, which is ascribed to the presence of too narrow 2D pores (ca. 5.2 \u00c5) with irregular shapes due to a disorder in the stacking of nanosheets in Mo2(C,N)Tx, limiting interlayer diffusion. A deactivation pathway in Mo-based MXenes was identified, and it relates to a precipitation of carbon vacancies to metallic molybdenum under NH3 decomposition conditions. While the ammonia decomposition reaction shows no dependence of the reaction rate on the specific H2 pretreatment of Mo2(C,N)Tx (500 or 575 C), the gravimetric ammonia formation rate increases appreciably with H2 pretreatment, viz., Mo2(C,N)Tx pretreated at 575 C outperforms by ca. four times both the reference \u03b2-\u039c\u03bf2\u039d catalyst and Mo2(C,N)Tx pretreated at 500 C, explained by a smaller molecule size of the reactants H2 and N2 relative to NH3, and an increased accessibility and utilization of the interlayer space for ammonia synthesis.

Structural variations impacted the mechanical behaviour and biological properties, assessed by 2D cultures of fibroblasts, of these hydrogels. Difference in gelation kinetics between the two biomacromolecules under the two processes appeared as a key factor driving the mixed network structuration. This work discloses a new route to obtain dense hydrogels from binary biopolymer systems and offers additional insights on the underlying gelation process.", "date": "2024-12-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One way to endow nanoparticles (NPs) with the designed surface properties is to use excipients that enable appropriate multivalent surface modifications. In this respect, cyclodextrins (CDs) is a versatile building block that can be used to provide NPs various surface modifications as well as drug loading capacity by means of host-guest interactions. On the other hand, structural properties of CD-decorated NPs including localization, orientation, and mobility of individual CDs should be assessed for rational design of DDS and control over its surface properties. In this paper, we used combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular dynamics(MD) to assess these structural and dynamical properties of \u03b1- and \u03b2-CD-decorated core-shell micelles based on NPs topography maps. Micelles self-assemble from function-spacer-lipid (FSL) constructs that are conjugates of CDs, phospholipid DOPE and hydrophylic N-carboxymethyloligoglycine spacer. It was found that most of CD residues lose their functionality because of their clustering and unfavorable orientation, that results in CD cavity becomes inaccessible for binding. Dynamics of NPs surface structure reveals that CDs have low mobility, due to their interactions with oligoglycine spacer that prone to form static shell. Reducing the density of CD and spacer by 5 times prevents clusterization suggesting optimal density of CD residues, but does not affect CDs orientations and mobility. These findings indicate that the functionality of CD residues depends on the type of spacer and CD and their junction, and simple conjugation may not be enough to properly orient CDs on the surface. The combination of oligoglycine spacer with CD can be used as an excipient that turn hydrophobic core into stable multivalent scaffold to which various functional compounds can be attached through guest-host interactions. Obtained insights could be useful in development of CD-based NPs surface modifications towards rational design of smart next generation drug delivery systems.", "date": "2024-12-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Unlike prior approaches that rely on nanomaterials or intricate modifications, our method places the target sequence and hairpins directly on the electrode surface, reducing both cost and preparation time while maintaining efficient signal amplification. Using DNA modified with methylene blue (MB) as a redox mediator, the system generates a \"signal-off\" response by suppressing electron transfer when MB intercalates into the DNA polymers formed by HCR. This approach eliminates the need for complex surface functionalization, enhancing ease of fabrication and consistency.

Experimentally, it is challenging to characterize nanometer-scale electrosprayed droplets; however, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations pose an attractive solution by providing a molecular perspective of protein charging and transfer to the gas-phase during ESI. By resolving approximations used in past MD simulations of ESI, we demonstrate the capability of simulating electrosprayed droplets with experimentally relevant droplet composition and behavior. This is accomplished by modelling proton transfers between all titratable molecules in simulated droplets under atmospheric conditions; thus, enabling simulated droplets containing ammonium acetate that form experimentally observed protonated or deprotonated protein ions upon solvent evaporation. Application of the proposed protocol to several native proteins in positive- and negative-ion mode ESI produces charge-state distributions that are highly correlated to experimental mass spectra. Our simulations suggest that changes in residue basicity during the transition to the gas-phase play a significant role in moderating protein charging during native-ESI and can explain many experimentally observed trends.

Autoxidation proceeds via radical chain reactions involving hydroxyl (\u2022OH), peroxy (RO2\u2022), and alkoxy radicals, which are also prominent oxidants in the atmosphere. Recent reports have provided evidence for an alternative autoxidation mechanism driven instead by -hydroxy peroxy radicals (-OH-RO2\u2022) and Criegee intermediates (CI). This work evaluates the contributions of these two mechanisms in the \u2022OH initiated heterogeneous oxidation of linoleic acid (LA) aerosols. Reaction kinetics and product distributions are monitored using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer. To explain the observed kinetics, a kinetic model is developed that incorporates both the conventional peroxidation and alternative CI-mediated autoxidation mechanisms. We observe that the CI-mediated autoxidation pathways enhance the heterogeneous autoxidation rate, while the peroxidation reactions, although present, contributes less to the overall oxidation rate. Alpha-acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs) are identified as key indicators for bimolecular reactions of CI with LA, highlighting the role of LA as a CI scavenger.

SF-NOCI is a nearly ``black-box'' electronic structure theory developed by Mayhall et al., well-suited for studying charge transfer phenomena. This method allows for core-virtual orbital rotations for all configurations within the active space, efficiently capturing important orbital relaxation effect induced by electron transfer. However, the inclusion of this relaxation effect for all configurations results in a sharp increase in computational cost, especially for large active spaces commonly encountered in transition metal complexes. To address this challenge, we grouped configurations based on the number of electrons associated with each atom. Within each group, configurations share a common set of bath orbitals, significantly reducing the computational burden. We demonstrate the performance of SF-GNOCI through benchmark calculations on two systems: the avoided crossing of the lowest singlet states of LiF dissociation and the low-lying charge transfer states of [Fe(SCH_3)_4]^{2-/1-}. Our results show that SF-GNOCI maintains the accuracy comparable to the standard SF-NOCI while reducing a computational cost by a factor of about 1/10 for [Fe(SCH_3)_4]^{2-} and 1/14 for [Fe(SCH_3)_4]^{1-}.

In particular, the recycling of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is especially challenging. Here, we present an innovative protocol to recycle discarded PVC into a photothermal catalyst for the depolymerization of polyolefins under sunlight. By dechlorinating the PVC, we harness its unique ability to converts sunlight into the energy required to break C-C bonds in polyolefins. This protocol allows for the transformation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP) into waxes enriched with terminal olefins, which can be further utilized for the synthesis of surfactant. Furthermore, this protocol enables the conversion of polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(\u03b1-methyl styrene), styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) into their respective monomers. This broad applicability makes our protocol suitable for the recycling of a wide range of real-life plastic products and their mixtures under ambient environment. Notably, with the aid of just 0.1 wt% catalyst, a successful depolymerization of kilogram-scale PS waste, such as plastic cups, using solar energy has been achieved. Additionally, the catalysts derived from PVC can be reused, thereby enhancing the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the depolymerization of polyolefins.

These studies suggest that presentation of alcohol to mice or rats can alter brain levels of NE and DA, in various subregions. Three previous publications (Fitzgerald 2012, 2020, 2022) have presented the hypothesis that there may be an unidentified pathway in rodents, and other organisms, that actually transforms ethanol to NE or DA. Here, this paper investigates the hypothesis in male CD-1 mice. Experimental mice were systemically injected with an intoxicating dose of stable isotope-labeled carbon 13 (C13) ethanol (ethanol-1-13C, 20% v/v, 1.5 g/kg, i.p.), and brain samples (hippocampus and brainstem) were collected two hours post-injection. Two other groups of mice received normal unlabeled carbon 12 (C12) ethanol or a water (Control) injection, respectively. Although we had difficulty detecting the two neurotransmitters (especially C13 NE) due to their very low concentrations, high resolution mass spectrometry analysis suggests that C12 ethanol selectively boosted hippocampal C12 NE, and C13 ethanol likewise boosted hippocampal C13 NE. We did not observe effects on DA. These data provide preliminary information on whether there is a novel biosynthetic pathway in mice that converts alcohol to catecholamines in select brain regions, where the ethanol molecule would presumably lead to formation of the ethanolamine side chain of NE. There are, however, alternative interpretations of these findings, including that acute alcohol administration modulates catecholamine release, reuptake, metabolism, or canonical biosynthesis.", "date": "2024-12-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Given the chemical diversity of lipids, it is important to understand the relationship between lipid composition and interfacial H-bond dynamics. Here we investigate the role of palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM) in modulating interfacial H-bond networks in binary mixtures with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) using a combination of ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find that analysis of 2D IR spectra of the amide carbonyl is subtle, requiring a careful accounting of the heterogeneous H-bond environment of the amide. The amide groups in PSM, acting as H-bond donors, partially replace water-mediated interactions at lipid carbonyls, with the number of lipid-lipid H-bonds constituting up to 20% of the total. These interactions create comparatively stable hydrogen-bond networks that significantly slow interfacial dynamics. The comparison between experiments and simulations reveals composition-dependent H-bond ensembles for ester and amide carbonyls, with increased H-bond populations and slower dynamics with higher PSM concentrations.  2D IR spectra show that interfacial H-bond dynamics slow by up to 45% in an equimolar mixture of the two lipids compared to DPPC alone. This study highlights PSM's dual role in H-bonding, which increases membrane viscosity and stabilizes lipid interfaces, providing molecular insights into the role of sphingolipids in cell membranes.

Typically, these features and phenomena are experimentally probed by stationary and time-resolved vibrational spectra, exhibiting characteristic differences between the various adsorption modes and phases. To gain atom- and time-resolved insight into vibrational response of CO molecules on NaCl(100), vibrational density of states (VDOS), Infrared (IR) and Vibrational Sum Frequency (VSF) spectra are computed from Velocity Velocity Correlation Functions (VVCFs) by Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) for various coverages, temperatures and phases.

Corollary, the title structure can be viewed as an intergrowth of two imaginary quaternary phases (1A) \u201cBa3Zn1\u2013yIn1+yBi4\u201d and (1B) \u201cBa5Zn1\u2013zIn2+zBi6\u201d (with x = y+z). The polyanionic system in the 1A block, [Zn1\u2013yIn1+yBi4]6\u2013 consists of dimeric pentagonal rings that are stacked to form double pentagonal tubes running in the b-direction, and filled with Ba cations. The polyanion in the 1B block, [Zn1\u2013zIn2+zBi6]6\u2013 consists of large ribbons formed by the condensation of two strands of dimeric corner sharing infinite chains of [InBi4] tetrahedra with one chain of edge-sharing [ZnBi4] tetrahedra. The Zn/In atomic site preferences appeared to be one decisive factor behind the structural complexity and, it seems to be directed mainly by the atomic valence states and sizes, as well as the electrostatic factors, aiming to optimize the lattice reticular energy, as confirmed by total energy calculations on three ordered models using DFT methods. According to the Zintl-Klemm concept (ZKC) and the 8\u2013N rules, the compound should be charge balanced for x = 0. Therefore, the experimentally observed phase width (x = 0.21 to 0.47) indicates that the system is amenable for substantial (n- or p-type) doping, to fine tune their transport properties, like the charge carrier concentration and charge mobility, via specific chemical substitutions at specific sites of the two polyanionic blocks. The DFT electronic band structure calculations on the hypothetical fully ordered model \u2018Ba8Zn2In3Bi10\u2019 (x = 0), also predicted the title compound to be a semiconductor with narrow band gap. Therefore, the title phase fully qualified as a promising thermoelectric material candidate.

Finely tuned proton delivery to and from the heme, substrates and active site water molecules is essential, yet the mechanisms of proton delivery and the sources of protons are poorly understood in all heme enzymes. This information is important if the power of heme enzymes is to be exploited for bespoke catalysis. Here, proton transfer pathways in a heme peroxi-dase enzyme (ascorbate peroxidase) are identified using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, DFT calculations, QM(DFT)/MM calculations and QM(DFTB2)/MM MD simulations. The results show that an active site arginine residue, Arg38, is predominantly positively charged but can transiently deprotonate and adopt different tautomeric states, potentially accepting and donating pro-tons to nearby water molecules, depending on the instantaneous local environment. Extensive MD simulations identify two hy-drated tunnels through which protons from solvent can access the active site from the - and -edges of the heme. In the active site, dynamic proton exchange can occur, assisted by an active site distal histidine residue, and relayed to the substrate via Arg38. QM/MM free energy calculations demonstrate the feasibility of the transfer of a proton from solvent to His42 via distal water molecules. Rather than a simplistic model for proton delivery \u2013 where a single substrate provides a single proton (and an electron) \u2013 the data instead indicate multiple possible routes for proton delivery during reaction.

Our earlier work used templating energy (Eij,T) to rank the most likely OSDA-zeolite pairs to be produced from synthesis. Using literature recall area-under-the-curve (AUC) as a performance metric, we find that computing energies associated with the net transformation that occurs during zeolite synthesis (the sum of the formation energy of the zeolite framework and the OSDA binding energy) provides a modest improvement over Eij,T when predicting the zeolite phase that a given OSDA produces, from 67.5% average literature recall to 72.3%, but negligibly improves predictions for the best OSDA for a given zeolite framework, from 68.3% to 68.8%.

One potential cause of flaring is intermittent disruptions in gas supply chains between oil and gas production sites and gathering and boosting operations.  Since gathering and boosting facilities serve multiple production facilities, these types of supply chain disruptions would be expected to cause simultaneous flaring at multiple upstream sites in the regions served by a gathering and boosting facility experiencing a disruption, unless production sites are able to use other gathering and boosting facilities or the production sites immediately shut-in production.  To assess the potential magnitude of this type of event, the overall frequency of multiple flares being detected in a localized area (<5 km radius from another flare) was assessed using spatiotemporal patterns in satellite based daily flare detections using the VIIRS Nightfire (VNF) product.  Multiple detections in a localized area are unlikely if flaring is caused by independent conditions at individual sites.  In contrast, multi-site detections in a localized area may be indicative of potential supply chain disruptions.  Hundreds of flares in the Eagle Ford production region in south central Texas that are detected infrequently (<18% observations) were evaluated.  For these infrequently detected flares, which account for approximately half of flared gases in the region, 87% had 80-100% of their detections classified as multi-site events.  This suggests that efforts to reduce flaring should consider impacts of supply chain disruptions.", "date": "2024-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We demonstrate that the distribution of electrons at the maxima of the square of the wavefunction (Born maxima) highlight the rigidity of same-spin electron blocks and validate the LDQ framework in atoms and molecules. A generalized LDQ model accounts for all bond types --- including covalent, polar-covalent, ionic, dative, and electron-deficient --- and directly incorporates electron correlation effects, providing a rigorous yet intuitive approach to bonding. This perspective also reveals fundamental flaws in conventional mean-field descriptions that ignore the correlated motion of electrons. By bridging traditional and quantum paradigms, the generalized LDQ model offers a robust tool for understanding chemical bonding, with implications for education, experimental design, and theoretical advancements.", "date": "2024-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Incorporating electrochemical stability in multi-objective optimization would advance HEAs as a catalyst discovery platform. To address the knowledge gap on electrochemical stability, we propose a methodology for simulating the dissolution of n-element alloy nanoparticles comprised of density functional theory and machine learning regression to calculate the dissolution potentials of the surface atoms. We demonstrate the methodology for the Ag-Au-Cu-Ir-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru HEA system with the conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction. We investigated trends in stability against dissolution through a compositional grid search for the octo-metallic composition space, uncovering two alloying strategies to increase stability against electrochemical surface dissolution: Alloying with a noble metal or a metal with high relative surface energy. In the simulations, stabilization ensues from forming a protective surface layer, and consequently, the dissolution of persistent alloyed nanoparticles results in core-shell structures.

We report here a pyridyl-tethered isolable azomethine ylide (AY) that unprecedentedly acts as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) in activating a series of H-E bonds (E = B, Si, Al, O). The reactions are thoroughly probed mechanistically by the aid of DFT calculations and each case appears to be distinct from the rest. While the HBpin activation follows a stepwise mechanism, the same of PhSiH3 has a concerted route. The AlH3 activation is also stepwise but takes place across the 1,5-(C+/N-) dipole involving the pyridyl-N. The H2O activation is better fitted with a \u2018relay\u2019 mechanism with two H2O molecules rather than one to interact with AY. The B-B bond of B2pin2 is also cleaved but in an intriguingly different way, by an oxidative addition at a carbene center formed in situ through a 1,3-(C+ to C-) H+ shift. Though the imperative H2 activation fails, a transfer hydrogenation by NH3\u2022BH3 is achieved readily and mechanistically elucidated as a stepwise process. The AY also undergoes FLP-like cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles, among which the addition of CS2 but not of CO2 is alluring and counter-intuitive.

Our findings, supported by Pourbaix diagrams, reveal that high hydrogen coverages dominate under HER-relevant potentials.  Pt- and Pd-doped clusters exhibit remarkable structural stability, retaining their icosahedral core even at high hydrogen coverage. The detachment of thiol (HSR) and HAu-S(R)H molecules creates more accessible active sites enhancing catalytic efficiency. These clusters also support low H (2H) coverage states at less negative potentials, further contributing to their superior catalytic activity. In contrast, Cu-, Ag-, Zn-, Cd-, and Hg-doped clusters undergo structural collapse of the icosahedral core as hydrogen coverage increases and stabilize only high coverage clusters (> 7 H), correlating with their lower reactivity.

Initial sediment was composed of either fresh or aged organic matter (OM), and was fed with environmentally relevant, low Se concentrations and filtered lake water. We monitored Se concentration as well as speciation along with pH and the concentrations of dissolved OM, NO3-, NO2-, Fe(II), SO42- and HS- in the outflow of FTRs during 8 experimental phases along increasing Se concentrations. All experiments sequestered a large proportion of Se. Fresh, labile OM removed 50% more Se than aged, more recalcitrant OM. Along with a highest proportion of reduced redox-sensitive species in the reactors with fresh OM, this result is consistent with reducing conditions promoting Se sequestration. Inflowing selenite was sequestered to a larger extent than inflowing selenate. Lastly, only selenate reduction responded strongly to temperature. At 100 nM inflow, selenate was sequestered at a rate of 92 pmol cm-3 d-1 at 23\u00b0C, which lowered to 80 pmol cm-3 d-1  at 4\u00b0C. Outflow Se speciation for selenate reduction experiments comprised mostly of organic Se species at 23\u00b0C and, in contrast, solely of selenate at 4\u00b0C.

The proposed methodology identifies and characterizes failure events with site-specific information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of inventory programs through the so-called measurement-informed inventories (MIIs). Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of carefully comparing instantaneous emission measurements from aerial surveys with annual average emissions reported in inventories, as they have distinct timeframes.

A canonical mechanism based on experimental and theoretical considerations proposes that molecular oxygen reacts at the mononuclear CuM-center to form a reactive Cu(II)-superoxo intermediate capable of H-atom abstraction from the peptidyl substrate, followed by long range ET from the CuH center positioned 11 \u00c5 away across a solvent-filled cleft. However, recent data has challenged this mechanism, suggesting instead that an \u201copen-to-closed\u201d conformational transition brings the copper centers closer to facilitate reaction at a binuclear copper site.  Here we present direct observations of an enzyme-bound binuclear copper species, which was enabled by the use of an Ala-Ala-Phe-homoselenocysteine (hSeCys) species.  EXAFS, UV/vis, and EPR studies are used to show that this reagent reacts with the oxidized enzyme to form a novel mixed valence entity which is subtly different from that observed previously for the S-peptidyl complex (J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2024)146, 5074-5080).  In the ascorbate-reduced Cu(I) state of PHM, EXAFS measurements at both the Se and Cu absorption edges provide a unique signature of a bridging mode of binding, with Se-Cu site occupancy (1.8)  measured from the Se-EXAFS simulating to twice that of the Cu-Se site occupancy (0.85) measured at the Cu edge.  The ability of the hSeCys entity to induce a binuclear state is further emphasized by the XAS of the selenomethionyl peptide complex, where no such bridging chemistry is observed. The properties of the binuclear PHM derivative are of interest due to their unique chemical signatures, as well as providing the basis for a completely new mechanistic paradigm for PHM and its monooxygenase congeners.", "date": "2024-12-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thus, reducing fabrication time from 24 to 3 hours for multi-thiol aptasensors compared to a standard aptasensor using single thiols, without reduction in aptamer density.

As the release of these compounds into air, water, and soils can pose significant risks to human health and the environment, different techniques have been exploited to prevent or remediate chloroethene pollution. Although several previous experimental and computational studies investigated the removal of chloroethenes using zeolite adsorbents, their structural diversity in terms of pore size and pore topology has hardly been explored so far. In this work, molecular simulations using validated empirical force field parameters were used to study the gas-phase adsorption of chloroethenes in 16 structurally distinct zeolite frameworks. As all these frameworks are synthetically accessible in high-silica form, the simulations used purely siliceous zeolite models. In the most relevant concentration range (0.1 to 10 ppm by volume), substantial uptakes of tri- and tetrachloroethene were computed for several zeolite frameworks, prominently EUO, IFR, MTW, MOR, and BEA. In contrast, vinyl chloride uptakes were always too low to be of practical relevance for adsorptive removal. For selected frameworks, simulation snapshots were analyzed to investigate the impact of pore shape and, at higher uptakes, guest-guest interactions on the adsorption behavior. Hence, this study not only identifies zeolites that should be prioritized in future investigations, but also contributes to the microscopic understanding of chloroethene adsorption in crystalline microporous materials.", "date": "2024-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The monomer products, e.g. the silylester monomers and/or their value-added derivatives, involving reactive iodo groups (alkyl iodides and acyl iodides), are obtained in high yields. The reaction outcomes are influenced by the solvent choice (e.g. CH2Cl2, CH3CN), temperature (25 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C) and the amount of Me3SiI. The depolymerization of PES gives the corresponding silylester which then cyclizes into succinic anhydride. With PLA the ester CH3CH2CO2SiMe3 and propionyl iodide (CH3CH2COI) are formed. They can be selectively obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions.

Five models (coverage, anomalous diffusion, mass transfer, fixed site-interconversion, and dynamic site-interconversion) are investigated to describe the 44-min induction period in the first step-response cycle and the 95% reduction in subsequent step-response cycles. This reduction is due to dynamic autocatalytic interconversion across three active site-ensembles. The first active site-ensemble retains the kinetic function of the first step response cycle while the second and third active site-ensembles adopt a new kinetic function mediated by surface methoxy species, and adsorbed water.

In this work, we use\nbenzenethiol (BT) as an inhibitor in the selective deposition of ZnO on SiO2 in the presence of\ncopper with and without a native oxide (Cu/CuOx). We observe that BT forms a monolayer on the\nCu surface and a Cu-thiolate multilayer structure on CuOx.

Using ellipsometry and x-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy, we show that the BT consumes the entirety of the CuOx present in forming the\nmultilayer, and thus the thickness of the multilayer can be tuned by the thickness of the original\noxide. Both the monolayer BT and the multilayer BT prove to be effective inhibitors of ZnO ALD,\nblocking nearly 500 ALD cycles, which is more than twice that achieved with other thiol inhibitors.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the multilayer structure can prevent mushrooming of the ALD\nmaterial onto the nongrowth surface of nanoscale patterns, creating vertical sidewalls with welldefined material interfaces and providing excellent pattern transfer even for a relatively thick\ndeposited film. As such, these results demonstrate not only that BT is an effective inhibitor, but\nalso that its ability to form tunable multilayers lends itself towards highly precise nanopatterning\napplications.\n", "date": "2024-12-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Materials Processing; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recent efforts have focused on developing electrocatalytic mediators that rapidly and selectively activate specific C-H bonds.

Our previous work described the development of N-alkyl ammonium ylides as a new class of electro-oxidative mediators. Despite its importance, the underlying principles of designing efficient mediators and understanding their site-selectivity are yet to be fully elucidated. The work discussed herein scrutinized mediator design using density functional theory calculations to highlight the critical features of mediators that govern C(sp3)-H activation. The design of newer mediators is guided by scaling relationships between the thermodynamic descriptors associated with the elementary steps involved in C(sp3)-H activation. We subsequently examine the results from detailed transition state calculations to elucidate the site-selectivity for C(sp3)-H activation for various substrates with quinuclidine and ylide mediators. The results show the critical interplay of thermodynamic, steric, and electronic features of the substrate and mediator that govern the corresponding site-selectivity.

Data splitting is crucial for better benchmarking of such AI models. Traditional ran-dom data splits produce similar molecules between training and test sets, conflict-ing with the reality of VS libraries which mostly contain structurally distinct compounds. To tackle this challenge, scaffold split, which groups molecules by shared core structure, and Butina clustering, which clusters molecules by their chemotypes, were proposed. In the present study, however, we show that such splitting methods still introduce high similarities between clusters, leading to overestimated model performance. Our study examined three representative AI models on 60 NCI-60 datasets, each with approximately 33,000 to 54,000 mole-cules tested on a different cancer cell line.

This transformation is only rigorously valid for an isotropic dielectric medium. To simulate anisotropic solvation, as encountered at an interface or when parts of a system are solvent-exposed while other parts are assumed to be in a nonpolar environment, ad hoc modifications to the PCM  formalism have been suggested, in which a dielectric constant is  assigned separately to each atomic sphere that contributes to the solute cavity.  The accuracy of this \"heterogeneous\" PCM (HetPCM) method is tested here for the first time, by comparison to results from a  generalized Poisson equation solver.  The latter  is a more expensive and cumbersome approach to incorporate arbitrary dielectric boundary conditions, but one that corresponds to a well-defined scalar permittivity function, epsilon(r). We examine simple model systems for which a model function epsilon(r) can be constructed in a manner that maps reasonably well onto a dielectric constant for each atomic sphere,  using a solvent-exposed dielectric constant epsilon_solv = 78 and a variety of smaller values to represent a  hydrophobic environment.  For nonpolar dielectric constants epsilon_nonp <= 2,  differences between the HetPCM and Poisson solvation energies are large compared to the effect of anisotropy on the solvation energy. For epsilon_nonp = 4 and epsilon_nonp = 10, however, HetPCM and anisotropic Poisson solvation energies agree to within  2 kcal/mol in most cases.   As a realistic use case, we apply the HetPCM method to predict solvation energies and pKa values for a blue copper protein.

Building on our previously developed mitochondria-targeting probe (R)-BCT-2, which is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the inner membrane protein carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CAC), probe 1 incorporates two bromine atoms that enhance intersystem crossing, leading to a singlet oxygen quantum yield of 80%, while retaining sufficient fluorescence for effective cell staining in fluorescence microscopy.

Probe 1 co-localizes in both mitochondria and, to a lesser extent, in lysosomes, and this dual targeting may synergistically enhance phototoxic activity by amplifying cellular stress responses. Importantly, probe 1 demonstrated high phototoxicity upon green light irradiation, with IC50 values of 52 nM under normoxia and 117 nM under hypoxia, while remaining non-cytotoxic in the dark.

We first identify catalytic hotspots from chemical shift perturbations induced by transition-state-analogue binding and then use computational/phylogenetic design (FuncLib) to predict stabilizing combinations of mutations at sets of such hotspots. We test this approach on a previously designed de novo Kemp eliminase, which is already highly optimized in terms of both activity and stability.

Notably, our most efficient engineered variant shows a ~3-fold enhancement in activity (kcat 1700 s-1, kcat/KM 4.3\u00b7105 M-1s-1) from an already heavily optimized starting variant, resulting in the most proficient proton-abstraction Kemp eliminase designed to date, with a catalytic efficiency on a par with naturally occurring enzymes. Molecular simulations pinpoint the origin of this catalytic enhancement as being due to the progressive elimination of a catalytically inefficient substrate conformation that is present in the original design. Remarkably, interaction network analysis identifies a significant fraction of catalytic hot-spots, thus providing a computational tool which we show to be useful even for natural-enzyme engineering.

Therefore, here we address the metabolic profiles of the valerian plants with a special emphasis on their major root constituents with pronounced neuroprotective activity. The following phytochemical analysis of the V. officinalis L. roots led to isolation of nine compounds, including two previously undescribed iridoids \u2013 isovaltrate isovaleroyloxyisohydrin (1) and isovaltrate \u03b1-(isovaleroxy)isovaleroxyhydrin (2) together with one previously undescribed valerenic acid derivative \u2013 2-oxovalerenic acid (3). Three previously described iridoids \u2013 iridoidvol A (4), isovaltrate isovaleroyloxyhydrin (5) and valtrate hydrine B1 (6), along with valerenic acid (7) and its metabolites - hydroxyvalerenic (8) and acetoxyvalerenic acids (9) were isolated.  Functional assays accomplished with the isolated compounds revealed moderate antioxidant activity characteristic for all of them. Moreover, high neuroprotective potential was observed for the compound 3 (and to less extent of 8). This potential was manifested by a pronounced antineurodegenerative effect in the model of A\u03b225-35 induced cytotoxicity. In respect of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, compounds 1, 4 and 7 demonstrated pronounced inducing and compounds 2, 5 and 6 showed clear potentiating activity.

Therefore, phytochemical profiling of the major secondary metabolites in the first year Spiraea shoot extracts, accompanied with comprehensive screening of the activities exerted by these isolates, appears to be a remarkable step forwards. Obviously, this work will deliver new valuable information on the structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the major natural product constituents of these extracts. Indeed, although numerous phytochemical studies with Spiraea plants were reported so far, these works relied on limited numbers of species (or even on individual accessions), while, to the best of our knowledge, no full-scale screening with any logically completed set of Spiraea species was accomplished till now. Because of this, the data on the quantitative profiles of the principal secondary metabolites in the isolates prepared from different Spiraea species are quite fragmentary and require further supplementation and systematization. Therefore, our study aims filling this gap and covers the whole list of the Spiraea species naturally occurring in Russia. Moreover, here we successfully combined a metabolite profiling survey with a comprehensive screening of biological activities of the same extracts to address the Russian spirea species as promising sources of biologically active complexes for use in medical practice. For this, we address the relationships between the relative abundances of individual natural products occurring as their major extract constituents and the biological effects of the corresponding isolates in reliable laboratory models. Specifically, altogether 33 major components representing flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol derivatives) and hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid, coumaric acid derivatives) were identified based on chromato-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) analysis. Further, the relative contents of these identified major components in the extracts, obtained from different Spiraea species, were addressed. The analysis of antioxidant potential revealed high activity of all extracts in the models of antiradical activity (DPPH assay), activity against cation radicals (TEAC assay) and superoxide anion radical (NBT assay).

Dimerization of Mpro, necessary for its enzymatic activity, presents a promising but underexplored target for drug development. However, knowledge gaps remain in understanding the dynamic conformational changes and network of residues that stabilize the dimer interface. In this study, we captured the transient dynamics of Mpro dimerization and the conformational changes at the dimer interface induced by inhibitor binding. Integrat-ing stable isotope labeling and native mass spectrometry with hydrogen-deuterium exchange, we provided time-resolved insights into the structural dynamics of Mpro in its intact dimeric form. We employed N15 isotopic labeling of Mpro to investi-gate subunit exchange and dissociation kinetics during dimerization, both in the presence and absence of peptidomimetic inhibitors, including Nirmatrelvir, GC376, and MPI8. Our findings revealed that peptidomimetic inhibitor binding inhibited dimer dissociation, altering the dynamics of subunit exchange. Moreover, we identified significant conformational changes across Mpro's three domains and at the dimer interface upon inhibitor binding. Notably, hydrogen-deuterium exchange pro-files transitioned from bimodal to unimodal distributions in the N-finger region when Mpro was complexed with Nirmatrelvir, suggesting distinct structural alterations that stabilize the dimeric form.

Currently, such datasets are typically assembled in an unprincipled manner, suffering from uncontrolled chemical bias, and limiting the transferability of benchmarking results to broader chemical space. In this work, a data-efficient solution, based on active learning, is explored to address this issue. Focusing -- as a proof of principle -- on pericyclic reactions, we start from the BH9 benchmarking dataset, and design a chemical space around this initial dataset by combinatorially combining reaction templates and substituents. Next, a surrogate model is trained to predict the standard deviation of the activation energies computed across a selection of 20 distinct DFT functionals. With this model, the designed chemical space is explored, enabling the identification of challenging regions, for which representative reactions are subsequently acquired. Remarkably, it turns out that the function mapping molecular structure to DFT functional divergence is readily learnable; convergence is reached upon the acquisition of less than 100 reactions. With our final model, a more challenging -- and arguably more representative -- pericyclic benchmarking dataset is curated, and we demonstrate that the functional performance has changed significantly compared to the original BH9 subset.", "date": "2024-12-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

An ionic liquid screening showed that the biocompatible ionic liquid choline acetate, [Ch][OAc], can extract more than 80 wt% of the protein and precipitate it upon solvent swing between ethanol and water. Process parameter optimization was carried out with factorial design of experiments to yield 75% of recovered protein with an estimated 90% purity and a highly acetylated, crystalline \u03b2-chitin with up to 95% purity. Physico-chemical analyses of these two streams confirmed the efficiency of ionic liquid separation and the amino acid profiling of the protein isolate revealed the presence of three major essential amino acids, histidine, leucine and valine that could be a valuable alternative protein source for feed in aquaculture. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of [OAc]- to protein surfaces is greater than that of alternative anions, facilitating protein solubilization. However, its combination with [Ch]+ is optimal because the interactions of this cation with the protein surface are relatively weak, allowing the protein to be recovered from the IL. A material mass balance of the process has shown the solvent usage is high, which ultimately impacts on high energetic requirements.

SPP, derived from squid pen is a marine waste product and a sustainable alternative to traditional synthetic pol-ymers. When combined with chitosan, extracted from crustacean exoskeletons, the resulting hydrogels demonstrate en-hanced dye sorption properties due to the complementary characteristics of the two materials.

Given the lack of any formal mechanism that would have directed us to identify the correct factors responsible for such an occurrence, we needed to spend several months and devote significant analysis to unravel the involved mechanism.

At first, we obtain data on certain basic features from the all-atom MD data for a reference case (case with a smaller electric field) and the perturbed case in bins in which the nanochannel half height has been divided into. These datasets are high-dimensional dataset, to which the LDA is applied. This leads to the projection of the data (between the reference and the perturbed states) in a highly separated form on a 1D line. From such LDA calculations, we are able to identify the importance scores for the different features, which in turn tell us what to study and where to study.

However, the accuracy of these methods is highly dependent on  details of the calculation and choices made while preparing the ligands and protein ahead of running calculations. During ligand preparation, researchers typically assign partial atomic charges to each ligand atom using a specific ligand conformation for charge assignment, often the input conformer. While it is a well known problem that partial charge assignment is dependent on conformation, little investigation has explored the downstream effects of varied partial charge assignment on free energy estimates. Preliminary benchmarks from Open Free Energy Project show that generating partial charges from different input conformers leads to variation of up to \u00b15.3 kcal/mol in calculated relative binding free energies due to variation in partial charges alone. In this study, we more systematically explore this issue, investigating systems where differences in partial charge generation (such as those caused by input conformer choice, partial charge engine, and hardware) may lead to differences in calculated absolute hydration free energy (AHFE) values. We demonstrate that supplying different input conformers to a partial charge engine can result in atomic partial charge discrepancies of up to 0.681 e, resulting in differences in calculated AHFE of 6.9 \u00b1  0.1 kcal/mol. We find that even relatively small variations in partial charge assignment can result in notable differences in calculated AHFE, and thus care should be taken when assigning partial charges to ensure reproducibility and accuracy of any resulting free energy calculations.

The electrical conductivity is a product of frameworks\u2019 charge carrier density and mobility, which depend on their structures and compositions. Although the hexagonal 2D MOFs composed of square-planar metal ions and trigonal planar aromatic ligands often display impressive electrical conductivities because of their unique abilities to support in-plane (through bonds) and out-of-plane (through space) charge transport, large disparities between the two orthogonal conduction pathways also render their conductivity highly anisotropic and dampen bulk conductivity. To address this issue, herein, we have developed a novel redox-complementary dual-ligand 2D MOF (CDL-MOF1), Cu3(HHTP)(HHTQ), in which the Cu-coordinated \u03c0-donor hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and a \u03c0-acceptor hexahydroxy-tricycloquinazoline (HHTQ) ligands are located at alternate corners of the heteroleptic hexagonal framework. The CDL-MOF1 layers, which support through-bond charge transport along ab-planes, are stacked in eclipsed AA fashion along the c-axis, forming parallel homomeric HHTP and HHTQ \u03c0-stacks at each corner of the hexagons, which can facilitate out-of-plane charge transport by serving as dual electron and hole transporting channels. Consequently, Cu3(HHTP)(HHTQ) MOF displayed a distinctly higher bulk conductivity (~0.12 S/m, 295 K) than the parent Cu3(HHTP)2 (7.3 x 10\u20132 S/m) and Cu3(HHTQ)2 (5.9 x 10\u20134 S/m) MOFs.

Complex 1 effectively catalyzes the hydrophosphinylation of alkynes resulting stepwise hydrophosphinylated products namely monophosphinylated vinyledene- and 1,2-diphosphinylated alkanes.

Herein, a series of mesoporous Ti-promoted silica materials with different Ti-loadings was synthesized via the aerosol-assisted sol-gel process. These materials possess a spherical morphology with high specific surface area and homogeneous distribution of dispersed Ti species, even at Ti-loading as high as 16 mol%, thus allowing to investigate the role of Ti as a promoter in silica-supported Ru CO2 methanation catalysts. Keeping the Ru loading constant, higher Ti loadings (up to 12 mol%) lead to superior catalytic activity in CO2 methanation. At 300 C, the Ru-mass-normalized CO2 conversion rate of Ru/12%Ti-SiO2 catalyst is 2.3 times higher than that of unpromoted Ru/SiO2 catalyst. The improved activity correlates well with the smaller crystallite size of RuO2 nanoparticles, which translates to higher Ru dispersion after reductive treatment with H2. Overall, Ti helps stabilize Ru species and impedes crystal growth. With a Ti loading of 12 mol%, the crystallization of small anatase TiO2 is induced after RuO2 impregnation and during subsequent calcination, in turn forming the interfacial contact between Ru and TiO2 after H2 reduction. In-situ DRIFTS suggests that the promotion of CO2 activation and CO adsorption at these interfacial sites is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity in Ti-promoted Ru-SiO2 methanation catalyst.", "date": "2024-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A simple, generalizable way to construct such concentration maps in vitro, with precise control over the position and shape of each feature and applicability to diverse length-scales, timescales, and downstream processes, would open opportunities to direct the synthesis and dynamics of systems ranging from optics and electronics to living tissues. Here we introduce a strategy for creating intricately patterned, stable RNA concentration fields by designing the arrangement and overlap of local concentration fields that act as geometric primitives for pattern design. Each primitive field is produced by a \u201cgenerator\u201d hydrogel, allowing field positions and overlaps to be arbitrarily chosen by prescribing the generator locations. This design flexibility derives from a straightforward approach: combining primitive fields through the direct addition of their concentrations at each point. As a result, combining fields by modulating inter-generator distance can introduce new pattern features such as hills or valleys. Using an empirical model that enables rapid and accurate prediction of the composite fields produced by arbitrary numbers and arrangements of generators, we show how a desired field can be generated from first principles by optimizing the set of generator locations that accurately reproduces it. The construction of patterns from primitive fields, using RNA synthesis and degradation reactions easily generalized to any sequence, enables the patterning of a range of RNA species, independent scaling of local and composite fields, and multi-hour pattern stability using only NTPs as fuel. This approach provides a foundation for applying the operations of constructive geometry to patterning materials in solution that could be extended to three-dimensional and multi-species concentration fields to drive the self-assembly of particles and materials, orchestrate the growth and self-organization of cell architectures, or precisely direct reconfiguration or healing.", "date": "2024-12-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Biological Materials; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Crystalline rutile-type iridium dioxide (IrO2) offers superior stability in acidic OER conditions compared to amorphous iridium oxide (IrOx), but the high synthesis temperatures required for crystalline phase formation reduce OER activity by decreasing active surface area. Herein, we present a novel perchlorate fusion\u2013hydrothermal (PFHT) synthesis method to produce nano-crystalline rutile-type IrO2 nanoparticles with exceptional OER performance.

A distinction between chaotropic, superchaotropic and hydrophobic ions, however, has not been presented so far. Herein, we show by measurement of the viscosity B-coefficient of SiW (and other nano-ions) and of ion binding to the non-ionic polymer hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), how chaotropic, superchaotropic and hydrophobic ions can be unambiguously distinguished. The viscosity B-coefficient of the superchaotropic SiW is positive as for hydrophobic ions, and distinct from classical chaotropic ions with a negative B-coefficient. In HPC-solution, BPh4 and SiW bind to the polymer, dramatically increasing the viscosity and the cloud point. Heating induces characteristically distinct responses for the two nano-ions: The viscosity rises for BPh4 and decreases for SiW. These effects are related to nano-ion induced aggregation and electric charging of HPC, which, upon heating, become stronger for BPh4 and weaker for SiW as shown by Small Angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry showed that the structural effects are linked to binding thermodynamics. Upon heating, the binding constant decreases for SiW and increases for BPh4 arising respectively from an enthalpically favorable, exothermic, chaotropic driving force or an enthalpically unfavorable, endothermic, hydropho-bic driving force. Combining the viscosity B-coefficient and sign of the binding enthalpy enables distinguishing cha-otropic, superchaotropic and hydrophobic ions.

H2-producing membrane reactors (MRs), such as those used for fuel reforming or water-gas shift reactions, can enable low-cost low-carbon H2 production from a variety of feedstocks, e.g., biomass, coal, or natural gas. This is a consequence of the enhanced feed utilization (i.e., kg of H2 produced per kg of \n eed) for the MR compared to conventional multi-step H2 generation/purification schemes. Furthermore, H2 MRs simultaneously separate H2 and concentrate CO2, thereby increasing the overall process efficiency and facilitating pre-combustion carbon capture.

Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III-V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and non-illuminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 \u00b1 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7-3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.", "date": "2024-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Fuels - Energy Science; Photovoltaics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While RAM is rapidly emerging as a scalable methodology for media-free mechanochemical synthesis, the design parameters for reaction control, optimization, and scale-up remain poorly understood. This study establishes the filling ratio (\u03c6), acceleration, and amount of liquid additive (\u03b7) as three critical parameters that can be used to design scalable Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reactions under RAM conditions. Systematic investigation of several model reactions reveals a relationship between reaction conversion and \u03c6, providing a simple means to maximize conversion. The simultaneous real-time in situ monitoring of a model reaction through infrared thermography, fingerprint Raman, as well as low-frequency Raman (THz-Raman) spectroscopy enabled correlation of the reaction progress with the evolution of temperature during RAM, and established the RAM acceleration as a parameter that can be used to tune the reaction kinetic  behavior. At high accelerations the reactions can proceed under sigmoidal kinetics, enabling multi-gram syntheses within 5 minutes, while lower accelerations can be used to switch the reactions to a more linear kinetic profile, associated with longer reaction times and milder temperature profiles. Following the reaction progress in the THz-Raman region is a reaction monitoring strategy that enables the detection of crystalline and non-crystalline phases in the reaction, permitting the observation of a non-crystalline intermediate whose evolution and replacement with the crystalline product could be tracked through non-negative least-squares fitting algorithm of the real-time spectroscopic data. This study establishes key parameters for manipulating the course and stoichiometric selectivity of a metal-catalyzed reaction in RAM and illustrates the scalability to at least 100 mmol without any protocol changes, except the volume of the vessel.", "date": "2024-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, using [Au25(SR)18]- nanocluster as the prototype model, we demonstrated the importance of ligand hydrophilicity versus hydrophobicity in modulating the interface dynamics and electrocatalytic performance. Our first-principle computations revealed that Au25 protected by hydrophilic -SCH2COOH ligands dictates faster kinetics in stripping the thiolate ligand and exhibits better HER activity due to enhanced proton transfer facilitated by boosted interface hydrogen bonding.

Experimental validation using synthesized [Au25(MPA)18]- (MPA=Mercaptopropionic acid) and [Au25(SC6H13)18]- confirms these findings, where [Au25(MPA)18]- exhibits better activity and stability in HER, while [Au25(SC6H13)18]- achieves higher Faradaic efficiency and current density in CO2RR.

Our analysis encompasses turbulent flows occurring in both smooth and rough tubes under constraints of network's tube-volume and tube surface area. We introduce the non-dimensional conductance parameter $E$ to quantify flow conditions, investigating its variations with diameter ratio $\\beta$, length ratio $\\gamma$, branch splitting $N$, and branching generation levels $m$. Our findings reveal a decrease in $E$ with increasing $\\gamma$, $N$, and $m$, highlighting the influence of these parameters on flow conductance. Under volume constraint, we identify optimal flow conditions for both smooth and rough tube networks, characterized by distinct scaling laws as  $ D_{k+1}/D_{k}  = \\beta^* =  N^{-(10n+1)/(24n+3)} $, and $D_{k+1}/D_{k}    = N^{-3/7} $ (or flow rate proportional to  $D_k^{(24n+3)/(10n+1)}$ and $D_k^{7/3}$ ), respectively, where $D_k$ is tube-diameter and $\\dot{m}_k$ is the mass flow-rate in a branch at the $k_{th}$ level . Notably, the scaling in the rough tube network remains independent of the power-law index $n$, unlike the smooth tube network where it depends on $n$. Similarly, under surface-area constraint, we observe distinct optimal flow conditions for smooth and rough tube networks as with different scaling laws as $D_{k+1}/D_{k}   = \\beta^* =  N^{-(10n+1)/(21n+2)} $, and $D_{k+1}/D_{k}  = N^{-1/2} $ (or flow rate proportional to  $D_k^{(21n+2)/(10n+1)}$ and $D_k^{2}$ ), respectively, again smooth tube network showing dependency on the power-law index $n$. Moreover, we uncover a trend where the scaling exponent slope decreases with increasing $n$ in volume constraint networks, while the opposite holds true for surface-area constraint networks. In conclusion, our research significantly extends the applicability of Murray's Law, offering valuable insights into the design and optimization of branching networks under various constraints and fluid properties.

In this study, two machine learning systems were developed to address these challenges in catalyst discovery: a recommender system that balances exploration and exploitation, and a \"serendipiter\" that detects unexpected discoveries. These systems were tested on the oxidative coupling of methane, and the results demonstrated a promising improvement in the efficiency of catalyst discovery. The recommender, based on evidence theory, uses binary combinations of catalyst components as descriptors to predict performance. It handles incomplete data by quantifying contradictions and uncertainty, facilitating a balance between exploration (testing unevidenced catalysts) and exploitation (refining known high-performing ones). The recommender efficiently identified a diverse range of high-performing catalysts through adaptive sampling with 160 catalysts. The serendipiter, a meta-learner, identifies unexpected high-performing catalysts by leveraging different machine learning models. It increased the occurrence of serendipitous discoveries to 50%, compared to 3% with the recommender alone. In summary, these systems improve the efficiency and reproducibility of catalyst discovery by balancing exploitation, exploration, and serendipity.", "date": "2024-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Oligofluorenes, with their well-defined structures and controlled morphologies, offer a promising alternative but have been underexplored in sub-stoichiometric fluorene-benzothiadiazole systems.

Computational modelling supplemented this automated experimental workflow for post priori rationalization of experimental outcomes.

We employed a novel mesh-constrained Brownian dynamics (BD) algorithm coupled with Ansys\u00ae electric field simulations to model the transport and assembly of charged particles on a non-spherical droplet surface. We demonstrated that the electrostatic repulsion between particles, electrophoretic forces induced by substrate surface charge, and Brownian motion are the key factors influencing the compactness and ordering of the assembly structure. We further trained a deep neural network surrogate model using the data generated from the BD simulations to predict radial distribution functions (RDF) of particle assembly. By coupling the surrogate model with Bayesian optimization, we identified the optimal particle and substrate charge densities that yield the best match between the simulation and experimental assembly. Using the optimal charge densities, the RDF profile of the simulated assembly accurately matches the experiment with a similarity of 96.4%, and the corresponding average bond order parameter differs by less than 5% from the experimental one.

Polymorphs often exhibit differing physical properties, and they are therefore particularly important in the development of materials and pharmaceuticals. However, gaining a thorough understanding of the solid-state landscape of a molecule requires exhaustive experimental screening of crystallization conditions, a particular challenge when using classical crystallization methods. We show that high-throughput Encapsulated Nanodroplet Crystallization (ENaCt) can enable the rapid and efficient exploration of the solid-state landscape of highly polymorphic molecules, through an in-depth study of 5-methyl-2-((2-nitrophenyl)amino)thiophene-3-carbonitrile (ROY), the most polymorphic small molecule known. An ENaCt screen encompassing 1,536 individual crystallization experiments, spanning 320 unique conditions, resulted in direct access to single crystals, suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, for all six of the known polymorphs accessible from solution (Y, R, YN, ON, ORP and R18). In addition, two polymorphs (Y04 and Y19) previously accessed only via melt and heteroseeded melt experiments, and a new polymorph of ROY (O22), the fourteenth to be discovered, were obtained. Furthermore, ENaCt screening resulted in the identification of the first ROY solvate (ROY\u2022methyl anthranilate) and the first example of a ROY dimer, formed via in situ oxidation. ENaCt is thus shown to be an impactful tool for the experimental mapping of the solid-state landscape of highly polymorphic molecules and, through the discovery of a new polymorph O22, has ensured that tetradecamorphic ROY retains the world record for most polymorphic small molecule.", "date": "2024-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Solid State Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Our results reveal strikingly low consistency rates of below 1% for commercial state-of-the-art LLMs.  To cope with the imbalance in molecular representation in the training data, we finetune the models using data represented in both SMILES and IUPAC, but the models still produce inconsistent predictions. To address this, we regularize training by a sequence-level, symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss. Although the proposed KL divergence loss improves surface-level consistency, it does not lead to better accuracy, due to the apparent orthogonality between consistency and accuracy, suggesting that these models do not understand chemistry, as we expect them to.

The model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network (NN) models trained with the same dataset, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added into the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. The 6-D H$_2$O-He system was chosen as the test system.  A reference PES was constructed firstly by the newly developed MLRNet model with a weighted RMSE of 0.028 cm$^{-1}$, where the full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method.  Our tests demonstrate that it is also reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, however, it is less inefficient for the newly developed MLRNet model. For the first single-precision sampling, the LS-FI-NN only requires 472 fitting points to achieve a weighted-RMSE of 0.3253 cm$^{-1}$ for 47945 test points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy.  Notably, the MLRNet demonstrated lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles with less trainable parameters, which indicates its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. For the second double-precision sampling, the LS-FI-NN achieved a test RMSD of 0.0710 cm$^{-1}$ with only 613 points, while the MLRNet can't converge to a given threshold for tens of iterations. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to further validate the accuracy of these PESs.

By building a catalysis-driven motor into simulated numerical experiments, we here systematically report on how directionality responds when the motor is modified accordingly to power stroke intuition.

Though power strokes are formally unimportant for determining directionality, we show that practical attempts to alter a power stroke have side effects that can in fact alter the bias.

We investigate adsorption-induced deformation of nanoporous carbons using an original hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) simulation approach that couples adsorption sampling with structural relaxation. By studying CH4 and CO\u2082 adsorption on 3D carbon structures of varying densities (0.5-1.0 g/cm\u00b3), we demonstrate characteristic non-monotonic deformation behavior, with initial contraction at low pressures followed by expansion at higher pressures. A key contribution is the direct calculation of isothermal compressibility of adsorbate saturated porous structures from the volume fluctuations during NPT-MD simulations, which reveals dramatic mechanical property changes during adsorption. In the process of adsorption, carbon structures exhibit initial softening followed by substantial hardening, with a dramatic increase of the volumetric modulus in denser carbons. Using elastic theory relationships, we estimate the adsorption stresses reaching 175 MPa, that provides crucial insights into potential material degradation mechanisms. For binary CH\u2084/CO\u2082 mixtures, increasing CO\u2082 content amplifies both contraction and expansion effects due to stronger fluid-wall interactions.

In recent years the application of enzymes in organic synthesis has expanded dramatically, especially for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and amines, two very important functional groups found in many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Indeed, many elegant routes employing such compounds have been described by industry. Yet, for the synthesis chiral thiols and thioethers, likewise found in APIs albeit less ubiquitous, only very few biocatalytic syntheses have been reported, and stereo-control has proved challenging. Here we apply ene-reductases (EREDs), whose ability to initiate and control chemically challenging radical chemistries has recently emerged, to the synthesis of chiral thioethers from \u03b1-bromoacetophenones and pro-chiral vinyl sulfides, without requiring light.

In ATR-MIRS, changes in samples induced by mycotoxigenic fungi are correlated with mycotoxin concentrations obtained through reference analysis, using multivariate statistical methods. Due to its indirect nature, limited research has explored the applicability of this technique for complex sample sets. In this study, we demonstrate that ATR-MIRS can effectively screen for deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in wheat samples collected across two countries over multiple years. A total of 320 naturally contaminated samples from Austria and France were utilized to develop screening models. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), combined with various spectral preprocessing strategies and dataset balancing, was explored to classify samples as compliant or non-compliant with the European Commission (EC) limit of 1000 \u00b5g/kg DON in unprocessed wheat. Model performance during repeated nested cross-validation exhibited a true positive rate ranging from 0.32 to 1. This variability was primarily influenced by sample splitting, as well as by dataset balancing and spectral preprocessing approaches. These findings underscore the critical importance of sample selection when developing chemometric models for mycotoxin screening. Analysis of variable importance in projection (VIP) scores revealed that PLS-DA predominantly selected wavenumbers associated with dissolved carbohydrates in the MIRS spectra to discriminate between compliant and non-compliant samples. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using ATR-MIRS to assess DON contamination in complex, multiyear wheat sample sets as exemplified for samples obtained from Austria and France while adhering to regulatory limits. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of ATR-MIRS for investigating the effects of mycotoxigenic fungi on wheat composition during the development of DON screening models.", "date": "2024-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

The difficulty of identifying underlying mechanistic models for such novel transformations, coupled with the large reaction space of this reaction class, mean that developing a robust process is challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the machine learning-driven optimisation of a photoredox tertiary amine synthesis with six continuous variables (e.g., concentration, temperature, residence time) and solvent choice as a discrete variable, in a semi-automated continuous flow setup. Starting with a large library of solvents, the workflow included multiple steps of a priori knowledge generation (e.g., solubility predictions) to narrow down the discrete space. A novel Bayesian optimisation algorithm, Nomadic Exploratory Multi-Objective optimisation (NEMO), was then deployed to identify and populate the Pareto front for the two reaction objectives - yield and reaction cost. Permutation feature importance and partial dependence plots identified the most important parameters for high yield, sig3, the asymmetry of the -profile for the discrete space, and equivalences of alkene and Hantzsch ester for the continuous variables. Catalyst loading and residence time were found to be correlated to absorbed photon equivalence, while catalyst loading was additionally the main parameter to drive cost. Even though productivity was not an optimisation objective, the best result achieved in flow was ~25 times higher than reactions in batch, which equals to ~12 g per day throughput.", "date": "2024-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The investigation was conducted with an air-free approach to isolate any sample alterations exclusively to those caused by the reaction. Structural analysis was performed using a combination of (S)TEM, IR, and XAS. It was found that Ir-Mo/SiO2, Rh-Mo/SiO2, and Pt-Mo/SiO2 display high activity for primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol deoxygenation, while Pd-Mo/SiO2 only effectively catalyses tertiary alcohol deoxygenation. All other combinations as well as the corresponding monometallic materials do not display the same activity.

Mo K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra showed variations in the amount of Mo(0), Mo(IV) and Mo(VI) depending on the metal counterpart in the fresh catalysts, while complete conversion of Mo(VI) to lower oxidation states was demonstrated in the spent catalysts.

This study provides mechanistic and kinetic insights on how organo-mineral associations affect adsorption/desorption and abiotic oxidation of glyphosate. We use in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and microfluidic experiments coupled to LC-MS determination of glyphosate transformation by-products. A model protein (BSA) and Mn-oxide minerals (K-birnessite and hausmannite) are used. Results indicate the presence of protein adsorbed onto mineral surfaces (BSA-Mn oxide associations) favors the AMPA (+20%) over the glycine transformation pathway (-55%). The AMPA pathway is also favored in experiments conducted at circumneutral pH.  The shift in pathway selectivity corresponds to changes in bonding of glyphosate with BSA-Mn oxide associations: we observe protein association enhances the contribution of the mononuclear monodentate conformation of glyphosate at the Mn oxide interface. In addition, protein association protects glyphosate from abiotic oxidation by diminishing Mn oxide catalytic activity (occupies surface active sites) and by forming organic-organic (i.e., glyphosate-protein) complexes. Furthermore, kinetic modeling shows protein association hinders the adsorption, desorption and transformation rate constants under circumneutral (pH 7.2) and acidic (pH 4.6) conditions.

Unfortunately the most efficient (degradable) thionolactone dibenzo[c,e]oxepine-5(7h)-thione (DOT) is incompatible with methacrylate derivatives, implying the absence of MMA-DOT-MMA formation in poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) backbones. As shown in the present work, DOT can be encapsulated through a fast radical ring-opening polymerization (rROP) in a symmetric triad, by utilizing methyl acrylate (MA) or N-phenyl maleimide (PhMal) as an auxiliary comonomer. The intriguing formation of MA-DOT-MA and PhMal-DOT-PhMal triads is realized, and demonstrated to be compatible with MMA addition.

One key remaining challenge is identifying solid electrolytes that combine high ionic conductivity with stability in contact with the highly reducing potentials of next-generation anodes. Fully reduced electrolytes, based on irreducible anions, offer a promising solution by avoiding electrolyte decomposition altogether. In this study, we demonstrate the compositional flexibility of the disordered antifluorite framework accessible by mechanochemical synthesis and leverage it to discover irreducible electrolytes with high ionic conductivities. We show that the recently investigated Li9N2Cl3 and Li5NCl2 phases are part of the same solid solution of Li-deficient antifluorite phases existing on the LiCl-Li3N tie line with a general chemical formula of Li1+2xCl1-xNx (0.33<x<0.5). Using density functional theory calculations, we identify the origin of the 5-order of magnitude conductivity increase of the Li1+2xCl1-xNx phases compared to the structurally related rock salt LiCl phase. Finally, we demonstrate that SCl  and BrCl substituted analogues of the Li1+2xCl1-xNx phases may be synthesized, enabling significant conductivity improvements by a factor of 10, reaching 0.2 mS cm-1 for Li2.31S0.41Br0.14N0.45. This investigation demonstrates for the first time that irreducible antifluorite-like phases are compositionally highly modifiable; this finding lays the ground for discovery of new compositions of irreducible antifluorite-like phases with even further increased conductivities, which could help eliminate solid-electrolyte decomposition and decomposition-induced Li losses on the anode side in high-performance next-generation batteries.", "date": "2024-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

At these resolutions hydrogen atoms do not resolve and heavy atoms such as oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen are indistinguishable. This leads to ambiguity in the rotamer and protonation states of multiple amino acids, notably asparagine, glutamine, histidine, serine, tyrosine, and threonine. When the rotamer and protonation states of these residues changes, so too does the electrochemical surface of a binding site. A variety of computational tools have been developed to assign these states for these residues based on a crystal protein structure by evaluating the possible states and typically deciding on one single state for each residue. We posit that multiple rotamer and protonation states of residues are consistent with the resolved structure of the proteins and introduce a protonation and rotamer assignment tool that identifies an ensemble of rotamer and protonation states that are consistent with the X-ray scattering data of the protein.  Here, we present a Rotamer and Protonation state Assignment (RAPA) tool that analyzes local hydrogen bonding environments in the resolved structures of proteins and identifies a set of unique rotamer and protonation states that are energetically consistent with the crystal structure. We evaluate all RAPA predicted states in unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations and find that there are multiple configurations for each protein which match the X-ray results with RMSDs of less than 1.0\u00c5 for the atoms with the lowest 90% B-factors. We find that for most protein systems (62 of 77) there are 8 or fewer possible states suggesting that there is no combinatorial explosion of accessible configurations for a majority of proteins.

Fibre strength deterioration seemed to be mainly driven by the topochemistry of the cellulose degradation (homogeneous or localised), rather than by its intensity usually measured as an average DP loss. In fact, depolymerisation by cellulase was found critically detrimental to fibres strength whereas ozone and hypochlorous acid induced little harm to the fibres despite a significant cellulose depolymerisation. According to these results, in line with several past studies, fibre strength measurements should be performed systematically as the sole pulp viscosity is an inadequate indicator. Alternatively, albeit being insufficient strength predictors on their own MMD can give valuable insight on the topochemistry of the cellulose degradation, a key aspect when monitoring fibre strength preservation during pulping and bleaching.

Using spectroscopic and computational approaches, we elucidate and compare the roles of the vibrational Stark effect, bond polarization, and charge transfer in driving the C-H redshift.

This enzyme efficiently transforms asparagine into aspartate, depriving leukaemia cells of this essential amino acid. A combination of Molecular Dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and mechanistic insights based on Quantum Mechanics / Molecular Mechanics hybrid approaches were used to identify those residues contributing to the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. We first dissected the contribution of enzymatic residues to substrate binding and selectivity, showing why this ASNase can degrade asparagine but not glutamine. We also studied the conformational dynamics of the enzymatic loop closing the active site, demonstrating that substrate binding favors the closed state. The catalytic reaction mechanisms, composed of two stages: acylation and hydrolysis, were explored as well. The rate-limiting step presents a free energy barrier close to the experimental estimation and corresponds to the nucleophilic attack of enzymatic Thr19 to the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate. Analysis of the electric field created by the protein sheds light on the role of certain residues and structural motifs in stabilizing the reaction transition state. The conclusions of this analysis are useful for rationalizing the properties of chimeras derived from gpASNase1 and predicting additional residue positions where mutations could enhance substrate binding and loop dynamics.

Therefore, to date, there is no systematic study focusing on comprehensively sampling the energetics of surface conformers of glycerol and their reactivity. In this study, we employ a message-passing graph neural network architecture (MACE) to develop a machine-learned force-field (MLFF) potential, utilizing active learning to investigate the impact of conformational complexity on the reaction network of glycerol HDO on a Cu(111) surface. Following five iterations, our trained MLFF model accurately predicts surface bound structures with a root-mean-square accuracy of 0.04 eV (< 0.6 meV/atom total energy), essential to accurately determine conformational minima of 24 meta-stable and 26 intermediate states along seven competitive pathways. Conformational sampling uncovers the intricate nature of the complex energy landscape, where conformers with multiple shallow minima lead to non-trivial trends in the transition state energies connecting them.  Notably, the investigations predict lower activation barriers for O-H bond scissions of glycerol structures with \u03b1- and \u03b3-backbone as compared to \u03b2-backbone. This is significant in case of scission of secondary O-H glycerol bonds where the activation barrier varies up to 0.44 eV depending upon the initial glycerol structure motif. Altogether, we identify dehydrogenation-dehydration-hydrogenation as dominant pathway resulting in PDO formation on the Cu(111) surface. The selectivity of glyceraldehyde towards C-H bond scission over C-OH bond scission explains higher selectivity of 1,2-PDO over 1,3-PDO.

Experimental studies have shown a lower-than-expected increase in PEMWE operation voltage under elevated pressure, but existing modelling approaches have difficulties to adequately explain these observations. Herein, a combined theoretical\u2013experimental approach is presented to elucidate the effect of pressure on water electrolysis kinetics in a PEMWE. Experiments, performed under differential and balanced pressure changes, clearly demonstrate a sub-Nernstian response of the PEMWE polarisation curve to pressure increase at both the hydrogen and oxygen electrodes. The kinetic origin of the effect was revealed by a novel modelling strategy accounting for the distinct contributions of the oxygen evolution (OER), hydrogen evolution (HER), and hydrogen oxidation (HOR) reactions to the activation losses, which are defined on a fixed reference potential scale. By simultaneously fitting the experimental data at multiple operating pressures, the sub-Nernstian voltage response is accurately reproduced and shown to arise from the superimposed kinetics of the OER, HER, and HOR. Effectively, increasing the operating pressure thereby transforms part of the irreversible activation losses into useful compression energy, thus enhancing the energy efficiency of the process. The model further demonstrates that deviations from Tafel-line behaviour observed at intermediate current densities are due to a decreased influence of the HOR reverse reaction at the hydrogen electrode.

Gas phase ion activation prior to IMS separation on sodiated \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-cyclodextrins generates isomeric species with different mobilities.

For this work, the guiding functions are functions of a subset of the $3N-6$ coordinates that are needed to describe the structure of the molecule of interest.  The DMC wave functions are used to evaluate intensities using two approaches.  In the trial wave function approach, the product of the molecular wave function for one of the states involved in the transition and the guiding function for the second state is used to evaluate the matrix elements of the dipole moment. In the descendant weighting approach  descendant weights are used  to evaluate  the value of the wave function for one of the states involved in the transition at the geometries sampled by the DMC wave function for the second state.  The descendant weighting approximation is shown to be  more accurate as well as computationally more expensive compared to approximations that are based on various forms of the trial wave function approach.  Strategies are explored, which combine results of different forms of the trial wave function approximation to minimize the errors in this approach.  The trial wave function and descendant weighting approaches are applied to a study of a harmonic oscillator, where the sensitivity of the calculated energies and intensities to the quality of the trial wave function is explored.   The two approaches are also applied to calculations of frequencies and intensities of transitions in water, H3O2- a four-dimensional model based on H3O2-, and H5O2+.

However, the use of thermoset matrices presents major challenges since they are oil-based, non-recyclable, and require energy-intensive curing processes, which diminishes their sustainability. Various proposed alternatives, particularly sustainable, dynamic matrices, have limited industrial applicability as they often lack the appropriate curing kinetics and viscosity needed for conventional composite processing techniques, such as Resin Transfer Molding (RTM). CO2-derived polyhydroxyurethanes (PHUs) show promise as NFC matrices but are hampered by poor processability and complex workup procedures, confining them mainly to laboratory settings. This study explores a synergetic copolymerization strategy that combines epoxy and PHU to allow fine-tuned polymerization kinetics and, thus, suitability for the RTM process. We demonstrate a synergetic catalytic effect that accelerates curing compared to each neat component. The formulation maintains a low viscosity (<5 Pa.s) at room temperature while curing within 30 minutes at 80\u00b0C\u2014unattainable conditions with pure PHUs. The RTM-made composite achieves a fiber volume fraction of 58-60% and a porosity below 1%, making it ideal for high-quality NFCs. Moreover, the catalyst-free dynamic matrix allows the reshaping after curing, and flax fibers can be easily separated without toxic reagents from the polymer under mild conditions (60\u00b0C for 2 hours) and reused, retaining properties similar to those of virgin yarns. This strategy could broaden the application of PHU chemistry in sustainable NFC manufacturing while preserving both natural and fossil feedstock.", "date": "2024-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Composites; Materials Processing; Cellulosic materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the Pt-catalyzed formation of reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl radicals (HO\u2022), can accelerate membrane degradation, requiring the use of a radical scavenger such as cerium-zirconium oxide. Given the short diffusion length of HO\u2022 in the PEM, it is necessary to position the cerium-zirconium oxide close to the Pt sites where radicals are catalytically produced, for timely scavenging. To address this issue, we propose the use of a bi-functional catalyst Pt/CexZr1\u2011xO2, where Pt particles are anchored on the CexZr1\u2011xO2 support. Adapting a one-pot polyol method, Pt/CexZr1\u2011xO2 catalysts were synthesized with Ce contents of x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1, and two Pt-to-oxide loadings of 0.5 and 5 wt %. The catalysts were then calcined at either 500 \u00b0C or 900 \u00b0C, and the resulting phases were characterized by high resolution X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement, nitrogen physisorption and transmission electron microscopy. It was observed that the cubic fluorite structure of ceria tends to be maintained with a higher Ce content, a lower Pt-to-oxide loading and a lower calcination temperature. Otherwise, the formation of tetragonal phase is favored. Pt was found to be mainly dispersed ionically when calcined at 500 \u00b0C, and to largely segregate into particles at 900 \u00b0C. Two selected compositions, namely 0.5\u2011Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and 5\u2011Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, were incorporated into the membrane for PEM water electrolysis cell measurements. A reduced content of H2 in O2 in the anode product gas and a lower fluoride release rate were observed using the composite membrane containing 5\u2011Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, compared to the blank measurement.

The characterization results obtained with LFAs were compared to those from traditional methods such as infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence labelling. The advantages of LFAs in characterizing such conjugated nanosystems were clearly demonstrated. The use of half-strip assays could not only confirm the presence of OVA on AuNPs but also enable the quantification of OVA bound per nanoparticle, offering a rapid and quantitative characterization method. Additionally, the assay showcased its versatility, as it was successfully applied to optimize the covalent coupling conditions of OVA on AuNPs, as well as to differentiate between covalently bound and adsorbed proteins. Furthermore, LFAs were employed to detect antibodies on functionalized nanoparticles, optimize their coupling to a newly developed organic coating, and confirm both the grafting of nucleic acids onto the surface and their pairing with complementary strands. These findings underscore the remarkable adaptability of LFAs for characterizing diverse nanoconjugates.

Fc preferentially adsorbs in a vertical configuration through the lower Cp ring on hollow sites, with adsorption energies of -0.87 eV (E-Fc) and -0.88 eV (S-Fc) on Au(111) and -0.79 eV for both conformers on Ag(111). These results confirm that Fc adsorptions are more stable on Au(111) than Ag(111), with negligible stability differences between the two conformers in vertical configurations. Parallel configurations are generally less stable; S-Fc cannot stably adsorb parallel on either surface, and E-Fc(||) exhibits significantly weaker adsorption energies (-0.82 eV on Au(111) and -0.62 eV on Ag(111)) than vertical configurations.

A distinctive region-specific charge transfer is observed in vertical configurations, where electrons flow from top-layer Au atoms to the Cp ring of Fc, forming an electron circuit that enhances adsorption strength. This feature is absent in parallel configurations, where charge transfer occurs uniformly from Fc to the surface, resulting in weaker adsorption.\nThese findings underscore the impact of adsorption geometry and surface type on Fc\u2019s stability and electronic interactions, offering valuable insights into its behavior on metallic surfaces.

Our results suggest that by capillary condensation alone these chemicals can transform hydrophobic soot particles into cloud condensation nuclei within a few hours. Additionally, capillary condensation induces compaction of fractal soot even at a moderately elevated relative humidity, changing its transport and optical properties.

The adsorption behavior of guest TIPB molecules into the host COF\u2019s pores is in-situ probed by high-resolution LT-STM. Our results reveal that the in-plane adsorption of TIPB molecules is pore-size-dependent and influenced by the interaction with substrate, with tetragon and pentagon lattices showing no molecule adsorption due to their small pore size. Hexagon and heptagon lattices can adsorb one TIPB molecule through I-H bonding, while octagon and nonagon lattices are able to accommodate two TIPB molecules through both I-H & I-I bonding. The substrate affects the in-plane adsorption. After annealing, the adsorbed molecules can form new covalent bonds with the COF lattice, resulting in the pore-size-dependent grafting of TIPB molecules at the COF branched chains.

Recently, modern LLMs have made significant progress in general reasoning tasks, making this kind of evaluation extremely interesting. In this paper, we address a major limitation in the current LLMs' assessment: the models are usually evaluated on English language, or on the multi-lingual benchmarks reflecting English-centric culture, obtained by the translation from the English originals. In the contrary, we test the ability of the modern LLM to deal with the questions of real human quiz games from non-English-speaking society. Namely, we apply LlaMa3-405B to solve the quiz tasks created by the \"What?Where?When?\" Russian-speaking intellectual gaming community. First, we show, that although the LLM demonstrates strong reasoning and linguistic proficiency in Russian language, the performance diminishes significantly because of the poor knowledge of culture-specific facts. Second, we show the importance of the reasoning strategy choice for answering medium-difficulty questions, for which the model \"posses\" the necessary knowledge, but the correct answer cannot be given immediately.

Dedicated approaches have been developed to achieve such highly desired properties including push-pull substitution, new chromophore designs, and physical means such as two-photon absorptions, sensitization, or upconversion. However, reaching further into the near infrared (NIR) has proven to be extremely challenging so far, raising the question whether viable photoswitching can actually go beyond 1000 nm. Here we use the concept of aggregation induced bathochromism (AIB) to enable direct excitation beyond 1000 nm for reversible photoswitching. Derivatives of the recently reported peri-anthracenethioindigo (PAT) can be aggregated into ca. 500 nm large particles, which shifts their absorption far beyond 1000 nm and into the short wavelength infrared (SWIR) region. Upon irradiation with 1020 nm light, the metastable Z isomer is obtained while at the same time the aggregates are dissolved. Photoisomerization of the Z isomer with orange or red light allows to return to the aggregated state establishing reversible beyond 1000 nm photoswitching. Further, a secondary and independent level of control is enabled via pH-dependent aggregation and deaggregation and corresponding absorption shifting. The resulting multi-stimuli responsiveness was applied in advanced molecular logic operations in the red and NIR absorption regime. AIB thus offers a highly promising way to realize extremely low-energy responsive photoswitching while at the same time allowing to control aggregation and dissolution behavior at the SWIR end of the electromagnetic spectrum.

To develop our improved MX-Raman methodology, we utilized post-mortem brain tissue from several neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) that have considerable clinical overlap. For improving our methodology we used three sources of spectral information arising from distinct physical phenomena to assess which was most important for NDD classification. Spectral measurements utilized combinations of data from multiple, distinct excitation laser wavelengths and polarization states to differentially probe molecular vibrations and autofluorescence signals. We demonstrate that the more informative MX-Raman (532nm-785nm) spectra are classified with 97.0% accuracy compared to conventional single-excitation Raman spectroscopy that resulted in 78.5% accuracy (532nm) or 85.9% accuracy (785nm) using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on 5 NDD classes. By combin-ing information from distinct laser polarizations we were also able to increase classification accuracy to 91.1% without the need of a second laser (785nm-785nm polarized), whereas combining Raman spectra with autofluorescence signals did not increase classification accuracy. Finally, by filtering out spectral features that were redundant for classification or not descriptive of disease class, we engineered spectral barcodes consisting of a minimal subset of highly disease-specific MX-Raman features that improved the unsupervised and cross-validated clustering of MX-Raman spectra. The results demonstrate that increasing spectral information content using our optical MX-Raman methodology enables enhanced identification and distinction of complex biological samples but only when that information is independent and descriptive of class.

For this reason, different descriptors have been developed to rationalize and quantify this phenomenon. Given that cyclic electron delocalization is an essential property of aromatic compounds, in this work, we propose six new aromatic descriptors based on Stone's distributed multipole analysis (DMA) to partition the molecular electron density on electric multipoles localized on different sites of a molecule. The new aromatic descriptors are based on different components of DMA quadrupole electric moment tensor Q_2, the first term of the DMA multipole expansion having contributions from the out-of-plane electron density. The proposed descriptors are straightforward to obtain because the DMA method is implemented on different popular electronic structure packages. For users of Gaussian, the formatted checkpoint with the calculated molecular electron density is used as input for the GDMA2 program of Stone to compute the necessary Q_2 components. The computer protocol for computing the Q_2-based descriptors in either way is presented. To assess the performance of the aromaticity descriptors, we used 12 tests of the Girona benchmark developed by the Sol\u00e0 group involving different distortions of benzene, substitutions, complexation, ring size dependence, atom size dependence, heteroatomic species, Clar systems, and fulvenes. The correct aromaticity trends of the six new indices were predicted entirely in 78% of the cases; for 16%, most trends were predicted and only failed utterly in 6%.

The reaction results of diverse substrates, such as alkanes, alcohols, ketones, terpenoids, and derivatives of amino acids, peptides, glucose, ribofuranose, phosphonates, and drugs, showed that this method is robust and efficient, and is useful for the late-stage C\u2013H functionalization of drugs and natural products.", "date": "2024-12-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Photochemistry (Org.); Chemical Biology; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In recent decades, the quality and quantity of available crystal structure data has exploded, in large part due to the advent of online crystal structure databases, increased use of in-situ and operando methodologies, and user-accessible beamlines. The new wealth of data has also spawned an increasing use of machine learning (ML) to either construct high-throughput surrogates of established analysis or extract patterns from large datasets. However, XRD spectroscopy has been for many years solved via Rietveld refinement, while most ML techniques are simply complex statistical evaluation methods that are physics-agnostic. The discrepancy between data analysis and the underlying physics can lead to incorrect conclusions and/or limit the wide-spread adoption of ML techniques. In this review, we bridge the gap between ML and XRD spectroscopy with an introduction designed both for new data scientists and experimentalists interested in problems related to ML-guided spectroscopy analysis. We cover how supervised ML methods are used to predict likely symmetries and phases in pure and mixed samples, including challenges related to experimental artifacts and model interpretation. We also review recent uses of unsupervised methods in the extraction of patterns hidden in high-dimensional data, such as in in-situ and microscopic studies. Finally, we discuss the importance of problem formulation, data transferability, and reporting with recent case studies and give various resources throughout to expedite the learning curve for readers new to XRD or ML. We advocate for greater scrutiny of ML methods, how they are presented in the literature, and how to conduct data-driven research responsibly.

The number average molecular weights of the precursors were 6 and 8 kDa, and the amine-to-aldehyde molar ratio (r) ranged between 0.8 and 2.4. The glass transition temperature exhibited a non-monotonic relationship with r. The linear viscoelasticity of PS-v was evaluated using a combination of small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), stress relaxation, and creep and recovery. Time-temperature superposition analyses indicated two distinct relaxation regimes: (I) fast high frequency dynamics with a Williams-Landel-Ferry temperature dependence and (II) slow low frequency dynamics with Arrhenius behavior. The fast regime represented the segmental relaxations of the vitrimer backbone. The slow regime was described as a Slow Arrhenius Process (SAP), in which the long time dynamics have a temperature-independent rheological activation energy. For all PS-v samples in this study, the observed SAP had a much weaker temperature dependence than expected from sticky Rouse model predictions. Increasing r altered the plateau modulus and SAOS cross-over frequency but did not affect the temperature dependences of the segmental motions or SAP.

High Mn content increased the average discharge voltage while maintaining specific discharge capacity, with 80 % Mn providing an 18 % boost to initial gravimetric energy density over LFP.

Much interest has therefore been devoted to linker design to fine-tune molecular and mechanistic properties of PROTACs. In this study, we present FerroTACs, a novel PROTAC design strategy incorporating ferrocene as the linker chemotype. We exemplify the approach across three different PROTAC systems: VHL-VHL (homo-PROTACs), VHL-CRBN, and VHL-BETs. We find that ferrocene\u2019s unique organometallic structure, featuring freely rotating cyclopentadienyl rings around a central Fe(II) ion, acts as a molecular hinge enabling dynamic conformational changes i.e., chameleonicity. Conformational analyses via NMR spectroscopy support ferrocene's role in fostering intramolecular interactions that result in a more folded state in an apolar environment. This property promotes compact conformations, improving cellular permeability and reducing efflux liabilities. Cellular assays demonstrate that FerroTACs exhibit robust target degradation and cell permeability profiles, en-par or enhanced compared to benchmark PROTACs CM11, 14a and MZ1.

However, traditional BU methods do not adequately account for variations in throughput and failure conditions, which can significantly impact gas composition and emission rates.\n\nThe Mechanistic Air Emissions Simulator (MAES) is a computer model developed to estimate methane and other hydrocarbon emissions from oil and gas facilities. MAES employs two distinct modeling approaches: mechanistic models and traditional methods.

The fluorescence emission of 12 is also sensitive to the polarity of the solvent.

Hyperpolarization of biomolecules (e.g., pyruvate) is of particular interest as it allows one to follow their metabolism, providing a diagnostic tool for various pathologies, including cancer. In this regard, the hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei is especially beneficial due to its relatively long hyperpolarization lifetime and the absence of a background signal. Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) is arguably the most affordable hyperpolarization technique. PHIP exploits the pairwise addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated substrate. This sets limitations on the range of compounds amenable to direct PHIP hyperpolarization. The range of molecules that can be hyperpolarized with PHIP significantly expanded in 2015 when PHIP by means of side arm hydrogenation (PHIP-SAH) was introduced. Here, parahydrogen is added to an unsaturated alcoholic moiety of an ester followed by polarization transfer to carboxylate 13C nuclei with a subsequent cleavage of the side arm. In this review, the recent advances in PHIP-SAH are discussed, including the synthetic methodology to produce isotopically labeled precursors, peculiarities of pairwise addition of parahydrogen to PHIP-SAH precursors, polarization transfer, cleavage of the side arm, purification of hyperpolarized solution, and, finally, in vitro and in vivo applications.", "date": "2024-12-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Utilization of quinone mediators by L. plantarum requires a type-II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2), however structural variations in the core of 1,4-naphthoquinone EET mediators has shown to yield significantly different current outputs. Herein, we assembled a library of 40 quinone-based EET mediators to probe the important physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions responsible for Ndh2-dependent EET in L. plantarum. The library was designed with inspiration from naturally-occurring metabolites, and assembly was focused on structural modifications that diversified polarity, reduction potential, and predicted free energy of binding to Ndh2 (\u0394Gcomp), as these properties are hypothesized to drive EET activity. In general, Ndh2-dependent EET activity in an iron(III) nanoparticle reduction assay significantly correlates to the mediator's polarity and \u0394Gcomp. Five mediators were analyzed in BESs with L. plantarum and each generated Ndh2-dependent current over background signal.

There is a growing interest within the metabolomics community in mining MS/MS-based data from public repositories. The theme of this protocol, reverse metabolomics, is a data science strategy that differs from the traditional LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach. In traditional untargeted metabolomics, we first collect the samples to address a predefined question and then collect LC-MS/MS data. We then identify metabolites associated with a phenotype (e.g., disease vs. healthy), and elucidate or validate their structural details (e.g., molecular formula, structural classification, substructure, or complete structural annotation or identification). Reverse metabolomics, however, does not necessarily involve collecting new data or requiring the structural characterization of molecules. Instead, we start with MS/MS spectra for known or unknown molecules and discover phenotype-relevant information such as organ/biofluid distribution, disease condition, intervention status (e.g., pre- and post-intervention), organisms (e.g., mammals vs. others), geography, and any other biologically relevant associations available in public repositories. This protocol guides the reader through the step-by-step process of utilizing available MS/MS data and discovering repository-scale associations of the associated MS/MS spectra. As example, we utilize MS/MS spectra from three small molecules: phenylalanine-cholic acid (a microbially conjugated bile acid), phenylalanine-C4:0, and histidine-C4:0 (two N-acyl amides).

However, non-specific adsorption of unrelated proteins and other biomolecules present in the cell environment can potentially mask the intended protein presentation. Recently surface-grafted peptoid-based polymer brushes, both neutral and zwitterionic, have emerged as candidate surfaces for resisting protein adsorption and anti-fouling applications due to their strong hydration and chain flexibility. On the other hand, specific peptoid sequences may also be prepared to enable specific protein binding interactions. However, molecular level insight into peptoid and brush interactions with proteins are both lacking. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we investigated the interaction of the fibronectin (Fn) FnIII9\u221210 domains, which exhibit fibronectin\u2019s integrin cell adhesive motifs, with neutral polysarcosine and a sequence specific zwitterionic analog. As expected, peptoids simulated at different grafting densities exhibited protein adsorbing and antifouling regimes. however, comparison of independent adsorption simulations, including with different starting orientations of the protein, identified regions of FnIII9\u221210 that are typically involved in peptoid interactions, suggesting a degree of specificity in this. The binding regions were distinct from the integrin binding motifs and different interactions were observed between polysarcosine and the zwitterionic sequence. Unlike typical protein-surface adsorption, the specific interactions are driven by polar interactions. These observations give new insight into protein- surface interactions, which can be used to guide the development of new biomaterials.", "date": "2024-12-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, NiOOH is only stable at potentials \u2265 1.5V vs RHE, with Ni(OH)2 being the stable reduced form at lower potentials. The potential of the phase transition from inactive Ni(OH)2 to active NiOOH can be tuned by doping. Lowering the potential for reaching the phase-transition is thought to be beneficial for lowering the overpotential of oxidation reactions catalysed by NiOOH. Here, we investigate which first row transition metals are most plausible for this purpose: First, the doped structure should be more stable than the phase-segregated system and second the potential for reaching the NiOOH-like phase should be lower compared to the pure Ni compound. Substitutional doping of NiOOH is found to be plausible for many dopants, but only V can be incorporated exothermically compared to their pure oxyhydroxides. Furthermore, dopants lead to a substantial lowering in the potential necessary to reach the phase transition. Since catalysis is more a surface than a bulk process, we then investigate the surface state of NiOOH and the impact of substitutional doping on it. To address this question, we apply grand-canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) in order to explicitly account for the electrochemical potential. We find that the stoichiometric surface (50% hydrogen coverage) is the most stable one over a large range of relevant potentials at pH 14. Oxidizing the surface lowers the hydrogen coverage and occurs at about 1.7 V vs RHE, i.e.,\u223c0.2 V less positive compared to the potential of the phase transition. At a doping level of 25%, only V and Cr allow to stabilize NiIII at significantly lower potentials compared to pure NiOOH (down to 1.1 V vs RHE) in the bulk.

This is commonly compensated by applying high pressures, but large recycle ratios and purging losses are still unavoidable. Equilibrium limitations can alternatively be evaded by sorption-enhancement, where NH3 is selectively removed from the reaction mixture by a solid sorbent material. One material class commonly applied in this approach are metal halides like MgCl2, as they typically show high NH3 capacity even at elevated temperatures. In this study, a thermodynamic equilibrium model based on Gibbs energy minimization was established that is able to predict the simultaneous NH3 synthesis and sorption equilibrium. After parameterization for metal chloride-based sorbents, the model is used to estimate the potential extent of sorption-enhancement of the NH3 synthesis in equilibrium. For kinetic studies under realistic operation conditions, a reactor model was established using kinetics for both iron and ruthenium-based catalysts. Simulations reveal that near-full conversion is possible in sorption-enhanced NH3 synthesis under a wide range of realistic operating conditions. In that way the integration of a sorbent material into the NH3 synthesis reaction results in increased conversion, but at the same time also allows for a higher NH3 productivity. While it has been demonstrated experimentally before, these findings quantify and emphasize the vast potential of sorption-enhanced NH3 synthesis under a wide range of conditions.", "date": "2024-12-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Thermodynamics (Chem.

Here, we model the folding landscapes of twelve linear and cyclic peptide beta hairpin mimics studied by the Erdelyi group, with the goal of reproducing the effects of subtle chemical modifications on peptide folding stability. The Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) algorithm was first used to refine Karplus parameters to obtain an optimal forward model for scalar coupling constants; then, BICePs was used to reweight conformational ensembles against experimental NMR observables (NOE distances, chemical shifts, and 3JHNH\u03b1 scalar couplings).

An in vitro one-pot synthetic biology approach was developed to investigate the specificity and kinetics of GT O-GalNAc glycosylation that leads to tumor antigen glycoforms of mucin 1 (MUC1).  The focus is to experimentally simulate the divergent glycosylation pathways that lead to the synthesis of cancer-associated antigens (Tn, T) and their sialylated derivatives. First, the biosynthetic details of the defining first step of GALNT re-localization from the ER to the Golgi was modeled using the one-pot method. Our findings reveal that an ER enriched with GALNTs results in complete Galnac (Tn) MUC1 site occupancy. This comes about as a function of two pro-cesses that are i) extended GALNT reaction time and ii) prevention of inhibition by subsequent glycosylation enzymes like C1GALT1. The modeling confirms that B3GNT6 has negligible specificity for MUC1 Tn, explaining the absence of core 3 and core 4 structures in MUC1 in both normal and cancerous breast cell lines. Moreover, ST6GALNAC1, and not ST6GALNAC2, is primarily responsible for \u03b1-2-6 sialylation of Tn and T antigens. Computer reaction dynamic simulations combined with kinetic experimental analysis show that ST6GALNAC1 prefers fully glycosylated MUC1 but moreover that its preference is the sialyation the S9 and T13 sites in the SAPDTR motif. This is especially the case when MUC1 concentra-tion is great (i.e., highly expressed), suggesting that sTn upregulation on MUC1 in cancer is linked to the occupancy status of S9 and T13 glycosylated sites, that were previously found to be cancer-associated. The results from the one-pot synthesis approach presented here demonstrate its ability to simulate cellular glycosylation within the Golgi-ER.  This systems model-ling unpacks the molecular details of enzyme localization and substrate glycan occupancy that is fundamental to the regulatory mechanisms that gives rise to tumor-associated MUC1 antigens.", "date": "2024-12-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Besides direct application it is used for training models aimed at predicting retention times in HPLC. Although there are quite a number of articles featuring METLIN SMRT, the pipelines used for filtering from errors are either simplistic or nonexistent. Two more datasets of HPLC retention times - RepoRT and MCMRT - have emerged recently. RepoRT maintainers used a 10-fold cross-validation strategy with gradient boosting models to validate retention times in the database. MCMRT maintainers suggested a projection method for transferring retention times from one chromatographic method to another, but there is no information about applying the method for data validation. Therefore, a reliable method for filtering potentially erroneous entries is still required. \n\nResults:\nAn approach to filter potentially erroneous entries, as suggested in our earlier work for a database of gas chromatography retention indexes, was repurposed for METLIN SMRT using five predictive models (GNN, CNN, FCFP, FCD, and CatBoost). The retention times were predicted for the whole dataset using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. Entries with retention times differing significantly from the predictions (bottom 5%) were flagged with a \u201cyellow card\u201d. This procedure was repeated for each model, leading to obtaining a group containing 1544 entries (about 2% of the dataset) with 5 \u201cyellow cards\u201d. These entries were considered potentially erroneous, as anomalous behavior was observed in the analyzed trends (with the increasing number of \u201cyellow cards\u201d) for both the size of each group and the standard deviation of the predictions. \n\nSignificance:\nThe previously proposed filtering approach  was expanded to a retention time database, enabling finding potentially erroneous entries in METLIN SMRT.

Despite significant progress in PSC technology, defects within the perovskite material continue to pose challenges, leading to reduced efficiency and stability of the devices. CsPbI3 perovskites have shown potential, but trap states induced by surface defects remain a challenge. The use of fullerene-derivatives, like C60 and PC61BM, has been highlighted to enhance the device stability eliminating/reducing hysteresis and passivating trap states. However, the mechanisms behind fullerene-induced passivation of trap states and their impact on surface energetics remain unclear. This study employs periodic density functional theory (DFT) simulations to explore the interaction between C60, PC61BM, and CsPbI3 (001) surface, with and without defects (cesium vacancy, lead vacancy, and I-antisite). The DFT simulations reveal that both C60 and PC61BM effectively passivate trap states induced by I-antisite defects by reorienting and reorganizing the iodine atoms that promote the presence of trap states. This work contributes to understanding the fundamental aspects of surface-defect interactions in CsPbI3 perovskites. Both C60 and PC61BM play a crucial role in passivating trap states, causing atomic reorganization and avoiding the nonradiative recombination.

Recently, ion mobility spectrometry has been combined with liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-HRMS) to assess PFAS. Interestingly, using negative electrospray ionization, per-fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) form homodimers ([2M-H]-), a phenomenon observed with trapped, traveling wave, and drift-tube IMS. In addition to the limited research on their effect on analytical performance, there is little information on the conformations these dimers can adopt. This study aimed to propose most probable conformations for PFCA dimers. Based on qualitative analysis of how collision cross section (CCS) values change with the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of PFCA ions, the PFCA dimers were hypothesized to likely adopt a V-shaped structure. To support this assumption, in silico geometry optimizations were performed to generate a set of conformers for each possible dimer. A CCS value was then calculated for each conformer using the trajectory method with Lennard-Jones and ion-quadrupole potentials. Among these conformers, at least one of the ten lowest-energy conformers identified for each dimer exhibited theoretical CCS values within a \u00b12% error margin compared to the experimental data, qualifying them as plausible structures for the dimers.

In this work, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to characterize ion transport with first principles-level accuracy in aqueous NaCl confined to graphene slit pores. We find that ionic conductivity decreases as the degree of confinement increases, a trend governed by changes in both ion self-diffusion and dynamic ion-ion correlations.

We further observe a shift in the ions' diffusion mechanism towards more vehicular motion as the degree of confinement increases. Non-ideal (beyond Nernst-Einstein) contributions to transport become more prominent under confinement due to increased cation-anion correlations arising from long-lived contact ion pairs.

In this work, we present a joint experimental-theoretical study of the vibrational and photophysical properties of microhydrated protonated and deprotonated 4 benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA), a key model system for environmental photosensitizers.

Comparing the experimental UV-Vis spectra and quantum chemistry-predicted spectra of 4 BBA+\u2219(H2O)0-2, we find that the degree of microhydration has little effect on the UV-Vis spectra or the orbitals of the dominant feature.  For deprotonated 4-BBA\u2012, representing photosensitizers in basic conditions, quantum chemistry calculations predict that the UV-Vis spectra are ~3x weaker in intensity than the brightest 4 BBAH+\u2219(H2O)0-1 features and were not observed experimentally.

After cycling, the surface densified phase resembles Ni5O8 , with 25% Ni in the Li layer forming a similar superlattice. These Ni pin nearby Li, suppressing vacancy formation at the surface and kinetically trapping Li inside. Meanwhile, the Ni5O8 phase exhibits high diffusivity for Li interstitials in the superlattice, which explains the minimal resistance increase during discharge at the same Li content.

Herein, we carried out density functional theory-based screening of metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) single-atom catalysts for electrocatalytic furfural reduction. Using furfural\u2019s adsorption strength as a descriptor, we identified CrNC to be promising to promote furfuryl alcohol production in contrast to other single atom motifs which are only selective to hydrofuroin. Its higher selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol can be attributed to the enhanced adsorption strength of furfural via chemisorption of the carbonyl group and its overall enhanced oxygen binding strength. We then synthesized the single-atom motifs via their incorporation in a highly porous nitrogen doped carbon synthesized through an ionothermal templating process. In agreement with our predictions, CrNC was able to produce furfuryl alcohol with Faradaic efficiency of ca. 18 %, while Co-, Fe- and NiNC motifs selectively produce hydrofuroin, with limited Faradaic efficiencies to furfuryl alcohol < 3 %.

Consequently, electronic structure calculations of such species often necessitate multireference approaches. However, widespread use of multireference methods is hindered due to the active space selection problem, which has historically required system-specific chemical knowledge and a trial-and-error approach. Here, we address this issue with an automated method combining the approximate pair coefficient (APC) scheme for estimating orbital entropies with the discrete variational selection (DVS) approach for evaluating active space quality. We apply DVS-APC to the calculation of 67 vertical excitations in transition metal diatomics as well as to two larger complexes. We show DVS-APC generated active spaces yield NEVPT2 mean absolute errors of 0.18 eV, in line with previous accuracies obtained for organic systems, but larger than errors achieved with hand-selected active spaces (0.14 eV). If instead of using DVS we identify the best results from our trial wave functions, we find improved performance (mean absolute error of 0.1 eV) over the manually selected results. We highlight this deviation between DVS and hand selected active spaces as a possible measure of bias introduced when hand selecting active spaces. However, we find that multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) using the tPBE and tPBE0 functionals is roughly 0.15 eV less accurate than NEVPT2 across this class of diatomic systems, potentially accounting for the decreased performance of DVS-APC, which uses MC-PDFT energies to select between active spaces. We also showcase an ability to ``down-sample'' the DVS-APC wave functions using natural orbital occupancies to achieve smaller minimal active spaces which retain the accuracy of the larger starting active spaces. Finally, DVS-APC and tPBE0 are proven to be effective when applied to modeling excited states in two larger transition metal complexes, suggesting that the transition metal diatomics may be a particular outstanding challenge for DVS-APC and MC-PDFT approaches.", "date": "2024-12-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This process is mediated by direct translocation of FGF2 across the plasma membrane into the extracellular space. It requires several components that are asymmetrically distributed between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane. At the inner plasma membrane leaflet, FGF2 undergoes sequential interactions with the Na,K-ATPase, Tec kinase, and the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. While the Na,K-ATPase, and Tec kinase are auxiliary factors, interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P2 trigger the core mechanism of FGF2 membrane translocation, inducing FGF2-oligomerization-dependent formation of lipidic membrane pores. At the outer plasma membrane leaflet, membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers are captured and disassembled by Glypican-1 (GPC1), resulting in translocation of FGF2 to the cell surface.  In a cellular context, a single FGF2 membrane translocation event occurs within 200 milliseconds. By contrast, in vitro, using a fully reconstituted liposomal inside-out system with FGF2 added from the outside and luminal encapsulation of high affinity heparin molecules, FGF2 membrane translocation takes several minutes. Here, we hypothesize the observed difference to be, at least in part, due to the asymmetrical membrane lipid distribution and the spatial organization of the FGF2 translocation machinery in native plasma membranes. We suggest the molecular machinery mediating FGF2 membrane translocation to assemble in ordered nanodomains, characterized by sphingomyelin (SM), cholesterol and phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 coupled together. The transbilayer asymmetry of these lipids likely plays a crucial role in regulating the thermodynamics and kinetics of FGF2-induced membrane pore formation. Therefore, succeeding in reconstituting the FGF2 translocation machinery in artificial membranes with an asymmetric transbilayer distribution of SM and PI(4,5)P2 and other membrane lipids may reveal a direct impact on pore opening kinetics.  Similarly, disrupting lipid asymmetry in cells may significantly impact FGF2 secretion rates, a finding that would underscore the importance of the spatial organization of lipids in membrane dynamics. Testing this hypothesis may advance our understanding of how membrane asymmetry and ordered lipid nanodomains regulate critical biological processes, such as the unconventional secretion of FGF2.", "date": "2024-12-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The tissue-selective degraders are composed of recently reported highly potent BRD4 intramolecular bivalent molecular glue degraders and ligands of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The selective degradation of BRD4 was validated both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of action was further confirmed through PSMA inhibitor competition. In vivo, selective degradation was observed starting at a dose as low as 1x10-4 mg/kg. This work established a strategy for PSMA targeted delivery of degraders, expanding their potential for clinical applications.

To show a negative \u0394EST, a non-overlapping HOMO and LUMO arrangement is crucial to minimize the exchange interaction in the excited state. We revisited the electronic structure of cyclazine, consisting of cyclododecahexaene ([12]annulene) and a central nitrogen atom. The 12 \u03c0-electrons of the peripheral cyclic oligoene play an important role in achieving the non-overlapping HOMO and LUMO arrangement, and the bridging by the nitrogen atom inside produces the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO while maintaining a stable planar structure. Based on these insights, we designed a set of 10 molecules in which the number of \u03c0-electrons (N) in the peripheral cyclic oligoene is 16, 20, and 24, satisfying N = 4\u00b7n (n = 4, 5, 6), and a further set of 11 molecules in which N in the peripheral cyclic oligoene is extended to 14, 18, 22, and 26, satisfying N = 4\u00b7n + 2 (n = 3, 4, 5, 6). HOMO, LUMO, and \u0394EST were calculated using CIS, TD-DFT, and EOM-CCSD with the structure optimized without any symmetry constraint. Among the molecular structures with N = 4\u00b7n, only the molecules without bond alternation exhibit a non-overlapping HOMO and LUMO and a small \u0394EST. In contrast, among the molecular structures with N = 4\u00b7n + 2, none of the molecules exhibit a non-overlapping HOMO and LUMO arrangement. The molecules with both N = 4\u00b7n and no bond alternation show negative \u0394EST in the EOM-CCSD calculation.

Under optimised conditions (pH 4.0, 1:1 Fe\u00b2\u207a: H\u2082O\u2082 molar ratio), 59% of \u03a3OMs were degraded in unconcentrated urine treated with 1 g H\u2082O\u2082 L\u207b\u00b9. Increasing the H2O2 dose in unconcentrated urine, or treating concentrated urine obtained through evaporative water removal, resulted in higher \u03a3OMs degradation but also increased urea oxidation, highlighting a trade-off between efficient COD removal and nutrient recovery. COD removal was 38% at pH 4.0 and 27% at pH 6.0, suggesting that Fenton oxidation could be applied to H\u2082O\u2082 stabilised urine without strict pH adjustment. Real urine differed significantly from synthetic urine, requiring five times more Fe\u00b2\u207a catalyst for complete H\u2082O\u2082 activation and reaching equilibrium within five minutes compared to two hours in synthetic urine. Organic compounds in urine scavenged Fe\u00b3\u207a, forming iron-organic complexes that disrupted Fe\u00b2\u207a regeneration and contributed to iron precipitation at higher pH values.

Previously, we identified peptide sequences derived from enhancing factor-C (EF-C), which are neurotrophic without additional supplements or growth factors. Here, a library of nine EF-C variants is designed by varying the hydrophobic core of the peptide backbone since a detailed understanding of how hydrophobic interactions impact self-assembly and, subsequently, bioactivity is lacking. The physicochemical properties, including binding affinity, secondary structure, and assembled morphologies, of these variants are thoroughly analyzed. To obtain information at the molecular level, computer simulations based on AlphaFold 3 models are used to investigate the stability of EF-C peptide fibrils and their assembly. Our simulations provide theoretical insights that explain the differential assembly and stability of EF-C variants. In addition, the EF-C variants are tested for bioactivity in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) to establish the structure-property relationship.

This approach may provide an alternative way to modulate cellular behaviors if such molecules can be synthesized with spatiotemporal control on specific cell types in living systems; furthermore, restricting synthesis to well-defined cells or cell-types would enable a potentially transformative approach of treating cells as separable reaction vessels within living organisms. Herein, we use genetic targeting to incorporate an organic photocatalytic dye onto specific cell types to enable in-situ light-controlled and spatially defined chemical synthesis of non-natural molecules.

Modifying available achiral structure-bearing MOF scaffolds is a preferred method to extend this class of materials. Reported postsynthetic covalent chiralizations generally lead to uniform, site-specific modifications. The use of chemically versatile modifying agents, like aldehydes, may instead result in the statistical formation of chemically non-uniform anchored products. In addition, use of such modifying agents gives rise to spatial non-uniformities in the radial direction, due to prohibited diffusion through the MOF bulk. The advantageous grain structure formation plus molecular non-uniformity greatly increase the complexity of such systems. The use of such modifying agents, therefore, necessitates a broader, holistic characterization. The present work explores the adaptation of imine chemistry for post-synthetic chiralization. A chiral aldehyde and a chiral ketone are probed on two amine-functionalized MOF substrates - MIL-125 NH2, and UiO-66 NH2. The UiO-66 NH2 modified with the natural product-derived (R)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-carboxaldehyde ((R)-1 aldehyde) is found to have the best performance in terms of reactivity and MOF stability. A comprehensive toolbox of methods was demonstrated to robustly characterize the obtained material. This includes high-resolution accurate mass electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRAM-ESI-MS) to reveal the competing reactions that yield a statistical set of oligomer-rich structures. In silico modeling correctly predicts the localization of the modification. The modification is found to be covalent, chiral, and mainly proceeding through imine formation, resulting in a surface enantioselector display formation.

These degradation processes are generally studied separately, so the relationship between the two is poorly understood. Previously, it had been assumed that the main contribution to battery capacity fade was electrochemical degradation of the electrolytes. Using the on-line 1H NMR crossover characterization method we developed previously, we reveal the first evidence for crossover-driven side reactions in redox flow batteries.

We further introduce simple \u2018simulated-crossover\u2019 experiments to identify anolyte-catholyte combinations where these processes are occurring. Using these simulated-crossover experiments, we find that crossover-driven side reactions can be mitigated by avoiding the use of anolytes with hydroxyl functional groups when using ferrocyanide electrolytes.

This study leverages recent advancements in semiempirical quantum-mechanical and implicit solvent approaches embodied in the PM6-D3H4S/COSMO2 method for the development of a hierarchical computational protocols encompassing molecular dynamics, fragmentation, and virtual glycine scan techniques for the investigation of flexible protein-protein interactions. As a model, the binding of insulin to its receptor is selected, a complex and dynamic process that has been extensively studied experimentally. The interaction energies calculated at this level in ten molecular dynamics snapshots did not correlate with molecular mechanics/generalized Born interaction energies because only the former method is able to describe non-additive effects. This became evident in the examination of the energetics in small-model dimers featuring all the present types of non-covalent interactions with respect to DFT-D3 calculations. The virtual glycine scan has identified 16 hotspot residues on insulin and 15 on the insulin receptor, and their contributions have been quantified using PM6-D3H4S/COSMO2. The accuracy and credibility of the approach are further supported by the fact that all the insulin hotspots have previously been confirmed by biochemical and structural evidence. The modular nature of the protocol has enabled the formulation of several variants, each tailored to specific accuracy and efficiency requirements. The developed computational strategy is firmly rooted in general biophysical chemistry and is thus offered as a general tool for the quantification of interactions across relevant flexible protein-protein interfaces.", "date": "2024-12-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Contrary to the traditional viewpoint, we find that mesoporosity does not necessarily correlate with high supercapacitor rate capability. Instead, we employed pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance to directly measure anionic effective diffusivities in the carbon pores, offering a probe of ionic transport in supercapacitors. Our findings reveal a significant discrepancy between short-range and long-range diffusivities, which captures the tortuosity of the pore network. Short-range diffusivities lack correlation with supercapacitor rate capability, whereas long-range diffusivities correlate strongly. Ultimately, low-tortuosity nanoporous carbons exhibited superior rate capability, highlighting the importance of well-interconnected pore networks for efficient ion transport.

Prenyl chains are synthesized by prenyltransferase proteins. Despite their structural similarity, prenyltransferases exhibit substantial functional diversity to create lipophilic products of varying lengths. Human \\textit{cis}-prenyltransferase (h-cisPT) is a tetrameric enzyme responsible for the synthesis of long prenyl chains, consisting of ~20-prenyl-unit products that are essential to specific posttranslational modifications such as N-glycosylation upon downstream processing. These long products are hypothesized to transfer from h-cisPT to the ER membrane, but the mechanism of this transfer is not known. We use molecular dynamics simulations to identify a consistent membrane binding pose for h-cisPT. By quantifying protein-membrane contacts, we identify the aromatic amino acid residues in the conserved catalytic domain as critical to membrane binding. Determining relative protein-membrane binding free energies through free energy perturbation highlights the importance of these residues for membrane association, as mutations lower membrane affinity by as much as 27 kcal/mol. These results are validated using FRET to demonstrate decreased catalytic activity and membrane binding in response to mutation. Together, our results suggest a possible mechanism for prenyl substrate transfer, where key aromatic residues facilitate h-cisPT binding to the ER membrane in an orientation which holds the substrate-containing active site near to the membrane surface. Molecular dynamics simulations of the mutant exhibiting lower FRET show greater orientational variability relative to wild type.

However, donor functionalized tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl radicals show lower quantum yield than their perchlorinated derivatives, likely due to weaker donor-acceptor electronic coupling and enhanced non-radiative decay. We present a novel trityl derivative with two additional chlorines that restrict the orientation of the donor to a nearly perpendicular arrangement towards the trityl plane, minimizing vibronic coupling and non-radiative losses. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that this steric con-straint improves the photoluminescence quantum yield compared to the tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl analogues.

MOFsyn Agent is an integrated system comprising two core components: data automatic analyzer and material mechanism analyzer.

Furthermore, the incorporation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology enables MOFsyn Agent to access external knowledge bases in real time, significantly enhancing its domain applicability in MOFs synthesis. Taking Ni@UiO-66(Ce) as an illustrative example, MOFsyn Agent conducted a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between synthetic conditions, structural characteristics, and catalytic performance. Through machine learning (ML), key features such as nickel content and metallic nickel were identified.

Despite its long research history, the behavior of SIC under complex deformation conditions, frequently encountered in NR products, remains incompletely understood. This study visualizes the evolution of non-uniform SIC under heterogeneous deformation using a specially designed tensile geometry. This experimental configuration induces diverse local deformation modes, including uniaxial, planar and biaxial stretching, within a single tensile test. By integrating digital image correlation and high-speed infrared thermography, we successfully map the spatial distribution of strain and the associated crystallinity evolution across the specimen. The findings reveal that local SIC initiates at nearly the same critical longitudinal strain, regardless of local strain biaxiality, characterized by the lateral-to-longitudinal true strain ratio (m12 = -e2/e1). In contrast, the subsequent evolution of SIC is strongly influenced by local deformation characteristics, specifically the longitudinal true strain (e1) and m12. At a constant m12 (representing a fixed deformation mode), local crystallinity (c) increases with 1. Conversely, at a constant e1,  c increases with m12, indicating that uniaxial stretching promotes higher crystallization when compared to other deformation modes at equivalent longitudinal strains. Classical models based solely on conformational entropy reduction fail to capture these strain-biaxiality effects, underscoring the necessity of incorporating m12 into predictive frameworks. The observed strain-crystallinity relationship is effectively described by a unified model, comprising of a quadratic dependence of e1 and a linear dependence of m12. This model enables a comprehensive visualization of crystallinity evolution during non-uniform deformation, providing deeper insights into SIC mechanisms.

The LJSPM offers a significant means for developing physical-based non-bonded interaction parameters in CG models.

This study addresses the classification of QDs synthesized in a tubular flow reactor consisting of a mixture of the desired InP/ZnS core-shell QDs and QDs made from the shell material, i.e., here ZnS QDs formed as a byproduct during the ZnS shell formation step. The formation of nanoparticles from the shelling material introduces a heterogeneity in size and composition and affects the optical properties of the resulting QDs. To address this issue, we developed a size-selective agglomeration (SSA) technique by incrementally introducing ethanol as a poor solvent and classified the synthesized QDs into 13 distinct fractions. These 13 fractions sorted into 3 distinct groups: (i) larger InP/ZnS QDs, (ii) a combination of smaller InP/ZnS QDs and larger ZnS QDs, and (iii) predominant ZnS QDs with some very tiny InP/ZnS QDs. The comprehensive characterization of the fractions was conducted using UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). We could demonstrate that our method effectively separated unwanted ZnS QDs from the target InP/ZnS QDs. In addition, the fractions enriched in smaller InP/ZnS QDs exhibited a higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) compared to the fractions with larger QDs. This demonstrates the efficacy of SSA in fine-tuning the composition of QD mixtures produced on a larger scale to improve their functional properties. In the future, this approach can pave the way towards a scalable two-dimensional classification process for such ultra-small nanoparticles by particle size and composition.", "date": "2024-12-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Core-Shell Materials; Optical Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inorganic solid electrolytes offer a promising solution by acting as barriers to polysulfide migration, mitigating capacity loss. While the sequential formation of cycling products in molten-electrode and liquid electrolytes-based Na-S batteries generally aligns with the expectations from the Na-S phase diagram, their presence, stability, and transitory behavior in systems with inorganic solid electrolytes at room temperature, remain poorly understood. To address this, we employed operando scanning micro-beam X-ray diffraction and ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the sulfur conversion mechanisms in Na-S cells with Na3PS4 and Na4(B10H10)(B12H12) electrolytes. Our findings reveal the formation of crystalline and amorphous polysulfides, including those predicted by the Na-S phase diagram (e.g., Na2S5, Na2S4, Na2S2, Na2S), high-order polysulfides observed in liquid-electrolyte systems (e.g., Na2Sx, where x = 6\u20138), and phases like Na2S3 typically stable only under high-temperature or high-pressure conditions.

Here we report the use of in situ FTIR spectroscopy to measure the Ka values of supramolecular host-guest complexes across three classes of host-guest complexes using different types of interactions including hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding. This approach can be performed with minimal sample preparation, does not require deuterated solvents, can measure asso-ciation based on changes in host or guest vibrations, and benefits from a much shorter timescale than NMR spectroscopy. Due to its fast timescale, FTIR spectroscopy also provides details on host/guest conformational changes, such as the presence of unsymmetrical host conformation that are not in the ideal binding conformation until treatment with a suitable guest, which would otherwise not be observed in more common time-averaged NMR measurements. Using this approach, we demonstrated the capabilities and challenges of this technique to investigate host-guest interactions of three anion receptors that use hydrogen or halogen bonding with both mono- and polyatomic anions. In addition to directly observing how host-guest interactions impact bonding within the individual molecules, we also demonstrate that global fitting of the FTIR spectra is an effective and robust approach to measure Ka values of these host-guest complexes.

Based on Raman spectroscopy data of electrolyte and electrochemical investigations on non-porous electrodes, modification in the classical Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) model has been proposed by incorporating ionicity to estimate Debye length. The modified model shows a sharp Debye length decrease as the concentration rises from 1 to 10 mol\u2219kg\u207b\u00b9 but an increase beyond 10 mol\u2219kg\u207b\u00b9 due to ion pairing.

The data obtained for non-porous electrodes was adjusted by dividing it with the MacMullin number of the carbon electrode to estimate the Debye length in pores. Further, introducing the MacMullin number into the Stokes-Einstein equation enabled the estimation of ionic radii within pores, which was subsequently utilized to calculate extent of ion desolvation/dehydration in micro- and mesopores.

NLDH by itself generates trace amounts of NO in the air due to the left-shifting of the protonation equilibrium of NO2\u2012 by aerial CO2 and H2O (2[NO2\u2012]LDH + CO2 + H2O \u21cc 2HNO2\u2191 + [CO32\u2012]LDH), which is followed by disproportionation of 2HNO2 to NO, NO2 and H2O. In contrast, it was found that the protonation equilibrium can be shifted to the right side when volatile acid products (HNO2 and NO2) are readily converted to neutral NO over the AASiO2 reductant. Based on this, even a single tablet (containing 0.30 g NLDH and 0.90 g AASiO2) generates 5~20 ppm NO at 0.5 L/min for 24 h, which is sufficient to be useful for the relief of severe hypoxia caused by persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Moreover, the tablet can be activated by exhaled breath for high-dose iNO therapy (80~180 ppm for several hours), revealing its potential utility for treating viral pneumonia. The NO tablet can be stored stably over long periods at ambient temperature in a gas barrier bag, and has the potential to break the logistical, financial, and operational barriers that have long existed to the widespread implementation of iNO therapy.", "date": "2024-12-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Solid State Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This work presents a novel two-channel model to elucidate the vibrational heat transport in semiconducting polymers with extended side chains. We reveal a striking splitting of vibrational modes along the polymer chain, which is driven by the significant difference in force constants between the covalent bonds of the backbone and the van der Waals forces between the side chains. This leads to the emergence of two distinct longitudinal acoustic-like branches: a dominant backbone branch, featuring phonon-like propagons that predominantly dictate thermal conductivity, and a side chain branch, primarily composed of non-propagating diffusons, contributing minimally to heat transport. The reduced thermal conductivity of these polymer semiconductors relative to their side chain-free counterparts is attributed to phonon scattering with the low-frequency optical modes of the side chains, as validated by both first-principles calculations and inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Our findings highlight that the strategic modification of side chains offers a potent approach for fine-tuning thermal conductivity, as demonstrated by substituting side chain atoms with heavier elements.

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus encased in a lipid envelope that houses key structural proteins, including the Spike glycoprotein, which mediates viral entry into host cells. Within the Spike protein, the S2 subunit, and particularly its fusion domain, plays a critical role in merging viral and host membranes. Understanding the fusion domain interactions at the molecular level is important for advancing applications such as the development of novel antiviral therapies. This study investigates the self-assembly of SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit fusion peptides (FPs) and their interaction with biomimetic plasma membrane (PM) models composed of physiological mixes of phospholipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. Complementary techniques, including atomic force microscopy, neutron reflectometry and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, provided detailed insights into lipid nano-mechanics and in-plane molecular structure. Our findings reveal several types of FP assemblies at the PM interface, including the formation of rigid fibres, spiral structures, and segregated domains. These behaviours are influenced by FP intrinsic features such as hydrophobicity and molecular structure, and the resultant interactions with lipid headgroups and tail regions. This work enhances our molecular-level understanding of FP-lipid interactions, shedding light on viral entry mechanisms. Furthermore, the ability of these peptides to self-assemble, modulated by the surrounding lipid environment, positions them as promising building blocks for innovative functional biomaterials.

Specifically, the MAO enzyme catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a variety of monoamines. This reaction leads to the formation of aldehydes, together with H2O2 and ammonia. Hydrogen peroxide can generate additional reactive oxygen species (ROS), this way leading to neurotoxicity. When MAO is activated, it induces the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition via abnormal cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and contributes to the generation of neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive impairment due to neuronal loss. MAO has two isoforms: MAO-A and MAO-B.

This study presents the first publicly available on-line model for predicting the solubility of platinum complexes, addressing the current scarcity of literature and absence of models in this regard. Using a time-split dataset, the consensus model that we developed had a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.62 through 5-cross-validation on a training set of 284 historical compounds (solubility data reported prior to 2017). However, the RMSE increased to 0.86 when applied to a prospective test set of 108 compounds measured after 2017. Further analysis of the high prediction errors revealed that these inaccuracies are primarily attributed to the underrepresentation of novel chemical scaffolds\u2013mainly Pt(IV) derivatives, in the training sets. For instance, a series of eight phenanthroline-containing compounds, not covered by the training set\u2019s chemical space, had an RMSE of 1.3. When the model was redeveloped using a combined dataset, the RMSE of this series significantly decreased to 0.34 under the same validation protocol. Additionally, we developed an interpretable linear model to identify structural features and functional groups that influence the solubility of platinum complexes.

Arynes\u2013a triple bond in a benzene ring\u2013are an intriguing solution to the problem of generating decorated arenes. State-of-the-art aryne precursors are plagued by two issues: 1) the additives required for activation are incompatible with many desirable functional groups intrinsic to the aryne itself as well as the coupling partners which limits the scope, and 2) derivatization of the precursors requires lengthy linear sequences often using harsh conditions rendering them impractical for discovery chemists. Here, we show the design of an aryne precursor made in a single step from a commercially available carboxylic acid and then derivatized in a single SNAr step. Unprecedented aryne activation proceeds using blue light or mild heat, avoiding the use of additives. The model system for this precursor incorporates an ortho-amino group in the final stage because anilines are found in 40% of medicinal chemistry patents and are highly underrepresented in aryne methodology.

The approach takes advantage of machine learning strategies in a two-step process.  In the first, the molecular-orbital based machine learning (MOB-ML) model uses Gaussian process regression to learn the correlation energy at the CCSD(T) level using the molecular orbitals obtained from Hartree-Fock calculations.  In this work, the MOB-ML approach is expanded to use orbitals obtained using a smaller basis set, aug-cc-pVDZ, as features for learning the correlation energies at the complete basis set (CBS) limit.  This approach is combined with the development of a neural-network potential, where the sampled geometries and energies that provide the training data for the potential are obtained using a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculation, which was run using the MOB-ML model.   Protocols are developed to make full use of the structures that are obtained from the DMC calculation in the training process.   These approaches are used to develop potentials for OH-(H2O) and H3O+(H2O), which are used for subsequent DMC calculations. The  results of these calculations are compared to those performed using previously reported potentials.   Overall, the results of the two sets of DMC calculations are in good agreement for these very floppy molecules.   Potentials are also developed for OH-(H2O)2 and OH-(H2O)3, for which there are not available potential surfaces.  The results of DMC calculations for these ions are compared to those for the correspondingOH-(H2O)2 and OH-(H2O)3 ions.  It is found that the level of delocalization of the shared proton is similar for a hydroxide or hydronium ion bound to the same number of water molecules.  This finding is consistent with the experimental observation that these sets of ions have similar spectra.

Dysregulation of CCR1 has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and acute pulmonary inflammation, including hyperinflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients. Natural compounds, with their structural diversity and multifunctional biological activities, present an untapped resource for therapeutic discovery. Among them, Esculin, a coumarin derivative exhibits promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying Esculin's interaction with CCR1 remain unclear.\n\nMethods: We investigated Esculin, a coumarin derivative with known anti-inflammatory properties, using molecular docking, 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy (MMGBSA) analysis. Structural stability, residue-specific interactions, and pharmacokinetic properties (ADMET analysis) were comprehensively evaluated.\n\nResults: Molecular docking revealed that Esculin effectively occupied the CCR1 ligand-binding pocket, with a favorable binding energy of -7.4 kcal/mol. MD simulation trajectories demonstrated structural stability of the Esculin-CCR1 complex. Key residues, including Trp90, Tyr93, Lys94, and Tyr113, were identified as critical contributors to binding stability. MMGBSA analysis confirmed energetically favorable interactions (Av. \u0394G = -28.32 kcal/mol), with specific residues contributing significantly to the overall binding energy. ADMET analysis highlighted Esculin's optimal pharmacokinetic profile, high bioavailability, non-toxic nature, and absence of mutagenic or cardiotoxic risks.\n\nConclusion: Esculin demonstrates stable and energetically favorable binding with CCR1, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic modulator of CCR1-mediated immune responses. These findings highlight Esculin as a promising candidate for treating CCR1-associated diseases, including COVID-19-induced inflammation and chronic inflammatory conditions. Further in vitro and in vivo validation will be essential to confirm its therapeutic efficacy.\n", "date": "2024-12-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The mechanism of E. coli RNR requires long-range radical transport through a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway spanning two different protein subunits. Herein, the direct PCET reaction between the interfacial tyrosine residues, Y356 and Y731, is investigated with a vibronically nonadiabatic theory that treats the transferring proton and all electrons quantum mechanically. The input quantities to the PCET rate constant expression are computed with a combination of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. The calculations highlight the importance of hydrogen tunneling in this PCET reaction. Compression of the distance between the proton donor and acceptor oxygen atoms of the interfacial tyrosine residues is essential to facilitate hydrogen tunneling by increasing the overlap between the reactant and product proton vibrational wavefunctions. This compression occurs by thermal conformational fluctuations of these interfacial tyrosine residues. N733 and R411 are identified as key residues that can hydrogen bond to Y731 and Y356, respectively, and thereby compete with the hydrogen-bonding interaction between Y731 and Y356 required for direct PCET. Understanding the roles of hydrogen tunneling and conformational motions in this interfacial PCET reaction, as well as identifying other residues that may impact the kinetics, is important for targeted protein engineering efforts to modulate RNR activity.", "date": "2024-12-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, it remains a considerable challenge for OLPL materials to achieve such performance using commonly available, cost-effective optoelectronic-inert polymers as the host component. In this work, electron-deficient naphthalenediimide derivatives are utilized as guest molecules, which are dispersed into various polymers, achieving hour-level OLPL for the first time in widely used, low-cost optoelectronic-inert hosts, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), and polystyrene (PS). By combining commercially available PMMA with polycarbonate (PC), an unprecedented day-level OLPL phenomenon is observed. A cascade polymer hole trap mechanism is proposed to elucidate this exceptional OLPL performance. Additionally, these materials can be applied not only for large-area fabrication and nighttime illumination but also for stable emission in diverse extreme environments, as well as for multi-layer information encryption.

In order to investigate this, 13 alcohols with carbon numbers between 2 and 8 and phenol were used to synthesize and classify the smells, and the relationship between the smell of acetate esters, carbon number and molecular structure was compared. The results showed that the smell of acetate esters changes with changes in carbon number and with changes in molecular structure.

The interaction profiles of these probes were visualized through in-gel fluorescence scanning, and their subcellular localization was examined using fluorescence microscopy. Higher polyamine analogs predominantly target proteins in the nucleoplasm and cytosol, whereas diamine analogs localize to vesicle-like structures near the Golgi apparatus, implying that different polyamine types show a proclivity for specific cellular compartments.

Franco", "abstract": "In this study, we present a hybrid Physics-Assisted Machine Learning (PAML) model that integrates Deep Learning (DL) techniques with the classical Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate the slurry drying during a lithium ion battery electrode manufacturing process. This model predicts the microstructure evolution leading to the formation of the electrode, as a time-series along the drying process. The hybrid approach consists in performing a certain amount of DEM simulation steps, n_DEM, after every DL prediction, mitigating the risk of unphysical predictions, like overlapping particles. Our PAML model was rigorously tested by evaluating different functional metrics of the predicted electrodes, including density, porosity, tortuosity factor, and radial distribution function.  We conducted an in-depth analysis of performance versus accuracy, particularly focusing on the impact of the n_DEM hyperparameter, which represents the number of DEM steps executed between two subsequent DL predictions. Despite the model being trained on a specific formulation (96 % of Active Material, AM, and 4 % of Carbon Binder Domain, CBD), it demonstrated exceptional generalization capability when used to extrapolate to a different formulation (94 % AM and 6 % CBD). This adaptability highlights the robustness of our PAML hybrid approach. Furthermore, the integration of DL significantly reduced the computational cost versus the original DEM model simulation, decreasing the calculation time from 615 minutes to 36 min for the whole slurry drying simulation process. Our findings underscore the potential of combining ML with traditional simulation methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy in the field of electrode manufacturing. \n", "date": "2024-12-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

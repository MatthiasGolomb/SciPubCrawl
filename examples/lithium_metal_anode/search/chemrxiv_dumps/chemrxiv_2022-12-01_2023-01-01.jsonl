Given the prohibitive complexity of first principles simulations and large-scale sampling required to rigorously predict hydrogen equilibrium in these systems, we turn to compositional machine learning models as the most feasible approach to screen on the order of 10,000s of candidate equimolar alloys. We critically show that machine learning models can predict hydride thermodynamics and capacities with reasonable accuracy and that explainability analyses capture the competing trade-offs that arise from feature interdependence. We can therefore elucidate the multi-dimensional Pareto optimal set of materials (i.e., where two or more competing objective properties can't be simultaneously improved) and provide rapid and efficient down-selection of the highest priority candidates for more time-consuming density functional theory investigations and experimental validation. Selected target materials were experimentally synthesized, characterized, and tested amongst an international collaboration group to validate the proposed novel hydrides. Additional top-predicted candidates are suggested to the community for future synthesis efforts, and we conclude with an outlook on improving the current approach for the next generation of computational HEA hydride discovery efforts.", "date": "2022-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Alloys; Machine Learning; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

These constructs contain two paratopes capable of binding two distinct epitopes on target molecules and are thus able to perform complex biological functions (mechanisms of action) not available to monospecific mAbs. Traditionally these bsAbs have been constructed through protein engineering, but recently chemical methods for their construction have started to (re-)emerge. While these have been shown to offer increased modularity, speed and for some methods, even the inherent capacity for further functionalization (e.g., with small molecule cargo), most of these approaches lacked the ability to include a fragment crystallizable (Fc) modality. The Fc component of IgG antibodies offers effector function and increased half-life. Here we report a first-in-class disulfide re-bridging and click-chemistry-based method for the generation of Fc-containing, IgG-like mono- and bispecific antibodies. These are in the FcZ (FabX)-FabY format, i.e., two distinct Fabs and an Fc, potentially all from different antibodies, attached in a homogeneous and covalent manner. We have dubbed these molecules synthetic antibodies (SynAbs).

Whereas the Li\u2013C bond of LiCF3 is classified as a conventional two-center two-electron bond (ICIXC = 0.910, ICIXC > 0.9 and close to 1), that of LiCPh3 is categorized as a collective bond (ICIXC = 0.393).

Photoredox catalysis is a powerful method for the mild genera-tion of alkyl radicals for C\u2013C bond formation. However, the effect of ring strain on radical reactivity is not well understood and there are no studies that address this question systematically. Furthermore, examples of such reactions that use tertiary and benzylic radicals are rare, and their reactivity is challenging to direct towards productive reaction pathways. This work develops a radical functionalization of benzylic oxetanes and azetidines using visible light photoredox catalysis to prepare 3-aryl-3-alkyl substituted derivatives and assesses the influence of ring strain and heterosubstitution on the reactivity of small-ring radicals. 3-Aryl-3-carboxylic acid oxetanes and azetidines are suitable precursors to tertiary benzylic oxetane/azetidine radicals which undergo conjugate addition into activated alkenes. We compare the reactivity of oxetane radicals to that of other common benzylic systems. Computational studies indicate that reversible Giese additions of non-strained benzylic radicals into acrylates result in low yields and radical dimerization. Benzylic radicals that are part of a strained ring, however, are both less stable and more \ud835\udf0b-delocalized, decreasing dimer formation and increasing Giese product formation. Oxetane substitution, in particular, results in high product yields due to ring strain and Bent\u2019s rule rendering the Giese addition irre-versible.

We have shown that using Cr-centered complexes with sulfone-based RMs leads to an enhancement of CO2 reduction electrocatalysis under protic conditions via an inner-sphere mechanism. In these co-catalytic systems, an oxygen atom of the reduced RM binds to the Cr center to form a key intermediate stabilized by pancake bonding between the reduced aromatic components of the catalyst ligand backbone and the RM.

While the hardware for running HTE in the chemical laboratory has evolved significantly in recent years, there remains a need for software solutions to navigate data-rich experiments. Here we have developed phactor\u2122, a software that facilitates the performance and analysis of HTE in a chemical laboratory. phactor\u2122 allows experimentalists to rapidly design arrays of chemical reactions or direct-to-biology experiments in 24, 96, 384, or 1,536 wellplates. Users can access online reagent data, such as a chemical inventory, to virtually populate wells with experiments and produce instructions to perform the reaction array manually, or with the assistance of a liquid handling robot. After completion of the reaction array, analytical results can be uploaded for facile evaluation, and to guide the next series of experiments. All chemical data, metadata, and results are stored in machine-readable formats that are readily translatable to various software formats. We also demonstrate the use of phactor\u2122 in the discovery of several chemistries, including a light-enabled reagent-free sp2\u2013sp2 deaminative\u2013decarboxylative carbon\u2013carbon coupling and a low micromolar inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

Interaction energies and their components are computed using extended symmetry-adapted perturbation theory along two-dimensional scans representing slip-stacking.   As in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons studied previously, we find that the van der Waals interaction potential (defined as the sum of dispersion and Pauli repulsion) drives the system into a slip-stacked geometry.   Electrostatics is a relatively small component of the total interaction energy.  In the case of COF-1, the van der Waals potential drives the conformational preference whether or not a solvent molecule intercalates into the framework, although the presence of the guest (mesitylene) molecule substantially limits the low-energy slip-stacking configurations that are available.

Collision theory was originally developed to explain the reaction kinetics of gas reactions with no dilution. For a reaction in a diluted inert gas solution or a diluted liquid solution, diffusion often dominates the collision process. Thus, it is necessary to include diffusion in such a calculation. Traditionally the classical Smoluchowski rate is used as a starting point to predict the collision frequency of two molecules in a diluted solution. In this report, a different collision model is derived from the adsorption of molecules on a flat surface. A surprising result is obtained showing that the reaction order for biomolecular reaction should be 2 and 1/3 instead of 2, following a fractal reaction kinetics.

The energy efficiency of the CO2RR is correspondingly increased. The enhanced CO2RR in clathrate is ascribed to non-equilibrium release of the CO2 due to the electric field near the electrode, analogous to what has been observed recently for tetrahydrofuran [Li et al. J. Phys. Chem. Letters 125, 13802 (2021)]. This raises the chemical potential of CO2 beyond that of saturated aqueous solution, thereby reversing the relative rates of the CO2RR and the HER. The experimental demonstration of this release mechanism for the application of CO2 up-conversion illustrates how the electric field can not only influence electrochemical reactions at the surface but also the reactant supply from clathrate hydrates to the surface.

For example, despite the numerous studies of thymine in solution and DNA, there is still a debate on the photochemical deactivation pathways after UV absorption. Many theoretical models are oversimplified due to the lack of computationally accurate and efficient electronic structure methodologies that capture excited state electron correlation effects when nucleobases are embedded in large electrostatic media. Here, we combine mixed-reference spin-flip time-dependent density-functional theory (MRSF-TDDFT) with electrostatic embedding QM/MM using electrostatic potential fitting (ESPF) atomic charges, as a strategy to accurately and efficiently describe the electronic structure of chromophores polarized by an electrostatic medium. In particular, we develop analytic expressions for the energy and gradient of MRSF/MM based on the ESPF coupling using atom-centered grids and total charge conservation. We apply this methodology to the study of solvation effects on thymine photochemistry in water and thymine dimers in DNA. In the former, the combination of trajectory surface hopping (TSH) non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) with MRSF/MM remarkably revealed the accelerated deactivation decay pathways, which is consistent with the experimental decay time of ~ 400 fs. The enhanced hopping rate can be explained by the preferential stabilization of corresponding conical interactions due to their increased dipole moments. Structurally, it is a consequence of characteristic methyl puckered geometries near the conical intersection region. For the thymine dimer in B-DNA, we found new photochemical pathways through conical intersections that could explain the formation of cyclobutadiene dimers and 6-4 photoproducts.", "date": "2022-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A two-step synthesis approach has recently led to significant advances in terms of Fe-loading and mass activity; however, the Fe utilisation remains low owing to the difficulty of building scaffolds with sufficient porosity that electrochemically exposes the active sites.

The \u201catom attribution from finger prints\u201d-method developed by Riniker and Landrum (J. Chem. Inf. Comput.

The agreement is increased significantly (to 0.75) when the atomic contributions are adjusted to match the fact that the molecular representation is fragment-based rather than atom-based (the finger print-adapted (FPA) ground truth vector). Most heatmaps and the corresponding FPA overlaps are relatively insensitive to the training set size and the results are close to converged for a training set size of 1000 molecules, although for molecules with low overlap some heatmaps change significantly.

In particular, relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulations are beneficial for lead optimization. To use RBFE simulations to compare prospective ligands in silico, researchers first plan the simulation experiment, represented by graphs where nodes represent ligands and graph edges represent alchemical transformations between ligands. Recent work demonstrated that optimizing the statistical architecture of these perturbation graphs improves the accuracy of the resultant changes in the free energy of ligand binding. Therefore, to improve the success rate of computational drug discovery, we present the open-source software package High Information Mapper (HiMap) --- a modernized take on its predecessor, Lead Optimization Mapper (LOMAP). HiMap removes heuristics decisions from design selection and instead finds statistically optimal graphs over ligands clustered with machine learning. Beyond optimal design generation, we present theoretical insights for designing alchemical perturbation maps. Some of these results include that for n number of nodes, the precision of perturbation maps is stable at n\u00b7ln(n) edges. We additionally find that optimal designs will converge more rapidly than radial and LOMAP designs. Moreover, we derive bounds for how clustering reduces cost for designs with a constant expected error, invariant of the size of the design. These results inform how to best design perturbation maps for computational drug discovery and have broader implications for experimental design.

State-of-the-art time-resolved X-ray solution scattering has emerged in the last decade as a powerful technique to observe solute and solvent motions in real time. However, disentangling solute and solvent dynamics and how they mutually influence each other remains challenging. Here, we simultaneously measure femtosecond X-ray emission and scattering to track both the intramolecular and solvation structural dynamics following photoexcitation of a solvated copper photosensitizer. Quantitative analysis assisted by molecular dynamics simulations reveals a two-step ligand flattening strongly coupled to the solvent reorganization, which conventional optical methods could not discern. First, a ballistic flattening triggers coherent motions of surrounding acetonitrile molecules. In turn, the approach of acetonitrile molecules to the copper atom mediates the decay of intramolecular coherent vibrations and induces a further ligand flattening. These direct structural insights reveal that photoinduced solute and solvent motions can be intimately intertwined, explaining how the key initial steps of light harvesting are affected by the solvent on the atomic time and length scale.

We herein present a fast method for the preparation of the first MIL SURMOF on Au-surfaces under rather harsh conditions: Using a dynamic layer-by-layer synthesis for MIL-68(In), thin films of adjustable thickness between 50-2000 nm could be deposited within only 60 min. The MIL-68(In) thin film growth was monitored in-situ using a quartz crystal microbalance. In-plane X-ray diffraction revealed oriented MIL-68(In) growth with the pore-channels of this interesting MOF aligned parallel to the support. SEM data demonstrated an extraordinarily low roughness of the MIL-68(In) thin films. Mechanical properties and lateral homogeneity of the layer were probed through nanoindentation. These thin films showed extremely high optical quality. By applying a PMMA layer and further depositing an Au-mirror to the top, a MOF optical cavity was fabricated that can be used as Fabry-Perot interferometer. The MIL-68(In)-based cavity showed a series of sharp resonances in the UV-Vis regime. Changes in the refractive index of MIL-68(In) caused by exposure to volatile compounds, led to pronounced position shifts of the resonances.

In this model, ET results in a change in diabatic potential energy surfaces, separated along an ET nuclear coordinate. This coordinate accounts for all nuclear motion that promotes electron transfer. It is usually assumed to be dominated by a collective asymmetric vibrational motion of the redox sites involved in the ET.  However, this coordinate is rarely quantitatively specified. Instead, it remains a nebulous concept, rather than a tool for gaining true insight into the ET pathway. Herein, we describe an ab initio approach for quantifying the ET coordinate and demonstrate it for a series of dinitroradical anions. Using sampling methods at finite temperature combined with density functional theory calculations, we find that the electron transfer can be followed using the energy separation between potential energy surfaces and the extent of electron localization. The precise nuclear motion that leads to electron transfer is then be obtained as a linear combination of normal modes. Once the coordinate is identified, we find that evolution along it results in a change in diabatic state and optical excitation energy, as predicted by the Marcus model. Thus, we conclude that a single dimension of the electron transfer described in Marcus--Hush theory can be found in the real systems as an intuitive nuclear motion. Furthermore, the barrier separating the adiabatic minima was found to be sufficiently thin to enable heavy-atom tunneling in the ET process.", "date": "2022-12-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Bonding; Electrochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A tool is developed to automate the coupling of these building block units based on their available C(sp2/sp)-H bonds, thus providing a fundamental link between the two philosophies of dataset construction. Statistical models are trained on this dataset and a subset of the resulting hybrid top-down/bottom-up compounds, which enable on-the-fly prediction of key ground state (frontier molecular orbital gaps) and excited state (S1 and T1 energies) properties from molecular geometries with high accuracy across all known p-block organic compound space.\nWith access to ab initio-quality optical properties in hand, it is possible to apply this bottom-up pipeline using existing compounds as molecular building blocks to any materials design campaign. To illustrate this, we construct and screen over a million molecular candidates for efficient intramolecular singlet fission, the leading candidates of which provide insight into the structural features that may promote this multiexciton-generating process.", "date": "2022-12-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Optical Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although numerous computational and experimental investigations have focused on understanding these interactions, the conversion of CO2 to H2CO3 in nanopores, and how this conversion differs from that in bulk water, has not been understood. In this study, we use ReaxFF metadynamics molecular simulations to demonstrate striking differences in the free energy of CO2 conversion to H2CO3 in bulk water compared with that in water confined in pyrophyllite nanopores. We find that the nanoconfinement not only reduces the energy barrier, but also reverses the reaction from endothermic in bulk water to exothermic in nanoconfined water. In addition, charged species are observed more often under nanoconfinement than in bulk water.  The higher number of reactive encounters,  stronger solvation, and more favorable proton transfer with increasing confinement enhance the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction. As carbonation in nanopores is  important in the carbon cycle and a complicated problem that depends on confinement, surface chemistry,  pore chemistry, and concentration of CO2, our results provide a mechanistic understanding to an important step in this process.

Cyclopropenones are a class of pseudo-aromatic light-responsive molecules used in bioorthogonal photoclick reactions; their excited-state decarbonylation reaction mechanisms are misunderstood due to their ultrafast (<100 femtosecond) lifetimes. We have combined state-of-the-art multiconfigurational quantum mechanical (QM) calculations and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations to uncover the excited-state mechanism of cyclopropene and a photoprotected cyclooctyne-(COT)-precursor in gaseous and explicit aqueous environments. We explore the role of H-bonding with unprecedented QM/QM NAMD simulations (CAS-chromophore and HF-solvent) for the aqueous decarbonylation reaction. The cyclopropenones pass through asynchronous conical intersections but have dynamically concerted photodecarbonylation mechanisms. The cyclopropenones break planarity to relieve the S1 pseudo anti-aromaticity upon photoexcitation. The substantial structural distortions relieve pseudo anti-aromaticity towards non-aromatic structures and release inherent ring strain. After crossing to S0-state, the cyclopropenones maximize pseudo-aromaticities by reverting to the reactant or the second \u03c3CC bond breaks to form CO and an alkyne.

The Lagrangian for the conventional SA-CASSCF analytic gradient theory is extended to the SA-DMRG-CASSCF variant that can fully consider a whole set of constraints on the parameters of multi-root canonical matrix product states (MPSs) formed at all the DMRG block configurations. An efficient algorithm to solve the CP-DMRG-CASSCF equations for determining the multipliers was developed. The complexity of the resultant analytic gradient algorithm is overall the same as that of the unperturbed SA-DMRG-CASSCF algorithm. In addition, a reduced-scaling approach was developed to directly compute the SA reduced density matrices (SA-RDMs) and their perturbed ones without calculating separate state-specific RDMs. As part of our implementation scheme, we neglect the term associated with the constraint on the active orbitals in terms of the active-active rotation in the Lagrangian. Thus, errors from the true analytic gradients may be caused in this scheme. The proposed gradient algorithm was tested with the spin-adapted implementation by checking how accurately the computed analytic energy gradients reproduce numerical gradients of the SA-DMRG-CASSCF energies using a common number of renormalized basis. The illustrative applications show that the errors are sufficiently small when using a typical number of the renormalized basis, which is required to attain adequate accuracy in DMRG's total energies.", "date": "2022-12-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Some previous experimental studies proposed hydrophobic zeolites as promising adsorbents for the removal of carbamazepine from water, but only a few framework types were considered in those investigations. In the present work, electronic structure calculations based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) were used to study the adsorption of CBZ in eleven all-silica zeolites having different pore sizes and connectivities of the pore system (AFI, ATS, BEA, CFI, DON, FAU, IFR, ISV, MOR, SFH, SSF framework types). It was found that some zeolites with one-dimensional channels formed by twelve-membered rings (IFR, AFI) exhibit the highest affinity towards CBZ. A \u201cgood fit\u201d of CBZ into the zeolite pores that maximises dispersion interactions was identified as the dominant factor determining the interaction strength. Further calculations addressed the role of temperature, performing DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations for selected systems, and of guest-guest interactions between coadsorbed CBZ molecules. In addition to predicting zeolite frameworks of particular interest as materials for selective CBZ removal, the calculations presented here also contribute to the atomic-level understanding of the interaction of functional organic molecules with all-silica zeolites.", "date": "2022-12-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This compound is a structural relative of the well-known TADF compound DMAC-TRZ, substituting the bridging phenylene for a pyridyl group. This marginal change has an enormous impact on the structure and hence on the photophysics as the steric interactions between the DMAC donor and the bridge that force DMAC-TRZ into an orthogonal conformation are attenuated and permit DMAC-py-TRZ to adopt a planar and slightly bent structure in the ground state. The large degree of conjugation in the bent DMAC-py-TRZ structure, demonstrated by the strong intensity of the lowest excitation with CT character, is responsible for a large singlet triplet gap, hence hindering TADF of this bent conformer. The computational analysis predicts that emission occurs, however, from a relaxed orthogonal excited-state geometry, as confirmed by the huge Stokes shift observed in non-polar solvents. In this relaxed orthogonal geometry TADF is indeed observed. Emission from the unrelaxed state is recovered in glassy frozen solvents, where the emission band is largely blue-shifted compared with measurements in liquid solvent, and TADF is quenched. In amorphous matrices, structural disorder leads to the coexistence of both conformers, even if, depending on the emitter concentration, dual fluorescence may disappear due to a fast energy transfer from the bent to the orthogonal conformers. We maintain that this efficient energy transfer is responsible for the good efficiency of DMAC-py-TRZ devices, because of the presence in the matrix of a sizable proportion of compounds that adopt the bent structure, favorable to act as the host for the orthogonal TADF conformer of DMAC-py-TRZ.", "date": "2022-12-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To this end, dimensionality reduction algorithms are used to produce low-dimensional embeddings of the high-dimensional conformational phase space. However, identifying a compact and informative set of input features for the embedding remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we propose to harness the power of Residue Interaction Networks (RINs) and their centrality measures, established tools to provide a graph theoretical view on molecular structure. Specifically, we combine the closeness centrality, which captures global features of the protein conformation at residue-wise resolution, with EncoderMap, a hybrid neural-network autoencoder/multidimensional-scaling like dimensionality reduction algorithm. We find that the resulting low-dimensional embedding is a meaningful visualization of the residue interaction landscape that resolves structural details of the protein behavior while retaining global interpretability. This feature-based graph embedding of temporal protein graphs makes it possible to apply the general descriptive power of RIN formalisms to the analysis of protein simulations of complex processes such as protein folding and multi-domain interactions requiring no protein-specific input. We demonstrate this on simulations of the fast folding protein Trp-Cage and the multi-domain signalling protein FAT10.

Increased posttranslational modification of MBP is linked to both, the natural development (from adolescent to adult brains) of myelin, and features of multiple sclerosis. Here, we study how a combination of this intrinsically disordered myelin protein with varying the natural cholesterol content may alter the characteristics of myelin-like membranes and interactions between these membranes. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with a composition mimicking the cytoplasmic leaflet of myelin were chosen as the model system, in which different parameters contributing to the interactions between the lipid membrane and MBP were investigated. While we use cryo-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for imaging, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic measurements through continuously-monitored phase-analysis light scattering (cmPALS) were used for a more global overview of particle size and charge, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was utilized for local behavior of lipids in the vesicles\u2019 membranes in aqueous solution. The cholesterol content was varied from 0\u00ac\u00ac\u250060% in these LUVs and measurements were performed in the presence and absence of MBP. We find that the composition of the lipid layers is relevant to the interaction with MBP. Not only the size, the shape and the aggregation behavior of the vesicles depend on the cholesterol content, but also within each membrane, cholesterol\u2019s freedom of movement, its environmental polarity and its distribution were found to depend on the content using the EPR-active spin-labeled cholesterol (CSOSL). In addition, DLS and EPR measurements probing the transition temperatures of the lipid phases allow a correlation of specific behavior with the human body temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Overall, our results aid in understanding the importance of the native cholesterol content in the healthy myelin membrane, which serves as the basis for stable and optimum protein-bilayer interactions. Although studied in this specific myelin-like system, from a more general and materials science-oriented point of view, we could establish how membrane and vesicle properties depend on cholesterol and/or MBP content, which might be useful generally when specific membrane and vesicle characteristics are sought for.

While metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) comprise a diverse class of porous electrochemical materials, the intercalation redox chemistry of MOFs remains poorly understood due to the presence of redox sites at the exterior of MOF particles and in the internal pores. Here, we report that Fe(1,2,3-triazolate)2 possesses an intercalation-based redox process shifted ca. 1.2 V from redox at the particle surface. Such distinct chemical environments do not appear in idealized MOF crystal structures but become magnified in MOF nanoparticles. Quartz crystal microbalance and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry combined with electrochemical studies identify the existence of a distinct and highly reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox event occurring within the MOF interior. Systematic manipulation of experimental parameters (e.g., film thickness, electrolyte species, solvent, and reaction temperature) reveals that this feature arises from the nanoconfined (4.54 \u00c5) pores gating the entry of charge-compensating anions. Due to the requirement for full desolvation and reorganization of electrolyte outside the MOF particle, the anion-coupled oxidation of internal Fe2+ sites involves a giant redox entropy change (i.e., 164 J K-1 mol-1).

This method allows to select the transitions with the largest magnitude that determine the overall value of the OR for a specific molecule, thus providing useful insights for characterization. However, the individual Sia values are origin-dependent even if the total OR is origin invariant. In this work, we explicitly identify the reason for the origin dependence of the Sia original formulations and we propose two ways to eliminate this spurious effect and define an origin invariant S \u0303ia within the modified velocity gauge formalism. One approach is based on averaging the electric and magnetic-perturbed density Sia definitions (which have equal and opposite origin dependence that cancels out in the average), while the second approach is based on the equal distribution of the electronic response to an external field via Cholesky decomposition of the response matrix. Numerical results prove that the new Sia definitions are indeed origin invariant and they provide the same physical picture for the OR tensor decomposition. At the same time, we show that setting the origin of the coordinate system at the center of mass of the molecule also provides the same physical picture when using the original Sia formulation, which confirms that this is a robust approach for investigating structure-property relations in chiral molecules.", "date": "2022-12-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Comparing to finite element simulations that assume a spatially uniform free electron distribution in the nanocubes, we show that the plasmon modes associated with the edges and the faces of the nanocubes are less sensitive than expected, and that their reduced dielectric sensitivity can be rationalized by the presence of band bending and a resulting surface depletion layer.

Depending on the structural topology and structural rigidity, these macrocyclic luminogens display obviously distinctive emission behavior and photochemical reactions in the solution and in the solid state. Monocyclic MST with lower strain was more susceptible to intramolecular motions, and thus exhibited aggregation-induced emission properties.  After UV light irradiation, MST was also vulnerable to undergo photo-cyclization in solution and triplet sensitizer promoted photo-dimerization, and yielded the anti-dimer via triplet excimer on the HOPG surface confirmed by STM investigation. By contrast, highly constrained bis-macrocyclic luminogens DMTPE, featured with high emission quantum yields of 68% both in solution and in the solid state, was relatively inert to photochemical reactions and yield syn-dimer on the surface via singlet excimer involved [2+2] photo-dimerization.", "date": "2022-12-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.); Self-Assembly; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Lipid peroxidation can propagate through either hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) or peroxyl radical addition (PRA) mechanism. However, the contribution of the PRA mechanism to the induction of ferroptosis has not been studied. In this study, we aim to elucidate the relationship between the reactivity and mechanisms of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis induction. We found that while some peroxidation-reactive lipids, such as 7-dehydrocholesterol, vitamins D3 and A, and coenzyme Q10, suppress ferroptosis, both nonconjugated and conjugated PUFAs enhanced cell death induced by RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer. Importantly, we found that conjugated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including conjugated linolenic acid (CLA 18:3) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA 18:2) can induce or potentiate ferroptosis much more potently than nonconjugated PUFAs. We next sought to elucidate the mechanism underlying the different ferroptosis-inducing potency of conjugated and nonconjugated PUFAs. Lipidomics revealed that conjugated and nonconjugated PUFAs are incorporated into distinct cellular lipid species. The different peroxidation mechanisms predict the formation of higher levels of reactive electrophilic aldehydes from conjugated PUFAs than nonconjugated PUFAs, which was confirmed by aldehyde-trapping and mass spectrometry. RNA sequencing revealed that protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and proteasome are among the most significantly upregulated pathways in cells treated with CLA 18:3, suggesting increased ER stress and activation of unfolded protein response. Significantly, using click chemistry, we observed increased protein adduction by oxidized lipids in cells treated with an alkynylated CLA 18:2 probe. These results suggest that protein damage by lipid electrophiles is a key step in ferroptosis.", "date": "2022-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

State-of-the-art gas detectors based on liquid scintillators suffer from many drawbacks such as lengthy sample preparation procedures and limited solubility of gaseous radionuclides, which produces a detrimental effect on measurement sensitivity. A potential breakthrough solution to this problem is using solid porous scintillators that act as gas concentrators and, therefore, could increase detection sensitivity. Highly porous scintillating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) stand out as relevant materials for the realization of these devices. We demonstrate the capability of porous hafnium-based MOF nanocrystals exploiting dicarboxy-9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) as a scintillating conjugated ligand to detect gas radionuclides. The nanocrystals show fast scintillation properties in the nanosecond domain, a fluorescence quantum yield of ~40% and an accessible porosity suitable to host noble gas atoms and ions. The adsorption and detection of radionuclides such as 85Kr, 222Rn and 3H have been explored for these MOFs utilising a newly developed device based on a time coincidence technique. MOF nanocrystals demonstrate an improved sensitivity for these radionuclides compared to a reference detector, showing an excellent linear response down to an activity value lower than 1 kBq\u00b7m-3 that outperforms commercial devices. These results strongly support the possible use of scintillating porous MOF nanocrystals as the building block of ultrasensitive sensors for detecting natural and anthropogenic radioactive gases.", "date": "2022-12-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Optical Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The identity of the remaining EOF has thus far been unclear, but may be partly attributable to fluorine-containing pharmaceuticals and pesticides used throughout society. To test this hypothesis, we applied high resolution mass spectrometry-based suspect screening to samples of municipal WWTP sludge which had been previously subjected to a fluorine mass balance. Sixteen pharmaceutical substances (including transformation products [TPs]), one pesticide, and thirteen conventional PFAS were confirmed at confidence levels 1-4, with concentrations ranging from 0.07-155 ng/g dw.

With the experimental demonstrations of modifying chemical reactivities by forming polaritons under strong light-matter interactions, theorists have been encouraged to develop new methods to simulate these systems and discover new strategies to tune and control reactions. This review summarizes some of these exciting theoretical advances in polariton chemistry, in methods ranging from the fundamental framework to computational techniques and applications spanning from photochemistry to vibrational strong coupling. Even though the theory of quantum light-matter interactions goes back to the mid-twentieth century, the gaps in the knowledge of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED) have only recently been filled. We review recent advances made in resolving gauge ambiguities, the correct form of different QED Hamiltonians under different gauges, and their connections to various quantum optics models. Then, we review recently developed {\\it ab-initio} QED approaches which can accurately describe polariton states in a realistic molecule-cavity hybrid system. We then discuss applications using these method advancements. We review advancements in polariton photochemistry where the cavity is made resonant to electronic transitions to control molecular non-adiabatic excited state dynamics and enable new photochemical reactivities. When the cavity resonance is tuned to the molecular vibrations instead, ground-state chemical reaction modifications have been demonstrated experimentally, though its mechanistic principle remains unclear. We present some recent theoretical progress in resolving this mystery. Finally, we review the recent advances in understanding the collective coupling regime between light and matter, where many molecules can collectively couple to a single cavity mode or many cavity modes. We also lay out the current challenges in theory to explain the observed experimental results. We hope that this review will serve as a useful document for anyone who wants to become familiar with the context of polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED and thus significantly benefit the entire community.

Moreover, benchtop NMR proton lock capabilities further allow for rapid and convenient monitoring of various organic reactions in real-time, as the use of deuterated solvents is not required. The complementary role of 19F NMR-based kinetic monitoring in the fluorination of bioactive compounds serves many benefits in the drug discovery process, since fluorinated motifs additionally improve drug pharmacology. In this study, 19F NMR spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the synthesis of novel trifluorinated analogs of monastrol, a small molecule dihydropyrimidine kinesin-Eg5 inhibitor, and to probe the mechanism of the Biginelli cyclocondensation, a multicomponent reaction used to synthesize dihydropyrimidine and tetrahydropyrimidines through a Bronsted- or Lewis-acid catalyzed cyclocondensation between ethyl acetoacetate, thiourea, and an aryl aldehyde. In the present study, a trifluorinated ketoester serves a dual purpose as being the source of the trifluoromethyl group in our fluorinated dihydropyrimidines and as a spectroscopic handle for real time reaction monitoring and tracking of reactive intermediates by 19F NMR. Further, upon extending this workflow to a diverse array 3- and 4-substituted aryl aldehydes, we were able to derive Hammett linear free energy relationships (LFER) to determine stereoelectronic effects of para- and meta- substituted aryl aldehydes to corresponding reaction rates and mechanistic routes. In addition, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to corroborate our experimental results through the thermodynamic values of key intermediates in each mechanism. Finally, these studies cumulate in the synthesis of a novel trifluorinated analog of monastrol and its subsequent biological evaluation in vitro.

Therefore, our present focus is to realize nanopores that have as cylindrical as possible shapes, in order to obtain a better comparison of nanophotonic observations with theory and simulations. To this end in our 2-step Bosch process we have improved the mask undercut, the uneven scallops, pore widening and positive tapering by optimizing a plethora of parameters such as the etch step time, capacitively coupled plasma (ion energy) and pressure. To add further degrees of control, we implemented a 3-step DREM (deposit, remove, etch, multistep) process. Optimization of the etching process results in cylindrical nanopores with a diameter in the range between 280 and 500 nm and a depth around 7 \u00b5m, corresponding to high depth-to-diameter aspect ratios between 14 and 25, that are very well suited for the realization of silicon nanophotonic structures.", "date": "2022-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanofabrication", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Concomitantly, the mechanism of CO2 methanation remains debated, and its elucidation would drive further progress. Herein, we disclose the preparation of a series of high-loading Ni/SiO2 catalysts via sol-gel method. Through (HR)-TEM, XRD, N2 physisorption, and H2 chemisorption, we show that small Ni particles (<5 nm, high Ni dispersion) could be obtained in a highly porous silica matrix, even at loading up to 50 wt%.

Although the relative population of the QA conformer appears to be small, its effect is disproportionate because it has high local excited state character. The energy transfer efficiency from the QA to the QE conformer is shown to be high, even at low concentrations, and changes depending on the hosting environment. The currently known triplet energy of DMAC-TRZ quoted from experiment is shown to originate from the QA conformer, completely changing the understanding we have so far for this donor-acceptor molecule. The contribution of the QA conformer in devices has been explored and its presence explains the good performance of the material in neat emissive layer devices. Moreover, hyperfluorescnece (HF) devices, using v-DABNA as the terminal emitter show direct energy transfer from the QA conformer to v-DABNA, explaining the relative improved F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency compared to similar HF systems. Using this approach, we demonstrate highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) were green light (TADF only devices) is converted to blue light (HF devices) with the maximum external quantum efficiency remaining high and close to 30%.", "date": "2022-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Precise control over the chemo- and stereoselectivity in alkene radical anion-mediated processes represents another long-standing challenge due their high reactivity. To overcome these issues, here, we develop a new redox-neutral strategy that seamlessly merges photoredox and copper catalysis to enable the controlled generation of alkene radical anions and their orthogonal enantioselective diversification via distonic-like species. This new strategy enables highly regio-, chemo- and enantioselective hydrocyanation, deuterocyanation, and cyanocarboxylation of alkenes without stoichiometric reductants or oxidants under visible light irradiation.

An understanding of their fundamental properties, such as melting points, is essential to incorporate these compounds into relevant technologies. In this study, two different approaches were investigated to predict the melting points of quinone and hydroquinone-based molecules. In the first approach, molecular features were calculated with the Mordred molecular descriptor calculator and used to train a ridge regression and a random forest machine learning (ML) model. In the second, a simpler featurization that captures key enthalpic and entropic descriptors was applied in three model variants - a thermodynamic model, a ridge regression model, and a random forest model. The Mordred-calculated features in the ridge regression model outperformed the thermodynamic features across all models for the quinone dataset (average absolute errors (AAE): 29.5 \u00b0C), but the thermodynamic features in the thermodynamic model resulted in lower prediction errors for the hydroquinone dataset (AAE: 35.4 \u00b0C). These results emphasize the importance of including intermolecular interaction descriptors, especially for classes of molecules in which these interactions are expected to be strong (e.g. hydrogen bonding in hydroquinones).

Nevertheless, the ability to model the interplay between reaction components, known as interaction effects, with ML remains an outstanding challenge. Using a simulated HTE dataset, we find that the presence of irrelevant features poses a strong obstacle to learning interaction effects with common ML algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a two-part statistical modeling approach for HTE datasets: classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the experiment to identify systematic effects that impact reaction yield across the experiment, followed by regression of individual effects using chemistry-informed features. To illustrate this methodology, we use our previously published alcohol deoxyfluorination dataset comprising 740 reactions to build compact, interpretable regression models that account for each significant effect observed in the dataset. We achieve a sizeable performance boost compared to our previously published Random Forest model, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 18.1% to 13.4% and root mean squared error (RMSE) from 21.7% to 16.5% on a newly generated test set.

The formulated dielectric ink is composed of PVDF latex particles coated by protonated chitosan molecules. Beyond the isoelectric point, the ink demonstrates excellent printability and film-forming properties. Chitosan serves as a strong binder to largely improve the printed film quality yet it introduces charged species. To confine the transport of these mobile charges, the printed PVDF@Chitosan layer was interlayered by a boron nitride nanosheet nanolayer. This layer is perpendicular to the electric field and serves as an efficient barrier to block the transport and the avalanche of charges, eventually leading to a recoverable energy density of 15 J/cm3 at 610 MV/m.

Our screening results show that many  ABX3 compounds may form free-standing 2D structures that are both chemically and dynamically stable. Generally, the optimized 2D structures exhibit a shrinkage of the in-plane B-X bond lengths that are compensated by the elongation of the bonds normal to the 2D plane. As a result, the electron density distributions along the out-of-plane directions are strongly perturbed leading to a complex structural-dependent variation in the space-charge polarizations in these free-standing 2D perovskites. However, the out-of-plane ionic contributions to the dielectric permittivity are completely suppressed because of the structural confinement effect. The dominant contribution to the ionic dielectric permittivity thus comes from the in-plane optical phonons, the change in the frequencies of which from their bulk counterparts exhibits a complex dependency with the structures and chemistries of the 2D structures. Furthermore, without considering surface passivations and structural defects, the majority of the free-standing 2D perovskites exhibit metallic behavior. In particular, transition metal halides show exclusive spin-polarization at the Fermi level, which may be harnessed for applications such as nano spin-polarizer. Finally,  unsupervised machine learning is further applied to discover the intriguing chemical and structural patterns among the computationally screened free-standing 2D perovskite structures, allowing us to reveal in a fully `data-driven' manner, the dependence of the energetic stabilities upon the surface termination, ionic radii and the layer thicknesses of these nanostructures.

Training the force field parameters used in the LJ potential is challenging, generally requiring adjustment based on simulations of macroscopic physical properties.  The computational expense of these simulations limits the size of training data set and number of optimization steps that can be taken, often requiring modelers to perform optimizations within a local parameter region.\n\nTo allow for global LJ parameter optimization against large training sets, we introduce a multi-fidelity optimization technique which uses Gaussian process surrogate modeling to build inexpensive models of physical properties as a function of LJ parameters.  This allows for fast evaluation of objective functions, greatly accelerating searches over parameter space.  We use an iterative framework which performs global optimization at the surrogate level, followed by validation at the simulation level and surrogate refinement.  Using this technique on two previously studied training sets, containing up to 195 physical property targets, we refit a subset of the LJ parameters for the OpenFF 1.0.0 ``Parsley'' force field.  We demonstrate that this multi-fidelity technique can find improved parameter sets compared to a purely simulation-based optimization by searching more broadly and escaping local minima.  In most cases, these parameter sets are transferable to other similar molecules in a test set.

Munro", "abstract": "Background\nThe first crystal structure of the active \u03bc opioid receptor (\u03bcOR) exhibited several unexplained features. The ligand BU72 exhibited many extreme deviations from ideal geometry, along with unexplained electron density around the benzylic carbon. I previously showed that inverting the benzylic configuration resolved these problems, establishing revised stereochemistry of BU72 and its analog BU74. However, another problem remains unresolved: additional unexplained electron density contacts both BU72 and a histidine residue in the N-terminus.\n\nResults\nHere I show that these short contacts and uninterrupted density are inconsistent with non-covalent interactions. Therefore, BU72 and \u03bcOR form a covalent adduct through an unmodeled atom, and the published model as two separate entities is incorrect. A subsequently proposed magnesium complex is also inconsistent with multiple lines of evidence. However, oxygen fits the unexplained density well. While the structure I propose is tentative, similar oxygen-bridged adducts have been reported previously in the presence of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, known sources of reactive oxygen species were present: HEPES buffer, nickel ions, and a sequence motif that forms redox-active nickel complexes. This motif contacts the unexplained density. The adduct exhibits severe strain, and the tethered N-terminus forms contacts with adjacent residues. These forces, along with the nanobody used as a G protein substitute, would be expected to influence the receptor conformation. Consistent with this, the intracellular end of the structure differs markedly from subsequent structures of active \u03bcOR bound to Gi protein.\n\nConclusions\nLater Gi-bound structures are likely to be more accurate templates for docking and molecular dynamics simulations of active \u03bcOR. The possibility of reactions like this should be considered in the choice of protein truncation sites and purification conditions, and in the interpretation of excess or unexplained density.\n", "date": "2022-12-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bioorganometallic Chemistry; Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.); Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Many methods are used to generate empirical models, yet almost no research compares models generated by separate research groups. We intercompare six national-scale empirical models for year-2010 concentrations of PM2.5 in the US, each generated by a different research group. Despite substantial differences in the statistical methods and input data used to build the models, our main finding is a relatively high degree of agreement among model predictions. For example, in pairwise intercomparisons, the average Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.87 (range: 0.84 to 0.92); the RMSD (root-mean-square-difference; units: \u03bcg/m3) is 1.1 on average (range: 0.8 to 1.4), or ~12% of the average concentration; and many best-fit lines are near the 1:1 line. The underlying reason for this agreement is likely that, while the methods and the independent variables differ among the models, in all cases the models are built using, and are calibrated to, the same information: publicly available measurement at US EPA regulatory monitoring stations.

Therefore, to meet the growing food demand of the human population, improvement of drought tolerance of the currently cultured crops is required. The knowledge of the molecular mechanisms behind, e.g., drought tolerance provides a versatile instrument to correct the plant metabolism by chemical tools and to increase, thereby, their adaptive potential. This will preserve crop productivity and quality under water deficit conditions. Endogenously produced nitric oxide (NO) is one of the key signaling factors activating drought tolerance mechanisms in plants. Thus, application of synthetic NO donors as drought-protective phytoeffectors might support maintaining plant growth and productivity under dehydration conditions. Sydnone imines (Sydnonimines) are a class of clinically established mesoionic heterocyclic NO donors which represent a promising candidate group for such phytoeffectors. Therefore, here we provide an overview of the current progress in application of sydnone imines as exogenous NO donors in plants with a special emphasis on their potential as herbicides as well as herbicide antidotes, growth stimulants and suggest a deeper look into them as drought protectors, applicable to different plant species. We specifically address the structure-activity relationships in the context of the growth modulating activity of sydnone imines. According to the actual state of the art, growth-stimulating or antidote effects sre typical for 4-(\u03b1-hydroxybenzyl) derivatives of sydnone imines containing an alkyl substituent in position N-3. The nature of the substituent of the N-6 atom has a significant influence on the activity profile and the intensity of the effect. Nevertheless, further investigations are necessary to establish reliable structure-activity relationships (SAR).

Hupp", "abstract": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) featuring 7, 12, 18, or more, redox-accessible transition-metal ions are ubiquitous as \nselective catalysts, electrocatalysts, and sensitized photocatalysts, especially for oxidation reactions. The corresponding synthetic and catalytic chemistry of stable, discrete, and capping-ligand-free polythiometalates (PTMs), which could be especially attractive for reduction reactions, is much less well developed. Among the challenges is the propensity of PTMs to agglomerate and form larger clusters of indeterminate size, as well as the tendency for agglomeration to block access of candidate reactants to potential catalyst active-sites. Nevertheless, the pervasive presence of transition-metal sulfur clusters metalloenzymes or cofactors that catalyze reduction reactions, and the justifiable proliferation of studies of 2D metal\u0002chalcogenides, and especially their edge sites, as reduction catalysts, point to the promise of well-defined and controllable PTMs as catalysts for reduction reactions, including complex, bond-forming, many-electron reactions. Here we report the fabrication of agglomeration-immune, reactant-accessible, capping-ligand-free CoIIMoIV6S24n- clusters as periodic arrays in a water-stable, hierarchically porous Zr-metal-organic-framework (MOF; NU1K) by first preparing and installing a disk-like Anderson polyoxometalate, CoIIMoVI6O24m(-), in size-matched (<1 nm) micropores termed c-pores, where the siting is established via DED (difference electron density) X-ray diffraction experiments. Prolonged treatment with flowing H2S while heating, uniformly reduces the six molybdenum(VI) ions to Mo(IV) and quantitatively replaces oxygen anions with similarly ligating sulfur anions in the form S(2-), HS(-), and S2(2-). Further DED measurements show that the templated POM-to-PTM conversion leaves the clusters individually isolated in open-channel-connected c-pores. The structure of the immobilized cluster as determined, in part, by XPS, XAFS, and PDF (pair-distribution function) analysis of total X-ray scattering agrees very well with the theoretically simulated structure. Preliminary, proof-of-concept experiments show that electrode-supported thin-films of CoMo6S24@NU1K are electrocatalytically competent for hydrogen evolution in aqueous acid (e.g. 10 mA\u00b7cm-2 of current density at an overpotential of 100 mV). Suspensions of CoMo6S24@NU1K in acetonitrile + triethanolamine, are \nphotocatalytically competent for hydrogen evolution via sensitization with chromophoric MOF linkers. Nevertheless, the initially installed PTM appears to be a pre-catalyst, as hydrogen evolution is observed only after four hours of photolysis. Reduction-assisted loss of ~3-to-6 sulfurs, as H2S, likely is responsible for pre-catalyst-to-catalyst conversion, as the loss opens coordination sites on multiple cluster-sited metal ions, perhaps enabling hydrogen evolution via a Mo-hydride intermediate. Given the great variety of sizes and compositions available for both POMs and Zr-MOFs, we suggest that the approach described here can be adapted for the synthesis and stabilization of periodic arrays of other non-agglomerating, capping-ligand-free PTMs of well-defined metal-nuclearity, presumably including catalytically functional PTMs. ", "date": "2022-12-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Polymer electrolytes with ion-clusters can potentially provide fast transport in ion-channels, because the ion cluster phase is ionophilic and its energy landscape is continuous. In this contribution, we report on single-ion conducting polymers with varying polymer backbone types that contain delocalized tethered anions (-sulfonyl(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (-TFSI-)) prepared from side-chain monomers capable of free-radical polymerization.

The reaction routes opened through this method involve both partial reduction and partial oxidation of separate reactants on the same catalyst surface in parallel to co-adsorb their activated intermediates proximal to one another. Using the CO2 and NH3 as model reactants, the end result is an enhancement of selectivity and formation rates for C-N bond containing products (urea, formamide, acetamide, methylamine) by factors of 3-20 as compared to static electrolysis in otherwise identical conditions. An array of operando measurements and computational modelling was carried out to pinpoint the key factors behind this performance enhancement. Finally, the oxy-reductive coupling strategy was extended to additional carbon and nitrogen reactants as well as applied to boost electrochemical C-S coupling.", "date": "2022-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Fuels - Energy Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The formation and characteristics of the material was studied using X-ray and electron diffraction, TEM, EDS, X-ray photoelectron and 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies, measurements of magnetization, dielectric permittivity, and zeta potential of aqueous dispersions. The reliable formation of tochilinite was ensured by a large excess of sodium sulfide, which induced negative zeta potential (about -30 mV) of tochilinite dispersions, whereas the potential approached zero for nearly-stoichiometric S/Fe precursor ratios. The assembly of the metal sulfide and hydroxide sheets driven by their opposite electric charges starts immediately after mixing the reagents at room temperature. The hydroxide layers contain Fe3+, not Fe2+, cations, the quantity of which was reduced and increased in the range 10 to 40% of Mg2+ by addition of Al and Li, respectively. The Fe-deficient sulfide sheets contain comparable amounts of high-spin Fe3+ and Fe2+ centers, and minor S-S bonding.

However, a key bottleneck for developing programmable RNA regulators is a lack of robust reporter systems and methods to characterize their function. To develop better reporters to characterize RNA regulator activity we optimized a dual luciferase reporter system by selecting luciferase enzymes that maximize reproducibility and signal stability. Additionally, we demonstrated that untranslated regions (UTRs) from disease-relevant transcripts could be incorporated into the reporter mRNAs, both to test RBPs in more native sequence contexts, but also to evaluate RBPs ability to affect gene expression from an mRNA when directed to those sequences. We also demonstrate the flexibility of the reporter by tuning its translational efficiency, testing the reporter in multiple cell lines, and by testing validated RNA regulators that target several UTRs from disease-relevant gene targets. The new reporter system showcased here should provide a valuable method to characterize and develop novel RNA regulators for both synthetic biology and therapeutic purposes.

The performance difference between the single-objective and multi-objective strategy was further investigated using a retention modeling example. One additional advantage of the multi-objective approach was that it allows for a trade-off to be made between multiple objectives without prior knowledge.

We show here an unusual way to access formally iron(IV) alkyl complexes through double silylation of iron(I) alkyl dinitrogen complexes to form an NNSi2 group. When the alkyl group is trimethylsilylmethyl, the formally iron(IV) compound is stable at room temperature. Spectroscopically validated computations show that the disilylhydrazido(2\u2013) ligand stabilizes the formal iron(IV) oxidation state through a strongly covalent Fe\u2013N \uf070-interaction, in which one \uf070-bond fits an \"inverted field\" description. This means that the two bonding electrons are localized on the metal and not the ligand, and an iron(II) resonance structure is a significant contributor as with the phenyl analogue. However, in contrast to the phenyl analogue which has an S = 1 ground state, the ground state of the alkyl complex is S = 2, and this places one electron in the \uf070* orbital and weakens the Fe\u2013N bonding, leading to longer Fe\u2013N bonds. The reactivity of these hydrazido(2\u2013) complexes has an interesting dependence on the specific alkyl group. When the alkyl group is methyl, the formally iron(IV) species undergoes migration of the carbon-based ligand to the NNSi2 group to form a new N\u2013C bond, followed by an intriguing isomerization of the hydrazido ligand. This reactivity is not observed with the bulkier trimethylsilylmethyl complex. When the alkyl group is benzyl, yet another reactivity pathway is evident: the Fe\u2013C bond homolyzes to give a three-coordinate iron(III) complex with a hydrazido(2\u2013) ligand. DFT calculations are used to explain the differences between the behavior with the different alkyl groups. Overall, these formally iron(IV) compounds display a diverse set of reaction pathways associated with the specific alkyl groups.

Studies of iridium nanoparticles have also been key for the development of kinetic models of nanomaterial formation. However, compared to other metals such as gold or platinum, there is very limited knowledge on the actual formation pathway of iridium nanoparticles on the atomic and molecular level. Here, we use in situ X-ray total scattering experiments with pair distribution function analysis to study a simple, surfactant-free synthesis of colloidal iridium nanoparticles. The reaction is performed in methanol at 50 \u00b0C with only a base and an iridium salt as precursor. From different precursor salts - IrCl3, IrCl4, H2IrCl6, or Na2IrCl6 \u2013 colloidal nanoparticles as small as Ir55 are obtained as the final product. The nanoparticles do not show the bulk iridium face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, but decahedral and icosahedral structures. The formation route is highly dependent on the precursor salt used. Using IrCl3 or IrCl4, metallic iridium nanoparticles form rapidly from IrxCly complexes, whereas using H2IrCl6 or Na2IrCl6, the iridium nanoparticle formation follows a sudden growth after an induction period and the brief ap-pearance of a crystalline phase. With H2IrCl6, the formation of different Irn (n= 55, 55, 85, 116) nanoparticles depends on the nature of the cation in the base - LiOH, NaOH, KOH, or CsOH, respectively - and larger particles are obtained with larger cations.

They can act as scaffolds for skin cells and as a reservoir of active compounds, to accelerate scarless wound healing. To overcome repeated administration of peptides which accelerate healing, we report development of three new peptide biomaterials based on the RADA16-I hydrogel functionalized with a sequence (AAPV) cleaved by human neutrophil elastase and short biologically active peptide motifs, namely GHK, KGHK and RDKVYR. The peptide hybrids were investigated for their structural aspects using circular dichroism, thioflavin T assay, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, as well as their rheological properties and stability in different fluids such as water or plasma, and their susceptibility to digestion by enzymes present in the wound environment. In addition, the morphology of the RADA-peptide hydrogels was examined with a unique technique called scanning electron cryomicroscopy. These experiments enabled us to verify if the designed peptides increased the bioactivity of the gel without disturbing its gelling processes. We demonstrate that the physicochemical properties of the designed hybrids were similar to those of the original RADA16-I. The materials behaved as expected, leaving the active motif free when treated with elastase. XTT and LDH tests on fibroblasts and keratinocytes were performed to assess the cytotoxicity of the RADA16-I hybrids, while the viability of cells treated with RADA16-I hybrids was evaluated in a model of human dermal fibroblasts. The hybrid peptides revealed no cytotoxicity; the cells grew and proliferated better than after treatment with RADA16-I alone. Improved wound healing following topical delivery of RADA-GHK and RADA-KGHK was demonstrated using a model of dorsal skin injury in mice and histological analyses.

Understanding the structure-function relationship of PEI is necessary for enhancing its efficacy in various applications. Coarse-grained (CG) simulations can be performed at length- and timescales directly comparable with experimental data while maintaining the molecular perspective. However, manually developing CG forcefields for complex PEI structures is time-consuming and prone to human errors. This article presents a fully automated algorithm that can coarse-grain any branched architecture of PEI from its all-atom (AA) simulation trajectories and topology. The algorithm is demonstrated by coarse-graining a branched 2 kDa PEI, which can replicate the AA diffusion coefficient, radius of gyration, and end-to-end distance of the longest linear chain. Commercially available 25 kDa and 2 kDa Millipore-Sigma PEIs are used for experimental validation. Specifically, branched PEI architectures are proposed, coarse-grained using the automated algorithm, and then simulated at different mass concentrations. The CG-PEIs can reproduce existing experimental data on PEI\u2019s diffusion coefficient and Stokes-Einstein radius at infinite dilution, as well as its intrinsic viscosity. This suggests a strategy where probable chemical structures of synthetic PEIs can be inferred computationally using the developed algorithm.

Because of the absence of interfaces with conducting electrodes, such spectroscopic evidence could provide a clear understanding of how CISS works at the intramolecular level. Experimental results have demonstrated the potential of this approach for detecting a spin-polarised photoinduced electron transfer (ET) in hybrid systems comprising a CdSe quantum dot as an electron donor (D) connected by a chiral linker (\u03c7) to a fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor (A).

Here, we combine detailed process modelling, machine learning, and extensive global sensitivity analysis, which entails varying all of the model parameters together, on a direct air capture process to show that the dry CO2 adsorption capacity does not influence process performance for an amine-functionalised adsorbent operating in a temperature vacuum swing adsorption (TVSA) process, while it is important in a steam-assisted TVSA (S-TVSA) process. In fact, adsorption kinetics, density, and thermal conductivity are all critical attributes to obtaining a low energy penalty and reduced costs. The analysis also highlights the importance of heat transfer, directing process engineers to (alternative) adsorber designs that maximise this. By an in-depth evaluation of how process performance indicators are affected by materials properties and process operating parameters, this work provides guidance to both material scientists and process engineers towards the design of a \"unicorn adsorbent\" and intensified DAC processes. This will improve the performance of solid adsorbent direct air capture and help drive down the costs of this vital technology to avert the worst impacts of climate change.

In the case of the non-totally symmetric transition in a symmetric molecule, the overwhelming majority of transitions do not contribute to the overall rate.

It is proposed to deal with the promoting modes directly, while approximating the effect of the surrounding modes by a Pekarian function.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to its host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), through its receptor binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human protease TMPRSS2 to process the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to facilitate host cell entry. To identify new candidate drugs to inhibit binding of the RBD to hACE2 (the first step of virus entry), we used in silico screening (Phase VS from Schr\u04e7dinger) to predict the RBD binding site and energetics for molecules in the ZINC FDA approved Drug Bank database (1,657 drugs), which includes clinical trial drugs approved by FDA. Using a pharmacophore (1 acceptor, 1 donor, 3 negatively charged, 1 positively charged) derived from the 2.5-\u00c5 X-ray structure SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexed with hACE2 (PDB ID: 6LZG), we found 29 unique hits. To refine the binding energies and bonding sites, we applied our DarwinDock complete sampling method, predicting that 4 of these 29 should bind strongly to the RBD site. Next, we tested 3 of these experimentally using FLOWER, a label-free optical whispering gallery mode sensing technique that can measure ligand-receptor binding affinities down to attomolar levels. We measure that methotrexate (MTX) and Diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) bind with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 0.2 pM in Tricine buffer, which is 1.832 million fold increase in binding strength compared to hACE2 (Kd: 366.4 nM). We then tested these ligands against common mutations: alpha, delta, and omicron. Our measured binding studies demonstrate that MTX provides inhibition against all four variants of SARS-coV-2.

We performed five independent GA searches that resulted in 448 unique molecules, for which we were able to locate 435 true transition states at semiem- pirical level of theory. The predicted activation energies of all 435 molecules were all lower than that of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which is a popular catalyst of the MBH reaction. Virtually all the molecules contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA since it is either not found in the initial population or discarded early only to be rediscovered as the search progresses. Many of the GA searches also intro- duce a substituent with a hydrogen bond donor that helps to stabilize the transition state and thus lower the barrier. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their synthetic accessibility as predicted by the retrosynthesis package Manifold. For these two molecules, we compute the entire free energy reaction profile at the DFT level and show that their rate- determining barriers are 1.7 and 2.4 kcal/mol lower than that of DABCO. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction so we experimentally verified our predictions. One of the molecules was successfully synthesized and is indeed more active than DABCO with an eight-fold increase in the rate-constant corresponding to a roughly 1 kcal/mol lower barrier, in good agreement with the predictions.

Hydrogen bonded liquids, such as water or alcohols, for example, represent a special type of polar liquids, in that they form labile clustered local structures. For water, in particular, hydrogen bonding and the related local tetrahedrality, play an important role in the various attempts to understand this liquid. However, labile structures imply dynamics, and it is not clear how it affects the understanding of this type of liquids from purely static point of view. Herein, we propose to reconsider hydrogen bonding as a charge ordering process. This perspective allows to demonstrate the insufficiencies of the analysis of the microscopic structure based solely on static pair correlation functions, and the need for dynamical correlation functions, both in real and reciprocal space. This extended analysis allows to recover several aspects of our understanding of hydrogen bonded liquids, but from a unified viewpoint. For water, it confirms the jump rotation picture found recently, and it allows to rationalize the contradicting pictures that arise when following the interpretations based on hydrogen bonding. For alcohols, it allows to understand the dynamical origin of the scattering pre-peak, which does not exist for water, despite the fact that both these liquids have very similar hydroxyl group chain clusters. The concept of charge ordering complemented by the analysis of dynamical correlation functions appear as a promising way to understand micro-heterogeneity in complex liquids and mixtures from kinetics point of view", "date": "2022-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Self-Assembly; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, we address this problem with transformer models, a type of machine learning (ML) model, with recent demonstrated success in applications to machine translation and other tasks. By training transformer models on pairs of similar bioactive molecules from the public ChEMBL dataset, we enable them to learn medicinal-chemistry-meaningful, context-dependent transformations of molecules, including those absent from the training set. Most generated molecules are highly plausible and follow similar distributions of simple properties (molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor numbers) as the training dataset. By retrospective analysis of the performance of transformer models on ChEMBL subsets of ligands binding to COX2, DRD2, or HERG protein targets, we demonstrate that the models can generate structures identical or highly similar to highly active ligands, despite the models having not seen any ligands active against the corresponding protein target during training. Thus, our work demonstrates that transformer models, originally developed to translate texts from one natural language to another, can be easily and quickly extended to \u201ctranslations\u201d from known molecules active against a given protein target to novel molecules active against the same target, and thereby contribute to hit expansion in drug design.", "date": "2022-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The nanoporous material in equilibrium with the bulk electrolyte exchange water and ions at a given chemical potential in the semigrand canonical ensemble that must be calibrated in order to determine the concentration in the nanoporous material. In this work, we propose an algorithm based on non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves to ultimately perform MC simulations in contact with a saline reservoir. First, we adapt the Widom insertion technique to calibrate the chemical potential by alchemically transmuting water molecules into ions by using NCMC moves. The chemical potential defines a Monte carlo osmostat in the semigrand constant volume and temperature ensemble to be added in a Monte Carlo simulation where the number of ions fluctuates. In order to validate the method, we adapted the NCMC move to determine the free energy of water solvation and subsequently explore thermodynamics of electrolyte solvation at infinite dilution in water. Finally, we implemented the osmostat in MC simulations initialized with bulk water that are driven towards electrolytes of similar concencentration as the saline reservoir. Our results demonstrate that alchemical osmostat MC simulation is a promising tool for use to sample electrolyte insertion in nanoporous materials.", "date": "2022-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Cross-coupling reactions are the most widely used synthetic methods, but these methods typically form bonds to C(sp2)-hybridized carbon atoms (e.g., amide coupling, biaryl coupling) and lead to a prevalence of \"flat\" molecular structures with suboptimal physicochemical and topological properties. Benzylic C(sp3)\u2013H cross-coupling methods offer an appealing strategy to address this limitation by directly forming bonds to C(sp3)-hybridized carbon atoms, and emerging methods exhibit synthetic versatility that rivals conventional cross-coupling methods to access products with drug-like properties.

The results show that the conformational rigidity of the benzylic scaffold strongly influences the product dimensionality. Products derived from flexible scaffolds often exhibit little or no improvement in three-dimensionality, unless they adopt higher energy conformations.

The algorithms to match MS/MS to sequences have undergone a parallel evolution, with both spectral alignment and peak matching being paired with diverse methods for scoring proteoform-spectral matches (PrSMs). This study assesses state-of-the-art algorithms for top-down identification through three distinct challenges. The first is identifying a large yield of PrSMs while controlling false discovery rate (FDR) in identifying thousands of proteoforms from complex cell lysates via four software workflows: ProSight Proteome Discoverer, TopPIC, Informed Proteomics, and pTop. The second is the deconvolution of data from both Thermo Orbitrap-class and Bruker maXis Q-TOF instruments to produce consistent precursor charge and mass determinations while generating fragment mass lists to optimize identification. The third attempts to detect diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteoforms from bovine milk and human ovarian tissue. The data demonstrate that existing software suites produce admirable sensitivity, in some cases identifying a third of collected MS/MS with FDR controlled below 2%; the overlap in these PrSMs, however, illustrates real value in searching data with multiple search engines. Differences among identification workflows seem to result from each search algorithm incorporating its own deconvolution algorithm. By transmitting deconvolution data from multiple deconvolution routes (Thermo Xtract, Bruker Auto MSn, Mascot Distiller, TopFD, and FLASHDeconv) to the downstream TopPIC search algorithm, we were able to detect common causes of deconvolution disagreement. The detection of PTMs was very inconsistent among search algorithms, with some workflows suggesting as little as 1% of PrSMs from bovine milk were singly-phosphorylated while other workflows found that 18% of PrSMs were singly-phosphorylated. Taken together, these results make a strong argument for top-down researchers to adopt a standard practice of analyzing each MS/MS experiment with at least two different search engines.", "date": "2022-12-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Starting with cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), a model CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalyst, we show that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are ideal substrates for inducing optimum properties through molecular curvature.

These results agree with our Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory that calculates the energetics as a function of applied potential. We find that SWCNTs induce curvature in CoPc, which improves *CO binding to enable subsequent formation of methanol, while wide MWCNTs favor CO desorption. Thus, we demonstrate that the SWCNT-induced molecular strain increases methanol formation. We also show that induced strain can accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction and CO2RR for other catalysts.

Key to the success of these transformations has been the discovery of new ligands capable of increasing both the reactivity of the inert C-H bond and the selectivity of the process. Among them, a new type of S,O-ligand has shown to be highly efficient in promoting a variety of Pd-catalyzed C-H olefination reactions of non-directed arenes. Despite the success of this type of S,O-ligand, its role in the C-H functionalization processes is unknown. Herein, we describe a detailed mechanistic study focused on elucidating the role of the S,O-ligand in the Pd-catalyzed C-H olefination of non-directed arenes. For this purpose, several mechanistic tools, including isolation and characterization of reactive intermediates, NMR and kinetic studies, isotope effects and DFT calculations have been employed. The data from these experiments suggest that the C-H activation is the rate-determining step in both cases with and without the S,O-ligand. Furthermore, the results indicate that the S,O-ligand triggers the formation of more reactive Pd cationic species, which explains the observed acceleration of the reaction. Together, these studies shed light on the role of the S,O-ligand in promoting Pd-catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions", "date": "2022-12-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Physical Organic Chemistry; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The HMTI ligand is highly pi-acidic due to low lying pi*(C=N), which enhances DeltaFe via stabilizing t2g orbitals.  The inflexible geometry of the macrocy-cle results in short Fe-N bonds, and density functional theory calculations show that this rigidity results in an unusual set of nested potential energy surfaces. Moreover, the lifetime and energy of the MLCT state depends strongly on the solvent environment. This dependence is caused by modulation of the axial ligand-field strength by Lewis acid-base interactions between the solvent and the cyano ligands.

Despite different chemical schemes, a clear scalable strategy for micromanaging the bandgap is lagging.   Since conductivity arises from the delocalized \u03c0-electrons, chemical intuition suggests that selective saturation of some sp2 carbons will allow strategic control over the bandgap. However, the logical cognition of different 2D \u03c0-delocalization topologies is complex. Their impact on the thermodynamic stability and bandgap remains unknown. Using partially oxidized graphene with its facile and reversible epoxides, we show that delocalization overwhelmingly influences the nature of the frontier bands. Organic electronic effects like hyperconjugation, conjugation, aromaticity, etc., can be used effectively to understand the impact of delocalization. By keeping a constant C4O stoichiometry, the relative stability of various \u03c0-delocalization topologies is directly assessed without resorting to resonance energy concepts.   Our results demonstrate that >C=C< and aromatic sextets are the two fundamental blocks resulting in a large bandgap in isolation. Extending the delocalization across these units will increase the stability at the expense of the band gap. The bandgap is directly related to the extent of bond alternation within the \u03c0-framework, with forced single/double bonds causing the large gap. Furthermore, it also establishes the ground rules for the thermodynamic stability associated with the \u03c0-delocalization in 2D systems.

In this article, we present a mechanochemical one-pot reaction that depolymerises high-molecular-mass fractions by environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide oxidation and introduces new carbonyl functionalities into the lignin framework. First, kraft lignin was ground using sodium percarbonate (SPC) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in a ball mill at different time intervals. After acidic work-up, the samples were analysed by infrared spectroscopy (IR), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic vapour sorption (DVS), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Already after 5 minutes, a reduction from the mass average molecular weight (Mw) of 47% and an increased carbonyl absorption by a factor of 2 can be observed. DVS data show a ~2.8-fold increase in water adsorption and provide information about the adsorption mechanism caused by the chemical modification. SAXS data show that there is no significant surface area increase of the lignin particles when additives are used, supporting the hypothesis that the increased adsorption performance is caused by chemical modification. A principal component analysis (PCA) gives additional insight into the IR spectra and SAXS parameter correlations. Refining of industrial lignin to produce homogeneous fractions with enhanced surface properties is essential for high-value applications", "date": "2022-12-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In fact, the self-replication of nucleic acids remains strongly hindered by product inhibition, even when enzymes are present. Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self-replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved. Previously, our group reported lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA), which is an isothermal ligase chain reaction. It was proposed that the lesion, a destabilizing abasic group, played an important role in reducing product inhibition. However, using abasic groups in non-enzymatic ligation cycles did not yield appreciable amplification. In order to identify the unknown factors that overcome product inhibition in LIDA, we have performed a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the process, employing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and global fitting of PAGE fluorescence data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We found that in the absence of an enzyme, the ligated product binds four to five orders of magnitude more tightly to the template than to the shorter unligated strands of the intermediate complex. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase, this stability gap was reduced by two orders of magnitude, such that the intermediate and product complexes were roughly equal in stability. Thus, the ligase helps overcome product inhibition by reducing the affinity difference between the DNA product duplex and the intermediate complex. Furthermore, kinetic simulations showed that the stability of the intermediate complex, as well as the rate constant of ligation, significantly impacts the rate of self-replication, suggesting that catalysts that stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to efficient nonenzymatic replication.", "date": "2022-12-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Molecular docking is the most popular virtual screening technique, it predicts the binding of candidate compounds to the protein target by modeling the interactions at the binding pocket. Despite being widely used, docking accuracy is often low due to the difficulty of modeling inherently complex biological systems. On the other hand, state of the art deep neural networks, like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are able to capture the complex non-linear relationships between structural and biological data, but they lack the interpretability of structure-based modeling. In this work we took advantage of the activity data from a quantitative High Throughput Screen (HTS) of ~200K compounds against Cruzain (Cz) to retrospectively evaluate the ability of a docking algorithm and a Graph Convolutional Network for prioritizing the active compounds from the dataset. We then propose strategies to combine both techniques in a single virtual screening pipeline in order to exploit their orthogonal benefits. By plugging in the atomic embeddings learned by the GCN into the docking algorithm by means of pharmacophoric restraints, docking ability to retrieve the active ligands was enhanced. Moreover, by applying the GCN as a pre-docking filter, the compound\u2019s library was enriched in active molecules and subsequent docking of the filtered library achieved significantly higher hit rates.

Contrary to empirical scoring functions, absolute protein-ligand binding free energy perturbation (ABFEP) provides a theoretically more rigorous and accurate description of protein-ligand binding thermodynamics and could in principle greatly improve the hit rates in virtual screening. In this work, we describe an implementation of an accurate and reliable ABFEP method in FEP+. We validated the ABFEP method on eight congeneric compound series binding to eight protein receptors including both neutral and charged ligands. For ligands with net charges, the alchemical ion approach is adopted to avoid artifacts in electrostatic potential energy calculations. The calculated binding free energies are highly correlated with experimental results with the weighted average of R2 of 0.55 for the entire dataset and an overall RMSE of 1.1 kcal/mol when protein reorganization effect upon ligand binding was accounted for. Through ABFEP calculations using apo versus holo protein structures, we demonstrated that the protein conformational and protonation state changes between the apo and holo proteins are the main physical factors contributing to the protein reorganization free energy manifested by the overestimation of raw ABFEP calculated binding free energies using the holo structures of the proteins. Furthermore, we performed ABFEP calculations in three virtual screening applications for hit enrichment. ABFEP greatly improves the hit rates as compared to docking scores or other methods like metadynamics. The highly accurate ABFEP results demonstrated in this work position it as a useful tool to improve the hit rates in virtual screening, thus facilitate hit discovery.", "date": "2022-12-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we show that in HeLa cells, primary mouse fibroblasts and astrocytes, N6-substituted adenosines, such as N6-(2- furanylmethyl)adenosine (known as kinetin riboside) and N6-benzyladenosine, inhibit ubiquitin phosphorylation that is induced by established mitochondrial depolarizing agents, CCCP and niclosamide. Although these nucleoside analogues inhibited niclosamide- and CCCP-induced ubiquitin phosphorylation, they did not prevent the mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Notably, treatment of cells with these nucleoside analogues alone induced low level mitophagy and did not cause mitochondrial fragmentation. Together, this work presents N6-substituted adenosines as new inhibitors of CCCP- and niclosamide-induced PINK1-mediated ubiquitin phosphorylation and highlights their potential utility in treating aged and sporadic PD as well as Lewy body dementia patients who have elevated levels of phosphorylated ubiquitin.", "date": "2022-12-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

These two conditions are associated to one protein, AMPK. Studies have shown that vanadium complexes, such as bis(N',N'-dimethylbiguanidato)-oxovanadium (IV), VO(metf)2\u00b7H2O, are potential agents against AD. A crucial step on drug design studies is obtaining information about the structure and interaction of these complexes with the biological targets involved in the process through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. However, MDs depend on the choice of a good force field that could present reliable results. Moreover, general force fields are not efficient for describing the properties of metal complexes, and a VO(metf)2\u00b7H2O-specific force field does not yet exist, thus the proper development of a parameter set is necessary. Furthermore, this investigation is essential and relevant given the importance for both the scientific community and the population that is affected by this neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, the present work aims to develop and validate the AMBER force field parameters for VO(metf)2\u00b7H2O, since the literature lacks such information on metal complexes, and investigate through classical molecular dynamics the interactions made by the complex with the protein. The proposed force field proved to be effective for describing the vanadium complex (VC), supported by different analysis and validation. Moreover, it had a great performance when compared to general AMBER force field. Beyond that, MD findings provided an in-depth perspective about vanadium complex-protein interactions that should be taken into consideration in future studies.", "date": "2022-12-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Injectable hydrogels that can effectively provide intra-tumoral delivery of photosensitizers with sustained release is attracting increased interest for photodynamic cancer therapies. However, most of the hydrogels for PDT applications are based on systems with high complexity and often, pre-clinical validation is not provided. Herein, we provide a simple and reliable pH-sensitive hydrogel formulation that presents proper rheological properties for intra-tumoral injection. For this, Temoporfin (m-THPC), which is one of the most potent clinical photosensitizers, was chemically modified to introduce functional groups that act as cross-linkers in the formation of chitosan-based hydrogels. The introduction of -COOH groups gave rise to a water-soluble derivative, named as PS 2, that was the most promising candidate. Although PS 2 was not internalized by the target cells, its extracellular activation cause effective damage of the cancer cells which was likely mediated by lipid peroxidation. The injection of the hydrogel containing PS 2 in the tumors was monitored by high frequency ultrasounds and in vivo fluorescence imaging which confirmed the sustained release of PS 2 for at least 72 h. Following local administration, light exposure was conducted one (single irradiation protocol) or three (multiple irradiation protocol) times. The latter deliver the best therapeutic outcomes which included complete tumor regression and systemic anti-cancer immune responses. Immunological memory was developed as ~ 75% of the mice cured with our strategy rejected a second rechallenge with live cancer cells. Additionally, failure of PDT to treat immunocompromised mice bearing tumors reinforces the relevance of the host immune system. Finally, our strategy promotes anti-cancer immune responses that lead to the abscopal protection against distant metastases.

Analysis of immune cells, alveolar macrophages, extracellular vesicles, and cytokine profiling in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed that MoS2 nanosheets induced initiation of lung inflammation that was rapidly resolved despite the persistence of various biotransformed molybdenum-containing nanostructures in alveolar macrophages and extracellular vesicles up to one month.  Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy experiments, we could evidence the dynamics of MoS2 nanosheets transformation triggered by reactive oxygen species. Three main transformation mechanisms were observed directly at the nanoscale level: 1) scrolling of the dispersed sheets leading to the formation of nanoscrolls and folded patches, 2) etching releasing soluble MoO4-, and 3) oxidation generating oxidized sheet fragments. Extracellular vesicles released in BALF were also identified as a potential shuttle of MoS2 nanostructures and their degradation products and more importantly as mediators of inflammation resolution.\n", "date": "2022-12-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Biocompatible Materials; Biodegradable Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Herein, we described a spatially resolved top-down proteomics (TDP) platform for proteoform identification and quantitation directly from tissue sections. The spatial TDP platform consisted of a nanoPOTS (nanodroplet Processing in One pot for Trace Samples)-based sample preparation system and an LCM (laser capture microdissection)-based cell isolation system. We improved the nanoPOTS sample preparation by adding benzonase in the extraction buffer to enhance the coverage of nucleus proteins. Using ~200 cultured cells as test samples, this approach increased total proteoform identifications from 493 to 700; with newly identified proteoforms primarily corresponding to nuclear proteins. To demonstrate the spatial TDP platform in tissue samples, we analyzed LCM-isolated tissue voxels from rat brain cortex and hypothalamus regions. We quantified 509 proteoforms within the union of TopPIC and TDPortal identifications to match with features from ProMex.  Several proteoforms corresponding to the same gene exhibited mixed abundance profiles between two tissue regions, suggesting potential PTM-specific spatial distributions.

The main active constituents within the cannabis plant are cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which have been categorized as either non-intoxicating with benefit or intoxicating with no benefit. These categories are constantly ignored, as cannabinoids have shown efficacy in the treatment of certain diseases and ailments as single-agent compounds.  Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a rare cannabinoid, is a homologue of THC, with the C5 alkyl chain having three carbons rather than the standard five carbon length. THCV has garnered attention in a clinical setting as an anti-obesity drug treating glucose issues. Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC), a hydrogenated analogue of THC, is a rare cannabinoid like THCV. These cyclic cannabinoids are considered rare, because they are typically found in minimal to trace amounts within cannabis sativa and their given C. indica, and C. ruderalis sub species. Increased popularity of these rare cannabinoids has led to proposed experimentation leading to assessing the cytotoxicity of these cannabinoids toward, cancer cells of the pancreas (MIA-PaCa2, HPAF-II, and PANC1).

By utilizing the nitroanilines hyperpolarizability trend based on charge transfer (pNA>oNA>mNA), we can uncover how the excitation wavelength affects the prediction of the hyperpolarizabilities in both on and off resonant regimes, and optimal gap tuning of RSH functionals. In non-resonant regions, with reference to CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ and experimental studies, we find that some computational approaches do not always reproduce the nitroanilines trend at specific excitation wavelengths. For example, RSH functionals require optimal gap tuning to reproduce the trend. In resonant regions, we find that the damped response theory predicts that the trend is maintained at the two-photon absorption, however, it breaks near the one photon pole. This suggests that the underlying charge transfer characteristics are undermined in the one-photon pole which in comparison to the two-state model suggests that this is due to the presence of other electronic states in some of the isomers.

Their physical properties often need to be tuned by chemical modification, e.g. by oxidation using periodate, to introduce carboxylic acid, ketone or aldehyde functional groups. The reproducibility required for application on an industrial scale, however, is challenged by uncertainty about the composition of product mixtures obtained and of the precise structural changes that the reaction with periodate induces. Here, we show that despite the structural diversity of gum arabic, primarily rhamnose and arabinose subunits undergo oxidation, whereas (inchain) galacturonic acids are unreactive towards periodate. Using model sugars, we show that periodate preferentially oxidises the anti 1,2-diols in the rhamnopyranoside monosaccharides present as terminal groups in the biopolymer. While formally oxidation of vicinal diols results in the formation of two aldehyde groups, only traces of aldehydes are observed in solution, with the main final products obtained being substituted dioxanes, both in solution and in the solid state. The substituted dioxanes form most likely by the intramolecular reaction of one aldehyde with a nearby hydroxyl group, followed by hydration of the remaining aldehyde to form a geminal diol.

Wade; Davey Jones", "abstract": "This manuscript showcases results from a large scale and comprehensive wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) study focussed on multi-biomarker suite analysis of both chemical and biological determinants in 10 cities and towns across England equating to a population of ~7 million people. Multi-biomarker suite analysis, describing city metabolism, can provide a holistic understanding to encompass all of human, and human-derived, activities of a city in a single model: from lifestyle choices (e.g. caffeine intake, nicotine) through to health status (e.g. prevalence of pathogenic organisms, usage of pharmaceuticals as proxy for non-communicable disease, NCD, conditions or infectious disease status), and exposure to harmful chemicals due to environmental and industrial sources (e.g. pesticide intake via contaminated food and industrial exposure). Population normalised daily loads (PNDLs) of many chemical markers were found, to a large extent, driven by the size of population contributing to wastewater (especially NCDs). However, there are several exceptions providing insights into chemical intake that can inform either disease status in various communities or unintentional exposure to hazardous chemicals: e.g. very high PNDLs of ibuprofen in Hull resulting from its direct disposal (confirmed by ibuprofen/2-hydroxyibuprofen ratios) and bisphenol A (BPA) in Hull, Lancaster and Portsmouth likely related to industrial discharge. An importance for tracking endogenous health markers such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNE-MA, an oxidative stress marker) as a generic marker of health status in communities was observed due to increased levels of HNE-MA seen at Barnoldswick wastewater treatment plant that coincided with higher-than-average paracetamol usage and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in this community. PNDLs of virus markers were found to be highly variable. Being very prevalent in communities nationwide during sampling, SARS-CoV-2 presence in wastewater was to large extent community driven. The same applies to the fecal marker virus, crAssphage, which is very prevalent in urban communities. In contrast, norovirus and enterovirus showed much higher variability in prevalence across all sites investigated, with clear cases of localised outbreaks in some cities while maintaining low prevalence in other locations. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates the potential for WBE to provide an integrated assessment of community health which can help target and validate policy interventions aimed at improving public health and well-being.", "date": "2022-12-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Small molecule therapeutic candidates with increased 3D complexity, on average, possess a higher probability of clinical success. However, new drug targets remain dominated by flat molecules due the wealth of robust coupling reactions available for their construction. Heteroarene dearomatization reactions offer an ideal opportunity to transform readily accessible 2D structures into saturated analogs. Broadly employed heteroarene hydrogenation reactions rehybridize C(sp2) sites to C(sp3) without otherwise perturbing the molecular shape. In stark contrast, heteroarene difunctionalization strategies dramatically change the molecular structure. In principle, heteroarene hydrofunctionalization reactions constitute an elusive middle ground by disrupting aromaticity and introducing a single molecular vector. Unfortunately, dearomative hydrofunctionalization reactions remain limited. Herein, we report a new strategy to enable the dearomative hydrocarboxylation of indoles and related heterocycles. This reaction represents a rare example of a heteroarene hydrofunctionalization that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug discovery. The transformation is highly chemoselective, broad in scope, operationally simple, and readily amenable to high-throughput experimentation (HTE). Accordingly, this process will allow existing libraries of heteroaromatic compounds to be translated into diverse 3D analogs and enable exploration of new classes of medicinally relevant molecules.

While many machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed, in the absence of binding data, molecular docking is the most widely used option to predict binding modes and score hundreds of thousands of compounds for binding affinity to the target protein. Docking's effectiveness is critically dependent on the protein-ligand (P-L) scoring function (SF), thus re-scoring with more rigorous SFs is a common practice. In this pilot study, we scrutinize the PM6-D3H4X/COSMO semi-empirical quantum mechanical (SQM) method as a docking pose re-scoring tool on 17 diverse receptors and ligand decoy sets, totaling 1.5 million P-L complexes. We investigate the effect of explicitly computed ligand conformational entropy and ligand deformation energy on SQM P-L scoring in a virtual screening (VS) setting, as well as molecular mechanics (MM) versus hybrid SQM/MM structure optimization prior to re-scoring. Our results proclaim that there is no obvious benefit from computing ligand conformational entropies or deformation energies and that optimizing only the ligand's geometry on the SQM level is sufficient to achieve the best possible scores. Instead, we leverage machine learning (ML) to include implicitly the missing entropy terms to the SQM score using ligand topology, physicochemical, and P-L interaction descriptors. Our new hybrid scoring function, named SQM-ML, is transparent and explainable, and achieves in average 9% higher AUC-ROC than PM6-D3H4X/COSMO and 3% higher than Glide SP, but with consistent and predictable performance across all test sets, unlike the former two SFs, whose performance is considerably target-dependent and sometimes resembles that of a random classifier.

While first-principles treatments for this system are seriously limited by the computational cost of exploring its large conformational space, classical force-fields are not transferable enough to represent it accurately. Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) is an intermediate complexity approach capable of capturing the electronic nature of different environments with a relatively low computational cost.

The model parameters are constructed with a particular emphasis on their transferability for the entire Li$_x$Si composition range. This is achieved by introducing a new optimization procedure that weights stoichiometries differently to improve the prediction of their formation energies.

However, tuning the polymer solution-state aggregation for optimal film morphology remains challenging due to a lack of understanding of polymer aggregates in the solution-state. Herein, we demonstrate that polymer solution-state aggregate structure significantly impacts the BHJ film morphology and processing temperature resiliency of OSCs. Using X-ray scattering and imaging techniques, we ascertain that the donor polymer PM7 forms a combination of large fibrillar aggregates and network-like aggregates comprised of single polymer chains while its derivatives PM7 D1 and D2 are mainly composed of polymer network-like aggregates in solution. Upon increasing the solution temperature, large fibrillar aggregates dissolve while polymer network-like aggregates maintain their network structures. Surprisingly, regardless of the polymer system, we show that OSCs fabricated from polymer network-like aggregates yield favorable BHJ morphology comprised of small domains with face-on preferred molecular orientation while large fibrillar aggregates lead to poor film morphologies consisting of large domains without preferential molecular orientation. Due to their stability with temperature, polymer network-like aggregates are resilient to processing temperature variation whereas fibrillar aggregates are sensitive to processing temperature. Overall, this work highlights the critical role of solution-state aggregation of polymers, especially their aggregate structures, in achieving OSCs with favorable morphology and high processing resiliency.

However, epitaxial growth of single-crystalline 2D bismuthene nanoflakes inevitably requires a high vacuum environment, primarily due to the high surface energy constraints of Bi. Herein, we report the growth of 2D single-crystalline hexagonal bismuthene nanoflakes on Cu foil substrate at atmospheric pressure by chemical vapor deposition. Based on first-principles calculations, the structural transformation of Bi on Cu foil can be suppressed by introducing the top h-BN layer, which potentially compensates for the charge transfer from Bi to the Cu (1 1 1) surface. The sandwich structure is identified by cross-sectional SEM and EDS characterization, demonstrating that bismuthene nanoflakes are sandwiched between the h-BN film and Cu foil. Benefiting from the encapsulation of the top h-BN layer, bismuthene nanoflakes also exhibit excellent thermal stability in ambient air even after annealing at 500 \u00b0C for 10 min. For further practical application, bismuthene nanoflakes are utilized for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). These bismuthene nanoflakes demonstrate remarkable ability in converting CO2 to formic acid with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.3% at \u20121.0 V (vs. RHE) and exhibit great catalytic stability with a Faradaic efficiency of over 90% in 15 h CO2RR tests.

These three cases correspond to common epidemiological study designs. Using high spatial resolution (census-block-level) national empirical model estimates of source- and chemically-specific PM2.5 concentration predictions, we quantified the contribution of various sources and processes to PM2.5 exposure contrasts in these three cases. \n\nResults: At the metro level (i.e., metropolitan statistical area; MSA), exposure contrasts of PM2.5 vary between -1.8 to 1.4 \u00b5g m-3 relative to the MSA-mean with about 50% of within-MSA exposure contrast of PM2.5 caused by cooking and mobile source primary PM2.5. For the national exposure contrast at low resolution (i.e., using MSA-average mean concentrations), exposure contrasts (relative to the national mean: -3.9 to 3.2 \u00b5g m-3) are larger than within an MSA with ~80% of the variation due to secondary PM2.5. National exposure contrast at high resolution (census block) has the largest absolute range (relative to the national mean: -4.7 to 3.7 \u00b5g m-3) due to both regional and intra-urban contributions; on average, 65% of the national exposure contrast is due to secondary PM2.5 with the remaining from the primary PM2.5 (cooking and mobile source 26%, other 9%). \n\nDiscussion:  While national epidemiological studies that use high-spatial-resolution exposure estimates maximize the exposure contrast of total PM2.5, other study designs may offer advantages to investigate the health impacts of specific components. City/metro scale studies better isolate the health impacts of primary PM2.5 from local sources, while national studies with low-spatial resolution can help to infer the health impacts of secondary PM2.5.

Using untargeted metabolomics profiling, which provides unbiased information regarding lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise, we aim to identify the molecular mechanisms connecting lifestyle and breast cancer through network analysis.\n \nMethods:  A total of 100 post-menopausal women, 50 with breast cancer and 50 cancer-free controls were selected from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP). We measured untargeted plasma metabolomics using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Using the \u2018enet\u2019 package, we retained highly correlated metabolites representing active molecular network (AMN) clusters for analysis.  A typical machine learning workflow (LASSO) was used to examine associations between cancer status and AMN metabolites and covariates such as BMI, age, and reproductive factors. LASSO was then repeated to examine associations between AMN metabolites and 10 lifestyle related variables including smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, meat consumption, fruit and vegetables consumption, and supplemental vitamin use. Results were displayed as a network to uncover biological pathways linking lifestyle factors to breast cancer status.\n \nResults:  After filtering, there were 1797 metabolomics peaks in the plasma samples. Of these, 851 \u201cactive\u201d metabolites were retained in 197 correlation AMN clusters. Using LASSO, breast cancer status was associated with 71 \u201cactive\u201d metabolites. Several of these metabolites were associated with lifestyle variables including meat consumption, alcohol consumption, and supplemental \u03b2-carotene, B12 and folate use. No individual lifestyle factors were significantly associated with breast cancer status using LASSO, suggesting that metabolites may act as biological intermediaries between healthy lifestyle factors and breast cancer. In particular, DiHODE, a metabolite linked with inflammation, was associated with breast cancer status and connected to \u03b2-carotene supplement usage through an AMN. \n \nConclusions: We found several plasma metabolites associated with lifestyle factors and breast cancer status. Future studies investigating the mechanistic role of inflammation in linking supplement usage to breast cancer status are warranted.", "date": "2022-12-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This is because any drug delivery system, while having its advantages, also suffers from certain limitations. Therefore, new and hybrid structures are created by combining different materials. In this respect, lipid-polymer hybrid particles emerged as a core-shell structure, where the polymer core is covered with a layer of phospholipids, and have attracted attention in the academic community.\nThis manuscript, which provides an overview of the fundamentals of these molecular architectures, begins with a description of lipid-polymer hybrid particles.

OSPW contains naphthenic acids (NAs), a class of aliphatic and cyclic carboxylic acids that can be toxic and are recalcitrant to natural attenuation. A passive advanced oxidation process (P-AOP), such as solar photocatalysis (PC) with buoyant photocatalysts (BPCs, TiO2-coated buoyant microspheres), is promising for NA treatment, through conversion to more hydrophilic forms (partial oxidation) or to CO2 (complete mineralization), depending on the solar dose. Although BPCs exhibit strong reactivity, full NA mineralization can require impractical hydraulic retention times. Biodegradation is another promising passive approach, but biodegradation rates are ultimately inhibited by the toxicity and structural complexity of NAs. We hypothesized that biological NA removal kinetics could be enhanced through BPC pre-treatment, since partial oxidation can lower NA toxicity and improve their biodegradability. Different PC exposure durations were used to pre-treat simulated OSPW prior to a biological treatment stage (with natural microbial culture from OSPW), to understand their impacts on NA chemical speciation and biodegradation kinetics. PC pre-treatment (2 d) enabled full mineralization (to <3 mg/L COD) and >99.9% removal of acid-extractable organics (AEO) in secondary biological treatment (21 d). Mineralization was achieved earlier in the combined PC+bio treatment than by photocatalysis alone (33 d vs. >42.2 d), and microbial growth rate was accelerated 23-fold compared to the non-pre-treated water. Overall, BPCs can improve NA biodegradability to achieve mineralization through a fully passive combined treatment process, without chemical or energy inputs.

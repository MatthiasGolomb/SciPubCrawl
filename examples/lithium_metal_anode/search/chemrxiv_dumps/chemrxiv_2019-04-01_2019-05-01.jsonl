Understanding oxygen chemistry on oxide materials is significantly more complicated than studying transition metal catalysts for two reasons: the most stable surface coverage under reaction conditions is extremely important but difficult to understand without many detailed calculations, and there are many possible active sites and configurations on O* or OH* covered surfaces. We have developed an automated and high-throughput approach to solve this problem and predict OER overpotentials for arbitrary oxide surfaces. We demonstrate this for a number of previously-unstudied IrO2 and IrO3 polymorphs and their facets. We discovered that low index surfaces of IrO2 other than rutile (110) are more active than the most stable rutile (110), and we identified promising active sites of IrO2 and IrO3 that outperform rutile (110) by 0.2 V in theoretical overpotential. Based on findings from DFT calculations, we pro- vide catalyst design strategies to improve catalytic activity of Ir based catalysts and demonstrate a machine learning model capable of predicting surface coverages and site activity.

In this study, mesoporous films consisting of SBA-15 particles grown onto silicon wafers using wet processing were evaluated as a scaffold for drug delivery. Films with various particle sizes (100 \u2013 900 nm) and hence thicknesses were grown onto OTS-functionalized silicon wafers using a direct growth method. Precise patterning of the areas for film growth could be obtained by local removal of the OTS functionalization through laser ablation. The films were incubated with the model drug DiO, and murine myoblast cells (C2C12 cells) were seeded onto films with different particle sizes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to study the cell growth, and a vinculin-mediated adherence of C2C12 cells on all films was verified. The successful loading of DiO into the films was confirmed by UV-vis and CLSM. It was observed that the drugs did not desorb from the particles during 24 hours in cell culture. During adherent growth on the films for 4 h, small amounts of DiO and separate particles were observed inside single cells. After 24 h, a larger number of particles and a strong DiO signal were recorded in the cells, indicating a particle mediated drug uptake.

E. coli GAR Tfase exhibits structural changes and the binding of ligands that varies with pH which leads to change the rate of the formyl transfer reaction in a pH-dependent manner.

Understanding the chemical composition and distribution within fingermarks may help explain variation in latent fingermark detection with existing methods and identify new strategies to increase detection capabilities. The majority of research in the literature describes investigation of organic components of fingermark residue, leaving the elemental distribution less well understood. The relative scarcity of information regarding the elemental distribution within fingermarks is in part due to previous unavailability of direct, micron resolution elemental mapping techniques. This capability is now provided at third generation synchrotron light sources, where X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy (XFM) provides micron or sub-micron spatial resolution and direct detection with sub-\u03bcM detection limits. XFM has been applied in this study to reveal the distribution of inorganic components within fingermark residue, including endogenous trace metals (Fe, Cu, Zn), diffusible ions (Cl-, K+, Ca2+), and exogeneous metals (Ni, Ti, Bi). This study incorporated a multi-modal approach using XFM and Infrared Microspectroscopy (IRM) analyses to demonstrate co-localisation of endogenous metals within the hydrophilic organic components of fingermark residue. Additional experiments were then undertaken to investigate how sources of exogenous metals (e.g. coins and cosmetics) may be transferred to, and distributed within latent fingermarks. Lastly, this study reports a preliminary assessment of how environmental factors such as exposure to aqueous environments may effect elemental distribution within fingermarks. Taken together, the results of this study advance our current understanding of fingermark composition and its spatial distribution of chemical components, and may help explain detection variation observed during detection of fingermarks using standard forensic protocols.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2019-04-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Imaging; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Using bond lengths as a powerful descriptor of ionization feasibility, we also identify that literature values for drug compounds celecoxib, glimepiride and glipizide are inaccurate. Our newly measured experimental values match our initial predictions to within 0.26 pKa units, whereas previous values were found to deviate by up to 1.68 pKa units.

The multiplicity of the (d,d) state, and/or the rate of intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet metal-centered states, has remained uncertain due to the spin-insensitivity of many spectral probes. In this work, we directly probe the metal 3d shell occupation of nickel(II) octaethylporphyrin (NiOEP) using femtosecond M2,3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). A tabletop high-harmonic source is used to perform 400 nm pump, extreme-ultraviolet probe transient absorption spectroscopy with ~100 fs time resolution. Photoexcitation produces a (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state that evolves with a time constant of 48 fs to a vibrationally hot metal-centered triplet 3(d,d) excited state with a lifetime of 595 ps. The spin sensitivity of M-edge XANES allows the 3(d,d) state to be distinguished from a potential 1(d,d) state, as shown by charge transfer multiplet simulations and comparison to triplet nickel(II) oxide. Vibrational cooling of the hot triplet state occurs over tens of ps, with minimal change in the electronic structure of the nickel(II) center. No evidence of an LMCT or MLCT intermediate state is seen within the time resolution of the instrument, suggesting that if such a state exists in NiOEP it depopulates in <25 fs.

By virtue of a new bivalent sidechain on bPNA+, similar DNA affinity and hybrid thermostability can be obtained with half the molecular footprint of previously reported bPNA. Lysine derivatives bearing two melamine bases (K2M) can be prepared on multigram scale by double reductive alkylation with melamine acetaldehyde, resulting in a tertiary amine sidechain that affords both peptide solubility and selective base-triple formation with 4 T/U bases; the Fmoc-K2M derivative can be used directly in solid phase peptide synthesis, rendering bPNA+ conveniently accessible. A compact bPNA+ binding site of two U6 domains can be genetically encoded to replace existing 6 bp stem elements at virtually any location within an RNA transcript. We thus replaced internal 6 bp RNA stems that supported loop regions with 6 base-triple hybrid stems, using fluorophore-labeled bPNA+. As the loop regions engaged in RNA tertiary interactions, the labeled hybrid stems provided a fluorescent readout; bPNA+ enabled this readout without covalent chemical modification or introduction of new structural elements. This strategy was demonstrated to be effective for reporting on widely observed RNA tertiary interactions such as intermolecular RNA-RNA kissing loop dimerization, RNA-protein binding as well as intramolecular RNA tetraloop-tetraloop receptor binding, illustrating the potential general utility of this method. The modest 6 bp stem binding footprint of bPNA+ makes the hybrid stem replacement method practical for noncovalent installation of synthetic probes of RNA interactions. We anticipate that bPNA+ structural probes will be useful for the study of tertiary interactions in long noncoding RNAs. </p><div><br /></div>", "date": "2019-04-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For this situation previously presented models use the one electron reduction potential of the NAC reaction. If such value is not available, it has been has been proposed that it could be computed directly or estimated from the electron affinity (EA). The model proposed herein uses the Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as the parameter in the linear free energy model. Both models employ quantum chemical computations for the required thermodynamic parameters. The available and proposed models are compared using second order rate constants obtained from five investigations reported in the literature in which a variety of NACs were exposed to a variety of reductants. A comprehensive analysis utilizing all the NACs and reductants demonstrate that the computed hydrogen atom transfer model and the experimental one electron reduction potential model have similar root mean square errors and residual error probability distributions.

Barriers of different arene molecules trend well with their effective radii, and species with a smaller effective radii diffusive more readily. A previously published maximum rate analysis of arene interconversion pathways\u2014previously validated by experimental data\u2014is compared to a diffusion-free KMC model to confirm the accuracy of this KMC package. The temperature and pressure dependencies of rates obtained from KMC agree well with those of maximum rate analysis on the diffusion-free model, demonstrating that KMC effectively predicts rates as well as maximum rate analysis methods commonly used in kinetic applications of DFT. Arene interconversion pathways were also analyzed on KMC models incorporating diffusion to and from interior crystal sites. These simulations suggest that large species, such as hexamethylbenzene, become trapped at 10\u201320% of sites, thus causing site deactivation by limiting diffusion through MFI channels and lowering overall rates of product formation. Benzene diffusion barriers are artificially varied from 20\u2013200 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> and rates of benzene methylation decrease by 4-fold with diffusion barriers greater than 80 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup>; this suggests that species with diffusion barriers greater than 80 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> (such as penta- and hexamethylbenzene) will likely become trapped at interior sites and ultimately cause catalyst deactivation. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for a novel KMC package that expedites kinetic analysis of complex reaction pathways and introduces mass-transport limitations which are not commonly accounted for in kinetic DFT studies. This KMC package can predict the behavior of diffusion-limited species, such as penta- and hexamethylbenzene, and the mechanisms by which they are formed and eventually lead to catalyst deactivation.</a><br /></p>", "date": "2019-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nevertheless, a quantitative understanding of how do size and aggregation of ice-binding proteins determine the temperature Thet at which proteins nucleate ice is still lacking.

The simulations indicate that the 2.5 nm long antifreeze protein TmAFP nucleates ice at 2\u00b11 \u00b0C above the homogeneous nucleation temperature, in good agreement with recent experiments.

We implement an accurate procedure to determine Thet of surfaces of finite size using classical nucleation theory and, after validating the theory against Thet of the proteins in molecular simulations, we use it to predict Thet of the INP of Ps. syringae as a function of the length and number of proteins in the aggregates.

In this work, two approaches were taken to investigate the importance of \u03b2-SnSb formation on the cycling stability of Sn-rich Sn-Sb composite sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes. First, to tease out the role of each component, thin layers of amorphous silicon with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 10 nm, were incorporated between Sn and Sb layers, of equal thicknesses. Silicon has low solubility in both tin and antimony, and thus acts as a barrier layer that can interfere with the formation of Sn-Sb alloys. The equivalent composition of this sandwich structure was Sn<sub>53</sub>Sb<sub>47</sub>. Upon electrochemical cycling, a clear correlation between capacity retention and Si thickness was observed, and it was found that a 1 nm thick Si layer was sufficient to inhibit the formation of the \u03b2-SnSb intermetallic, resulting in loss of the capacity of the tin layer after a few tens of cycles. The second approach involved capping a Sn film with increasingly thicker Sb layers. Thicker antimony layers were found to have a large positive influence on cycling stability with a marked drop-off in the capacity retention when there is not enough Sb to fully convert the bilayer into \u03b2-SnSb. These results point to the necessity of the Sn and Sb being in intimate contact prior to cycling for the \u03b2-SnSb phase to form in-operando, which is necessary for the excellent capacity retention of the Sn-Sb system.", "date": "2019-04-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For spherical micelles, but not for cylindrical micelles, cross relaxation rates are positive only for surfactant alkyl tail atoms connected to the hydrophilic head group. All cross relaxation rates are negative for cylindrical micelles. This effect is reproducible either by changing composition (ratios of the nonionic surfactants) or changing temperature of a single surfactant in order to change the micelle shape. We validate the micelle shape by SANS and use the results as a guide for our simulations. We calculate parameters that determine relaxation rates directly from simulated trajectories, without introducing specific functional forms. Results indicate that relative motions of nearby atoms are liquid-like, in agreement with 13C T1 measurements, though constrained by micelle morphology. Relative motions of distant atoms have slower components because the relative changes in distances and angles are smaller when the moving atoms are further apart. The slow, long-range motions appear to be responsible for the predominantly negative cross relaxation rates observed in NOESY spectra. The densities of atoms from positions 1 and 2 in the boundary region are lower in spherical micelles compared to cylindrical micelles. Correspondingly, motions in this region are less constrained by micelle morphology in the spherical compared to the cylindrical cases.

We successfully constructed RF models on an unbalanced data set with the \u2018comparison\u2019 concept and, the resultant RF models were tested on CASF-2013.5 In a comparison of the performance of our RF models against 29 scoring functions, we found our models outperformed the other scoring functions in predicting the native pose. In addition, we used two artificial designed potential models to address the importance of the GARF potential in the RF models: (1) a scrambled probability function set, which was obtained by mixing up atom pairs and probability functions in GARF, and (2) a uniform probability function set, which share the same peak positions with GARF but have fixed peak heights. The results of accuracy comparison from RF models based on the scrambled, uniform, and original GARF potential clearly showed that the peak positions in the GARF potential are important while the well depths are not. <br />", "date": "2019-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this regard, computational research has driven important developments in the understanding and the design of heterogeneous OER catalysts by establishing linear scaling relations. These relations are of paramount importance since they drastically reduce the amount of time required to traverse the vast chemical search space of potential OER materials. In this work, we interrogate 17 of the most active molecular OER catalysts known to date based on different transition metals (M= Ru, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu), and show that they obey the linear scaling relations established for metal oxides. This demonstrates that the conventional OER descriptor established for heterogeneous systems can also be applied to rapidly screen novel molecular catalysts. However, we find that this descriptor underestimates the activity of some of the most active OER complexes as it does not consider the additional one-electron oxidation that these undergo prior to O\u2013O bond formation. Importantly, we show that this additional step allows certain molecular catalysts to circumvent the \u201coverpotential wall\u201d observed for heterogeneous systems (i.e. 370 mV), leading to an enhanced performance in agreement with experimental observations. To describe the activity of such highly active catalysts, we propose a new OER descriptor that opens up the possibility of designing molecular catalysts exhibiting zero theoretical overpotential. With all this knowledge, we establish the fundamental principles for the rational design of ideal OER catalysts to advance the development of water splitting technologies.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organometallic Compounds; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis; Electrochemistry - Organometallic; Energy Storage; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we propose a new method (DrugEx) to\ndiscover <i>de novo</i> drug-like molecules.\nDrugEx is an RNN model (generator) trained through reinforcement learning which\nwas integrated with a special exploration strategy. As a case study we applied\nour method to design ligands against the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor.\nFrom ChEMBL data, a machine learning model (predictor) was created to predict\nwhether generated molecules are active or not. Based on this predictor as the\nreward function, the generator was trained by reinforcement learning without\nany further data. We then compared the performance of our method with two\npreviously published methods, REINVENT and ORGANIC. We found that candidate\nmolecules our model designed, and predicted to be active, had a larger chemical\ndiversity, and better covered the chemical space of known ligands compared to\nthe state-of-the-art.</p><p></p>", "date": "2019-04-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To observe rare events and calculate transition rates in these systems, enhanced sampling is a necessity. In particular, the study of ligand-protein interactions necessitates a diverse ensemble of protein conformations and transition states, and for many systems this occurs on prohibitively long timescales. Previous strategies such as WExplore that can be used to determine these types of ensembles are hindered by problems related to the regioning of conformational space. Here we propose a novel, regionless, enhanced sampling method that is based on the weighted ensemble framework. In this method, a value referred to as \u201ctrajectory variation\u201d is optimized after each cycle through cloning and merging operations. This method allows for a more consistent measurement of observables and broader sampling resulting in the efficient exploration of previously unexplored conformations. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with the N-dimensional random walk and the unbinding of the trypsin-benzamidine system. The system is analyzed using conformation space networks, the residence time of benzamidine is confirmed, and a new unbinding pathway for the trypsin-benzamidine system is found. We expect that REVO will be a useful general tool to broadly explore free energy landscapes.", "date": "2019-04-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Its main goal is the development of determinant-driven selected configuration interaction (sCI) methods and multi-reference second-order perturbation theory (PT2). The determinant-driven framework allows\nthe programmer to include any arbitrary set of determinants in the reference space, hence providing greater method-\nological freedoms. The sCI method implemented in Quantum Package is based on the CIPSI (Configuration Interaction\nusing a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively) algorithm which complements the variational sCI energy with a PT2\ncorrection. Additional external plugins have been recently added to perform calculations with multireference coupled\ncluster theory and range-separated density-functional theory. All the programs are developed with the IRPF90 code\ngenerator, which simplifies collaborative work and the development of new features. Quantum Package strives to\nallow easy implementation and experimentation of new methods, while making parallel computation as simple and\nefficient as possible on modern supercomputer architectures. Currently, the code enables, routinely, to realize runs on\nroughly 2 000 CPU cores, with tens of millions of determinants in the reference space. Moreover, we have been able\nto push up to 12 288 cores in order to test its parallel efficiency. In the present manuscript, we also introduce some key\nnew developments: i) a renormalized second-order perturbative correction for efficient extrapolation to the full CI\nlimit, and ii) a stochastic version of the CIPSI selection performed simultaneously to the PT2 calculation at no extra\ncost. </p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>", "date": "2019-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational; Quantum Computing; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This extension overcomes the restriction of the typical density functional approach to ground states, and offers useful formal and demonstrated practical benefits. The correlation energy functional in the generalized case acquires higher complexity than its ground state counterpart, however. Little is known about its internal structure nor how to effectively approximate it in general. Here we show that such a functional can be broken down into natural components, including what we call ``state-'' and ``density-driven'' correlations, with the former amenable to conventional approximations, and the latter being a unique feature of ensembles. Such a decomposition, summarised in eq.(6), provides us with a pathway to general approximations that are able to routinely handle low-lying excited states. The importance of density-driven correlations is demonstrated, an approximation for them is introduced and shown to be useful.<br />", "date": "2019-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

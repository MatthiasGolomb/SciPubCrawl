A variety of mechanochromic mechanophores, which change color in response to stress, have been developed, but modulating the properties of the dyes generally requires the independent preparation of discrete derivatives.

The mechanophore is based on an activated furan precursor to donor\u2013acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) masked as a hetero-Diels\u2013Alder adduct. Mechanochemical activation of the mechanophore unveils the DASA precursor and subsequent reaction with a secondary amine generates an intensely colored DASA. Critically, the properties of the DASA are controlled by the amine and thus a single mechanophore can be differentiated post-activation to produce a wide range of functionally diverse DASAs. We highlight this system by establishing the concept of mechanochemical multicolor soft lithography whereby a complex multicolor composite image is printed into a mechanochemically active elastomer through an iterative process of localized compression followed by reaction with different amines.

Most of them employ precursors, solvents or additives that are considered difficult to handle, unstable, toxic, generally unfriendly with the environment and/or unsuitable for large scale industrial processes. In this work, we present a new effective chemical route for preparation of ferroelectric doped-HfO2 films. The solution is prepared from simple, stable, and available precursors, handled in an open atmosphere and requires no restrictive processing conditions. We used 5 at.% Ca as dopant of HfO2 to induce a maximum remnant polarization of 9.3 and 11.1 \u00b5C/cm2 for 54 and 90 nm thick Ca:HfO2 films, respectively. The current-electric field loops show intense and distinctive ferroelectric switching peaks and the corresponding ferroelectric loops show excellent saturation, which speaks of good device quality with low leakage. Crystallization and the wake-up of ferroelectricity in Ca:HfO2 films was attained by means of rapid thermal annealing at different temperatures and times in Ar:O2 atmosphere. In comparison to the thin films, thicker ones exhibited the highest remnant polarization at shorter annealing times, thus evidencing the need for precise control of thermal processing. The Ca:HfO2 films with thickness of 50 nm displayed a good balance between leakage and retention, maintaining the ferroelectric response above 105 cycles at 1 kHz. The developed precursor solution is promising for its use in spray-coating and ink-jet printing techniques.", "date": "2022-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Processing; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

We have developed a semi-automated data-driven workflow from identification to suspect screening, which allows highly selective monitoring of each identified chemical in a large-sample dataset. The example dataset used to illustrate the potential of the approach consisted of human sweat samples from 40 participants, including field blanks (80 samples). These samples have been collected in a Horizon 2020 project to investigate the capacity of body odour to communicate emotion and influence social behaviour. We used dynamic headspace extraction, which allows comprehensive extraction with high preconcentration capability, and has to date only been used for a few biological applications. We found 325 sweat volatiles compared to 581 known skin volatiles, 107 of which matched perfectly with the literature, and 218 compounds (67%) novel sweat volatiles.  Unlike partitioning-based extraction methods, the developed method detects semi-polar (log P < 2) nitrogen and oxygen-containing compounds. However, it is unable to detect certain acids due to the pH conditions of unmodified sweat samples. Using a single analytical method, our coverage of the boiling point and polarity space was comparable to the cumulative coverage of all the available 35 studies investigating skin volatiles with different analytical methods.

Taking into consideration the SARS-CoV-2 and Zika main proteases (Mpro) as the re-production key element of the viral cycle and its main target, herein we report an intensive computer-aided virtual screening for a focused list of  39  marine  lamellarins pyrrole alkaloids, against SARS-CoV-2 and Zika main proteases (Mpro) using a set of combined modern computational methodologies including molecular docking (MDock), molecule dynamic simulations (MDS) and structure-activity relationships (SARs) as well. Indeed, the molecular docking studies had revealed four promising marine alkaloids including [lamellarin H (14)/lamellarin K (17)] and [lamellarin S (26)/ lamellarin Z (39)], according to their notable ligand-protein energy scores and relevant binding affinities with the SARS-CoV-2 and Zika (Mpro) pocket residues, respectively. Consequentially, these four chemical hits were further examined thermodynamically though investigating their MD simulations at 100 ns, where they showed prominent stability within the accommodated (Mpro) pockets. Moreover, in-deep SARs studies suggested the crucial roles of the rigid fused polycyclic ring system, particularly aromatic A- and F- rings, position of the phenolic -OH and \uf064-lactone functionalities as essential structural and pharmacophoric characteristics for an effective protein ligand interaction against SARS-CoV-2 and Zika Mpro, respectively.

As a result, new resources have emerged for educators to implement systems thinking in chemistry education (STICE), including a proposed set of ST skills. While these efforts aim to make ST implementation easier, little is known about how to assess these skills in a chemistry context. Additionally, there are no studies that have investigated how chemistry students naturally engage with ST learning activities; such information would guide educators about where to place emphasis when teaching ST skills. In this study, we investigated ST skills employed by students who constructed visual representations (systems) of a topic related to climate change. Eighteen undergraduate chemistry students from first- to third-year participated in this study. We designed and implemented a ST intervention to capture how students engaged with three ST tasks, performed individually and collaboratively. In our analysis, we assessed eleven ST skills that aligned with the five characteristics of STICE proposed by York and Orgill. We found that most participants demonstrated these ST skills when assessing ST skills exactly as articulated in the literature. When further investigating the extent that participants demonstrated these skills, we identified aspects of these skills that participants did and did not demonstrate. We found that (1) participants\u2019 systems lacked concepts and connections at the submicroscopic level, (2) participants\u2019 systems included multiple types of connections in their systems but few circular loops and causal connections, (3) participants predicted how their systems changed over time but lacked multicomponent causal reasoning, and (4) participants\u2019 systems demonstrated the breadth of connections but did not consider human connections to the underlying chemistry of climate change topics. These findings identify aspects of ST where chemistry educators need to place emphasis when teaching ST skills to chemistry students and when guiding learning activities and other assessments.

Within this framework, we introduced the concept of induced-volatolomics enabling to monitor simultaneously the dysregulation of several tumour-associated enzymes in living mice or biopsies. This approach relies on the use of a cocktail of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-based probes that are activated enzymatically for releasing the corresponding VOCs. Exogenous VOCs can then be detected in the breath of mice or in the headspace above solid biopsies as specific tracers of enzyme activities. Our induced-volatolomics modality highlighted that the up-regulation of N-acetylglucosaminidase was a hallmark of several solid tumours. Having identified this glycosidase as a potential target for cancer therapy, we designed an enzyme-responsive albumin-binding prodrug of the potent monomethyl auristatin E programmed for the selective release of the drug in the tumour microenvironment. This tumour activated therapy produced a remarkable therapeutic efficacy on orthotopic triple-negative mammary xenografts in mice, leading to the disappearance of tumours in 66 % of treated animals. Thus, this study shows the potential of induced-volatolomics for the exploration of biological processes as well as the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2022-10-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Kevin Tindell; Lincoln Busselle; Julianne Holloway", "abstract": "Musculoskeletal interfacial tissues consist of complex gradients in structure, cell phenotype, and biochemical signaling that are important for function. Designing tissue engineering strategies to mimic these types of gradients is an ongoing challenge. In particular, new fabrication techniques that enable precise spatial control over fiber alignment are needed to better mimic the structural gradients present in interfacial tissues, such as the tendon-bone interface. Here, we report a modular approach to spatially controlling fiber alignment using magnetically-assisted electrospinning. Electrospun fibers were highly aligned in the presence of a magnetic field and smoothly transitioned to randomly aligned fibers away from the magnetic field. Importantly, magnetically-assisted electrospinning allows for spatial control over fiber alignment at sub-millimeter resolution along the length of the fibrous scaffold similar to the native structural gradient present in many interfacial tissues.

As expected, cells seeded onto gradient fibrous scaffolds were elongated and aligned on the aligned fibers and did not show a preferential alignment on the randomly aligned fibers.

However, several morphological and electro-chemo-mechanical challenges impede their development. Solid state electrolytes such as those based on polymers show great promise in replacing liquid electrolytes in lithium metal batteries. Polyether-based polymer electrolytes are the most investigated but are plagued by low room temperature ionic conductivity and poor oxidative stability. Hence, there is a great need for the development and understanding of ion transport in new classes of polymer electrolytes. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) based electrolytes have shown improved oxidative stability, but little is understood about their lithium solvation and transport mechanism. In this work, we use multinuclear solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the lithium cation environment and mobility in crosslinked single-ion and salt-in-polymer PFPE electrolytes and compare it directly to well-known polyethylene glycol (PEG) electrolytes. We show that the interaction of the lithium cation with the polymer backbone is weaker in PFPE systems compared to PEG, likely resulting in stronger ion pairing in the PFPE systems. Line shape analyses shows lower lithium mobility in PFPE electrolytes, despite lower activation energies being derived from spin-lattice relaxation (T1) measurements as compared to those for the PEG systems. The rapid relaxation is instead ascribed to the local fluctuations caused by polymer backbone mobility.  By studying different modes of ion binding (single-ion vs. salt-in-polymer), we show that differences across polymer backbones (PFPE vs PEG) have a greater effect on mobility than differences in ion binding modes within each polymer class (especially when single-ion conducting site density is not high). Our ability to use MAS NMR to study polymer electrolytes in their native state opens new opportunities to develop and understand novel polymer or hybrid solid state electrolytes for next generation lithium metal batteries.

Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid with \u03b1-nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Yet such reactions demand stringent criteria to satisfy biorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. The reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2 >103 M-1s-1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. Further, DFT calculations support that SHz facilitated DAB formation runs via the lowest energy transition state and provides the most stable conjugate product while considering other biocompatible \u03b1-nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery.

In particular, we report the development of a von Hamos spectrometer for the collection of Fe K\u03b2 emission optimized for analysis of dilute biological samples. We further showcase its application in crystals of the immunosuppressive heme-dependent enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Spectra from protein crystals in different states were compared with relevant reference compounds. Complementary density functional calculations assessing covalency support our spectroscopic analysis and identify active site conformations that correlate to high- and low-spin states. These experiments validate the suitability of an X-ray emission approach for determining spin states of previously uncharacterized metalloenzyme reaction intermediates.

We here report a highly efficient ring-chain recycling of polydithioacetal (PDTA) via ring-closing depolymerization (RCD) and entropy-driven ring-opening polymerization (ED-ROP). Pristine PDTAs can be conveniently synthesized via a one-step reaction using 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and \u03b1,\u03c9-alkyl dithiols with an acid catalyst. The resulting PDTAs undergo acid-catalyzed RCD with refluxing toluene to yield a mixture of macrocycles of various sizes with conversions of 75-95%. ED-ROP of these macrocyclic monomer mixtures in solution at room temperature affords virgin PDTAs, reaching high conversions of 80-95% within 2 h. Owing to the stability of dithioacetals, PDTAs are far more stable than the acetal counterparts, resisting hydrolysis under both acidic and basic conditions. With a floor temperature below 0 \u00b0C, depolymerization is not a concern in the bulk state even in the presence of residual catalysts as polymerization is favored at higher temperatures for ED-ROP. Once crosslinked, the network behaves as a vitrimer enabled by temperature-activated interchain exchange of dithioacetals in the bulk state.

In contrast, questions about what happens when two aromatic rings are closely stacked have remained unanswered. To the best of our knowledge, only one computational study has been performed by Herges, the results of which suggest that [2.2]paracyclophane, possessing short distance (<3.00 \u00c5) between two aromatic ring planes, has a paratropic ring current between two the benzene rings. This observation is consistent with the conclusion that stacked antiaromaticity exists within the \u03c0-congested space between aromatic rings. Herein, we investigated the antiaromaticity of highly \u03c0-congested anthracene dimers using anthracenophane, which possesses a short inter-plane carbon-carbon distance of ca. 2.80 \u00c5.

In this study, we establish that the single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates. High site selectivity was observed in many cases, and activity on relatively unactivated substrates and heterocyclic substrates was demonstrated. High enantioselectivity was observed for atroposelective halogenation and halocyclization reactions. Site-selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF. The substrate and reaction scope of AetF, along with the fact that this enzyme requires only a commercially available glucose dehydrogenase to drive its halogenase activity, suggest that it has the potential to greatly improve the utility of biocatalytic halogenation.

In this detection scheme, hybridization of locally enriched target nucleic acids to the beads modulates the conduction of ions along the bead surfaces. This is a fundamental advancement in that this mechanism is similar to that observed in nanopore sensors, yet occurs in a bed of microbeads with microscale interstices. In application, this approach has several distinct advantages. First, electrokinetic enrichment requires only a simple DC power supply, and in combination with non-optical detection, makes this method amenable to point-of-care application. Second, the sensor is easy to fabricate, comprised of a packed bed of commercially-available microbeads, which can be readily modified with a wide range of probe types, thereby making this a versatile platform. Finally, the sensor is highly sensitive (picomolar) despite the modest 100-fold pre-enrichment we employ here by faradaic ion concentration polarization (fICP). Further gains are anticipated under conditions for fICP focusing that are known to yield higher enrichment factors (up to 100,000-fold enrichment). Here, we demonstrate detection of 3.7 pM single-stranded DNA complementary to the bead-bound oligoprobe, following a 30-min single step of enrichment and hybridization. Our results indicate that a shift in the slope of a current-voltage curve (CVC) occurs upon hybridization, and that this shift is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of target DNA. Finally, we investigate the proposed mechanism of sensing by developing a numerical simulation that shows an increase in ion flux through the bed of insulating beads given changes in surface charge and zeta potential consistent with our experimental conditions.

Here, we report the electrospinning of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) for three different molecular weights of P3HT: 31, 58, and 83 kDa. Chloroform was used as a solvent, and a high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was utilized to facilitate the processing of P3HT. The electrospinning was performed on the freshly prepared and 24 h aged spinning solutions. The aging of the spinning solution led to the self-assembly of P3HT chains, particularly with dominant H-aggregation for 83 kDa P3HT. The structure development and properties of the fibers were investigated, including the single-fiber electrical conductivity measured using a custom-built setup.  The electrical conductivity has been found to be increasing with increasing molecular weight, and as high as a five-fold enhancement in single fiber electrical conductivity was obtained compared to the fiber from the freshly-prepared solution. Despite a 25% PEO concentration in the fibers, the maximum electrical conductivity of a single fiber was found to be \u22482.7 X 10^(-5) S/cm, similar to the pristine P3HT thin films.

Here, out-of-equilibrium self-organization is demonstrated at an air-water interface, enabled by amphiphile filaments that self-assemble from source droplets and tether to pivalic anhydride-based drain droplets, which are surrounded by a pivalic acid gradient due to their hydrolysis. The coupling of chemical gradients, self-assembly and Marangoni flow due to release and depletion of amphiphiles at the air-water interface generates a unique orbiting of drain droplets around the source droplet. This orbiting is proposed to be driven by the selective adhesion of filaments to the front of the moving drain, while filaments approaching the drain from behind are destabilized upon contact with the asymmetrical gradient of pivalic acid. The motion sustains itself to complete multiple rotations, ending when the depletion of amphiphiles at the drain, which drives the Marangoni flow towards the drain, becomes too weak to attract new filaments.

Here, we use a graph neural network (GNN) to evaluate the adsorption energy of molecular species adsorbed on metallic surfaces. The GNN is trained on a set of C1\u20134 fragments including N, O, S heteroatoms and C6\u201310 aromatic rings. Compared to DFT, the GNN shows a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 eV on the test set being 6 orders of magnitude faster. When applying the trained model with subsequent hyperparameter optimization to molecules of industrial interest (biomass, plastics and polyurethanes precursors) containing up to 22 carbon atoms, the prediction performance for the adsorption energy yields a MAE of 0.03 eV/(non-H atom). While the error for out-of-distribution molecules is higher, it is still within the acceptable limit for adsorption energies (0.05 eV/atom), confirming the viability of the approach. The proposed framework represents a potential tool for the fast screening of catalytic materials, as well as their inverse design, enabling the multi-scale modeling for systems that cannot be easily simulated by DFT.", "date": "2022-10-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Frontal polymerization has emerged as an attractive, scalable alternative due to its exploitation of the heat of polymerization, which generally is wasted as unutilized heat-loss. The only external energy needed for frontal polymerization is an initial thermal (or photo) stimulus that locally ignites the reaction. The subsequent reaction exothermicity provides local heating; the transport of this thermal energy to neighboring monomers in either a liquid or gel-like state results in a self-perpetuating reaction zone that provides fully-cured polymeric thermosets and thermoplastics. Propagation of this polymerization front continues through the unreacted monomer media until either all reactants are consumed or sufficient heat-loss stalls further reaction. Several different polymerization mechanisms support frontal processes, including free-radical, cat- or anionic, amine-cure epoxides, and ring-opening metathesis polymerization. The choice of monomer, initiator/catalyst, and additives dictates how fast the polymer front traverses the reactant medium, as well as the maximum temperature achievable. Frontal polymerization enables the preparation of moldable thermoplastics derived from linear polymers. When crosslinking is involved, polymeric networks (e.g., rigid thermosets) are obtainable through a related process best described as a frontal curing reaction. Numerous applications of frontally-generated polymers and thermosets exist, ranging from the reinforcement of porous substrates to the design of patterned composite materials. In this review, we examine in detail the physical and chemical phenomena that govern frontal polymerization, as well as outline the existing applications.", "date": "2022-10-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers); Polymerization catalysts; Polymerization kinetics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Since then, the number of compounds has grown exponentially during the 20th and 21st centuries, and new types of compounds have been obtained that were unknown to pioneers, rising the question about the validity and generality of the PT. Can these patterns be extracted from current data or are they constrained to a particular chemical domain? To answer this question we conducted a Big Data exploration of chemical similarity using formulae of compounds reported since around 1800. We found that the similarities between elements of the same family are resilient to attacks and are ubiquitous along chemical contexts. We also found that PT groups approach true equivalence classes, being the most symmetrical and transitive on our data. These features point to\nan underlying structure in the PT ruling the similarity between elements, which agrees with its fundamental nature.

Therefore, a follow-up on a series of pseudo-irreversible covalent carbamate human butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors and the structure\u2013activity relationships of the N-dialkyl O-arylcarbamate warhead are presented in this study. The covalent mechanism of binding was tested by IC50 time-dependency profiles, and sequentially and increasingly confirmed by kinetic analysis, whole protein LC-MS, and crystallographic analysis. Computational studies provided valuable insights into steric constraints and identified problematic, bulky carbamate warheads that cannot reach and carbamoylate the catalytic Ser198. Quantum mechanical calculations provided further evidence that steric effects appear to be a key factor in determining the covalent binding behaviour of these carbamate cholinesterase inhibitors and their duration of action. Additionally, the introduction of a clickable terminal alkyne moiety into one of the carbamate N-substituents and in situ derivatisation with azide-containing fluorophore enabled fluorescent labelling of plasma human butyrylcholinesterase.

A detailed kinetic and mechanistic inves-tigation of this system was conducted using stopped-flow and traditional time-dependent UV-vis spectroscopy, supported by NMR and DFT studies. Consistently large KIE values (~14) in line with previous reports were obtained over a large range of reactant concentrations (0.1 \u2013 1.6 mM (cod)PtMe2 and 3.2 mM to 6.0 M acid). At lower concentrations of acid, the KIE decreased significantly (KIE = ~6 for 0.1 mM (cod)PtMe2 and 0.2 mM acid). This concentration-dependent KIE suggests a multi-step reaction mechanism, eliminating the need to invoke proton tunneling. The reaction exhibits first-order dependence on (cod)PtMe2 and approximately second-order dependence on acid, with at least 2 equivalents of acid required for complete conversion. Overall, the kinetic data indicate a multi-molecular, multi-step reaction mechanism for the protonolysis of (cod)PtMe2, thus ruling out the previously accepted bimolecular single-step mechanism. A mechanistic alternative consistent with the kinetic data is proposed, in which sequential oxidative addition and reductive elimination occur, and the second equivalent of acid serves to stabilize trifluoroacetate anion in solution.

Catalytic groups are localized via a tethered ligand either to DNA or to tubulin, and red-light (660 nm) photocatalysis is used to initiate a cascade of DHTz-oxidation, intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction, and elimination to release phenolic compounds. Silarhodamine (SiR) dyes, more conventionally used as biological fluorophores, serve as photocatalysts that have high cytocompatibility and produce minimal singlet oxygen. Commercially-available conjugates of Hoechst dye (SiR-H) and Taxol (SiR-T) are used to localize SiR to the nucleus and tubulin, respectively. Computation was used to assist the design of a new class of redox-activated photocage to release either phenol or n-CA4, a microtubule-destabilizing agent. In model studies, uncaging is complete within 5 min using only 2 \u00b5M of SiR and 40 \u00b5M of the photocage. In situ spectroscopic studies support a mechanism involving rapid intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction and a rate determining elimination step. In cellular studies, this uncaging process is successful at low concentration of both the photocage (25 nM) and the SiR-H dye (500 nM).

Several enzymes, termed PET hydrolases (PETases), have been found to hydrolyze this polymer at different temperatures, with the enzyme from I. sakaiensis (IsPETase) having optimal catalytic activity at 40\u00baC. Crystal structures of IsPETase have revealed that the side chain of a conserved tryptophan residue within an active site loop (W185) shifts between 3 conformations to enable substrate binding and product release. This is facilitated by two residues unique to IsPETase, S214 and I218 (S/I). When these residues are inserted into other PETases in place of the otherwise strictly conserved His/Phe (H/F) residues found at their respective positions, they enhance activity and decrease Topt. Herein, we combine conventional molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics simulations to investigate dynamic changes of the S/I and H/F variants of IsPETase, as well as three other mesophilic and thermophilic PETases, at their respective temperature and pH optima. Our simulations show that the S/I insertion both increases the flexibility of active site loop regions harboring key catalytic residues and the conserved Trp, as well as expanding the conformational plasticity of this Trp side chain, allowing the conformational transitions that allow for substrate binding and product release in IsPETase. The observed catalytic enhancement caused by this substitution in other PETases appears to be due to conformational selection, by capturing the conformational ensemble observed in IsPETase.

Due to the inherent difficulty to determine the atomistic structure of amorphous glasses, the intrinsic structural porosity of MOF glasses is only poorly understood. In this work, the porosity features of a series of prototypical MOF glass formers from the family of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and their corresponding glasses is investigated comprehensively. CO2 gas sorption at 195 K allows to follow the evolution of microporosity when transforming from the crystalline to the glassy state of these materials. Based on these data, the pore volume and the apparent density of the ZIF glasses (i.e. the density including the intrinsic microporosity of the glasses) are quantified for the first time. Additional hydrocarbon sorption data (n-butane, propane and propylene) at variable temperatures together with X-ray total scattering experiments prove that the porosity features (in particular the pore size and the pore limiting diameter) of the ZIF glasses depend on the types of organic linkers present in the glass network. This allows formulating first design principles for a targeted tuning of the intrinsic microporosity of MOF glasses. Importantly, these principles are counterintuitive and contrary to established porosity design concepts for crystalline MOFs but show similarities to strategies previously developed for porous polymers.

Recently, these proteins have revealed themselves as attractive drug targets for mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Wolfram syndrome 2, and cancers. Unfortunately, the lack of information and mechanistic understanding on ligands binding to the whole functional, cytoplasmatic domain has limited rational drug design approaches. Here we use an enhanced sampling technique, volume-based metadynamics, recently developed by a team involving some of us, to predict the poses and affinity of 2-benzamido-4-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)-thiophene-3-carboxylate ligand to the entire surface of the cytoplasmatic domain of the human NEET protein mitoNEET (mNT) in an aqueous solution. The calculations, based on the recently published X-ray structure of the complex, are consistent with the measured affinity. The calculated free energy landscape revealed that the ligand can bind in multiple sites and with poses other than the one found in the X-ray. This difference is likely to be caused by crystal packing effects that allow the ligand to interact with multiple adjacent NEET protein copies. Such extra-contacts are of course absent in solution, therefore the X-ray pose is only transient in our calculations, where the binding free energy correlate with the number of contacts. We further evaluated how the reduction and protonation of the Fe-bound histidine, as well as temperature, can affect ligand binding. Both such modifications introduce the possibility for the ligand to bind in area of the protein other than the one observed in the X-ray, with no or little impact on affinity.

Herein, we showcase the effects of pore size and porosity on resistive sensing behaviour in the 0.5-85% relative humidity (RH) range.  We employed evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) in combination with sol-gel chemistry to fabricate well-defined mesoporous silica thin films with high degree of structural control. Material architectures with pore sizes of 3 to 15 nm and porosities of 40 to 70% were rationally designed by using structure directing agents (SDAs) with increasing molecular weight and tuning the silica to SDA ratio. We found that a combination of pore size of 15 nm and 70% porosity showcases a particularly high sensitivity (~104 times change in resistance) in the measured range, with quick response and recovery times of 3 and 9 seconds, respectively. Across the various sensors, we identified a clear correlation between the pore size and the linear RH sensing range. Sensors with larger mesopores (~15 nm) exhibited higher sensitivity and linear response in the 65 to 85% RH range than sensors with smaller pores (<8 nm). Additionally, increasing the porosity while retaining the pore size, yields better overall sensitivity across the range.

Despite diterpene ubiquity in plant systems, it remains unknown how plants control diterpene localization and transport. For many other small molecules, plant cells maintain transport proteins that control compound compartmentalization. However, for most diterpene compounds, specific transport proteins have not been identified, and so it has been hypothesized that diterpene may cross biological membranes passively. Through molecular simulation, we study membrane transport for three complex diterpenes from among the many made by members of the Lamiaceae family to determine their permeability coefficient across plasma membrane models. To facilitate accurate simulation, the intermolecular interactions for leubethanol, abietic acid, and sclareol were parameterized through the standard CHARMM methodology for incorporation into molecular simulations. To evaluate the effect of membrane composition on permeability, we simulate the three diterpenes in two membrane models derived from sorghum and yeast lipidomics data. We track permeation events within our unbiased simulations, and compare implied permeation coefficients with those calculated from Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling calculations using the inhomogeneous solubility diffusion model. The diterpenes are observed to permeate freely through these membranes, indicating that a transport protein may not be needed to export these small molecules from plant cells.

Small guest molecules in the presence of micelles undergo constant exchange between a micellar aggregate and the surrounding solution, posing a considerable challenge for their molecular level characterisation. In this work we reveal the interaction maps between small guest molecules and surfactants forming micelles via novel applications of NMR techniques supported with state-of-the-art analytical methods used in colloidal science. Model micelles composed of structurally distinct surfactants (block non-ionic polymer Pluronic\u00ae F-127, non-ionic surfactant Tween 20 or Tween 80 and ionic surfactant SLS, sodium lauryl sulphate) were selected and loaded with model small molecules of biochemical relevance (i.e. the drugs fluconazole, FLU or indomethacin, IMC) known to have different partition coefficients. Molecular level organization of FLU or IMC within hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of micellar aggregates was established using combination of NMR methods (1D 1H NMR, 1D 19F NMR, 2D 1H-1H NOESY and 2D 1H-19F HOESY, and the multifrequency-STD NMR) and corroborated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This is the first application of multifrequency-STD NMR to colloidal systems, enabling us to elucidate intricately detailed patterns of drug/micelle interactions in a single NMR experiment within minutes. Importantly, our results indicate that flexible surfactants, such as block copolymers and polysorbates, form micellar aggregates with a surface composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and do not follow the classical core-shell model of the micelle.

Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements provide full spectral information and reveal that the observed hypsochromic shift arises due to a higher concentration of linker substitution defects at higher modulator concentrations, leading to broader excitation transfer-induced spectral diffusion.

However, the physico-chemical parameters governing the oxygen-atom transfer to the alkene and the impact of the electrolyte structure on the epoxidation reaction are yet to be understood. Here, we study the electrocatalytic epoxidation of cyclooctene at the surface of gold in hybrid organic/aqueous mixtures using acetonitrile (ACN) solvent. Gold was selected, as in ACN/water electrolytes gold oxide is formed by reactivity with water at potentials less anodic than the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This unique property allows us to demonstrate that a sacrificial mechanism is responsible for cyclooctene epoxidation at metallic gold surfaces, proceeding through cyclooctene activation, while epoxidation at gold oxide shares similar reaction intermediates with the OER and proceeds via the activation of water. More importantly, we show that the hydrophilicity of the electrode/electrolyte interface can be tuned by changing the nature of the supporting salt cation, hence affecting the reaction selectivity. At low overpotential, hydrophilic interfaces formed by using strong Lewis acid cations are found to favor gold passivation. Instead, hydrophobic interfaces created by the use of large organic cations favor the oxidation of cyclooctene and the formation of epoxide. Our study directly demonstrates how tuning the hydrophilicity of electrochemical interfaces can improve both the yield and selectivity of anodic reactions at the surface of heterogeneous catalysts.", "date": "2022-10-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Therefore, development of highly efficient and practical chiral ligands and catalysts is an eternal theme in chemical field. In the past decades, various axially chiral biaryldiol ligands and catalysts have been developed, in which the typical axially chiral cores should be [1,1'-naphenyl]-2,2'-diol (BINOL) and 1,1'-spirobiindane-7,7'-diol (SPINOL). It is known to all that the catalytic reactivity and enantioselectivity are generally substrate-dependent, and the slight variations in steric, electronic and geometric properties of chiral ligands or catalysts can cause dramatic changes in reactivity of substrates and enantioselectivity of products, so no omnipotent ligand or catalyst has been found thus far. Here we report the design, synthesis and evaluation in enantioselective catalysis of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral biphenyl ligands and catalysts, in which six model reactions including asymmetric additions of diethylzinc or alkynes to aldehydes in the presence of axially chiral [1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-diol ligands, Pd-catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions in the presence of phosphoramidite ligands, and chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of 1,1'-spirobiindane-7,7'-diol (SPINOL) derivative and [4+3] cyclization were attempted. The results showed that variation of 2,2'-substituent groups could provide different types of ligands and catalysts, and adjustment of substituent groups at the 3, 3', 5, 5', 6, 6'-positions could make ligands and catalysts more efficient in the asymmetric catalytic synthesis.

We tracked the reactivity of such bonds associated with the rise of the resistance to penicillin G (PenG) in protein evolution from penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to TEM beta-lactamases, and with the development of avibactam (Avb) to overcome the resistance. We found that the ester linkage in PBP\u2013PenG is resistant to hydrolysis mainly due to the small electric fields present in the protein active site. Conversely, the same linkage in the descendant TEM\u2013PenG experiences large electric fields which stabilize the more charge-separated transition state and thus lower the free energy barrier to hydrolysis. Specifically, the electric fields were improved from -59 to -140 MV/cm in an ancient evolution dating back billions of years, contributing 5 orders of magnitude rate acceleration. This trend continues today in the nullification of newly developed antibiotic drugs. The fast linkage hydrolysis acquired from evolution is counteracted by the upgrade of PenG to Avb whose linkage escapes from the hydrolysis by returning to a low-field environment.

This is applied to temporary anions of ethene and chlorinated ethene compounds, which are known to undergo dissociative electron attachment (DEA). It appears that the method is able to detect multiple valence resonance states in the same molecule, namely a \u03a0 and a \u03a3 state. The accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing the obtained electron affinities with experimental affinities reported in literature. The obtained nuclear and atom-condensed electronic Fukui functions are interpreted as nuclear forces and electron distributions respectively, and show clear differences between the \u03a0 and \u03a3 states.

Accurate segmentation of micropores and surface contamination, together with robustness against background inhomogeneity, guaranteed the quantification validity in complex experimental images.

However, the synthesis of Bd is rather hard and of low yield, which greatly limits the wide applications of RTUOP. Therefore, exploring readily obtained alternatives of Bd is of great significance and demands to be addressed though it is full of challenges. Herein, we report a new unit named 5H-benzo[b]carbazole (BCz) which can function similarly with 1H-benzo[f]indole (Bd) in RTUOP. BCz can be obtained facilely via two steps of reactions while the synthesis of Bd requires seven steps of tedious reactions. Excitingly, readily obtained BCz is an excellent alternative of Bd in RTUOP and shows some advantages in comparison with Bd. Firstly, BCz and its derivatives exhibit distinctive red-shifted red ultralong phosphorescence at 77 K while Bd does not. Secondly, BCz demonstrates remarkable photo-activated yellow ultralong phosphorescence at room temperature while the phosphorescence of Bd is difficult to be activated at room temperature. Thirdly, BCz derivatives (CNPyBCz and CNBrBCz) display similar photo-activated yellow ultralong phosphorescence with Bd derivatives at room temperature but the phosphorescent lifetimes are longer. Fourthly, it is shown that BCz and its derivatives emit yellow RTUOP in the powder matrixes besides their carbazole counterparts. It is revealed that BCz and Bd share the same cation radical-involved phosphorescence mechanism featuring charge separation and charge recombination and the redshift of phosphorescence in the aggregated state arises from the enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions among BCz units. To our best knowledge, this study paves a simple way for the future applications of RTUOP.

The ratio of heavy-to-light isotopes in a compound can constrains its formation history: a reaction\u2019s substrates, mechanisms, and physiochemical conditions impact isotope ratios. Studies of the stable isotope compositions of meteoritic organic compounds have focused on sample- and molecular-average isotope measurements and have interpreted those data via qualitative or semi-quantitative models. Here we create quantitative models (i.e., explicitly fit to measurements) for hydrogen and carbon isotope compositions of organic compounds in primitive carbonaceous meteorites and use these models to reach broader conclusions regarding the environments, substrates, and chemical processes that contributed to pre- and early-solar-system organic synthesis. \n\nThe hydrogen model fits measured molecular-average deuterium concentrations in a compound class (e.g., amines, carboxylic acids) as linear combinations of hydrogens with similar chemical environments. In the chondrites studied, methyl hydrogens are amongst the most deuterium-enriched moiety and hydrogens attached to \u03b1-carbons are the least. Deuterium enrichment is inversely related to both a compound class\u2019s water solubility and a meteorite sample\u2019s degree of aqueous alteration and terrestrial weathering. These values suggest that ISM-sourced compounds reacted to form deuterium-enriched molecules on meteorites\u2019 parent bodies and the enrichments were attenuated through exchange with water during aqueous alteration on the parent body and subsequent terrestrial processing. \n\nThe carbon model fits the \u03b413CVPDB of products from various reaction mechanisms by applying isotope effects to reactant \u03b413C measurements.

Amazingly, the color of ultralong phosphorescence can be tuned in different states or by varying the host matrixes. At 77 K, all the four molecules show green afterglow in the monomer state but yellow afterglow in the aggregated state because strong intermolecular interactions exist in the self-aggregate and induce a redshift of the afterglow. In particular, PNNA-1 and PNNA-2 demonstrate distinctive photo-activated green UORTP in the PMMA film owing to the generation of their cation radicals.

In the matrix PNCz, the cation radicals of PNNA-1 and PNNA-2 can stay stably and form strong intermolecular interactions with PNCz because of their high molecular structure similarity, leading to a redshift of ultralong phosphorescence.

However, in two-chamber designs, cathodic oxygen reduction is slow and limits MFC voltage. Biocathodes, cathodes containing microorganisms, show great promise for improving MFC performance. This study investigated how the microalgae Nannochloropsis affects cathodic oxygen reduction via a thermodynamic analysis of energy losses. Voltage, cathode pH, and cathode pO2 (partial pressure of oxygen) were measured in experimental MFCs containing Nannochloropsis biocathodes and compared to controls containing distilled water or abiotic algae media catahodes. Isolated Nanochloropsis cultures were also assayed. Under open circuit conditions, cathodic energy losses in experimental MFCs were 15% (p = 0.038597) and 19% (p = 0.042435) lower than distilled water and algae media controls, respectively. Experimental MFCs produced 73% higher power at 37% higher current density than distilled water MFCs. While the pH and pO2 of isolated Nannochloropsis cultures increased linearly each day, these measurements were constant in experimental MFC cathodes. This result suggests that participation in oxygen reduction reactions induces a change in Nannochloropsis metabolism, leading to reduced oxygen production and limiting pH changes. Taken together, this work presents a promising new type of two-chambered MFC with lower energy losses and greater power production that can also maintain a constant cathode pH and reveals a new behavior of Nannochloropsis algae in response to oxygen reduction reactions in such MFCs.", "date": "2022-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Food intolerance is difficult to diagnose as it requires a long-term process of eliminating foods that are responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells are key intestinal epithelium cells that respond to luminal chemical stimulants by releasing 5-HT. Changes in 5-HT levels have been shown to directly alter the motility of the intestinal tract. Therefore, a rapid approach for monitoring the impact of chemicals in food components on 5-HT levels can provide a personalised insight into food intolerance and help stratify diets. Within this study we developed a 3D printed electrochemical multiwell plate to determine changes in 5-HT levels from intestinal organoids that were exposed to varying chemical components found in food. The carbon black/poly-lactic acid (CB/PLA) electrodes had a linear range in physiological concentrations of 5-HT (0.1 \u2013 2\u00b5M) with a limit of detection of 0.07 \u00b5M. The electrodes were stable for monitoring 5-HT overflow from intestinal organoids. Using the electrochemical multiwell plate containing intestinal organoids, increases in 5-HT were observed in the presence of 0.1 mM cinnamaldehyde and 10 mM quercetin but reduction in 5-HT levels was observed in 1 mM sorbitol when compared to control. These changes in the presence of chemicals commonly found in food were verified with ex vivo ileum tissue measurements using chromatography and amperometry with boron-doped diamond electrodes. Overall, our 3D electrochemical multiwell plate measurements with intestinal organoids highlight an approach that can be a high-throughput platform technology for rapid screening of food intolerance to provide personalised nutritional diet.", "date": "2022-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Electrochemical Analysis; High-throughput Screening", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

GAL21 has been fitted against DFT adsorption energies for Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Co on 500 configurations and validated on about 3000 configurations for each metal, constructed on five surfaces with GCNs varying from 2.5 to 11.25.

Using GAL21, as implemented in the open-source code CP2K, we then evaluate the solvation energy of Au55 and Pt55 NPs in water using thermodynamic integration. The solvation free energy is found to be larger for Pt and Au, and systematically larger than 200 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121, demonstrating the large impact of solvent on the surface energetics of NPs.

The method involves a transformation of a precursor metal phosphate phase, M-struvite (NH4MPO4\u00b76H2O, M = Mg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Nix2+Co1-x2+), and it relies on the thermal decomposition of crystalline M-struvite precursors to an amorphous and simultaneously mesoporous phase, which forms while degassing of NH3 and H2O from crystals. The temporal evolution of mesoporous frameworks and the response of the metal coordination environment were followed with in-situ and ex-situ scattering and diffraction, as well as X -ray spectroscopy. Despite sharing the same precursor struvite structure, different amorphous and mesoporous structures were obtained. We highlight the systematic differences in absolute surface area, pore shape, pore size, and phase transitions depending on a metal cation present in the analogous M-struvites. The amorphous structures of thermally decomposed Mg-, Ni- and NixCo1-x-struvites exhibit high surface areas and pore volumes (240 m\u00b2g-1 and 0.32 cm-3 g-1 for Mg and 90 m\u00b2g-1 and 0.13 cm-3 g-1 for Ni).

A failed initial route involving derivatization of pipecolic acid prompted us to examine the biosynthetic pathway for the production of 4-hydroxylysine, which culminated in the development of a 9-step synthesis of cepafungin I. An alkyne-tagged analog enabled chemoproteomic studies of cepafungin and comparison of its effects on global protein expression in human multiple myeloma cells to the clinical drug bortezomib. A preliminary series of analogs elucidated critical determinants of potency in proteasome inhibition. Herein we report the chemoenzymatic syntheses of 13 additional analogs of cepafungin I guided by a proteasome-bound crystal structure, 5 of which are more potent than the natural product. Enzymatic strategies enabled the facile synthesis of oxidized amino acids in the macrocycle warhead as well as the tail fragment. Additional analogs were prepared by chemical methods to further explore the SAR at other regions of the scaffold. These studies reveal the criticality of the macrocyclic L-lysine oxidation regio-/stereochemistry introduced in the natural product biosynthesis relative to other possible lysine oxidation patterns found in nature.

We compare the activity of the (001) facet of LaCr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2O3-\u03b4 with the parent compounds (single B-site in the ABO3 perovskite). While the single B-site perovskites roughly follow the expected volcano-type activity trends, the HEO clearly outperforms all of its parent compounds with 2.8 to 100 times higher currents at fixed overpotential. As all samples were grown as an epitaxial layer, our results indicate an intrinsic composition\u2013function relationships, avoiding the effects of complex geometries or unknown surface composition. In-depth X-ray photoemission studies reveal a synergistic effect of simultaneous oxidation and reduction of different transition metal cations during adsorption of reaction intermediates.

Various nano-delivery systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles, have been explored to address the pharmacokinetic limitations associated with the use of these complexes. However, these systems often suffer from poor stability or involve complex synthetic procedures. To circumvent these problems, we report here a simple, one-pot procedure for the preparation of covalently-attached Ru-polylactide nanoparticles. This methodology relies on the ring-opening polymerization of lactide initiated by a calcium alkoxide derivative formed from calcium bis(trimethylsilyl amide) and a hydroxyl-bearing ruthenium complex. This procedure proceeds with high efficiency (near-quantitative incorporation of Ru in the polymer) and enables the preparation of polymers with varying molecular weights (2000-11000 Da) and high drug loadings (up to 68% w/w). These polymers were formulated as narrowly dispersed nanoparticles (110 nm) that exhibited a slow and predictable release of the ruthenium payload. Unlike standard encapsulation methods routinely used, the release kinetics of these nanoparticles is controlled (no \u2018burst released\u2019 was observed) and may be adjusted on demand, by tuning the size of the polymer chain. In terms of cytotoxicity, the nanoparticles were assessed in the ovarian cancer cell line A2780 and displayed potency comparable to cisplatin and the free drug, in the low micromolar range. Interestingly, the activity was maintained when tested in a cisplatin-resistant cell line, suggesting a possible orthogonal mechanism of action. Additionally, the internalization in tumour cells was found to be significantly higher than the free ruthenium complex (> 200 times in some cases), clearly showcasing the added benefit in the drug\u2019s cellular permeation and accumulation of the drug. Finally, the in vivo performance was evaluated for the first time in mice. The experiments showed that the intravenously injected nanoparticles were well tolerated and were able to significantly improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the parent drug. Not only was the nanosystem able to promote an 18-fold increase in tumour accumulation, but it also allowed a considerable reduction of drug accumulation in vital organs, achieving, for example, reduction levels of 90% and 97% in the brain and lungs respectively. In summary, this simple and efficient one-pot procedure enables the generation of stable and predictable nanoparticles capable of improving the cellular penetration and systemic accumulation of the Ru drug in the tumour. Altogether, these results showcase the potential of covalently-loaded ruthenium polylactide nanoparticles and pave the way for its exploitation and application as a viable tool in the treatment of ovarian cancer.", "date": "2022-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers); Bioinorganic Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In particular, we developed a signal induced switch between cucurbituril[8] binary and ternary complexes with cationic bipyridine derivatives, where the charge on the bipyridine can be changed through an allylic substitution reaction with the nucleophilic signal. The kinetics of this reaction and the coupled aggregation process can be tuned using a range of biologically relevant nucleophilic signals.

In this work, we use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid-liquid and subsequent liquid-to-solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes at the molecular level. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy, we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid-like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by a structure calculation based on NMR distance restraints. Our results show that the fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side-chain \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state.

This methodology contains multivariate statistical analyses such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), which are commonly used for the interpretation of complex geospatial datasets. A large amount of pesticide concentration data were collected along 1-year monitoring in 2016, for 50 sites located on the Adour Garonne basin (South-West France). For those sampling sites, concentrations of 37 selected pesticides were investigated during six periods of 14-days immersion of integrative samplers. Specifically, the sampling devices used were Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS), providing time-weighted average concentration estimates. For each studied site, the associated watershed and its land-use repartition were determined based on the Corine Land Cover 2012 and geographical information system (GIS) aggregation of data. The HCA clustered the 50 sites into five groups with similar main land uses. After that, the datasets of pesticide integrated concentration and land use repartition were analyzed in a PCA. The key variables (pesticide distribution and concentrations) responsible for sampling site discrimination showed consistent patterns of distribution with specific land uses. In order to confirm these observations, pesticide fingerprints (based on the waffle method) of sites with contrasted land use relative to the surface areas were compared. These fingerprints confirmed that there was different and specific patterns, visible at a glance, of pesticide occurrence in surface water, in relation with their initial use at the catchment level.

Alexandrova", "abstract": "Deactivation via coking due to a lack of selectivity is a persistent problem for the longevity of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Ge as a promoter improves the exper- imental selectivity and stability of subnano Pt clusters. The origin of this improvement is self-limiting coking, to form a Pt4GeC2 cluster which is more stable and selective than the bare Pt4Ge cluster. In this paper we compare the dehydrogenation abilities of Pt4 and Pt4C2 with and Pt4Ge and Pt4GeC2 with DFT calculations in order to explore the origin of self-limiting coking in the presence of Ge. The unique stability of Pt4GeC2 is attributed to electron donation from Ge to the C2 atoms. This prevents the coke from drawing electrons from the Pt, which is the origin of deactivation via coking. Thus, we identify an electronic mechanism for coke deactivation and then use an electronically driven doping strategy to improve catalyst longevity. This differs from the common perception of coke deactivating via steric blocking of active sites.Furthermore, Pt4C2 and Pt4GeC2 show differences in kinetic accessibility of different isomers, which brings us into a new paradigm of sub-ensembles of isomers, where the dominant active sites are determined by kinetic stability under reaction conditions, rather than Boltzmann populations.", "date": "2022-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Clusters", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Due to the environmental impact of these potentially hazardous chemicals, the demand for more efficient formulations is increasing. Promising formulations consist of easily adaptable carriers from which controllable stimuli release the agrochemicals. Here, we investigated poly(N vinylcaprolactam) (pVCL)-based microgels as a potential carrier for okanin, an inhibitor of the C4 plant key enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, by combining experiments, molecular simulations, and free energy computations. Dynamic light scattering, scanning transmission electron and atomic force microscopy revealed that pVCL microgels collapse and rigidify upon the loading of okanin. The simulations identified loosely adsorbed okanin and tightly bound okanin mediating inter-chain crosslinks. With increasing okanin concentration, stacking interactions of okanin occur with adsorbed and bound okanin. These findings can explain the experimentally observed collapse and the rigidification of the microgels. Based on the atomistic insights, two poly(N vinylcaprolactam co glycidyl methacrylate) microgels were synthesized, for which a doubled loading capacity of okanin was found. Finally, we investigated the triggered release of okanin using the addition of green solvents as a stimulus.

Finite-size cluster models of well-defined point-group symmetry and of general local-spin Slocal \u2265 1/2 are presented, including J1\u2013J2 triangular and tetrahedral clusters, which are often used to describe magnetic interactions in biological and bio-mimetic polynuclear transition metal clusters with unique catalytic activity, such as nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. We show that a unique block-diagonal structure of the underlying Hamiltonian matrix in the spin-adapted basis emerges when an optimal lattice site ordering is chosen that reflects the internal symmetries of the model investigated. The block-diagonal structure is bound to the commutation relations between cumulative spin operators and the Hamiltonian operator, that in turn depend on the geometry of the cluster investigated. The many-body basis transformation, in the form of the orbital/site reordering, exposes such commutation relations. These commutation relations represent a rigorous and formal demonstration of the block-diagonal structure in Hamiltonian matrices and the compression of the corresponding spin-adapted many-body wave functions. As a direct consequence of the block-diagonal structure of the Hamiltonian matrix it is possible to selectively optimize electronic excited states without the overhead of calculating the lower-energy states by simply relying on the initial ansatz for the targeted wave function. Additionally, more compact many-body wave functions are obtained. In extreme cases, electronic states are precisely described by a single configuration state function, despite the curse of dimensionality of the corresponding Hilbert space. These findings are crucial in the electronic structure theory framework, for they offer a conceptual route towards wave functions of reduced multi-reference character, that can be optimized more easily by approximated eigensolvers and are of more facile physical interpretation.

One of the most promising classes of photocatalytic materials for this conversion that excels by high selectivity, chemical stability and low cost is represented by polymeric carbon nitrides, and particularly by various types of poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), i.e., ionic variants of carbon nitride. A crucial challenge highlighted by recent studies is the problem of separation of formed H2O2 from the reaction medium and especially from the suspended photocatalyst particles since photocatalytically generated H2O2 can undergo light-driven decomposition, as well as disproportionation on the surface of the photocatalyst in the dark. Herein, we report an elegant solution to this problem by implementing a biphasic reaction system in which the hydrophobic photocatalyst oxidizes a lipophilic electron donor in the organic phase, while the produced H2O2 is instantaneously extracted into the aqueous layer. To this end, we have achieved an effective hydrophobization of ionic carbon nitride (PHI) nanoparticles in the form of a composite with alkylated silica. The hydrophobized composite effectively photocatalyzes the reduction of dioxygen to H2O2 with concurrent oxidation of a model fatty alcohol (1-octanol) in the organic phase under visible light irradiation (406 nm LED), and enables, at the same time, facile separation of the high-value H2O2/water mixture from the reaction medium at H2O2 concentrations (~0.12 M) that are unprecedentedly high for light-driven systems reported in the literature. Notably, fatty alcohols are readily available from vegetable waxes and as pulping sub-products, and the products of their partial oxidation represent a valuable feedstock for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products. This work thus showcases a rational design of a high-performance photocatalytic system for H2O2 production that enables easy separation of the product from electron donors and its recovery at high concentrations, and paves the way for sustainable and economically viable light-driven H2O2 production from easily available feedstock.", "date": "2022-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Thousands of emergent chemical compounds were detected via FT-ICR MS, ultimately leading to the emergence of two dominant outcomes. First, the presence of small amounts of food waste into green waste results in substantial decarboxylation and subsequent polymerization to biocrude then chars. Second, in the other limit, small amounts of green waste promote capping of oxygenates into the biodiesel range, such as with the emergence of fatty acid methyl esters.", "date": "2022-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These polymers often differ from their petroleum-based counterparts in topology, raw material composition and solution behaviour. Effective and efficient reformulation that maintains comparable performance to existing products requires a deep understanding of the differences in behaviour between polymers.\n\nIn this work, we simulate the tribological behaviour of three topologically distinct polymers in simplex  solutions in presence of surfactants and in contact with hair-biomimetic patterned surfaces: a strongly charged polyelectrolyte poly-(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (Merquat 100TM, Polyquaternium 6), a zwitterionic copolymer of acrylic acid, 3-trimethylammonium propyl methacrylamide chloride and acrylamide, (Merquat 2003TM, Polyquaternium 53) and one generic functionalized polysaccharide. Merquat 100TM is a relatively simple linear cationic homopolymer. Merquat 2003TM is a pseudorandom block copolymer with a hydrophilic linear block and a brush-like cationic block. The chosen polysaccharide is a highly branched, amphiphilic and quanternized polymer with a cellulose-like backbone. Such topological differences are expected to affect rheological properties, as well as their direct interaction with structured biological substrates. \n\nUsing a refined Martini-style coarse-grained model we describe the polymer-dependent differences in aggregation behaviour as well as selective interactions with the surface depending on the structure. Finally, we introduce a formalism to characterize the response of the solution to shear as an initial study on lubrication properties, that define the sensorial performace of these systems in cosmetics (i.e. , manageability, touch, etc.).  \n\nThe tools and techniques presented in this work illustrate the strength of molecular simulation in eco-design of formulation as a complement to experiment. These efforts help advance our understanding of how we can relate complex atomic-scale solution behaviour to relevant macroscopic properties. We expect these techniques to play an increasingly important role in advancing strategies for green polymer formulation design by providing an understanding for how new polymers could reach and even exceed the level of performance of existing polymers. \n", "date": "2022-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Aggregates and Assemblies; Surfactants; Biopolymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

But adsorption capacity shown by these adsorbents is low and is time-consuming. Herein, we have synthesized for the first time a new powdered adsorbent ZnOS+C, modified Zinc peroxide with sulfur and activated carbon to effectively remove FG dye from wastewater. Results of batch adsorption experiments have suggested that ZnOS+C has the maximum adsorption capacity of 238.28 mg/g for FG dye within 120 minutes of adsorption equilibrium for a wide range of pH ranging from 2-10 pH. The adsorption process follows the Freundlich isotherm model, suggesting a multilayered adsorption process that occurs on the surface of ZnOS+C. The adsorption kinetics study indicates that the kinetics of the reaction is the intraparticle diffusion model.

A key hurdle to the design of improved carbon capture materials is the lack of adequate tools to characterise how CO2 adsorbs. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is emerging as a promising probe of CO2 capture, but it remains challenging to distinguish different adsorption products. Here we perform a comprehensive computational investigation of 22 amine-functionalised metal-organic frameworks and discover that 17O NMR is a powerful probe of CO2 capture chemistry that provides excellent differentiation of ammonium carbamate and carbamic acid species. The computational findings are supported by 17O NMR experiments on a series of CO2-loaded frameworks that clearly identify ammonium carbamate chain formation and provide new evidence for a mixed carbamic acid \u2013 ammonium carbamate adsorption mode. The fine sensitivity of 17O NMR to local chemistry also shows that hydrogen bonding schemes proposed in previous ammonium carbamate chain structures may be inaccurate and new structures are proposed. We further discover a new mixed CO2 adsorption mechanism and show that carbamic acid formation is more prevalent in this materials class than previously believed.

The luminescence quantum yield (\u03a6lum), excited state lifetime (\u03c4), radiative (kr \u2261 A) and non-radiative (knr) rate constant and oscillator strength (f) was determined for Tb(CF3SO3)3 in H2O/D2O mixtures in order to map the radiative and non-radiative transition probabilities.

Further, the Horrocks method of determining inner-sphere solvent molecules has been revisited, and it was concluded that the coordination number of Tb3+ in aqueous solution is 9.

The framework is applied to a case study in the upper Midwest region of the US.

Here we report the synthesis of Ni\u2013Mo catalyst composites supported on oxidized Vulcan carbon (Ni\u2013Mo/oC) and demonstrate their performance for reversible hydrogen evolution and oxidation. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, we observed mass-specific activities exceeding 80 mA/mg at 100 mV overpotential, and additional measurements using hydroxide exchange membrane electrode assemblies yielded full cell voltages that were only ~100 mV larger for Ni\u2013Mo/oC cathodes compared to Pt\u2013Ru/C at current densities exceeding 1 A/cm2. For hydrogen oxidation, Ni\u2013Mo/oC films required <50 mV overpotential to achieve half the maximum anodic current density, but activity was limited by internal mass transfer and oxidative instability. Nonetheless, estimates of the mass-specific exchange current for Ni\u2013Mo/oC from micropolarization measurements showed its hydrogen evolution/oxidation activity is within 1 order of magnitude of commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations helped shed light on the high activity of Ni\u2013Mo composites, where the addition of Mo leads to surface sites with weaker H-binding energies than pure Ni.

The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM), although initially introduced as an implicit solvent model, was reported to improve SCF convergence in some large molecules. However, the underlying mechanisms and applicable use cases were unclear. We investigated the impacts of CPCM on the SCF convergence of 25 peptides and found that the CPCM only effectively reduced the SCF iterations for molecules with charge separations (e.g., the zwitterionic form of peptides) but had little effect on non-charge-separated molecules. We observed that CPCM increased the HOMO-LUMO gap of both the zwitterionic and non-charge-separated molecules, but only the charge-separated molecules suffered from the vanishing HOMO-LUMO gap problem in the gas phase which is the origin of the convergence issue. We revealed CPCM\u2019s gap-opening mechanism as the selective stabilization/destabilization of molecular orbitals (MO) based on their local electrostatic environment. Compared to level-shifting, a traditional SCF improvement technique, CPCM has superior performance because the stabilization/destabilization of MOs is consistent through SCF iterations. Finally, we examined CPCM\u2019s impacts on DFT density delocalization error (DDE) when used as an SCF accelerator. CPCM can mitigate the DDE and reproduce the density-derived properties (e.g., dipole moments) matching high-level methods when a very low dielectric constant is used but tends to over-localize the electron density at higher dielectric constants.", "date": "2022-10-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In\ncomparison with some methods in wave function theory in which one seeks to expand the ever increasing size of an active space to approximate the wave functions,\nit is possible to have an upper bound in MSDFT because the auxiliary states in a\nMAS are used to represent the exact N-dimensional matrix density D(r). In analogy\nto Kohn-Sham DFT, we partition the total Hamiltonian matrix functional H[D] into\nan orbital-dependent part, including multistate kinetic energy and Coulomb-exchange energy plus an external potential energy, and a correlation matrix density functional Ec[D]. The latter accounts for the part of correlation\nenergy not explicitly included in the minimal active space. However, a major difference from Kohn-Sham DFT is that state interactions are necessary to represent the\nN-matrix density D(r) in MSDFT, rather than a non-interacting reference state for the\nscalar ground-state density. Two computational approaches are highlighted. We\nfirst derive a set of non-orthogonal multistate self-consistent-field (NOSCF) equations\nfor the variational optimization of H[D]. We introduce the multistate correlation po\u0002tential, as the functional derivative of Ec[D], which includes both correlation effects\nwithin the MAS and that from the correlation matrix functional.

The results of these modeling and simulations are used for bone grafting, making scaffolds, making dental implants, healing damaged bones, 3D modeling, stress analysis, As removal, nanoindentation, etc. Some software like GROMACS, MEGACELL, and ANOVA is used for this purpose.  Hydroxyapatite (HAp) was prepared from egg shells by various routes using hexane and acetic acid followed by heat treatment. Hap has a wide application in water treatment by removal of metal ions. XRD of the samples showed use of acetic acid followed by high temperature sintering leads to formation crystalline phases of HAp. Strong evidence of CaCO3 in calcite phase was obtained in other samples.", "date": "2022-10-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Ceramics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, due to the safety risks associated with high school students in university chemistry laboratory settings, high school students rarely engage in authentic hands-on chemical learning. To bridge the gap between the benefits and drawbacks, this study investigates a method to educate high school students (with no previous experience) about standard chemical laboratory practices. 98 high school students experimented throughout two days to determine the molecular weights and characteristics of various polystyrene samples, essential knowledge for polymer recycling. Students were split into 5 groups so that laboratory usage be organized and staggered. After laboratory safety training was administered, students created different types and concentrations of toluene-based samples and spin casted these samples onto silicon wafers, determining thickness through ellipsometry. With the data, each group calculated molecular weight, propagated error, and wrote laboratory reports. In order to evaluate the extent of learning through this process, students were given pre-training and post-experimentation assessments with the same questions pertaining to laboratory safety, equipment usage, and materials science related topics. On average, students displayed scores 63% higher on the post-experiment assessment compared to those of the pre-training assessment. The results suggest the experience not only taught students about the various materials science concepts, but also improved their laboratory logic.

Enantioselective recognition of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) was achieved by using B20 group PdGa crystals with different chiral lattices. Orbital textures of PdGa enantiomers (namely PdGa-A and PdGa-B) suggest large OAM polarization for the bands near the Fermi level and carrying opposite signs.

Above mentioned characterization methods proved that NHSG preparation provided highly homogeneous Zr dispersion in silica leading to almost doubled Lewis acid site numbers and higher activity in ethanol-to-butadiene (ETB) transformation, Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) redox reaction, and aldol condensation, in comparison to the catalyst prepared by dry impregnation. The fraction of micropore volume in micro-mesoporous samples (ranging from 27 % to 69 %) did not play a significant role: The activity in all three catalytic reactions followed the acid site numbers.

Such a detailed insight can be gained through cooling-rate computer simulations, i.e. simulations in which cooling is applied to a system at a constant rate. However, the ability of the simulations to give an accurate description of the phase transition process is an open question, since the cooling rates accessible in atomic-scale computer simulations are many orders of magnitude larger than those in experiments. In this paper we present the first computational study that systematically explores as to how the cooling rate affects the crystallization of organic phase-change materials such as paraffins. To this end, we performed a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in which the cooling rate was varied over four orders of magnitude. Our computational results clearly show that a certain threshold in the values of cooling rates exists. When cooling is performed with the rates smaller than the threshold, computer simulations are able to qualitatively reproduce the crystallization process in paraffins. This includes an abrupt change in the temperature dependence of the density, enthalpy, and thermal conductivity upon crystallization. The crystallization enthalpy for these cooling rates was found to agree quantitatively with experiment. However, beyond this threshold, when cooling is too fast, the paraffin\u2019s properties in simulations start to deviate considerably from experimental data: the faster the cooling, the larger part of the system is trapped in the super-cooled liquid state. As a result, one can observe a systematic decrease in the fraction of crystalline domains in a paraffin sample with cooling rate, leading eventually to a complete lack of crystallization at low temperatures. Both the crystallization temperature and the crystallinity decrease with cooling rate in line with experimental data. All the above strongly supports the conclusion that a proper choice of a cooling rate is of tremendous importance in computer simulations of organic phase-change materials such as paraffins. Cooling with the rates that are too high can lead to a completely inaccurate description of the crystallization process, as well as the thermophysical and structural properties.", "date": "2022-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thus, there is an urgent need to comprehend water management in these devices and to engineer electrodes that allow both stable and efficient electrocatalytic performance. Here, we investigated the possible causes of suppression in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity on Cu via in operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The in operando XRD allowed us to monitor water and bicarbonate formation in the GDE, while in-line gas and mass chromatographs allowed us to correlate those changes to the cathode and anode product distribution during CO2E. We found direct evidence for salt precipitation in the cathode GDEs, which causes water build-up and an increase in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We also observed that the increase in HER is related to a drop in total cell potential, caused by a shift in ion transport through the membrane from carbonates to more conductive hydroxide ions. Our results reported here also do not show any substantial catalyst-induced effects on CO2RR. Thus this work suggests proper ion management is an important key to enhanced durability throughout the device.", "date": "2022-10-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Energy; Catalysts; Electrocatalysis; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While heparan sulfate (HS) was shown to be a key co-receptor in the host-cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the effect of spike charge on its interactions with heparan sulfate has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we investigate the role of evolving spike positive charge in accelerating long-range interactions to heparan sulfate and ACE2 in the glycocalyx. We show that the positively charged Omicron evolved enhanced binding rates to the negatively charged glycocalyx. Moreover, we discovered that while the Omicron spike-ACE2 affinity is comparable to Delta, the Omicron spike interactions with heparan sulfate are significantly enhanced, giving rise to a ternary complex of spike-HS-ACE2 with a larger proportion of double-bound and triple-bound ACE2. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variants evolve to be more dependent on heparan sulfate in viral attachment and infection.

Consequently, it has been necessary to re-design experimental and theoretical methods in order to face the challenges introduced by the dynamic nature of IDRs. In this work, we present an accurate and cost-effective method to study the conformational dynamics of IDRs based on the use of residue-local probabilistic expressions that characterize the conformational ensembles obtained from finite-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is shown that the good performance and the high convergence rates achieved with our method are independent of the IDR lengths, since the method takes advantage of the major influence of the identity and conformation of the nearest residue neighbors on the amino-acid conformational preferences to evaluate the IDR conformational ensembles. This allows us to characterize the conformational space of IDRs using a reduced number of probabilities which can be obtained from comparatively short MD simulations or experimental databases.

Previously it was reported that when the T2-site is removed from the TNC, all O2 binding activity at the dinuclear T3-site is lost. Computational studies attribute this loss of activity to the flexibility of the protein active site, where the T3-copper centers move apart to minimize electrostatic repulsions. To address the question if and how a more constrained T3-site will catalyze the reduction of oxygen, we herein report a mechanistic investigation into the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the dinuclear copper complex [Cu2L(\u03bc-OH)]3+ (L=2,7-bis[bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aminomethyl]-1,8-naphthyridine). This T3-inspired complex confines the Cu centers in a rigid scaffold in close proximity instead of the flexible scaffold found in the protein active site and we demonstrate that under these constraints the dinuclear copper site displays ORR activity. Compared to the ORR mechanism of MCOs, we show that electrochemical reduction of [Cu2L(\u03bc-OH)]3+ follows a similar pathway as the reduction of the resting enzyme due to the presence of the Cu-OH-Cu motif. By identification of key intermediates along the catalytic cycle of [Cu2L(\u03bc-OH)]3+ we provide for the first time evidence that metal-metal cooperativity takes place during electrocatalysis of the ORR by a copper-based catalyst, which is achieved by the ability of the rigid ligand framework to bind two copper atoms in close proximity. Electrochemical studies show that the mechanisms of the ORR and hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) found for [Cu2L(\u03bc-OH)]3+ are different from the ones found for analogous mononuclear copper catalysts. In addition, the metal-metal cooperativity results in an improved selectivity for the four-electron ORR of more than 70%. This selectivity is achieved by better stabilization of reaction intermediates between both copper centers, which is also essential for the ORR mechanism observed in MCOs. Overall, the mechanism of the [Cu2L(\u03bc-OH)]3+-catalyzed ORR in this work gives insight into the ORR activity of a T3-site and contributes to understanding of how the ORR activity and selectivity are established in MCOs.", "date": "2022-10-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Electrocatalysis; Small Molecule Activation (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We demonstrate the efficiency of the PyrroTriPol family under a magnetic field of 9.4, 14.1  and 18.8 T with respect to TEMTriPol-I. In particular, the superiority of PyrroTriPol was demonstrated on \u03b3-Al2O3 nanoparticles which enabled the acquisition of a high signal-to-noise surface-selective 27Al multiple-quantum MAS experiment at 18.8 T and 40 kHz MAS frequency", "date": "2022-10-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To this effect, we have created a systematic workflow to determine coarse-grained simulation models for crosslinked PDMS in order to further elucidate the effects of network changes on the system's mechanical properties. Our approach leverages a fine-grained united atom model for linear PDMS, which we extend to include crosslinking terms, and applies iterative Boltzmann inversion to obtain a coarse-grain ``bead-spring-type'' model. We then perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations to explore the effect of crosslinking on the rheology of silicone fluids, where we compute systematic increases in both density and shear viscosity that compare favorably to experiments that we conduct here. The kinematic viscosity of partially crosslinked fluids follows an empirical linear relationship that is surprisingly consistent with Rouse theory, which was derived for systems comprised of a uniform distribution of linear chains.

The reasons for the missing peaks could be because the flexible regions might exhibit unfavorable dynamics that interfere with NMR experiments, which result in low NMR intensity below the noise floor. To circumvent this issue, we exploit a hyperpolarization technique known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which is usually performed at low temperatures for optimal performances. We have also compared 1H enhancements for amyloid fibrils doped with the SNAPol-1 and M-Tinypol radicals, and the 1H DNP spectrum demonstrates a much higher \u03b5~30 for the SNAPol-1 radical than \u03b5~10 for the TinyPol-doped sample. By combining the sensitivity gain bestowed by efficient DNP polarizing agent (SNAPol-1), the freezing of local motions at cryogenic temperature (~ 100 K), and high NMR resolution at high magnetic field (18.8 T), we have successfully recorded an unprecedented enhancement factor of ~50 on amyloid fibrils (NWD2) in magic-angle spinning (MAS) DNP experiments at a high magnetic field of 18.8 T. Moreover, multidimensional MAS NMR experiments have revealed NMR signals of flexible side chains that were previously inaccessible at conventional room-temperature experiments.

However, the performance of propellants based on boron-based HILs is still inferior to hydrazine derivatives, restricting their widespread applications as a rocket propellant. To boost the propellant performance of boron-based HILs, constantly engineering their chemical structures is highly necessary. The conventional approaches modify the anions and cations of the ionic liquids based on experiences and heuristics, and then experimentally verify the physicochemical properties of the synthesized compounds. However, such a trial-and-error design cycle is biased by practitioners\u2019 preferences and the variations of experimental conditions.

We compute this descriptor using coordination-based models trained with DFT calculations. Our approach enables instantaneous predictions of catalytic turnovers for nanostructures up to 12 nm in size. Using NO decomposition as probe reaction, we identify sites on Au-Pt nanoparticles that, because of local structure and composition, yield one-to-two orders of magnitude increase in rate compared to sites on monometallic Pt. By prescribing specific sizes, morphologies, and compositions of optimal catalytic nanoparticles, our method guides experiments towards designing bimetallic catalysts with optimal turnovers.

We identify the unique bonding regions in five KSI systems, including those exposed to applied oriented electric fields and those with amino acid mutations, and calculate the precise redistribution of electron density and other regional properties that accompanies either enhancement or inhibition of KSI catalytic activity. We find that catalytic enhancement results from promoting both inter- and intra-molecular electron density redistribution, between bond bundles and bond wedges within the KSI-docked substrate molecule, in the forward direction of the catalyzed reaction. Though the redistribution applies to both types of perturbed systems, and is thus suggestive of a general catalytic role, we observe that bond properties (e.g. volume vs. energy vs. electron count) can respond independently and disproportionately depending on the type of perturbation. We conclude that the resulting catalytic enhancement/inhibition proceeds via different mechanisms, where some bond properties are utilized more by one type of perturbation than the other. Additionally, we find that the correlations between bond wedge properties and catalyzed reaction barrier energies are additive to predict those of bond bundles and atomic basins, providing a rigorous grounding for connecting changes in local charge density to resulting shifts in reaction barrier energy.", "date": "2022-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

AQME has a modular structure of independent modules that can be implemented in any sequence, allowing the users to use only the desired parts of the program. The code is intended for researchers with basic familiarity with the Python programming language. The CSEARCH module interfaces to molecular mechanics and semi-empirical QM (SQM) conformer generation tools (e.g., RDKit and Conformer\u2013Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool, CREST) starting from various initial structure formats. The CMIN module enables geometry refinement with SQM and neural network potentials, such ANI-1. The QPREP module interfaces with multiple QM programs, such as Gaussian, ORCA, and PySCF. The QCORR module processes QM results, storing structural, energetic, and property data while also enabling automated error handling (i.e., convergence errors, wrong number of imaginary frequencies, isomerization, etc.) and job resubmission. The QDESCP module provides easy access to QM ensemble-averaged molecular descriptors and computed properties, such as NMR spectra. Overall, AQME provides automated, transparent, and reproducible workflows to produce, analyze and archive computational chemistry results.

The hydrogenation of vanillin as a lignin model has been a hot research topic in the catalytic community. Vanillin has the potential to be upgraded to value-added compounds by catalytic hydrogenation, and its valuable hydrogenation products are usually vanillinol (VA) and 4-methylguaiacol (MMP). The difficulty of this reaction lies in the selectivity control of the hydrogenation products. Complete conversion of both products cannot be achieved with either noble or non-precious metal catalysts in the same catalytic system. For the hydrogenation of vanillin, the usual catalysts can achieve complete conversion of one product or partial conversion of both products. In our work, we developed a novel bimetallic catalyst encapsulated in nitrogen-rich carbon to achieve, for the first time, the selective and regulated conversion of two products, i.e., 96.06% vanillin and 99.99% MMP, in the same system. The use of nitrogen-doped carbon (NDC) as a carrier for Ni nanoparticles allows the charge transfer from Ni to the carrier, i.e., NDC, resulting in the oxidation potential is corrected. Combined with the more favorable deoxidation activity of Co, our catalysts are inexpensive, simple to prepare, stable in performance, easy to separate, high in activity, and have the advantage of being tunable to the target product. Due to the synergistic effect of Ni and Co bimetals, the vanillin hydrogenation reaction can be almost completely stopped at the step of VA generation and the catalytic activity of the active center can be adjusted by controlling the temperature in a continuous flow to achieve the conversion of the other product MMP at 99.99%, which has never been reported before.

Combining experiments and simulations we investigate the lithium diffusion mechanism, different synthetic routes and the electrochemical stability window of LNCl. Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments show that fast Li motion (\u03c3RT > 0.1 mS cm-1) is present in LNCl which is however not accessible in macroscopic LNCl pellets.

Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping, and single molecule photoluminescence (PL) studies were used to identify four possible species resulting from the Ag+-CdSe cation exchange doping process. The heterogeneity of these samples shows the difficulty in controlling a post-synthesis cation exchange method to produce homogenous samples needed for use in any potential application. Additionally, the heterogeneity in the doped samples demonstrates that significant care must be taken in describing the ensemble or average characteristics of the sample.", "date": "2022-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To reach an accurate and rapid prediction of membrane permeation coefficients of drugs is a complex challenge, which can efficiently support drug discovery. Such predictions are indeed highly valuable as they may guide the selection of potential leads with optimum bioavailabilities prior to synthesis. Theoretical models exist to predict these coefficients. Many of them are based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which allow calculation of permeation coefficients through the evaluation of both the potential of mean force (PMF) and the diffusivity profiles. However, these simulations still require intensive computational efforts, and novel methodologies should be developed and benchmarked. Free energy perturbation (FEP) method was recently shown to estimate PMF with a significantly reduced computational cost compared to the adaptive biasing force method. This benchmarking was achieved with small molecules, namely short-chain alcohols. Here, we show that to estimate the PMF of bulkier, drug-like xenobiotics, conformational sampling is a critical issue. To reach a sufficient sampling with FEP calculations requires a relatively long time-scale, which can lower the benefits related to the computational gain. In the present work, the Accelerated Weight Histogram (AWH) method was employed for the first time in all-atom membrane models. The AWH-based protocol, named MemCross, appears affordable to estimate PMF profiles of a series of drug-like xenobiotics, compared to other enhanced sampling methods. The continuous exploration of the crossing pathway by MemCross also allows modelling subdiffusion by computing fractional diffusivity profiles.  The method is also versatile as its input parameters are largely insensitive to the molecule properties. It also ensures a detailed description of the molecule orientations along the permeation pathway, picturing all intermolecular interactions at an atomic resolution. Here, MemCross was applied on a series of 12 xenobiotics, including four weak acids, and a coherent structure-activity relationship was established.", "date": "2022-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using underpotential deposition of Pb as a surface probe, we find that across a range of different thiolates, SAMs tend to increase the proportion of (111)-facets on Au, but they simultaneously increase the defect density upon these and other facets. These changes lead to delayed onset but higher maximum activity toward formic acid oxidation, which is interpreted in terms of both the density of appropriate active site ensembles and changes to the binding isotherm for site-blocking hydroxyl species. The impacts of reconstruction are further illustrated through measured shifts in selectivity for electroreduction of crotonaldehyde, with reconstructed catalysts changing the favored product from butanal to crotyl alcohol. Thus, complex surface reorganization may play a significant role in catalytic behaviors of thiol-coated SAMs as well.", "date": "2022-10-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Interfaces; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The interplay between aggregation-prone and aggregation-resistant fragments within a single polypeptide chain is not well understood. Here, we examine fibrillization behavior of two designed chimeric peptides, ACC1-13E8 and ACC1-13E8(L/D), in which the highly amyloidogenic fragment of insulin\u2019s A-chain (ACC1-13) is extended by an octaglutamate segment composed of all-L (E8), or alternating L/D residues (E8(L/D)). As separate entities, ACC1-13 readily forms fibrils with the infrared features of parallel \u03b2-sheet structure while acidified E8 forms so-called \u03b22-aggregates consisting of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets and manifesting distinctly in the amide I band infrared region. This contrasts with profoundly aggregation-resistant behavior of E8(L/D) peptide although the alternating L/D motif has been hypothesized as compatible with aggregated \u03b1-sheets. ACC1-13E8 and ACC1-13E8(L/D) peptides are equally prone to fibrillization when the electrostatic repulsion between dissolved monomers is prevented either by lowering pH, or in the presence of Ca2+ ions. In the aggregated states, both ACC1-13E8 and ACC1-13E8(L/D) reveal the infrared characteristics of ordered parallel \u03b2-sheet structure with no spectral features attributable to \u03b22-aggregates (ACC1-13E8) or \u03b1-sheets (ACC1-13E8(L/D)). Hence, the preferred structural pattern of ACC1-13 segment not only overrides the tendency of E8 to form the antiparallel \u03b22-structure but also enforces formation of \u03b2-sheet structure within the E8(L/D) segment which on its own is entirely refractory to aggregation. We demonstrate how an alternating L/D sequence can be effectively forced to become a part of highly ordered amyloid structure scaffolded by an all-L amyloidogenic segment. Our study shows how the overall amyloidogenic characteristics of a larger hybrid sequence may be impacted and controlled by the properties of its most aggregation-prone part.

These findings have important implications for the future design of new nitroxide-based spin labels and imaging agents.

This review describes the range of non-enveloped viruses that have been co-opted for heterologous protein cargo encapsulation and the strategies that have been developed to drive encapsulation. Spherical capsids of a range of sizes have been used as platforms for protein cargo encapsulation. Various approaches, based on native and non-native interactions between the cargo proteins and inner surface of VLP capsids, have been devised to drive encapsulation. Here we outline the evolution of these approaches, discussing their benefits and limitations. Like the viruses from which they are derived, VLPs are of interest in both biomedical and materials applications. The encapsulation of protein cargo inside VLPs leads to numerous uses in both fundamental and applied biocatalysis and biomedicine, some of which are discussed herein. The applied science of protein encapsulating VLPs is emerging as a research field with great potential.

Out of the many molecular simulation methods that exist to model these disordered materials, one strategy consists in simulating the phase transition from a crystalline MOF to the amorphous state using molecular dynamics. ReaxFF reactive force fields have been proposed for this purpose in several studies to generate models of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) glasses by melt-quenching. In this work, we investigate in detail the accuracy and reliability of this approach by reproducing the published procedures and comparing the structure of the resulting glasses to other data, including ab initio modeling. We find that the in silico melt-quench procedure is extremely sensitive to the choice of methodology and parameters, and suggest adaptations to improve the scheme. We also show that the glass models generated with ReaxFF are markedly different from their ab initio counterparts, as well as known experimental characteristics, and feature an unphysical description of the local coordination environment, which in term affects the medium-range and bulk properties.", "date": "2022-10-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Sequence-defined macromolecules are fabricated by multi-step iterative processes that involve high reagents and solvents consumption. Moreover, every step causes yield losses that result in low overall yield. Despite the envisioned valuable functions and applications of sequence-defined polymers, the synthetic limitations constitute a barrier for the exploitation of their practical potential. Here, we investigated the one-pot synthesis of oligocarbamates without the purification of intermediates. To control monomer sequence without isolation, we introduced a monitoring feedback loop to fuel the exact amount of reagents to the reaction mixture, assuring full conversion of each reaction. Based on a one-pot strategy, we have developed a facile approach for the preparation of uniform, oligocarbamates with full control of monomer order and defined stereochemistry. The great advantage of the presented methodology is the scalability of the process (demonstrated for synthesis of 50 g) and high yield (up to 90%). Oligomers obtained on a large scale can be further used as precursors for the synthesis of polymers with high molar mass. One-pot methods combined with chemoselective reactions bear the potential to overcome existing synthesis limitations and unlock the practical use of sequence-defined macromolecules.

To achieve this, a selection of 23 structurally diverse compounds with a broad range of polarities were evaluated. Importantly, the novel introduction of an elution solvent containing ammonium bicarbonate extended the current applicability of SAX-SPE for strong acids and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. This new method performed with consistently higher recovery (88 \u00b1 7 % at 500 ng L-1), improved selectivity and lower matrix interference (mean = 12%) over a generic mixed-mode weak anion exchange SPE method. In addition, a novel filter for reducing full-scan features from fulvic and humic acids was successfully introduced, reducing workload and potential for false positives. The workflow was then applied to NTA/SS of 10 London municipal drinking water samples, allowing the identification of 22 confirmed substances. Several poorly investigated and potentially harmful compounds were found. In particular, predicted mutagenicity and occurrence frequency indicated the need for further investigation of halogenated hydroxy-cyclopentene-diones (HCDs) and dibromomethanesulfonic acid in drinking water.

This equates to chemical and human resources being spent on activities which ultimately do not progress the programs, leading to a triple loss when accounting for the cost of opportunity in time wasted. In this work we pre-train a BERT model on more than 16 million reactions from 4 different data sources, and fine tune it to achieve an uncertainty calibrated global yield prediction model. This model is an improvement upon state of the art not just from the increase in pre-train data but also by introducing a new embedding layer which solves a few limitations of SMILES and enables integration of additional information such as equivalents and molecule role into the reaction encoding, the model is called BERT Enriched Embedding (BEE). The model is benchmarked on an open-source dataset against a state-of-the-art synthesis focused BERT showing a near 20-point improvement in r2 score. The model is fine-tuned and tested on an internal company data benchmark, and a prospective study shows that the application of the model can reduce the total number of negative reactions (yield under 5%) ran in Janssen by at least 34%. Lastly, we corroborate the previous results through experimental validation, by directly deploying the model in an on-going drug discovery project and showing that it can also be used successfully as a reagent recommender due to its fast inference speed and reliable confidence estimation, a critical feature for industry application.", "date": "2022-10-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Artificial Intelligence; Pharmaceutical Industry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The major grain producing regions have been threatened by major crop diseases and insect pests. The wheat curl mite was previously thought to be the primary vector for the spread of the wheat mosaic virus. However, recent research has shown that soil may actually be more influential. In this present study,we used domain search of the bioinformatics method to study the coat protein of the Chinese wheat mosaic virus. The wheat mosaic virus's binding regions to chitin, chitosan, and cellulose, as well as the active region of cell wall degrading enzymes, and the related domains of endocytotic entry, were determined through the domain search.There are Ca2+ and Mg2+-ATP binding sites in the wheat mosaic virus coat protein. It demonstrates that wheat mosaic virus can complete its transmission by binding chitin via its coat protein. By binding Ca2+ via an EF-hand, the coat protein is capable of inducing the binding of Mg2+-ATP, which is essential for initiating serine-threonine kinase activity. A coating containing serine kinase activity facilitates the capacity of proteins to bind chitin, collagen, or fibrillar cellulose. Upon activation of the PPM enzyme domain that binds Mg2+-ATP, glycosyl hydrolases and swelling enzymes become active. This process necessitates the hydrolysis of glycosyl chains contained in proteins, which contributes to the enlargement of the cell wall. As they continue to move, the motor domains of the coat protein rotate and puncture holes in the cell wall. Using phospholipid transporter domains, it creates membrane fusion pores on the cell membrane. At the same time, the coat protein inserts viral genetic material into plant cells.", "date": "2022-10-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We provide a benchmark of several computational methods (GAFF, AMOEBApro13, PM6, PM7, DFTB3-D3(BJ)) as possible prescanning surrogates and apply sGADFT to two test case systems that are (i) two isomer families of the protonated Gly-Pro-Gly-Gly tetrapeptide, and (ii) the doubly-protonated cyclic decapeptide gramicidin S.

In this study, using Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), a fish known for its aggressiveness, we investigated the impact of varying caffeine concentrations on the aggressive behavior of the Betta splendens after seeing an intruder. There were four experimental caffeine used in the experiment: the control group without any caffeine added, another is the low dose (120 \u00b5g/L of caffeine), the medium dose (200 \u00b5g/L of caffeine), and the high dose (280 \u00b5g/L caffeine of caffeine). A T-test (using a significance level of 0.05) was used to determine the differences in behavior between the control fishes and the fishes with varying caffeine doses, which will allow us to evaluate the effects of caffeine on Betta splendens. The results showed that there is not much evidence to support the correlation between caffeine concentrations on male territory-holding Betta splendens and their increasingly aggressive behavior exhibited when an intruder is introduced. A better quantitative understanding of the anatomy of Betta splendens, such as the correlation between the biological systems of the fish responsible for aggressive behavior and caffeine, is needed to clarify the urgency of the issue of caffeine concentrations found in bodies of water worldwide.

However, it remains a challenge to identify a distal binding site that would be allosterically linked to the canonical ligand/substrate binding site. Such allosteric hotspots are often cryptic sites with a less populated excited conformational state of the protein. In this work we present a general strategy based on thermodynamic arguments to identify such distal cryptic sites as potential targets for allosteric drugs. We demonstrate this on allosterically modulating the PPI between PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor), which is a challenging and therapeutically important target towards treatment of hypercholesterolemia (elevated plasma level of LDL). Using several \u00b5s long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that on binding with the EGF-A domain of LDLR, there is a significant conformational change (population shift) in a distal loop (residues 211-222) region of PCSK9. We have identified several (meta)stable and kinetically resolved conformational states of this loop and demonstrated that there exists a clear correlation between the loop conformation and the binding affinity with LDLR. Using a thermodynamic argument, we establish that the loop conformations predominantly present in the apo state of PCSK9 would have lower binding affinity with LDLR and they would be potential targets for designing allosteric inhibitors. We also elucidate the molecular origin of the allosteric coupling between this loop and PCSK9-LDLR binding interface in terms of population shift in several specific pair-wise interactions consisting of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Overall, our work provides a general strategy towards identifying allosteric hotspots, where one should compare the conformational ensemble between the apo and substrate bound states of the protein and identify distal differences, if any. Subsequently the apo-like conformations should be targeted for designing inhibitors that would specifically bind to those conformations and stabilise them.", "date": "2022-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These catalyst materials are based on vanadium or manganese redox-active elements (RAEs) and present diverse phase compositions, crystallinities, and catalytic behaviors. By applying the sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator (SISSO) approach to the consistent data set, we identify nonlinear property-function relationships depending on several key parameters, reflecting the intricate interplay of underlying processes governing selective oxidation. This approach indicates the most relevant characterization techniques and shows how the catalyst properties may be tuned in order to achieve the\ndesired performance. For example, to achieve high olefin yields, the catalyst must have a high specific surface area, a low concentration of surface RAE, and the ability to change the surface RAE oxidation states under reaction conditions with respect to vacuum. These parameters are measured by N2 adsorption, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and near-ambient-pressure in situ XPS. They reflect the relevance of local transport, site isolation, surface redox activity, and the materials dynamical restructuring under reaction conditions.

Activity against the mycobacteria was generally less than with SQ109 and was reduced by increasing the size of the alkyl adduct, but two analogs were ~4-8 fold more active than was SQ109 against M. abscessus, including a highly drug resistant strain harboring a A309P mutation in MmpL3. There was also better activity than found with SQ109 with other bacteria and protozoa. Of particular interest, we found that the adamantyl C-2 ethyl, butyl, phenyl and benzyl  analogs had 4-10x increased activity against P. falciparum asexual blood stages, together with low toxicity to a human HepG2 cell line, making them of interest as new anti-malarial drug leads. We also used surface plasmon resonance to investigate the binding of inhibitors to MmpL3, and differential scanning calorimetry to investigate binding to lipid membranes. There was no correlation between MmpL3 binding and M. tuberculosis or M. smegmatis cell activity, suggesting that MmpL3 is not a major target, in mycobacteria.

The addition of the divalent lanthanide fragments Cp*2Ln(OEt2) (Ln = Sm or Yb) to a redox-active, non-symmetrical ligand, 2-pyrimidin-2-yl-1H-benzimidazole (Hbimpm), leads to two isostructural complexes, of the general formula (Cp*2Ln)2[\u03bc-Pd(pyridyl)2] (Ln = Sm (4) and Yb (5)). These adducts have interesting features, such as unique linear Ln-Pd-Ln arrangements and short Ln-Pd distances, which deviate from the expected lanthanide contraction. A mixed computational and spectroscopic study into the formation of these adducts gathers important clues as to their formation. At the same time, a thorough characterization of these complexes establishes the +3 oxidation state of all the involved Ln centers. Detailed theoretical computations demonstrate that the apparent deviation from the lanthanide contraction is not due to any difference in the intermetallic interaction between the Pd and the Ln, but that the fragments are joined together by electrostatic interactions and dispersive forces. This conclusion is in contrast with the findings about a third complex, Cp*2Yb(\u03bc-Me)2PdCp* (6), formed during the reaction, which also possesses a short Yb-Pd distance. Studies at the CASSCF level of theory on this complex show several orbitals containing significant interactions between the 4f and 4d manifolds of the metals. This demonstrates the need for methodical and careful analyses in gauging the intermetallic interaction and the inadequacy of empirical metrics in describing such phenomena.

Here we pay special attention to the entangled electron-nuclear motion.

Chem. Phys. 155, 204110 (2021)]. Fast convergence in the number of the dominant contributions is achieved when instead of the density matrix we describe the time-evolution of the surprisal, the logarithm of the density operator. In the present work, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach using an example of the early time dynamics in pyrazine in a Hilbert space accounting for up to four vibrational normal modes,  {Q10a, Q6a, Q1 , Q9a}, and two coupled electronic states, the optically dark   and the bright   states. Dynamics in four-dimensional configurational space involve 19600 vibronic eigenstates. Our results reveal that the rate of the ultrafast population decay as well as the shape of the nuclear wave packets in 2D, accounting only for  {Q10a, Q6a}  normal modes, are accurately captured with only six dominant time-independent observables in the surprisal. Extension of the dynamics to three- and four-dimensional vibrational subspace requires only five additional constraints. The time-evolution of a quantum state in 4D vibrational space on two electronic states is thus compacted to only 11 time-dependent coefficients of these observables.

Reliable DOM reference materials are required for further method development and dataset alignment, but do not currently exist for the marine environment. This presents a major limitation for marine biogeochemistry and related fields, including natural product discovery. To fill this resource gap, we have prepared a marine DOM reference material (TRM-0522) from 45 m deep coastal seawater obtained ~ 1 km offshore of Sweden\u2019s west coast. Over 3000 molecular formulas were assigned by direct infusion HRMS, confirming sample diversity, and the distribution of formulas in van Krevelen space was typical for a marine sample, with the majority of formulas in the region H/C 1-1.5 and O/C 0.3-0.7. The extracted DOM pool was more nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) rich than a typical terrestrial reference material (SRFA). MZmine3 processing of UPLC-HRMS/MS data revealed 494 resolvable features (233 in negative mode; 261 in positive mode) over a wide range of retention times and masses. NMR data indicated low contributions of the aromatic protons, and generally speaking lignin, humic, and fulvic substances associated with terrestrial samples. Instead, carboxylic-rich aliphatic molecules (CRAM) were the most abundant components, followed by carbohydrates and aliphatic functionalities. This is consistent with a very low specific UV absorbance SUVA254 value of 1.36 L mg C-1 m-1.  When combined with comparisons with existing terrestrial reference materials (SRFA and PLFA), these results suggest that TRM-0522 is a useful and otherwise unavailable reference material for use in marine DOM biogeochemistry.", "date": "2022-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Besides the preparative opportunities, mechanochemical conditions benefit from the absence of any organic solvent, the possibility of a significant synthetic acceleration and unique reaction pathways. Together with an accurate characterization of ball-milling products, the development of a deeper mechanistic understanding of the occurring transformations at a molecular level is critical for fully grasping the potential of organic mechanosynthesis. In this vein, we studied a bromination of a cyclic sulfoximine in a mixer mill and used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization of the reaction products. Magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR was applied for elucidating the product mixtures taken from the milling jar without introducing any further post-processing on the sample-of-interest. Ex-situ 13C-detected NMR spectra of ball-milling products showed the formation of a rather crystalline solid phase with the regioselective bromination of the S-aryl group of the heterocycle in position 4. Completion is reached in less than 30 minutes as deduced from the NMR spectra. The bromination can also be achieved by magnetic stirring, but then, a longer reaction time is required. Mixing the solid educts in the NMR rotor allows to get in-situ insights into the reaction and enables the detection of a reaction intermediate. The pressure alone induced in the rotor by MAS is not sufficient to lead to full conversion and the reaction occurs on slower time scales than in the ball mill, which is crucial for analysing mixtures taken from the milling jar by solid-state NMR. Our data suggest that on top of centrifugal forces, an efficient mixing of the starting materials is required for reaching a complete reaction.", "date": "2022-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this paper we show that if compound prices are the desired proxy for compound availability, then synthetic accessibility scores are not effective strategies for us in selection.

However, the achievable shift of the LSPR is diminished by the presence of a near-surface depletion layer with low electron concentration. The depletion layer also separates the plasmonic NC core from the surrounding environment with a deleterious effect on the near-field enhancement (NFE) of the electromagnetic field. Here, we synthesized a series of Sn-doped In2O3 NCs with dopants segregated either in\nthe core or the shell region to tune the depletion layer and introduce a second region of band bending at the interface between doped and undoped regions. By chemically reducing these NCs, we investigated the influence of radial dopant segregation on LSPR modulation and NFE. We found that core-doped NCs show large LSPR shifts during chemical titration, enabling broadband modulation in LSPR energy of over 1000 cm\u22121 and of peak extinction over 300%. Simulations reveal that the evolution of the LSPR spectra during chemical reduction results from raising the surface potential and increasing the donor defect density in the shell region. Although the computationally predicted NFE is greater for shell-doped NCs as synthesized, the change in NFE when adding or removing electrons is larger for core-doped NCs. These results establish dopant segregation as a useful strategy for engineering the responsive properties of metal oxide NCs, highlighting opportunities for dynamic optical modulation in plasmonic semiconductor NC heterostructures that go beyond those accessible with conventional plasmonic metals.", "date": "2022-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, its chemical stability in alkaline redox flow batteries has been debated. Mechanistic understandings at the molecular level are necessary to elucidate the cycling stability of K4[Fe(CN)6] and its oxidized state (K3[Fe(CN)6]) based electrolytes and guide their proper use in flow batteries for energy storage. Herein, we presented a suite of battery tests and spectroscopic studies to understand the chemical stability of K4[Fe(CN)6] and its charged state, K3[Fe(CN)6], at a variety of conditions. In a strong alkaline solution (pH 14), it was found that the balanced K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6] half-cell experienced a fast capacity decay under dark conditions. Our studies revealed the chemical reduction of K3[Fe(CN)6] by a graphite electrode leads to the charge imbalance in the half-cell cycling and is the major cause of the observed capacity decay. In addition, at pH 14, K3[Fe(CN)6] undergoes a slow CN\u2012/OH\u2012 exchange reaction. The dissociated CN\u2012 ligand can chemically reduce K3[Fe(CN)6] to K4[Fe(CN)6], and it is converted to cyanate (OCN\u2012) and further, decompose into CO32\u2012 and NH3.

We present a new software package, the Expanded Package for IET-based Solvation (EPISOL), that performs 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) calculations to obtain the solvation structure and free energies of solute molecules in different solvents. In EPISOL, we have implemented 22 different closures, multiple free energy functionals, and new variations of 3D-RISM theory, including the recent hydrophobicity-induced density inhomogeneity (HI) theory for hydrophobic solutes and ion-dipole correction (IDC) theory for negatively charged solutes. To speed up the convergence and enhance the stability of the self-consistent iterations, we have introduced several numerical schemes in EPISOL, including a newly developed dynamic mixing approach. We show that these schemes have significantly reduced the failure rate of 3D-RISM calculations compared to AMBER-RISM software. EPISOL consists of both a user-friendly graphic interface and a kernel library that allows users to call its routines and adapt them to other programs. EPISOL is compatible with the force-field and coordinate files from both AMBER and GROMACS simulation packages. Moreover, EPISOL is equipped with an internal memory control to efficiently manage the use of physical memory, making it suitable for performing calculations on large biomolecules. We demonstrate that EPISOL can efficiently and accurately calculate solvation density distributions around various solute molecules (including a protein chaperone consisting of 120,715 atoms) and obtain solvent free energy for a wide range of organic compounds.

However, the bonding of hydrogels (thiol-ene radical or more classic acrylate/methacrylate radical-based) to thiol-ene elastomers and alkene-functional elastomers has not been characterised in detail. In this study, we quantify the tensile mechanical properties of hybrid hydrogel samples formed of two elastomers bonded to a hydrogel material.

This study demonstrates the strong bonding of thiol-ene hydrogels to alkene-presenting elastomers with a range of chemistries, including silicones and polyesters.

The exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) dispersion model has shown good performance in the calculation of relative and absolute lattice energies of molecular crystals, although it has traditionally been applied in combination with plane-wave/pseudopotential approaches. This has limited XDM to use with semilocal functional approximations, which suffer from delocalization error and poor quality conformational energies, and to systems with a few hundreds of atoms at most due to unfavorable scaling. In this work, we combine XDM with numerical atomic orbitals, which enable the efficient use of XDM-corrected hybrid functionals for molecular crystals. This improves the treatment of delocalization error and conformational energies, and makes the calculation scale linearly with system size. We test the new XDM-corrected functionals for their ability to predict the lattice energies of molecular crystals for the X23 set and 13 ice phases, the latter being a particularly stringent test. A composite approach using a XDM-corrected, 25% hybrid functional based on B86bPBE achieves a mean absolute error of 0.48 kcal/mol per molecule for the X23 set and 0.19 kcal/mol for the total lattice energies of the ice phases, compared to recent diffusion Monte-Carlo data.

Discrete metallosupramolecular cages exhibiting SCO are an exciting, though rare, class of porous polyhedral material. Incorporating the SCO property into these architectures is complicated, as there are many inter- and intramolecular factors which must be appropriately balanced. Previous investigations into the magnetic properties of a large cubic metallosupramolecular cage, [Fe8Pd6L8]28+, constructed using semi-rigid metalloligands, found that the Fe(II) centers that occupied the corners of the cubic structure did not undergo a spin transition. In this work, substitution of the linker metal on the face of the cage resulted in spin crossover behavior, as evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, M\u04e7ssbauer and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Structural comparisons of these two cages were undertaken to shed light on the possible mechanism responsible for switching of the [Fe8MII6L8]28+ architecture from SCO inactive to active by simply changing the identity of M(II). This led to the suggestion that a possible interplay of intra- and intermolecular interactions may permit SCO in the Ni(II) analogue, 1. The distorted octahedral coordination environment of the secondary Ni(II) centers occupying the cage faces provided conformational flexibility for the eight metalloligands of the cubic architecture relative to the square planar Pd(II) environment. Meanwhile the occupation of axial coordination sites of the Ni(II) cations by CH3CN prevented the close packing of cages observed for the Pd(II) analogue, leading to a more offset, distant packing arrangement of cages in the lattice, whereby important areas of the cage that were shown to change most dramatically with SCO experienced a lesser degree of steric hindrance. Design via the effect of secondary metal centers on the flexibility of metalloligand structures and the effect of the axial donors on the packing arrangements may serve as new routes for engineering cage systems with desired magnetic properties.", "date": "2022-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Magnetism", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Taylor\u2019s theorem and transition state theory are further applied to precisely describe the relationship among rate constant, free energy of activation, and applied potential.

Thus, understanding the energetic balance of solvation and desolvation resulting from individual water molecules can be crucial when estimating ligand binding, especially when evaluating different molecules and poses as done in High-Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS). Over the last decades, several methods were developed to tackle this problem, ranging from fast approximate methods (usually empirical functions using either discrete atom-atom pairwise interactions or continuum solvent models), to more computationally expensive and accurate ones mostly based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, such as Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) or Double Decoupling. On one hand, MD-based methods are prohibitive to use in HTVS to estimate the role of waters on the fly for each ligand. On the other hand, fast and approximate methods show unsatisfactory level of accuracy, with low agreement with results obtained with the more expensive methods. Here we introduce WaterKit, a new grid-based sampling method with explicit water molecules to calculate thermodynamic properties using the GIST method. Our results show that the discrete placement of water molecules is successful in reproducing the position of crystallographic waters with very high accuracy, as well as providing thermodynamic estimates with accuracy comparable to more expensive MD simulations.  Unlike these methods, WaterKit can be used to analyze specific regions on the protein surface, (such as the binding site of a receptor), without having to hydrate and simulate the whole receptor structure.

In contrast, glycosylation sites in the S protein are conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants, making glycans a potential robust target for developing antivirals. However, this target has not been adequately exploited for SARS-CoV-2, mostly due to intrinsically weak monovalent protein-glycan inter-actions. We hypothesize that polyvalent nano-lectins with flexibly linked carbohydrate-recognition-domains (CRDs) can adjust their relative positions and bind multivalently to S protein glycans, potentially exerting potent antiviral activity. Herein, we displayed the CRDs of DC-SIGN, a dendritic cell lectin known to bind to diverse viruses, polyvalently onto 13 nm gold nanoparticles (named as G13-CRD). G13-CRD bound strongly and specifically to target glycan-coated quantum dots with sub-nM Kd. Moreover, G13-CRD neutralized particles pseudo-typed with the S proteins of Wuhan Hu-1, B1, Delta variant and Omicron subvariant BA.1 with low nM EC50. In contrast, natural tetrameric DC-SIGN and its G13 conjugate were ineffective. Further, G13-CRD potently and completely inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Hu-1 and BA.1, with <10 pM and <10 nM EC50, respectively. These results identify G13-CRD as a polyvalent nano-lectin with broad activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants that merits further exploration as a novel approach to antiviral therapy.", "date": "2022-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Cadmium selenide nanoplatelets are a special case. They combine a weak van der Waals attraction and a large facet to particle size ratio. We use coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations of nanoplatelets in octane to demonstrate that solvation forces are strong enough to induce the formation of nanoplatelet stacks, and by that have a crucial impact on the steric stability. In particular, we demonstrate that for sufficiently large nanoplatelets, solvation forces are proportional to the interacting facet area, and their strength is intrinsically tied to the softness of the ligand shell.", "date": "2022-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Aggregates and Assemblies; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Both CAG and VSFG analyses showed that the odd-even effect in liquid-like SAMs (n = 3 \u2013 9) disappeared upon heating at 50 \u2013 70 \u00b0C, indicating that the heating led to increased structural disorder regardless of odd and even carbon numbers. In contrast, the opposite thermoresponse was observed for odd and even SCn molecules in wax- and solid-like SAMs (n = 10 \u2013 18). Namely, temperature-dependent orientational change of terminal CH3 relative to the surface normal was opposite for the odd and even molecules, thereby leading to mitigated odd-even effect.

We demonstrate a digital Oracle that reasons about chemical reactivity using probability. By doing >500 reactions covering a large space and retaining both the positive and negative results the Oracle was able to rediscover eight historically important reactions including the Aldol condensation, Buchwald-Hartwig amination, Heck, Mannich, Sonogashira, Suzuki, Wittig and Wittig-Horner reactions.

Under nickel-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling conditions, a diversity of simple and complex substrates are united in good to excellent yield. High-throughput experimentation was essential to the development of the reaction, and to the discovery of performance-enhancing additives such as cyclic imides, RuCl3 and GaCl3.

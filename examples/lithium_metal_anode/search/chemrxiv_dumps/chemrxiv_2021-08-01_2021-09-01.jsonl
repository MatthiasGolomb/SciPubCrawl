Describing such phenomena via computational models requires generation and analysis of a large space of surface atomic configurations. To address this challenge, we present the Adsorbate Chemical Environment-based Graph Convolution Neural Network (ACE-GCN), a screening workflow that can account for atomistic configurations comprising diverse adsorbates, binding locations, coordination environments, and substrate morphologies. Using this workflow, we develop catalyst surface models for two illustrative systems: (i) NO adsorbed on a Pt3Sn(111) alloy surface, of interest for nitrate electroreduction processes, where high adsorbate coverages combine with the low symmetry of the alloy substrate to produce a large configurational space, and (ii) OH* adsorbed on a stepped Pt(221) facet, of relevance to the Oxygen Reduction Reaction, wherein the presence of irregular crystal surfaces, high adsorbate coverages, and directionally-dependent adsorbate-adsorbate interactions result in the configurational complexity. In both cases, the ACE-GCN model, having trained on a fraction (~10%) of the total DFT-relaxed configurations, successfully ranks the relative stabilities of unrelaxed atomic configurations sampled from a large configurational space. This approach is expected to accelerate development of rigorous descriptions of catalyst surfaces under in-situ conditions.", "date": "2021-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The Square Table included emerging and established leaders from a wide range of backgrounds and institutional types such that a clear picture of the key challenges and needs were developed. Over the course of two half-day sessions, a group of more than 50 participants (see Appendix 1) discussed strategies for advancing the science, technology, and more overarching systems associated with sustainable polymers. The Square Table concept provides structure and self-facilitated interactions among stakeholders who do not typically interact with one another to bridge gaps that exist between industry, federal agencies, and academia in an open and unbiased manner. This was accomplished by mixing participants in breakout discussion with guiding questions, followed by reporting back to the group and repeating with a new mix of participants, questions, and discussion points. Select participants that not only contributed to the discussion but also acted as scribes for sub-sessions were essential to help capture the sum of the views, suggestions, and inputs from the participants. In this way, the discussions cut to the root cause of successes and opportunities in a rapid and less biased manner than traditional roundtables or workshops. The Square Table objectives included developing proposed answers to key questions such as (1) What are the critical basic and applied questions that, when addressed together, could improve the possibility for impact in terms of moving fundamental research thrusts and translational efforts? (2) What prevents large-scale, coordinated efforts between industry, academia, and federal agencies? (3) What is needed to help reduce these barriers in terms of data resources, physical infrastructure, and/or workforce training? (4) How can data and advanced modeling approaches be shared in a collaborative way that would allow data-driven science and engineering to be accelerated in a translational sense? (5) What partnerships are needed to foster an environment/culture to realize more sustainable polymer solutions in the future?", "date": "2021-08-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

To combat global coral reef stressors and rebuild coral communities, restoration practitioners have developed workflows to rear and settle vulnerable coral larvae in the laboratory and subsequently outplant settled juveniles back to natural and artificial reefs. These workflows often make use of the natural biochemical settlement cues present in crustose coralline algae (CCA), which can be presented to swimming larvae as extracts, fragments, or live algal sheets to induce settlement. In this work, we investigated the potential for inorganic chemical cues to complement these known biochemical effects. We designed settlement substrates made from lime mortar (CaCO3) and varied their composition with the use of synthetic and mineral additives, including sands, glasses, and alkaline earth carbonates. In experiments with larvae of two Caribbean coral species, Acropora palmata (elkhorn coral) and Diploria labyrinthiformis (grooved brain coral), we saw additive-specific settlement preferences (>10-fold settlement increase) in the absence of any external biochemical cues. Interestingly, these settlement trends were independent of bulk surface properties such as surface roughness and wettability. Instead, our results suggest that not only can settling coral larvae sense and positively respond to soluble inorganic materials, but that they can also detect localized topographical features more than an order of magnitude smaller than their body width. Our findings open a new area of research in coral reef restoration, in which engineered substrates can be designed with a combination of organic and inorganic additives to increase larval settlement, and perhaps also improve post-settlement growth, mineralization, and defense.", "date": "2021-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Biocompatible Materials; Environmental Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In recent works we have shown that SPION-doped lipid cubic liquid crystals undergo a cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition under the action of temperature or of an alternating magnetic fields (AMF). This transition triggers the release of drugs embedded in the lipid scaffold or in the water channels. In this contribution, we address this phenomenon in depth, to fully elucidate the structural details and optimize the design of hybrid multifunctional carriers for drug delivery. Combining Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) with a magnetic characteri-zation, we find that in bulk lipid cubic phases the cubic-to-hexagonal transition determines the magnetic response of SPIONs. We then extend the investigation from bulk liquid-crystalline phases to colloidal dispersions, i.e. to lipid/SPIONs nanoparticles with cubic internal structure (\u201cmagnetocubosomes\u201d). Through Synchrotron SAXS, we monitored the structural response of magnetocubosomes while exposed to an AMF: the magnetic energy, converted into heat by SPIONs, activates the cubic-to-hexagonal transition, and can thus be used as a remote stimulus to spike drug release \u201con-demand\u201d. In addition, we show that the AMF-induced phase transition in magnetocubosomes steers the re-alignment of SPIONs into linear string assemblies and connect this effect with the change in their magnetic properties, observed at the bulk level.

However, in certain instances, gene compensation can obfuscate the results of these studies, necessitating the editing of multiple genes to properly identify biological pathways and protein function. Performing multiple genetic modifications in cells remains difficult due to the requirement for multiple rounds of gene editing. While fluorescently labeled guide RNAs (gRNAs) are routinely used in laboratories for targeting CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt individual loci, technical limitations in single guide RNA (sgRNA) synthesis hinder the expansion of this approach to multi-color cell sorting. Here, we describe a modular strategy for synthesizing sgRNAs where each target sequence is conjugated to a unique fluorescent label, which enables fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) to isolate cells that incorporate the desired combination of gene-editing constructs. We demonstrate that three short strands of RNA functionalized with strategically placed 3\u2019-azide and 5\u2019-alkyne terminal deoxyribonucleotides can be assembled in a one-step, template-assisted, copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) to generate fully functional, fluorophore-modified sgRNAs. Using these synthetic sgRNA in combination with FACS, we achieved selective cleavage of two targeted genes, either separately as a single color experiment or in combination as a dual-color experiment. These data indicate that our strategy for generating doubly-clicked sgRNA allows for Cas9 activity in cells. By minimizing the size of each RNA fragment to 41 nucleotides or less, this strategy is well suited for custom, scalable synthesis of sgRNAs.

Amphiphilic copolymers were synthesized that exhibit \u03b2-sheet-like local structure upon collapsing into single-chain assemblies in aqueous environments. Systematic analysis of a series of amphiphilic copolymers illustrated that the global collapse is primarily driven by hydrophobic forces.

An emerging non-ionizing alternative for molecular imaging is hyperpolarized MRI. In particular, imaging of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate is a leading candidate because pyruvate is innocuous and has a central role in metabolism. However, simi-lar to PET, hyperpolarized MRI with dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is complex, costly and requires complex in-frastructure. In contrast, signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a fast, cheap, and scalable hyperpo-larization technique. In particular, SABRE in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH) transfers polarization from parahydrogen to 13C in pyruvate, however, to date, SABRE-SHEATH of 13C-pyruvate was limited in polarization levels relative to DNP (1.7% with SABRE-SHEATH vs. ~60% with DNP). Here we introduce a temperature cycling method for SABRE-SHEATH that enables >10% polarization on [1-13C]pyruvate, sufficient for successful in vivo experiments. First, at lower temperatures, ~20% polarization is accumulated on SABRE-catalyst bound pyruvate, which is subsequently released into free pyruvate in solution at elevated temperatures. We take ad-vantage of the achieved polarization to demonstrate first 13C pyruvate images with a cryogen-free MRI system operat-ed at 1 T. This illustrates that inexpensive hyperpolarization methods can be combined with low-cost MRI systems to obtain a broadly available, yet highly sensitive metabolic imaging platform.", "date": "2021-08-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In our earlier study1 of deprotonated serine, we observed a significant difference in the vibrational spectra with the classical MD simulations compared to the infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectra. It was postulated that this is due to neglecting the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). In this work, NQEs are considered in the spectral calculation using the TRPMD simulations. With the help of potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, the conformational space of deprotonated serine is analysed and used to understand the difference in the spectra of classical MD and TRPMD simulations at 298.15 K and 100 K. The high-frequency vibrational bands in the spectra are characterised using Fourier transform localised vibrational mode (FT-\u03bdNAC) and interatomic distance histograms. At room temperature, the quantum effects are less significant, and the free energy profiles in the classical MD and the TRPMD simulations are very similar.

Here, we developed viable Fe-N-C catalysts, which, for the first time, demonstrated competitive activity to that of Pt/C catalysts and dramatically enhanced stability and durability under practical PEMFC operating conditions. The most active Fe-N-C catalyst achieved a record half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.915 V vs. RHE at 0.6 mgcatcm-2) and an ORR mass activity of 10.5 mA mgcat at 0.9 V in (RDE) tests, exceeding a Pt/C baseline catalyst (60 \u00b5gPt cm-2) by 40 mV in acidic electrolytes. This compelling activity of the Fe-N-C catalyst in aqueous acids on rotating disk electrode (RDE) was successfully transferred to a fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), generating an initial current density of 44.2 mA cm-2 exceeding the U.S. DOE 2025 target (i.e., 44 mA cm-2) at 0.9 VIR-free under O2. Under practical hydrogen-air conditions, record 151 mA cm-2 at 0.8 V and peak power density of 601 mW cm-2 were achieved. Importantly, we discovered that depositing nitrogen-carbon species on the catalyst surface via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) dramatically enhanced catalyst stability, evidenced by performance durability after accelerated stress tests (30 000 square-wave voltage cycles under H2/air) and long-term steady-state life tests (> 300 hours at 0.67 V). Innovative identical location-scanning transmission electron microscopy (IL-STEM) experiments confirmed that the CVD process leads to deposition of nitrogen-doped carbon onto the catalyst surfaces. Along with theoretical modeling, a reconstruction of the carbon structure adjacent to FeN4 sites leads to increased robustness against demetallation and carbon oxidation.

While electrolyte engineering has been a major thrust of Li-ion battery (LIB) research, it is unclear if the same electrolyte design principles apply to K-ion batteries (KIBs). Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is a well-known additive used in Li-ion electrolytes, because the products of its sacrificial decomposition aid in forming a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode surface. Here, we show that FEC addition to KIBs containing hard carbon anodes results in a dramatic decrease in capacity and cell failure in only two cycles, whereas capacity retention remains high (> 90% over 80 cycles at C/10 for both KPF6 and KFSI) for electrolytes that do not contain FEC. Using a combination of 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), we show that FEC decomposes during galvanostatic cycling to form insoluble KF and K2CO3 on the anode surface, which correlate with increased interfacial resistance. Our results strongly suggest KIB performance is sensitive to accumulation of an inorganic SEI, likely due to sluggish K diffusion in these compounds. This mechanism of FEC decomposition was confirmed in two separate electrolyte formulations using KPF6 or KFSI. Interestingly, the salt anions do not decompose themselves, unlike their Li analogues. Insight from these results indicates that electrolyte decomposition pathways and favorable SEI components are significantly different in KIBs and LIBs, suggesting that entirely new approaches to KIB electrolyte engineering are needed.", "date": "2021-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

On the other hand, the weighted ensemble (WE) method can efficiently sample transitions between states with its many weighted trajectories, which directly yield rates and pathways. However, the performance of WE (i.e., convergence and efficiency) depends heavily on its initial conditions or initial sampling of the potential energy landscape. Hence, we have developed a hybrid method that combines the two methods, wherein GaMD is first used to sample the potential energy landscape of the system, and WE is subsequently used to further sample the potential energy landscape and kinetic properties of interest.

Thermal stability is associated with the glass transition temperature (Tg) and decomposition temperature (Td), but experimental determinations of these two important properties genernally involve a time-consuming and laborious process. Thus, the development of a quick and accurate prediction tool is highly desirable. Motivated by the challenge, we explored machine learning (ML) by constructing a new dataset with more than one thousand samples collected from a wide range of literature, through which ensemble learning models were explored. Models trained with the LightGBM algorithm exhibited the best prediction performance, where the values of MAE, RMSE, and R2 were 17.15 K, 24.63 K, and 0.77 for Tg prediction and 24.91 K, 33.88 K, and 0.78 for Td prediction. The prediction performance and the generalization of the machine learning models were further tested by out-of-sample data, which also exhibited satisfactory results. Experimental validation further demonstrated the reliability and the practical potential of the ML-based model. In order to extend the practical application of the ML-based models, an online prediction platform was constructed. This platform includes the optimal prediction models and all the thermal stability data under study, and it is freely available at http://oledtppxmpugroup.com.

Although two types of drugs are currently available, new drugs are still required because they have serious side effects. To develop a therapeutic agent for trypanosomiasis, we focused on spermidine synthase (SpdSyn) as the target protein and determined the hidden binding site which was not identified in the X-ray structure for obtaining seed compounds using a computational simulation.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for TcSpdSyn to predict new binding sites. These results indicated that the highly druggable binding site was discovered around Glu22. We also conducted docking simulation for the new binding site and in vitro assay to determine half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value. Furthermore, to confirm ligand of binding site and pose, we conducted X-ray crystallographic studies. As a result, two compounds were discovered as inhibitors of TcSpdSyn with IC50 values of 82.27 and 43.41 \u03bcM, respectively.

The evolution of the properties with particle size was explicitly studied. It was found that while the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied quasiparticle states and fundamental gap change with particle size, the optical gap remains essentially fixed for all but the smallest nanoparticles, in line with what was previously observed experimentally. The explanation for these observations is demonstrated to be that while the optical gap is associated with an exciton that is highly localised around the particle\u2019s corner atoms, the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied quasiparticle states, while primarily localised on the oxygen corner atoms (hole) and magnesium corner atoms -(electron), show significant delocalisation along the edges.

Herein, we evaluate the impact of solvent effects on the Fluorescent Lewis Adduct (FLA) method using a series of representative Lewis acids. The solution-state nature of the FLA method in particular, offers the ability to correlate Lewis Acid Units (LAUs) obtained from the FLA measurement with chemical reactivity. The binding of a Lewis acid in various solvents reveals a measurable dichotomy between both polarity and donor ability of the solvent. While not strictly separable, we observe that, as solvent polarity increases observed LAUs increase; however, as solvent donor ability increases, the observed LAUs decrease. This dichotomy was confirmed by titration data and catalytic Diels-Alder cycloaddition and hydrosilylation reactions, illustrating that solvation effects can be appropriately gauged by LAU values determined from the FLA method.", "date": "2021-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Acid Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In recent work [Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2020, 124, 10822.] the authors have studied a series of malonomide-based amphiphiles that are relevant to liquid-liquid extraction. That work demonstrated that aggregation is largely driven by local dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Here, we build upon this observation to develop a more detailed understanding of how the balance of dipole-dipole interactions (controlled by conformation) and molecular architecture influences the morphology of the aggregates across lengthscale. Using constrained molecular dynamics about key degrees of freedom, we demonstrate that the conformation of N,N\u2019-dimethyl,N,N\u2019-dioctylhexylethoxy malonamide  (DMDOHEMA)  and  N,N\u2019-dimethyl,N,N\u2019-dibutyltetradecyl  malonamide (DMDBTDMA) has a significant impact upon self-association - where appropriate conformational sampling is essential. To quantify the aggregate morphology, several graph theoretic and persistent homology based properties are determined. The former examines the patterns of intermolecular interactions within clusters, while the latter examines the 3-dimensional spatial distribution across lengthscales. Based upon these analyses, we find that the morphology of aggregates, particularly at higher malonamide concentration, depends on a balance of dipole alignment and alkyl tail sterics. Dipole alignment encourages linear patterns of the intermolecular interactions within aggregates, while the the alkyl tail steric interactions between the malonamide result in noticeably less linear aggregates for DMDOHEMA than DMDBTDMA. This is reflected in the spatial distribution, where more holes or voids exist between extractants within the DMDOHEMA that distribute within the solution in more of a ``swiss cheese\" arrangement as opposed to the more filamentous distribution of DMBDTDMA.  This study links conformation and molecular structure to the morphology of amphiphile assemblies, and serves as a basis for ongoing study of multicomponent amphiphile solutions with polar and other solutes, and how these impact aggregation phenomena.", "date": "2021-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Self-Assembly; Solution Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Specifically, we control the stoichiometry of both anions (P, As, S, and Se) and cations (In, Zn) at the InP/ZnSe core/shell interface and correlate these changes with the resultant steady-state and time-resolved optical properties of the nanocrystals. The use of reactive trimethylsilyl reagents results in surface-limited reactions that shift the nanocrystal stoichiometry to anion-rich and improve epitaxial growth of the shell layer. In general, anion deposition on the InP QD surface results in a redshift in the absorption, quenching of the excitonic photoluminescence, and a relative increase in the intensity of the broad trap-based photoluminescence, consistent with delocalization of the exciton wavefunction and relaxation of exciton confinement. Time-resolved photoluminescence data for the resulting InP/ZnSe QDs show an overall small change in the decay dynamics on the ns timescale, suggesting the relatively low photoluminescence quantum yields may be attributed to the creation of new thermally activated charge trap states and likely a dark population that is inseparable from the emissive QDs. Cluster-model density functional theory calculations show that the presence of core/shell interface anions give rise to electronic defects contributing to the redshift in the absorption.

The CHARMM36 lipid force field is used, and selected membrane properties are tested for variations between two leaflets and whole membranes. Our models include bacterial lipids containing cyclopropane moiety on the sn-2 acyl chain in the stationary membrane.

Multi-step reactions like the electroconversion of CO2 to multicarbons (C2+) are especially relevant considering the potential creation of a unique microenvironment as part of the reaction pathway. To elucidate the significance of the microenvironment during CO2 reduction, we develop on-stream substitution of reactant isotope (OSRI), a new method which relies on the subsequent introduction of CO2 isotopes. Combining electrolytic experiments with a numerical model, this method reveals the presence of a reservoir of CO molecules concentrated near the catalyst surface that influences C2+ formation. Application of OSRI on a Cu nanoparticle (NP) ensemble and an electropolished Cu foil demonstrates that a CO monolayer covering the surface does not provide the amount of CO intermediates necessary to facilitate C-C coupling. Specifically, the C2+ turnover increases only after reaching a density of ~100 CO molecules per surface Cu atom. The Cu NP ensemble satisfies this criterion at an overpotential 100 mV lower than the foil, making it a better candidate for efficient C2+ formation. Furthermore, given the same reservoir size, the ensemble\u2019s intrinsically higher C-C coupling ability is highlighted by the 4-fold higher C2+ turnover it achieves at a more positive potential. The OSRI method provides an improved understanding of how the presence of CO intermediates in the microenvironment impacts C2+ formation during the electroreduction of CO2 on Cu surfaces.

The results show that the increasing chemical potential may lead to further reorganization of the adsorbed ions, even though the total interfacial ion population does not change.

Myoglobine, bovine serum albumin, a plant mannosidase, glucose oxidase and the therapeutically relevant antibody trastuzumab were efficiently labelled with a fluorescent probe in a two-step approach combining eY-click and strain-promoted azide-alkyne cyclization (SPAAC). The proteins conserved their structural integrity as observed by circular dichroism and the trastuzumab conjugate showed a similar binding affinity for the natural HER2 ligand as shown by bio-layer interferometry.

In order to test this idea, we use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to simulate the TADF rates of several TADF emitters, while shifting their geometries towards higher TADF rates in a select subspace of internal coordinates. We find that geometric changes in this subspace can increase the TADF rate up to three orders of magnitude with respect to the minimum energy conformation, and the simulated TADF rate can even be brought into the submicrosecond timescales under the right conditions. Furthermore, the TADF rate enhancement can be maintained with a conformational energy that might be within the reach of modern synthetic chemistry.

Since it is expensive to propagate the configuration probabilities of the entire lattice, it is practical to consider the occupation probabilities of a typical site or a cluster of sites instead. This amounts to a moment closure approximation of the chemical master equation (CME). Unfortunately, simple closures, such as the mean-field (MF) and the pair approximation (PA), exhibit weaknesses in systems with significant long-range correlation. In this paper, we show that machine learning (ML) can be used to construct accurate moment closures in chemical kinetics, using the lattice Lotka-Volterra model (LLVM) as a model system. We trained feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) on kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) results at select values of rate constants and initial conditions. Given the same level of input as PA, the machine learning moment closure (MLMC) gave accurate predictions of the instantaneous three-site occupation probabilities. Solving the kinetic equations in conjunction with MLMC gave drastic improvements in the simulated dynamics and descriptions of the dynamical regimes throughout the parameter space. In this way, MLMC is a promising tool to interpolate KMC simulations or construct pre-trained closures that would enable researchers to extract useful insight at a fraction of the computational cost.", "date": "2021-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To date, little is known about the structure, speciation, and dynamic behavior of gibbsite interfaces with NaOH(aq)\u2014particularly as a function of ionic strength. Yet this is critical in order to understand interfacial reactivity, including dissolution mechanisms and rates that underpin industrial Al processing. This work reports equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the \u03b3-Al(OH)3:NaOH(aq) interface, revealing the sorption behavior and speciation of ions from 0.5 \u2013 10 M [NaOH]. As inner-sphere complexes, Na+ primarily coordinates to the side of the gibbsite hexagonal cavities, while OH- accepts hydrogen-bonding from the surface -OH groups. The mobility of inner-sphere Na+ and OH- ions is obviously reduced due to the strong surface affinity. At high [NaOH], ion pairing that is observed in the bulk solution is partially disrupted upon sorption to the gibbsite surface by the individual ion-surface interactions. We anticipate that surface ion-pairing is a key element of the dissolution mechanism and that its modulation (by considering concentration and different ion combinations) may be used to tune gibbsite interfacial chemistry.", "date": "2021-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Therefore, we developed a method called the quantitative estimate of protein-protein interaction targeting drug-likeness (QEPPI), specifically for early-stage screening of PPI-targeting compounds. QEPPI is an extension of the QED method for PPI-targeting drugs and developed using the QED concept, involving modeling physicochemical properties based on the information available on the drug. QEPPI models the physicochemical properties of compounds that have been reported in the literature to act on PPIs.

Rather than traditional atom-typing, our approach builds on the SMIRKS-native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) parameter assignment formalism, which handles increases in the diversity and specificity of the force field definition without needlessly increasing the complexity of the specification. Parameters are optimized with the ForceBalance tool, based on reference quantum chemical data that include torsion potential energy profiles, optimized gas-phase structures, and vibrational frequencies. These quantum reference data are computed and are maintained with QCArchive, an open-source and freely available distributed computing and database software ecosystem. In this initial application of the method, we present essentially a full optimization of all valence parameters and report tests of the resulting force field against compounds and data types outside the training set. These tests show improvements in optimized geometries and conformational energetics and demonstrate that Parsley's accuracy for liquid properties is similar to that of other general force fields, as is accuracy on binding free energies. We find that this initial Parsley force field affords accuracy similar to that of other general force fields when used to calculate relative binding free energies spanning 199 protein-ligand systems. Additionally, the resulting infrastructure allows us to rapidly optimize an entire new force field with minimal human intervention.", "date": "2021-08-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We accomplished this by designing and developing a bispecific aptamer that takes advantage of a high concentration of ATP in the TME.

In this regard, precious metals such as gold operate in various shapes and sizes as effective catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols. In this work, 20 nm-sized gold nanoparticles were synthesized and modified with either 4-carboxybenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (AB) (single salt catalyst) or a mixture of the latter with 3,5-dimethylbenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (AB-DMB, double-salt catalyst). The relative concentrations of the diazonium salts were tuned in order to maintain the electrocatalytic property of the arylated gold nanoparticles in the electro-oxidation of ethanol. The physicochemical properties (size, aryl layer thickness and composition) and electrocatalytic performances of the capped gold nanoparticles (in single and double salt catalyst systems) were investigated by means of TEM, XPS, UV-visible, TGA-DTA and electrochemistry. The aryl capping layer thickness is below 1 nm when the total salt concentration was 5\uf0b410-5 M, without any significant loss of current compared to pure gold nanoparticles. For 1 \u03bcL of pristine or arylated Au NPs, coated on 0.07 cm\u00b2 glassy carbon electrode disk, we achieved a low oxidation potential of 200 mV and high current ethanol oxidation peak intensity levelling off at ~80 \u03bcA for the single diazonium arylation. It is demonstrated that dilution of the carboxylic acid-functionalized diazonium is more important than mixing this compound with 3,5-dimethylbenzene diazonium salt at equal total concentration. The dual arylation strategy returned lower ethanol oxidation intensity likely due to hydrophic effect imparted by the 3,5-dimethylphenyl groups, thus hindring access of ethanol to the nanocatalyst surface.\nThis work demonstrates that arylated gold nanoparticles are unique nanocatalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction, with remarkable performances. This electrocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles was maintained through the use of finely tuned aryl capping layer.

In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with metadynamics to calculate the free energy of dimerization of small aromatic rings comparing three models from popular online servers for atomistic force fields, namely G54a7, CHARMM36 and OPLS. We show that, regardless of the force field, the profiles for the dimerization free energy of these compounds are very similar.

One way to meet these growing demands is to hand over the learning of force fields and their parameters to machines in a systematic (semi-)automatic manner. Doing so, we can take full advantage of exascale computing, the increasing availability of experimental data, and advances in quantum-mechanial computations and the calculation of experimental observables from molecular ensembles. Here, we discuss and illustrate the challenges we face in this endeavor and explore a way forward by adapting the Bayesian inference of ensembles (BioEn) method [Hummer and K\u00f6finger, J. Chem. Phys. (2015)] for force field parameterization. In the Bayesian inference of force fields (BioFF) method developed here, the optimization problem is regularized by a simplified prior on the force field parameters and an entropic prior acting on the ensemble. The latter compensates for the unavoidable over-simplifications in the parameter prior. We determine optimal force field parameters using an iterative predictor-corrector approach, in which we run simula- tions, determine the reference ensemble using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), and optimize the BioFF posterior. We illustrate this approach for a simple polymer model, using the distance between two labeled sites as the experimental observable. By systematically resolving force field issues, the BioFF corrections extend to observables not included in ensemble reweighting. We envision future force field optimization as a formalized, systematic, and (semi-)automatic machine learning effort that incorporates a wide range of data from experiment and high-level quantum chemical calculations and takes advantage of exascale computing resources.", "date": "2021-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

There are already three automated analysis strategies for microplastics based on vibrational spectroscopy: laser direct infrared (LDIR)-based particle analysis, Raman-based particle analysis, and focal plane array-Fourier transform infrared (FPA-FTIR) imaging. We compared the performances of these strategies in terms of their quantification, detection limit, size measurement, and material identification accuracy and analysis speed by analyzing the same standard and environmental samples. Unfortunately, the automated analysis results are not consistent in terms of quantification and material identification. The number of particles smaller than 60 \u03bcm recognized by Raman-based particle analysis is far greater than that recognized by LDIR-based particle analysis. Raman-based particle analysis has a submicrometer detection limit but should not be used in the automated analysis of microplastics in environmental samples because of the strong fluorescence interference. LDIR-based particle analysis provides the fastest analysis speed, but we suggest using a reliable detection limit of approximately 60 \u03bcm and manually cross-check between the material identification results and the reference database used. Misidentification could occur due to the narrow tuning range from 1800 \u2013 975 cm-1 and dispersive artefact distortion of infrared spectra collected in reflection mode.  FPA-FTIR imaging provides relatively reliable quantification and material identification for microplastics in environmental samples greater than 20 \u00b5m but might provide an imprecise description of the particle shapes. Optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy can detect submicron-sized environmental microplastics (0.5-5 \u03bcm) intermingled with a substantial amount of biological matrix; the resulting spectra are searchable in infrared databases without the influence of fluorescence interference, but the process would need to be fully automated.", "date": "2021-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Environmental Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Analytic Mie theory, the modified-long wavelength approximation, and the quasistatic dipole approximation together show that radiative processes dominate plasmon dephasing and damping in small (5\u201325 nm radius) Al, Bi, Ga, In, and Sn spheres. For Al, Ga, In, and Sn, the radiative contribution (~1\u20132 eV) to the plasmon linewidth is more than 100-fold greater than the non-radiative contribution (0.001\u20130.02 eV) derived from the bulk dielectric function. This is significantly different than what is observed for Ag spheres, where non-radiative contributions (~0.1 eV) are the primary source of broadening up to a radius of 25 nm. Overall, these data suggest that the plasmonic properties, dephasing, and lifetimes for Al, Ga, In, and Sn \u2014and to a lesser extent Bi\u2014 spheres are qualitatively similar. To develop a more general understanding of the relationship between plasmon energy and linewidth, we use a model for ideal free-electron Drude metals. It is seen that the linewidth increases at higher energies even for lossless Drude metals, suggesting that the increased broadening observed in UV-active metals is a generalizable observation. These data have important implications for the use of these metals for ultraviolet plasmonics.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the SEI layer on the electroplating of zinc metals in organic and aqueous electrolytes by using electrochemical techniques coupled with electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. First, the electrochemical response of Zn plating in organic or aqueous electrolytes was compared with the ones for Li and Na metal plating by using analogous perchlorate salt dissolved in the same organic solvent.

We show that pHPMA exhibits potent IRI activity in neutral PBS at nanomolar concentrations.

It results from the cooperative effect of hydroxide ions trapped through inorganic precipitation at the cathode and proton flux from water dissociation in a bipolar membrane (BPM; used as a separator). The acidification of the catholyte in the proposed BPM-DSE substantially mitigates cathode passivation, eliminates the requirement of additional processes for treatment of inorganic precipitates dispersed in the catholyte, and reduces the cathode potential (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc50) required for the HER to enable long-term DSE. The BPM in this system plays a critical role in maintaining the electrolyte concentration, suppressing the chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), and maximizing the oxygen evolution reaction.

Nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15) is a promising target due to its importance for SARS-CoV-2\u2019s evasion of the host\u2019s innate immune response.\nMethods: Using the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 NSP15 endoribonuclease, we developed a pharmacophore model of the functional centers in the NSP15 inhibitor\u2019s binding pocket. With this model, we conducted data mining of the conformational database of FDA-approved drugs. The conformations of these compounds underwent 3D fingerprint similarity clustering, and possible conformers were docked to the NSP15 binding pocket. We also simulated docking of random compounds to the NSP15 binding pocket for comparison.\nResults: This search identified 170 compounds as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 NSP15. The mean free energy of docking for the group of potential inhibitors were significantly lower than for the group of random compounds. Twenty-one of the compounds identified as potential NSP15 inhibitors were antiviral compounds used in the inhibition of a range of viruses, including MERS, SARS-CoV, and even SARS-CoV-2. Eight of the selected antiviral compounds in cluster A are pyrimidine analogues, six of which are currently used in a clinical setting. Four tyrosine kinase inhibitors were identified with potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, which is consistent with previous studies showing some kinase inhibitors acting as antiviral drugs.\nConclusions: We recommended testing of these 21 selected antiviral compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.\n", "date": "2021-08-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the convalescent plasma treatment, nanobody, and designer peptides, which recognizes epitopes that overlap with hACE2 binding sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein (S/RBD) and thereby blocking the infection has been the center stage of therapeutic research.

The polymeric catalysts were conveniently recy-cled and reused multiple times for gram scale functionalizations with catalytic loading as low as 0.1 mol%, and their performance was often found to be superior to the performance of their monomeric variants.  These regioselective CPA-catalyzed acetalizations were successfully combined with common hydroxyl group functionalizations as single-pot telescoped procedures to produce 34 regioisomerically pure differentially protected mono- and disaccharide de-rivatives. To further demonstrate the utility of the polymeric catalysts, the same batch of (R)-Ad-TRIP-PS catalyst was recycled and reused to accomplish single-pot gram-scale syntheses of 6 differentially protected D-glucose derivatives.

Recently, a few alkaloids from a traditional Indian medicinal plant, Vasaka (Justicia adhatoda), have been linked computationally to the main protease (Mpro) of SARS_CoV_2. To expand the knowledge and for further investigation, we have selected 41 quinazoline alkaloids from two natural product databases to create an adequate library and performed detailed computational studies against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS_CoV_2. The screening of the library was carried out through blending the rigid docking and pharmacokinetic analysis that resulted in nine alkaloids as initial leads against Mpro. These nine alkaloids were further subjected to advance flexible docking using first reference famotidine for the analysis of structure-based interactions. For further selection, a second screening was carried out based on binding energies and interaction profiles that yielded three alkaloids namely CNP0416047, 3-hydroxy anisotine and anisotine as hits. The stereo-electronic features of hit alkaloids were further investigated through additional structure-based E-pharmacophore mapping against a second reference, known X77 ligand. Additionally, the reactivity of hit alkaloids at the binding site of the protein was estimated by measuring the electron distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals and HOMO-LUMO band energies.  Finally, the stabilities of complexes between hit alkaloids with the protein were accessed extensively using robust molecular dynamics simulation through RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and MM-PBSA calculation. Thus, this study identifies three natural quinazoline alkaloids as potential inhibitors of MPro through extensive computational analysis.", "date": "2021-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The differing activities of the Bi cation lone pairs in Bi2S3, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 lead to competition between orthorhombic Pnma and rhombohedral R-3m phases, with the latter favored by heavier chalcogen atoms, while the reported non-ambient phases of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 show phonon instabilities under ambient conditions. The Pnma structure has weaker chemical bonding and stronger phonon anharmonicity than the R-3m phase, resulting in an intrinsically lower lattice thermal conductivity. A thermodynamic model of Bi2[Se(1-x)S(x)]3 indicates that the R-3m structure is energetically favored only for low S content, but the stability window can potentially be extended at lower formation temperatures. Bi2[Se(1-x)Te(x)]3 in the R-3m phase shows substantial deviation from ideal solid-solution behavior, due to a strong energetic preference for the Se and Te atoms to occupy the interior and exterior sites, respectively, in the constituent quintuple layers. Strain-field fluctuations induced by inhomogeneities in the chemical bonding are shown to play a significant role in determining the heat transport in the alloy systems, and chalcogen disorder away from the preferred symmetric structure is found to be an important factor in the reduced thermal conductivity of Bi2SeTe2 compared to the Bi2Te3 endpoint.

However, how lateral-chain thiophene fluorination affects the morphology and hole mobility (\u03bc_h) of SM donors has not been well understood. In the present work, we systematically study the effects of the positions and numbers of fluorinations on the morphology and \u03bc_h of a promising SM donor named DRTB-T (referred as 0F) with multiple fluorinations via multiscale simulations.

The trend of \u03bc_hs in these fluorinated molecules is consistent with that of the proportions of face-on configurations, and matches well with available experimental results. We find that functionalizing the lateral-chain thiophenes of side BDT-Ts (1F-side) or all BDT-Ts (1F-all) with only one F atom are efficient to fine-tune the morphologies and \u03bc_h of DRTB-T based SM donors simultaneously.

However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430-450 nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting. Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450 nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high-temperature (900 \u00b0C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine-derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de-ammonification leads to the formation of azo-groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible-light (470 nm) for H2 evolution even without any additional co-catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge-trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.

In this work, we study amorphous TIPS-Pn NP dispersions prepared by the re-precipitation method over a range of particle sizes. Time-resolved fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy show that exciton dynamics in these systems depend significantly upon particle size. Kinetic analysis reveals that SF becomes slower at smaller NP sizes, while triplet exciton decay (through both correlated triplet pair relaxation and geminate triplet-triplet annihilation) accelerates. These significant size-dependent effects are ascribed to increased morphological disorder within smaller NPs, weakening the intermolecular couplings which control SF and triplet migration. A non-radiative singlet quenching channel separate from SF is also identified, which has not been previously reported for NPs of SF-capable chromophores. This non-radiative singlet decay becomes a significant relaxation pathway at small particle sizes, substantially reducing SF yields. Interestingly, exciton kinetics in 81-nm NPs approach those of bulk amorphous TIPS-Pn, suggesting that NPs of this size or larger are likely good models for bulk TIPS-Pn. This work demonstrates that particle-size effects are significant for small NPs of SF chromophores, and must be accounted for in order to accurately model bulk materials with such NP dispersions.", "date": "2021-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Chemical Kinetics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The latter roughly corresponds to an energy gap of 0.1 eV, which is comparable with typical errors in calculations of the excitation energy by conventional quantum chemistry methods. In this work, we demonstrate a strong quantitative correlation between DMV values, obtained computationally with modest efforts, and excitation energies \u0394Eex at the experimental excitation band maxima for a series of RFPs with the bands between 570 and 605 nm. Protein models are constructed by motifs of the relevant crystal structures, and atomic coordinates are optimized in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations with QM-subsystems composed of large chromophore-containing regions.

Paints and coatings are an important class of VCPs that emit both volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (VOCs and IVOCs). In this study, we directly measured I/VOC emissions from representative water-based (latex) and oil paints used in the U.S. Paint I/VOC emissions vary over several orders of magnitude by both solvent and gloss level. Oil paint had the highest emissions (>10^5 microgram/g-paint) whereas low-gloss interior paints (Flat, Satin, and Semigloss) all emitted ~10^2 microgram/g-paint. Emissions from interior paints are dominated by VOCs, whereas exterior-use paints emitted a larger fraction of IVOCs. Extended emissions tests showed that most I/VOC emissions occur within 12-24 hours after paint application, though some IVOC-dominated paints continue to emit for 48 hours or more. We used the emissions measurements to estimate paint I/VOC emissions and subsequent SOA production in the U.S. Total annual paint I/VOC emissions are 168 +/- 15 Mg. This amounts to 291 g/kg of paint used and 0.51 kg/person, which are significantly larger than comparable emissions factors from combustion systems. These emissions contribute to the formation of 8 Mg of SOA annually.

Dean; Benjamin J. Morgan", "abstract": "Aliovalent doping of solid electrolytes with the intention of increase the concentration of charge carrying mobile defects is a common strategy for enhancing their ionic conductivities. For the antiperovskite lithium-ion solid electrolyte Li3OCl, both supervalent (donor) and subvalent (acceptor) doping schemes have previously been proposed. The effectiveness of these doping schemes depends on two conditions: first, that aliovalent doping promotes the formation of mobile lithium vacancies or interstitials rather than competing immobile defects; and second, that any increase in lithium defect concentration gives a corresponding increase in ionic conductivity. To evaluate the effectiveness of aliovalent doping in Li3OCl, we have performed a hybrid density-functional theory study of the defect chemistry of Li3OCl and the response to supervalent and subvalent doping. In nominally stoichiometric Li3OCl the dominant native defects are predicted to be VLi, OCl, and VCl. Supervalent doping increases VLi and OCl concentrations, with the preferentially formed defect species dependent on synthesis conditions. Subvalent doping increases the concentration of VCl more than the concentration of Lii under all accessible synthesis conditions. While supervalent doping is predicted to be effective at increasing ionic conductivity, particularly under Li-poor synthesis conditions, subvalent doping is predicted to decrease room-temperature ionic conductivities at low-to-moderate doping levels. This effect is due to a reduction in the number of lithium vacancies formed during synthesis, and increased [VLi + Lii] Frenkel-pair recombination upon cooling to room temperature. The strongly asymmetric doping response of Li3OCl with respect to supervalent versus subvalent doping is explained as a consequence of the low [VLi + VCl] Schottky pair formation energy, suggesting analogous behaviour should be expected in other Schottky-disordered solid electrolytes.", "date": "2021-08-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The interaction strength varies as a function of Pb-oxo interaction distance and angle with energy values ranging from ranging from 0.47 kcal/mol in the longer contacts to 21.94 kcal/mol in the shorter contacts. Uranyl units with stronger interactions display an asymmetric bond weakening and a loss of covalent character in the U=O bonds interacting closely with the Pb2+ ion. Luminescence quenching is observed in cases where strong Pb-oxo interactions are present, and is accompanied by significant red-shifting of the uranyl symmetric Raman stretch. Changes to inner sphere uranyl bonding manifest as a weakening of the U=O bond as a result of interaction with the Pb2+ ion.

No polymer degradation or crosslinking nor changes in crystallinity occur under the mild conditions of the process and the modification is fully reversible, which offers a significant opportunity for the reconstitution of the interfaces back to the native states, chemically and structurally. Consequently, access to 3D structuring of native elementary cellulose fibrils is made possible with the same supramolecular features as the bio-synthesized fibers, which is required to unlock the full potential of cellulose as a sustainable building block.", "date": "2021-08-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In addition, in the framework of TD-DMRG, we further develop an algorithm to calculate the final-state-resolved rate coefficient which is very useful to analyze the contribution from each vibrational mode to the transition process. We use this method to study the internal conversion (IC) process of azulene after taking into account the anharmonicity of the ground state PES. The results show that even for this semi-rigid molecule the intramode anharmonicity enhances the IC rate significantly, and after considering the two-mode coupling effect, the rate increases even further. The reason is that the anharmonicity enables the C-H vibrations to receive electronic energy while C-H vibrations do not contribute on the harmonic PES as the Huang-Rhys factor is close to 0.\n", "date": "2021-08-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The optical spectra of the ensembles are then produced by calculating vertical transitions using TDDFT with implicit solvation. To obtain the final spectral shapes, the stick spectra from TDDFT are convoluted with Gaussian kernels where the half-widths are determined by a statistically motivated strategy.

Vibronic progressions and broadenings due to the finite lifetime of the excited states are not included into the methodology yet. \nNuclear quantization affects the relative peak intensities and widths, which is necessary to reproduce the experimental spectrum. We have also found that using only the optimized geometry of each molecule works surprisingly well if a proper empirical broadening factor is applied. This is explained by the rigidity of the conjugated chromophore moieties of the selected molecules which are mainly responsible for the excitations in the spectra.

Both the synthesis of the material through exfoliation, and its various applications almost inevitably require its solvation. Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are extremely useful solvents for these types of applications due to their non-volatility, inflammability, biocompatibility, and reasonable cost. There are many different deep eutectic solvents available, and their suitability for any given application is particularly dependent on the specific of their structure. DES have been examined computationally for use with boron nitride, but these calculations use idealized, perfect boron nitride sheets instead of the more realistic, defect-containing systems. In this report, we investigated four DESs with two experimentally observed defective boron nitride, one with a single boron vacancy, the other with a single nitrogen vacancy. All DESs bound with higher affinity to the defective boron nitride than to the pristine surface. Charge transfer was minimal in all cases although the surfaces tended to donate electron density to the solvents. The interactions between the solvents and the surfaces are primarily non-covalent although in several cases natural bond order analysis indicates a partial covalent interaction that helps explain the higher-than-expected affinity for particular DES. The DESs have little effect on the predicted optical behaviour of the pristine boron nitride but do significantly change the adsorption spectrum of the defective boron nitride nanoflakes; the effect on bulk material might be limited. Together these results suggest that the choice of DES can either be made to limit any effect on the properties of the material (urea-choline chloride) or to affect the optical and electronic nature of the material (benzoic acid-choline chloride).

Yet, even in relatively small molecules, the spectra may gain complexity, hindering the analysis. To address this problem, we investigate an example biomolecule characterized with a complex J-coupling network -- urea, a key metabolite in protein catabolism -- and demonstrate ways of simplifying its zero-field spectra by modifying spin topology. This goal is achieved by controlling pH-dependent chemical-exchange rates of 1H nuclei and varying the composition of the D2O/H2O mixture used as a solvent. Specifically, we demonstrate that by increasing hydrogen chemical-exchange rate in [13C, 15N2]-urea solution, the molecule, being an effective spin system XAB2A'B'2, behaves as a much simpler XA2 system (where X = 13C, A = 15N, B = 1H), manifesting through a single narrow spectral peak. Additionally, we show that introducing spin-1 nuclei into the molecule and investigating J-spectra of 1H/D isotopologues of [15N2]-urea allows to study various isolated spin subsystems: XA2, (XA)B, and XB2 (here X = 15N, A = 1H, B = D), again greatly simplifying spectra analysis. The influence of the chemical exchange process on zero-field $J$-spectra for each urea solution is elucidated by theoretical studies, demonstrating solid agreement between results and simulations.

The key aryl ring on the ligand skeleton, namely Ring A, acts as a \u03c0-donor and stabilizes the palladium center of the transition state, as shown by Extended Transition State Natural Orbital of Chemical Valance (ETS-NOCV) analysis, and thus an electron-rich Ring A is expected to lower the barrier.

These effects originate from through-space interaction with the nitro group in the resting state, and the overall effect is that any polarizable or partly negative group nearby the ortho- or meta\u00ac- site of Ring A is harmful for the reaction. Based on these discoveries, we proposed a list of guidelines for successful ligand development, and designed several new ligands.

Here, we present evidence that a simple model invoking a modest amount of charge delocalization, a sum over the available microstates, and the Marcus rate constant for electron transfer can explain many seemingly contradictory phenomena reported in the literature. We use an electron-accepting fullerene host matrix dilutely sensitized with a series of electron donor molecules to test this hypothesis. The donor series enables us to tune the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer over a range of 0.7 eV, mapping out normal, optimal, and inverted regimes for free-charge generation efficiency, as measured by time-resolved microwave conductivity. However, the photoluminescence of the donor is rapidly quenched as the driving force increases, with no evidence for inverted behavior, nor the linear relationship between photoluminescence quenching and charge-generation efficiency one would expect in the absence of additional competing loss pathways. This behavior is self-consistently explained by competitive formation of bound charge-transfer states and long-range or delocalized free-charge states, where both rate constants are described by the Marcus rate equation. Moreover, the model predicts a suppression of the inverted regime for high-concentration blends and efficient ultrafast free-charge generation, providing a mechanistic explanation for why Marcus-inverted-behavior is rarely observed in device studies.", "date": "2021-08-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Photovoltaics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To assess the suitability of acylhydrazones as a new functional group for the preparation of anion transporters, we have studied a family of thioureas functionalized with these and related functional groups. 1H NMR titrations and DFT calculations indicate that the thioureas bearing acylhydrazone groups behave as chloride receptors with two separate binding sites, of which the acylhydrazone binds weaker than the thiourea. Chloride transport studies show that the additional binding site has a detrimental effect on thiourea-based transporters, and this phenomenon is also observed for bis(thio)ureas with two separate binding sites. We propose that the presence of a second anion binding unit hinders the transport activity of the thiourea due to additional interactions with the phospholipids of the membrane. In agreement with this hypothesis, extensive molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the molecules will tend to be positioned in the water/lipid interface, driven by the interaction of the NHs of the thiourea and of the acylhydrazone groups with the POPC polar head groups and water molecules. Moreover, the interaction energies show that the poorest transporters have indeed the strongest interactions with the membrane phospholipids, inhibiting chloride transport. This detrimental effect of additional functional groups on transport activity should be considered when designing new ion transporters, unless these groups cooperatively promote anion recognition and transmembrane transport.", "date": "2021-08-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A non-oxidizing reactant is required in plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) of thin films of metals to avoid O-contamination. PE-ALD of Co has been demonstrated experimentally with plasma sources of NH3 or a mixture of N2 and H2, but the growth mechanism and key reactions are not clear. In this paper, we have investigated the reactions of plasma generated radicals H, N, NH and NH2 at metal precursor (CoCp2) terminated Co (001) and (100) surfaces using static DFT calculations at 0 K and molecular dynamics simulations at 600 K. N radicals play an important role in eliminating surface-bound Cp ligand (if any) via pyridine (C5H5N) formation and desorption, whereas H radicals have endothermic reactions for eliminating Cp ligand via CpH formation and desorption. The surface NHx species are eliminated by H radicals via NH3 formation and desorption. The simulations of these key reactions show that on Co(001) surface, the remaining Cp ligand and surface NHx species after the metal precursor pulse will be completely removed with N and H radicals, resulting in Co atoms deposited on Co(001) surface at a coverage of 3.03Co/nm2. Whereas, on Co(100) surface, the surface NH2 species cannot be completely removed via NH3 formation and desorption due to overall endothermic reactions. Instead, H radicals react with trench N species, contributed to H transfer at metal precursor pulse, to form NH. These trench N species cannot be eliminated completely on Co(100) surface, which will be the source of N impurities for the deposited Co thin films. At the post-plasma stage, the metal surface will be covered with NHx-terminations with plasma generated NH radicals, which is then ready for the next deposition cycle. Our results explain why ammonia or H2/N2 plasma, which produce NHx species are required to deposit Co thin films using Co metallocene precursors.

National Biofuel Policy, 2009 focused on production of biodiesel from non-edible oil seeds. We assessed the sustainability of biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas, using the life cycle assessment approach. India specific inventory data for biodiesel production was collected by extensive literature review. GaBi software was used to model the life cycle of biodiesel. The environmental impacts are compared for different blends of biodiesel with reference to diesel in four impact categories: Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential, and Human Toxicity Potential. Using the biodiesel may reduce the global warming potential by 64.6% as compared to fossil diesel; while eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and human toxicity potential impacts may increase by 61.3%, 36.5%, and 52.5% respectively. A trade-off between impact categories is seen for biodiesel. Sensitivity analysis was done to identify most sensitive parameters in biodiesel life cycle. Use of electricity, life cycle span of Jatropha, seed yield, methanol, urea fertilizer, NOx emission factor, and steam are found to be highly sensitive in biodiesel life cycle. Scenario analysis was done to analyse the effect of change in seed yield, life span, and emission intensity of Indian electricity grid. Even low yield of Jatropha provides reduction in global warming potential (~27.7%) but in other impact categories significant increase is expected.

Here, we examine trivalent metal carbides with varying degrees of electronegativity and experimentally synthesize a 2D electride, Sc2C, containing the most electronegative metal yet found neighboring the electride site. Further, we find that higher electronegativity of the cation drives greater hybridization between metal and electride orbitals.

To achieve control over deactivation, we developed a new CRN that enables reversible formation of positive charges on a tertiary amine substrate, which are removed using nucleophilic signals that control the deactivation kinetics. Incorporation of the CRN in a polymer material leads to a temporally programmed transition from collapsed and hydrophobic to solvated, hydrophilic polymer chains by controlling polymer-solvent interactions.

To mimic the mounting importance of intermittent operations of power plants we performed a stress test in which we measured the amine emissions from a pilot plant that has been in operation using a mixture of amines (CESAR1) in a slipstream from a coal-fired power plant. Understanding how changes in the operation far from the steady-state of the plant affect the emissions is key to designing emission mitigation strategies. However, conventional process modelling techniques struggle to capture the full dynamic, multivariate, and non-linear nature of this data. In this work, we report how a data-intensive approach can be used to learn the mapping between process and emissions from data. The resulting model can forecast the emissions, can be used to analyse the data and also perform in silico stress tests. By doing so, we reveal that emission mitigation strategies that work well for single component solvents (e.g. monoethanolamine) need to be revised for a mixture of solvents such as CESAR1. We expect that the combination of large amounts of data with flexible learning algorithms will impact the way we design and operate industrial processes, as we can now harvest information at conditions where conventional approaches fail.", "date": "2021-08-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Environmental Science; Machine Learning; Process Control", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here we use optical absorbance to study the kinetics of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) degradation in response to combinations of moisture, oxygen, and illumination over a range of temperatures. We identify two primary reaction pathways that dominate MAPbI3 material degradation in these mixed environmental conditions: (1) dry photooxidation (DPO) due to the combined role of oxygen and photoexcited electrons (with a rate of 2 x 10-9 mol/m2\u2219s in dry air at 25 C and an effective activation energy of 0.62 eV), and (2) a water-accelerated photooxidation (WPO) process due to the combined role of water, oxygen, and photoexcited electrons (with a rate of 1 x 10-7 mol/m2s in 50% RH air at 25 C and observed effective activation energy of 0.07 eV). Commonly reported humidity-only, blue light, and thermal degradation pathways are demonstrated to have rates that are respectively 100, 1000, and >1000 times slower than predominant photooxidation processes in ambient conditions. Extracting kinetic rate constants from the dynamics of the initial degradation, we calculate that in dry air, photooxidation rate of MAPbI3 follows a f(x)\u221dx/(1+Kx) relationship with respect to oxygen in the vapor phase (PO2) and excess concentration of photoexcited electrons (n). In humid air, photooxidation of MAPbI3 exhibits first order kinetics with respect to the partial pressure of water in the vapor phase (PH2O). However, with respect to PO2 and n, kinetics follow a f(x)\u221dx/(1+kx)^2 relationship with respect to rate. We then identify a plausible reaction mechanism for degradation of MAPbI3 material that is consistent with these rate functionalities. The rate determining step for both DPO and WPO is proton abstraction by photogenerated superoxide radicals. However, proton donation by adsorbed water proceeds much more rapidly than donation by methylammonium, resulting in faster degradation rates for WPO at typical ambient conditions (~50% RH). Rate laws derived from this mechanism were fit to the entire dataset to extract rate constants for DPO and WPO processes. Accurate predictions of material degradation rates, with narrow confidence intervals of fit parameters as identified by the Bootstrap algorithm, provide the first experimental estimates of the equilibrium constants of oxygen adsorption on MAPbI3 (Keq \u2248 3 x 10-3 kPa-1) and superoxide generation from adsorbed oxygen and photoexcited electrons in MAPbI3 (Keq \u2248 5 x 10-15 (photons/m2\u2219s)-0.7). Given that water has been reported as a degradation product of DPO, the results reported here highlight the need for the development of encapsulation schemes that rigorously block oxygen, as over longer time periods, product water (if generated) may accumulate inside the packaging and initiate the much faster WPO process.", "date": "2021-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here, we report a long-lived charge-transfer triplet excited state in a well solubilized, chlorinated graphene nanoribbon (Cl-GNR) with edges modified by bipyrimidine (bpm) moieties. The photophysical behavior of Cl-GNR was observed and characterized by steady-state UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy on the ps-ms timescale, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both the Cl-GNR and its monomeric subunit, chlorinated graphene quantum dot (Cl-GQD), were synthesized using bottom-up techniques to produce the H- analogs of the compounds followed by edge-chlorination to achieve soluble products. The absorption spectra of Cl-GQD and Cl-GNR appear in the UV-vis range with lowest-energy peaks at 375 and 600 nm, respectively. The excitons in Cl-GNR were found to exhibit charge-transfer character with the bpm edges serving as electron acceptors. DFT calculations indicate that the excitons are relatively localized, spreading over at most two monomeric units of the GNR. Transient absorption spectroscopy shows that singlet excited states of Cl-GQD and Cl-GNR undergo intersystem crossing with ~300 ps lifetime to form triplet state that lasts for 15.7 \u03bcs (Cl-GQD) and 106 \u03bcs (Cl-GNR).

Herein, we report a detailed study of the adsorption properties and the bonding mechanism of pyrrole, furan, and thiophene on Fe(110) surface employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In the most stable adsorption geometries, we found that the adsorbates lie flat at the hollow site and form chemical bondings with four Fe atoms on Fe(110) surface. The chemisorptions are indicated by large adsorption energies and charge transfers from the surface to the adsorbates. We also found that taking into account vdW corrections in the DFT calculations has a minimal effect on the adsorption geometries whereas it significantly increases the adsorption energies. The energetic and structural analysis reveals large molecular distortions induced by the adsorbate-surface interactions, and among the adsorbates, thiophene experiences the least molecular distortion, thereby having the largest adsorption energy. The electronic structure analysis also reveals that the nature of electronic interaction of pyrrole, furan, and thiophene with Fe(110) surface is due to the strong overlaps of the frontier \uf070 and \uf070* orbitals of the adsorbates with Fe-3dz2 and Fe-(3dxz+3dyz) states of the surface.

Our results suggest that 3\u2032-amino-TNA may have been present on the early earth. Formation of the amino-sugar moiety by 3-component coupling of glycolaldehyde 1, 2-aminooxazole 3 and an aminonitrile 6 regiospecifically positions both the 3\u2032-amine and glycosidic bond. Phosphate provides an unexpected resolution of the two diastereomers formed, leading to purification of the genetically relevant threo-isomer. Under phosphate catalysis, the inhibitory erythro-isomer rearranges to an unreactive guanidinium salt, whilst the Watson-Crick base paring threo-isomer co-crystalises with phosphate, leading to its spontaneous purification and accumulation. Nucleobase construction on the amino-sugar scaffold is observed upon reaction with cyanoacetylene 8, and subsequent thiolysis and photochemical anomerisation sets up the ideal stereochemistry for Watson-Crick base pairing. The resulting 3\u2032-amino-TNA can be phosphorylated directly in water, under mild conditions with cyclic trimetaphosphate (PO3Na)3, forming a nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) in a manner not feasible for canonical nucleosides.

Indeed, the time needed for water molecules to equilibrate between bulk solvent and the binding site can be well beyond what is practical with standard MD, which typically ranges to hundreds of nanoseconds to low microseconds. We recently introduced a hybrid Monte Carlo/MD (MC/MD) method, which speeds up the equilibration of water between buried cavities and the surrounding solvent, while sampling from the thermodynamically correct distribution of states. While the initial implementation of the MC functionality led to considerable slowing of the overall simulations, here we address this problem with a parallel MC algorithm implemented on graphical processing units (GPUs).

As such, the multiscale reactive molecular dynamics method provides one promising alternative for simulating complex chemical systems at atomistic detail on a reactive\npotential energy surface. However, the parameterization of such models is a key barrier to their applicability and success. In this work, we present reactive MD models derived from constrained density functional theory that are both accurate and transferable.

Miller IV; Laurel Bobka", "abstract": "As the challenges faced by drug chemists continue to persist due to the presence of synthetic opioids, novel psychoactive substances, and other emerging drugs, laboratories are continuing to look for new analytical approaches or techniques to ease the burdens. These new solutions can range from simple changes in existing methods to better distinguish isomers to adoption and implementation of entirely new technologies for screening or confirmation. One barrier to making these transitions is lack of data to understand how, or even if, workflow changes will address the challenges. In this study, we attempt to compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, an existing analytical workflow for seized drug analysis to a new, experimental workflow to better understand the potential benefits and drawbacks. Using adjudicated and mock case samples containing synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, and opioids, four forensic chemists were asked to analyze fifty samples using one of two workflows. The first was an existing workflow that employed color tests for screening alongside general purpose gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and general purpose gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses for confirmation. The second was an experimental workflow that combined direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) for screening with class-specific (targeted) GC-MS methods for confirmation. At each step in the analysis scheme, chemists recorded the time required and as well as their interpretation of the results. Comparison of the workflows showed that screening by DART-MS required the same amount of time as color tests but yielded significantly more accurate, and specific, information. Confirmation using the general purpose GC-FID and GC-MS methods of the existing workflow required more than twice the amount of instrument time and data interpretation time while also presenting other analytical challenges that prevented compound confirmation in select samples. Use of targeted GC-MS methods simplified data interpretation, reduced consumption of reference materials, and addressed almost all the limitations of general purpose methods. While the experimental workflow is not yet validated for casework, this study shows how rethinking analytical workflows for seized drug analysis could greatly assist laboratories in reducing turnaround times, backlogs, and standards consumption. It also demonstrates the potential impact of being able to investigate workflow changes prior to implementation.", "date": "2021-08-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Preliminary testing in LiFePO4 full cells, showed promising performance of the PEO nanocomposite electrolytes.

We first present the synthesis of n-hexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-tetradecyl, n-octadecyl, and oleyl phosphinic acid. These compounds are suitable surfactants during high-temperature nanocrystal synthesis (240-300\u00b0C). In contrast to phosphonic acids, they do not form poly anhydride gels. Consequently, CdSe quantum dots synthesized with octadecylphosphinic acid are conveniently purified, and are free from background scattering in UV-Vis. The CdSe nanocrystals have a very low polydispersity and a photoluminescence quantum yield up to 18%, without additional shell. Furthermore, we could synthesize CdSe and CdS nanorods using phosphinic acid ligands and found a remarkable purity (i.e. without tetrapod impurities). We conclude that the reactivity towards TOP-S and TOP-Se precursors decreases in the series: cadmium carboxylate > cadmium phosphinate > cadmium phosphonate.

The assembly of these coacervate protocells can be regulated by redox chemistry and they act as oxidizing hubs for sequestered metabolites, such as NAD(P)H, and fiber precursors. Interestingly, we show that the oxidizing potential of ferricyanide inside coacervates can be harnessed to drive the selective formation of amide bonds between prebiotically relevant amino thioacids and amino acids or peptides. We demonstrate that aminoacylation is enhanced in Fe(CN)_6^{3\u2212}/peptide coacervate dispersions compared to the surrounding dilute phase, and selective for amino acids that interact less strongly with the coacervates. We finally use this amide bond formation to create self-reinforcing coacervates by reacting hydrophobic amino thioacids to amines on the protocell scaffold and show that this significantly enhances their salt resistance.

In contrast with an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, little is known about neutralizing antibodies binding mechanisms of N-terminal domain (NTD), let alone the effect of NTD mutation on antibody binding and risk of immune evasion. Employing various computational approaches in this study, we investigated critical residues for NTD-antibody bindings and their detailed mechanism. The results showed that some residues on NTD including Y144, K147, R246 and Y248 are critically involved in the direct interaction of NTD with many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), indicating that the viruses harboring these residue mutations may have high risk of immune evasion. Binding free energy calculations and the interaction mechanism study revealed that R246I, which is present in Beta (B.1.351) variant, may decrease or even abrogate the efficacies of many antibodies.

The reactivity of iminoxyl radicals with Tyr was dependent on the steric and electronic demands of oximes; isopropyl methyl piperidinium oxime 1f formed stable adducts, whereas the reaction of tert-butyl methyl piperidinium oxime 1o was reversible. The difference in reversibility between 1f and 1o, differentiated only by one methyl group, is due to the stability of iminoxyl radicals, which is partly dictated by the bond dissociation energy of oxime O\u2012H groups.

Understanding this process at a fundamental level can potentially unlock routes to the development of new therapeutics, as well as novel materials for other applications. This requires a microscopic picture of the behaviour of amyloidogenic proteins on metal surfaces. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the adsorption of the model amyloidogenic peptide, A\ud835\udefd(16-22), on different gold and silver surfaces. While the peptide adsorbs onto these different surfaces, the adsorption can be considered to be enthalphically driven for the gold surfaces and entropically driven for silver. The conformation of the peptide on gold surfaces also shows a strong facet dependence for gold, with fibril-like conformations being promoted in the 100 surface and inhibited on the 111 surface. A smaller degree of facet dependence is seen for silver with the peptide behaving similar on both of these. The difference in the facet dependence can be related to the difference between direct adsorption onto the gold 111 surface, with a preference towards indirect (water mediated) adsorption onto the other surfaces. This new information on the behaviour of an amyloidogenic peptide on metal surfaces can give insight into the size-dependent effect of nanoparticles on fibril formation and the use of surfaces to control fibrillation.", "date": "2021-08-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Instead, their simultaneous evaluation allows to map the important contributions, and we provide examples of their combinations for which interfacial reactions can be either favoured or disfavoured. By taking a N2 and a CO2 reduction pathway as test cases, we show that explicitly considering hydrophobic effects is important for the selectivity and rate of these relevant interfacial processes.", "date": "2021-08-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, if the sol-gel transition occurs in the physiologically relevant range (0-40 \u00b0C), there are many possible applications in areas such as drug delivery and biofabrication. Here, we describe a new mechanism of a thermally induced order-order transition in polymer self-assembly of an ABA triblock consisting of hydrophilic A blocks and a hydrophobic aromatic B block. Small-angle X-ray scattering confirmed worm-to-sphere transition upon heating on the nanoscale level while wide-angle X-ray scattering indicated a more uniform ordering of the macromolecular chains on the scale of 4-7 \u00c5. NMR spectroscopy showed reduced mobility of various polymer segments in the hydrogel state, especially in the hydrophobic aromatic region. More importantly however, solution and solid-state NMR investigations also revealed close proximity of hydrophobic and hydrophilic repeat units in the gel state, which is less pronounced in the sol state. This interaction between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic block is responsible for the order-order transition and \u2013ipso facto\u2013 inverse thermogelation. This unusual interaction is supported in silico by molecular dynamics modeling. Changes in the structure of the hydrophilic A blocks can be used to tune the gel strength, persistence, and gelation kinetics.

In this method, a waxy Parafilm sheet is placed on the back of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp containing microscale surface features; when heated above the melting temperature, the paraffin liquefies and diffuses into the stamp, which functions as a paraffin reservoir. The directional diffusion of the paraffin allows only a thin layer of liquid to be present at the micropatterned stamp surface. Hence, when it is put into contact with a target surface, it transfers a paraffin pattern with submicron lateral resolution and sub-100 nm thickness. By using XPS analysis to track paraffin diffusion process within the PDMS stamp, the diffusion coefficient in PDMS is estimated to be 5.3 x 10-11 m2/s at 65\u00b0C. In addition to improved patterning, the paraffin-saturated PDMS stamp removes the need for re-inking for consecutive patterning.

This work aims to qualitatively and quantitively identify what, if any, effect the analysis of drug evidence has on the drug residue levels on the exterior of the evidence packaging. Using wipe collection techniques, samples from the exterior of drug evidence packaging were taken prior to opening cases and after repackaging to measure changes in residue composition and mass. A total of 64 submissions were analyzed, and an increase in drug residue mass was observed 85.5 % of the time. After analysis and repackaging, 95 % of packages had detectable drug residue on their exterior even though some of the cases were repackaged into new bags. Drug residue masses on the exterior of drug packaging were found to be as high as tens of micrograms. The presence of drug residue on the exterior of drug evidence packaging is expected given the collection and analysis procedures, therefore potential ways to minimize these levels are currently being studied. The presence of these residues is an important factor to consider when developing protocols for the entire evidence handling process and its impact on personnel \u2013 from evidence handling technicians to crime scene technicians to submitting officers.

While recent advances in the development of redox-active bipolar organic molecules satisfy the prerequisites for the pioneering Symmetrical all-Organic Redox Flow Batteries (SORFBs) emerging, problems of low durability or low energy density remain a bottleneck for their wide-spread application. The present work reports that nitration of the [4]helicenium ion core (DMQA+) result in a significant enhancement of the electrochemical performance of DMQA as electrolyte for SORFBs. The physical and kinetic properties of NO2C+ were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV-visible spectroscopy in acetonitrile and compared to those of its precursor HC+. The electrons storage ability of NO2C+ was investigated in three differents type of static H-cell experiments. In the first experiment, NO2C+ provided an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 2.24 V and demonstrated good stability, as well as high coulombic (>98%) efficiencies, over more than 200 charge/discharge cycles. In the second experiment, a charge-discharge cycling over the entire redox window of NO2C+ (OCV > 3 V) resulted in 80 cycles at a potential energy density above 12 Wh/L. During the last epxeriment, a bipolarization stress-test was performed during which NO2C+ demonstrated a remarkable durability of 90 cycles at 100% load with a perfect retention of capacity and coulombic efficiency.

Here, we describe a new pathway for SQ degradation that involves oxidative desulfurization to release sulfite and enable utilization of the entire carbon skeleton of the sugar to support the growth of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. SQ or its glycoside sulfoquinovosyl glycerol (SQGro) are imported into the cell by an ABC transporter system with an associated SQ binding protein. A sulfoquinovosidase hydrolyses the SQ glycoside and the liberated SQ is acted on by a flavin mononucleotide-dependent sulfoquinovose monooxygenase, in concert with an NADH-dependent flavin reductase, to release sulfite and 6-oxo-glucose. An NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase reduces the 6-oxo-glucose to glucose, enabling entry into primary metabolic pathways. Structural and biochemical studies provide detailed insights into the recognition of key metabolites by proteins in this pathway. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that the sulfoquinovose monooxygenase (smo) pathway is distributed across Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria and is especially prevalent within the Rhizobiales order. This strategy for SQ catabolism is distinct from previously described pathways as it enables the complete utilization of all carbons within SQ by a single organism with concomitant production of inorganic sulfite.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Biology; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The results show that the trend in the near-surface vacancy formation energies for comparable vacancy spacings, i.e. (110) < (100) < (111), does not follow that in the surface stability of the facets, i.e. (111) < (110) < (100). The results also revealed that the preference of vacancies for surface or subsurface sites, as well as the preferred location of the associated Ce3+ polarons, are facet and concentration-dependent. At the higher vacancy concentration, the VA is more stable than the VB at the (110) facet whereas, at the (111), it is the other way around, and at the (100) facet, both the VA and the VB have similar stability. The stability of the VA vacancies, compared to that of the VB, is accentuated as the concentration decreases. Nearest neighbor polarons to the vacant sites are only observed for the less densely packed (110) and (100) facets.

An entire reaction sequence from C1 to C2 to C3 to C4 has been synthetically verified. The scope of reactivity is broad and includes a variety of transition metals (M = Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Co), including those found in industrial heterogeneous F-T catalysts. Variation of the transition metal fragment impacts the relative rate of the steps of chain growth, allowing isolation and structural characterisation of a rare C2 intermediate. The selectivity of carbon chain growth is also impacted by this variable; two distinct isomers of the C3 carbon chain were observed to form in different ratios with different transition metal reagents.

PAH molecules reach a strong affinity with phosphorene by forming well-ordered domains, whose interaction strength decreases 13-21% compared to the interaction onto carbonaceous surfaces, e.g., graphene. The adsorption energies are in linear relation with the NH:NC ratio of PAHs, where NH and NC are the numbers of H and C atoms; consequently, the cohesive energy of phosphorene-graphene heterostructures is estimated in 44 meV/atom. Energy decomposition (ALMO-EDA) and electron-density-based analyses support the major role of electrostatics driving forces in the interaction mechanism, which is balanced with dispersion effects for larger PAHs. In addition, phosphorene-PAH complexes display outstanding stability in solution under polar/non-polar solvents, which is due to the high polarity of the complexes and strong overcompensation of destabilizing solvation energies with stabilizing electrostatic effects. Moreover, PAHs behave as n-dopants for phosphorene, inducing small bandgap opening and weak effects on the photophysical fingerprint of phosphorene. Nevertheless, strong electron acceptor/donor and larger PAHs (NH:NC<0.5) lead to major effects on the bandgap control, acting as active sites for orbital-controlled interactions.

We show that the activity for CO2 reduction increases with GP loading at low GP loadings, but at sufficiently high GP loadings the activity plateaus as charge transfer is sufficiently fast to no longer be rate limiting.  We also demonstrate that axial coordination is still important even in the presence of GP, suggesting that CoPc does not fully coordinate to heteroatoms on the GP surface.  We develop a set of optimized conditions under which the CoPc/polymer/GP catalyst systems reduce CO2 with higher activity and similar selectivity to previously reported CoPc/polymer films on edge-plane graphite electrodes.  The procedures outlined in this study will be used in future studies to optimize catalyst, polymer, and carbon support loadings for other polymer-catalyst composite systems for electrocatalytic transformations.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, the effects of pH, the concentration of vanadium in solution, [V]Sol, and of their interaction; i.e., non-additive effect, over the properties of Na-SiO2 used for the oxidation of propane under oxygen rich conditions were studied. In general, the studied experimental factors had no net effects over the difference between the nominal and final loadings of vanadium in the catalysts, the surface area, and porosity. However, all catalysts presented a ~50% decrease in surface area due to partial mesopore blocking reflected by a ~30% increase in the average pore diameter. On the other hand, NaVO3 microcrystals and particles constituted \uf061-NaVO3 and \uf062-NaVO3 were formed at acidic pH, whereas Na metavanadate nanoparticles were formed at pH=9.0. These nanoparticles transformed into an \uf061-NaVO3 type phase upon dehydration. The reducibility of the catalysts was a function of the impregnation pH, where the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8 and 9.0 displayed similar reduction patterns but lower reducibility than those synthesized at pH=1.5. The produced patterns were correlated to the existence of a mixture of V5+ and V4+ species among which V4+ was prevalent for the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8 and 9.0. Consequently, the basicity of the catalysts decreased with the increase in pH. The surface concentration of vanadium increased with the increase in the concentration of vanadium in solution, while the pH had a weak negative effect over the former. On the other hand, it was established that chemical surface state of oxygen in the synthesized catalysts was influenced weakly by the synthesis pH and, more importantly, by non-additive effects between the pH and the concentration of vanadium in solution. The latter was coherent with the detection of surface oxygen species related to the partial dissolution of the Na-SiO2 support; a phenomenon that seemed to be favored at acidic pH. The latter properties were correlated to changes in basicity. Concerning the catalytic performance, the catalysts synthesized at pH=9.0 displayed the best steady state performance in terms of the selectivity to propene and oxygen consumption. The collected evidence allowed corroborating that both the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and its combustion to CO and CO2 are kinetically controlled by the initial activation of one of the C-H bonds of propane. But, the production of CO2 depended on the level of consumption of O2; where, a surplus of the latter compared to the conversion of propane combusted the hydrocarbon into CO2. Such a finding agreed with what has already been established for supported vanadium oxides for hydrocarbon oxidation. An analysis of the Raman spectra of the spent catalysts suggested that under the applied reaction conditions, all catalysts were provided of an active phase mostly constituted by \uf061-NaVO3 type structures. Therefore, the observed differences in catalytic behavior were rather associated to changes in particle size, reducibility, and acidity.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Petrochemicals; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 5895-5898). To uncover the mechanism of the reaction and the origins of the high enantioselectivity, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B97D3 / 6-311+G(2d,2p) / SMD(toluene) // B97D3 / 6-31G(d,p) / CPCM(toluene) level of theory. Comparison of four possible activation modes confirms that this reaction proceeds through the bifunctional activation of the azetidine nitrogen and the thione tautomer of the 2-mercaptobenzothiazole nucleophile. Upon thorough conformational sampling of the enantiodetermining transition structures (TSs), a free energy difference of 2.0 kcal mol-1 is obtained, accurately reproducing the experimentally measured 88% e.e. at 80 \u00b0C. This energy difference is due to both decreased distortion and increased non-covalent interactions in the pro-(S) TS. To uncover the true origins of selectivity, the TSs optimized with the full catalyst were compared to those optimized with a model catalyst through steric maps. It is found that the arrangements displayed by the substrates are controlled by strict primary orbital interaction requirements at the transition complex, and their ability to fit into the catalyst pocket drives the selectivity. A general model of selectivity for phosphoric acid-catalyzed azetidine desymmetrizations is proposed, which is based on the preference of the nucleophile and benzoyl group to occupy empty quadrants of the chiral catalyst pocket.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Stereochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although C2+ products higher economic value, only the formation of C1 products was investigated thoroughly. For the electrochemical reduction of CO2, a supporting material is needed for small copper clusters. Graphene is a promising candidate, as is exhibits good mechanical and electrical properties however, the weak interaction of copper and graphene needs to be addressed. Our DFT computations also revealed, that small Cu clusters on boron-doped graphene support are promising catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 towards both C1 and C2 products. We demonstrate the most promising reaction pathways towards various C1 products, and ethanol or ethylene as C2 products on both Cu4 and Cu7 clusters on a boron-doped graphene (BDG) support.

We explored thermal properties (degradation, melting and crystallisation temperatures) of these novel SAILs and their electrochemical properties (ionic conductivity and electrochemical potential window, ECW). These SAILs were tested as electrolytes in a multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-based supercapacitor at various temperatures from 253 to 373 K and their electrochemical performance as a function of temperature was compared. We found that the supercapacitor cell with [C6C1Im][EHS] as an electrolyte has shown a higher specific capacitance (Celec in F g-1), a higher energy density (E in W h kg-1), and a higher power density (P in kW kg-1) as compared to the other studied SAILs, [P4,4,4,4][EHS], [P6,6,6,14][EHS] and [N8,8,8,8][EHS] (from previous our study) at a temperature range from 253 to 373 K. The supercapacitor with an MWCNT-based electrode and [C6C1Im][EHS], [P4,4,4,4][EHS] and [P6,6,6,14][EHS] as electrolytes showed a specific capacitance of 148, 90 and 47 F g-1 (at the scan rate of 2 mV s-1) with an energy density of 82, 50 and 26 W h kg-1 (at 2 mV s-1), respectively, all at 298 K. For latter three SAILs, the temperature effect can be seen by a two to three-fold increase in the specific capacitance of the cell and the energy density values: 290, 198 and 114 F g-1 (at 2 mV s-1) and 161, 110 and 63 Wh kg-1 (at 2 mV s-1), respectively, at 373 K. The solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and equivalent series resistance (ESR) also decreased with an increase in temperature for all SAILs in this study. These new SAILs can potentially be used for high-temperature electrochemical applications, such as supercapacitors for high energy storage due to a reasonably high specific capacitance and enhanced energy and power density, and wider ECWs as compared to molecular organic and aqueous electrolytes.

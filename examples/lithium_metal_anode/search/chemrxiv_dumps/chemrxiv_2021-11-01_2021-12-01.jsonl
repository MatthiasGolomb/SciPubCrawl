Aiming to increase the availability of stereoselective glycosylation chemistry for non-specialists, we have discovered that several commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereospecific O-glycosylations of a wide range of phenols and alkyl alcohols. This catalytic reaction utilizes trichloroacetimidates, an easily accessible and synthetically proven electrophile, takes place under air and only initiates when all three reagents are mixed, which should provide better reproducibility by non-specialists. The reaction is stereospecific, resulting in \u03b2-specific glycosylations from \u03b1-trichloroacetimidates, whilst an \u03b1-selective glycosylation proceeds from \u03b2-trichloroacetimidates. A mechanistic study revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via an SN2-like substitution on the protonated electrophile.

The 1,7-naphthalene derivatives showed superior agonist activity than 2,7-naphthalene derivatives, suggesting that the bent form of 1 would be favorable for the agonist activity. The conformational analysis of 1,7-naphthalene derivatives indicated that the twisting of the amide unit out from the naphthalene plane is important for the enhancement of activity. The introduction of a methyl group on the 2-position of 1,7-naphthalene ring effectively increased the activity, which led to the discovery of the potent OX2R agonist 28c (EC50 = 9.21 nM for OX2R, 148 nM for OX1R). The structure-activity relationship results were well supported by a comparison of the docking simulation results of the most potent derivative 28c with an active state of agonist-bound OX2R cryo-EM SPA structure.

However, due to the sensitivity of metal centers toward various biomolecules, especially glutathione, low activity and turnover of artificial metalloenzymes in vivo are systematic problems not fully solved. Apart from straightforward routes such as the use of neutralizing agents, metal cofactors modification and directed evolution, one may notice that nature can create isolated microenvironments for diverse biological processes within cells. Following this way, here we report the in vivo assembly of artificial metalloenzymes based on HaloTag-SNAPTag fusion protein. These metalloenzymes have metal cofactors bound on protein interfaces, and can trigger liquid-liquid phase separation to form liquid condensates inside Escherichia coli. These condensates serve as membraneless, isolated compartments for artificial metalloenzymes to efficiently perform intracellular catalysis, mediating abiotic unmasking, coupling and polymerization reactions. The cellular compartmentalization also enables spatial control of reactions, either facilitating a cascade reaction within the confined spaces, or concurrent reactions with spatial separation. Such engineered Escherichia coli can work as whole-cell catalyst with confined metal species, colonizing at mice intestine to effect in vivo abiotic transformations with a lower chance of heavy metal poisoning.

Here, we demonstrate a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well-predictable mechanical behaviors by using a pair of star-polymer-DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two-state transition.

A greater understanding of sequence development throughout the polymerization process will aid the design of simple, generalizable methods to control sequence and tune supramolecular assembly. In previous simulations of solution-based step-growth copolymerizations, we have shown that weak, non-bonding attractions between monomers of the same type can produce a microphase separation among the lengthening nascent oligomers and thereby alter sequence. This work explores the phenomenon further, examining how effective attractive interactions, mediated by a solvent selective for one of the reacting species, impact the development of sequence and the supramolecular assembly in a simple A-B copolymerization. We find that as the effective attractions between monomers increase, an emergent self-organization of the reactants causes a shift in reaction kinetics and sequence development. When the solvent-mediated interactions  are selective enough, the simple mixture of A and B monomers oligomerize and self-assemble into structures characteristic of amphiphilic copolymers. The composition and morphology of these structures and the sequences of their chains are sensitive to the relative balance of affinities between the comonomer species.

The neopentane association in urea solution is greater than that in TMAO solution or neat water. We find the association is even less in TMAO solution than pure water. From free ener-gy calculations, it is revealed that the neopentane sized cavity creation in mixed urea-TMAO-water is most unfavorable and that causes the highest hydrophobic association. The cavity formation in urea solution is either more unfavorable or comparable to that in TMAO solution. Importantly, it is found that the population of neopentane-neopentane contact pair and the free energy contribution for cavity formation step in TMAO solution are very sensitive towards the choice of TMAO force-fields. A careful construction of TMAO force-fields is important for studying hydrophobic associa-tion.

The magnitude of this interaction energy is greater in urea solution relative to TMAO solution for two different force-fields of TMAO, whereas the lowest value is obtained in pure water.

This happened because the angles of projection between the adjacent pyridyl rings of M\uf0a2TPP cores adapted to accommodate the bridging XDC linkers having different lengths, and the bow-tie formation was entropically favored over tetragonal prisms. This work not only unveiled novel bow-tie-shaped coordination complexes, but also accurately defined the actual structures and compositions of M\uf0a2TPP-based tricomponent SCCs. Furthermore, a representative bow-tie complex containing an electron-rich ZnTPP core selectively formed a charge-transfer (CT) complex with highly electron deficient 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-heaxacarbonitrile (HATHCN) but not with \u03c0-donors like pyrene.", "date": "2021-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Approaches such as irregular particle shapes, local excitation or intrinsic asymmetry are on the rise to facilitate manufacturing, but the effects on the generation of motion remain poorly understood.  In this work, single crystalline BiVO4 microswimmers are presented that rely on a strict inherent asymmetry of charge-carrier distribution under illumination.  \nThe origin of the asymmetrical flow pattern is elucidated becauseof the high spatial resolution of measured flow fields around pinned BiVO4 colloids.  As a result the flow from oxidative to reductive particle sides was confirmed.  Distribution of oxidation and reduction reactions suggests a dominant self-electrophoretic motion mechanism with a source quadrupole as the origin of the induced flows.  It is shown that the symmetry of the flow fields is broken by self-shadowing of the particles and synthetic surface defects that impact the photocatalytic activity of the microswimmers.  The results demonstrate the complexity of symmetry breaking in nonspherical microswimmers and are leading the way towards understanding ofpropulsion mechanisms of phoretic colloids of various shapes.", "date": "2021-11-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Interfaces; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Robotics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we report the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) from citric acid and m-phenylenediamine using a one-pot hydrothermal approach. The environment-dependent emission changes of NCQDs were extensively investigated in various solvents, in solid-state, and in physically assembled PMMA-PnBA-PMMA copolymer gels in 2-ethyl hexanol. The NCQDs display bright emission in various solvents as well as in solid-state and a temperature-dependent enhanced emission in gels. In detail, these NCQDs exhibit multicolor PL emission across the visible region and its enhancement upon changing the environment (solutions and polymer matrices). The NCQDs also exhibit excitation-dependent PL and solvatochromism, which are rarely observed in CQDs. Most CQDs are non-emissive in the aggregated or solid-state due to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, limiting their solid-state applications. However, these NCQDs display a strong solid-state emission centered at 568 nm ascribed to the presence of abundant surface functional groups, which helps to prevent the \uf070-\uf070 interaction between the NCQDs and to overcome the ACQ effect in the solid-state. Interestingly, the NCQD containing gels display a significant fluorescence enhancement than the NCQDs in 2-ethyl hexanol solution because of the interaction between the polar PMMA blocks and NCQDs.

P. Radhakrishnan; Mark Buckwell; Martin Pham; Donal Finegan; Alexander Rack; Gareth Hinds; Dan Brett; Paul Shearing", "abstract": "Abuse testing of lithium-ion batteries is widely performed in order to develop new safety standards and strategies. However, testing methodologies are not standardised across the research community, especially with failure mechanisms being inherently difficult to reproduce. High-speed X-ray radiography is proven to be a valuable tool to capture events occurring during cell failure, but the observations made remain largely qualitative. We have therefore developed a robust image processing toolbox that can quantify, for the first time, the rate of propagation of battery failure mechanisms revealed by high-speed X-ray radiography. Using Gabor filter, the toolbox selectively tracks the electrode structure at the onset of failure. This facilitated the estimation of the displacement of electrodes undergoing abuse via nail penetration, and also the tracking of objects, such as the nail, as it propagates through a cell. Further, by cross-correlating the Gabor signals, we have produced practical, illustrative spatiotemporal maps of the failure events. From these, we can quantify the propagation rates of electrode displacement prior to the onset of thermal runaway. The highest recorded acceleration (\u2248 514 mm s-2) was when a nail penetrated a cell radially (perpendicular to the electrodes) as opposed to axially (parallel to the electrodes). The initiation of thermal runaway was also resolved in combination with electrode displacement, which occurred at a lower acceleration (\u2248 108 mm s-2).

These distinct solution states could only be revealed by a combination of NMR and molecular fluorescence/phosphorescence spectroscopic methods, which could provide important clues in the mechanistic understanding of many important processes such as photo-redox reactions.

In particular, transformations for which good reactivity or selectivity is challenging for organocatalysts may find particular benefit from translation into a protein scaffold so that its chiral microenvironment can be utilised in catalysis. Previously, we showed that incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid para-aminophenylalanine into the non-enzymatic protein scaffold LmrR forms a proficient and enantioselective artificial enzyme (LmrR_pAF) for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indoles with enals. The unnatural aniline side-chain is directly involved in catalysis, operating via a well-known organocatalytic iminium-based mechanism. In this study, we show that LmrR_pAF can enantioselectively form tertiary carbon centres not only during C-C bond formation, but also by enantioselective protonation. Control over this process is an ongoing challenge for small-molecule catalysts for which general solutions do not exist. LmrR_pAF can selectively deliver a proton to one face of a prochiral enamine intermediate delivering product enantiomeric excesses and yields that rival the best organocatalyst for this transformation. The importance of various side-chains in the pocket of LmrR is distinct from the Friedel-Crafts reaction without enantioselective protonation, and two particularly important residues were probed by exhaustive mutagenesis.

Ru/TiO2-R led to fast and selective conversion of xylose (100 % conversion in 2 h at 120\u00b0C with 99 % selectivity) whereas Ru/TiO2-A gave a slower and much less selective transformation (58 % conversion in 4 h at 120\u00b0C with 17 % selectivity) with the formation of several by-products. Detailed characterization of catalysts with ICP, XRD, FTIR, TEM, H2 chemisorption, N2 porosimetry, TPR and acid-base titration were performed to elucidate the role of each support.\nTiO2-R has a small specific surface area with large ruthenium nanoparticles in weak interaction with TiO2 support and no acidity, whereas TiO2-A is a mesoporous material with a large specific surface area, mildly acidic, and bears small ruthenium particles in strong interaction with TiO2 support. The former was very active and selective for xylose hydrogenation to xylitol whereas the latter was less active and poorly selective. Moreover, careful analysis of reaction products also revealed that TiO2 anatase can catalyze undesired side-reactions such as xylose isomerisation to various pentoses, and therefore the\ncorresponding unexpected polyols (arabitol, ribitol) were produced during xylose conversion by hydrogenation. In a first approach of the kinetics, a simplified kinetic model was built to compare quantitatively intrinsic reaction rates of both catalysts.

Here, we investigate the impact of varying additions of bromide into a lead iodide perovskite thin film on the TTA upconversion process in the annihilator molecule rubrene. We find an interplay between the bromide content and the overall device efficiency. In particular, a higher bromide content results in higher internal upconversion efficiencies, enabled by more efficient charge extraction at the interface, likely due to a more favorable band alignment. However, the external upconversion efficiency decreases, as the absorption cross section in the near infrared is reduced. The highest upconversion performance is found in our study for a bromide content of 5%. This result can be traced back to a high absorption cross section in the near infrared and higher photoluminescence quantum yield in comparison to the iodide-only perovskite, as well as an increased driving force for charge transfer.

However, prior studies have focused on how structural and environmental factors influence boronic acid\u2013diol binding affinity, and design rules for tuning the kinetics of this dynamic bond are lacking. In this work, we investigate the effects of diol (or polyol) structure and salt additives on the rate of bond exchange, binding affinity, and the mechanical properties of the corresponding polymer networks. To better mimic the environment of polymer networks in our small-molecule model systems, we incorporated proximal amide groups, which are used to conjugate diols to polymers, and included salts commonly found in buffers. Using one-dimensional selective exchange spectroscopy (1D EXSY), we find that both proximal amides and buffering anions induce significant rate acceleration consistent with internal and external catalysis, respectively. This rate acceleration is reflected in the stress relaxation of gels formed using PEG modified with different alcohols, and in the presence of salts containing acetate or phosphate.

In the absence of CO2, all quinones exhibited two well-separated reduction waves. For weakly complexing quinones, a positive shift in the second reduction wave was observed in the presence of CO2, corresponding to the dianion quinone-CO2 complex formation. The peak position and peak height of the first re-duction wave were unchanged, indicating no formation of complexes between the semiquinones and CO2. The relative heights of both reduction waves remained constant. In the case of strongly complexing quinones, the second reduction wave disappeared while the peak height of the first reduction wave approximately doubled, indicating that the two electrons transferred simultaneously at this potential. The observed voltammograms were rationalized through several equilibrium arguments. Both weakly and strongly complexing quinones underwent either stepwise or concerted mechanisms of oxidation and CO2 dissociation depending on the sweep rate in the cyclic voltammetric experiments. Relative to stepwise oxidation, the concerted process requires a more positive electrode potential to remove the electron from the carbonate complexes to release CO2 and regenerate the quinone.

Improving our understanding of how heterogeneous CO2 reduction electrocatalysts function is important to designing efficient systems for conversion of CO2 into commodity chemicals such as CO and HCO2H. Both Ag- and Sn-based materials have been previously considered as CO2 reduction catalysts and offer distinct CO2RR selectivities. In this work, we have considered electrodeposited composite film electrodes prepared from electroplating baths with varying ratios of Ag+ and Sn2+ triflates to understand how the performance of such composite materials varies as a function of composition. XPS analysis confirms that for each composite film electrodes, Ag existed in the metallic (Ag0) state, while the Sn was mainly oxidized (Sn2+/4+). The AgSn composite film electrodes studied herein are therefore best considered as AgSnOx cathodes with varying ratios of Ag0:Sn2+/4+. These systems were assessed as CO2RR electrocatalysts and were found to promote the 2e\u2013/2H+ reductions to deliver CO and HCOOH with fast kinetics and high efficiencies from electrolyte solutions containing the protic organic cation [DBU\u2013H]+. While Sn-rich composite films showed poor selectivities for CO versus HCO2H, a significant increase in CO versus HCO2H selectivity (up to 99%) is achieved for composite film electrodes in which the Ag content ranged from 25 - 75%. By tuning the ratio of Ag0 to SnOx we prepared composite film cathode materials that support quantitative current efficiencies for generation of CO with geometric current densities approaching 30 mA/cm2 at applied overpotentials that are less than 750 mV were realized. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) coupled with analysis of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) was used to better understand factors important to the composites\u2019 activity under CO2RR conditions. Probing the dynamics with DRT analysis revealed that multiple processes relating to both adsorption and diffusion-controlled events are important to the activity of the electrocatalysts considered in this work. The collection of electroanalytical investigations suggest that synergistic interactions between Ag and SnOx give rise to porous films that support enhanced CO2RR kinetics and that mixing of Ag with SnOx enhances the efficacy of adsorption and stabilization of reduced CO2 intermediates and [DBU\u2013H]+ cations to facilitate CO evolution at the cathode/electrolyte interface.", "date": "2021-11-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We employed the domain search method to investigate the Hantavirus protein in this present work. The results indicated that the membrane glycoprotein E protein (containing Gn-Gc) of Hantavirus had lipid phosphatase and C2-like domains. The E protein was a tensin phosphatase-like (PTEN) enzyme that could shuttle in the cytoplasm and cell membrane. In an acidic endosomal environment, Gn dissociates, exposing Gc's autophosphorylation region to complete autophosphorylation and activating the C2 domain. The C2 domain facilitates Gc's conformational transition, which is followed by Gc binding to the endosomal membrane. After being inserted into the endosomal membrane, the phosphatase domain of Gc phosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 on the endosomal membrane. Then converted PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4,5)P2 . PI(4,5)P2 bound to the N-terminal of Gc, completely anchoring the tetramer-shaped Gc to the endosomal membrane and forming a fusion hole. Then analogous to PTEN, phosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P3 directly induced the disintegration of Gc tetramer. The enlargement of the fusion pore speeded up the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Through the fusion hole, the virus's intracellular material was swiftly discharged into the cytoplasm. The C2 domain promoted the PKC signaling route during Hantavirus membrane fusion, whereas the phosphatase inhibited the PI3K signaling pathway. E protein's PTEN-like action impaired lipid metabolism and endothelial cell remodeling, increasing blood vessel permeability and resulting in renal and cardiac syndromes. Additionally, E protein inhibited the immune system and Akt-mediated eNOS activation, resulting in a cascade of consequences.", "date": "2021-11-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Atomic-level control of material processing is required for the fabrication of thin films of high-k materials at nanoscale device sizes. Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of metal oxides, in which up to one monolayer of material can be removed, can be achieved by sequential self-limiting (SL) fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions at elevated temperatures. First-principles based atomic-level simulations using density functional theory (DFT) can give deep insights into the precursor chemistry and the reactions that drive the etch of metal oxides. A previous study examined the hydrogen fluoride (HF) pulse in the first step in the thermal ALE process of crystalline HfO2 and ZrO2. This study examines the HF pulse on amorphous HfO2 using first-principles simulations. The Natarajan-Elliott analysis, a thermodynamic methodology is used to compare reaction models representing the self-limiting and spontaneous etch processes taking place during an ALE pulse. For the HF pulse on amorphous HfO2, we found that thermodynamic barriers impeding spontaneous etching are present at ALE relevant temperatures. HF adsorption calculations on the amorphous oxide surface is studied to understand the mechanistic details of the HF pulse. A HF molecule adsorbs dissociatively by forming Hf-F and O-H bonds. HF coverages ranging from 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 to 18.0 \u00b1 0.3 HF/nm2 are investigated and a mixture of molecularly and dissociatively adsorbed HF molecules is present at higher coverages.

Phenyl acetic acids, in particular, are privileged motifs that appear in many pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. This article reports the development of a sustainable and selective cobalt-catalyzed electrochemical carboxylation of benzyl halides with CO2 to generate phenyl acetic acids. The success of this transformation is enabled by the development of low-coordinate cobalt/pyrox complexes as electrocatalysts to convert various benzyl chlorides and bromides to their corre-sponding phenyl/heteroaryl acetic acids with high selectivity over undesired homocoupling of the benzyl halides. The combina-tion of electroanalytical methods, simulation studies, control reactions, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations informed the mechanistic analysis of this reaction. An EC\u2019C-type activation mechanism of benzyl halides, which is unique to Co(II)/pyrox electrocatalysts, provides the rationalization of the exceptional observed selectivity for carboxylation. Specifically, the Co(II)/pyrox catalyst undergoes reduction to Co(I) followed by halogen abstraction and a favorable radical rebound to Co(II)/pyrox to form alkyl\u2013Co(III) intermediates. Although voltammetry only shows a single electron transfer step, bulk electrolysis shows a two electron process and using DFT calculations, the intermediates are proposed to undergo two-electron reduction to alkyl\u2013Co(I) followed by a ZnCl2-assisted CO2 insertion to form the carboxylated adducts with regenera-tion of Co(I)/pyrox.", "date": "2021-11-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Substantial research effort has focused on increasing rate capabilities of SSBs by mitigating detrimental processes such as lithium filament penetration. Less attention has been paid to understanding how areal capacity impacts plating/stripping behavior, despite the importance of areal capacity for achieving high specific energy. Here, we investigate and quantify the relationships among areal capacity, current density, and plating/stripping stability using both symmetric and full-cell configurations with a sulfide solid-state electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl). We show that unstable deposition and short circuiting readily occur at rates much lower than the measured critical current density when a sufficient areal capacity is passed. A systematic study of continuous plating under different electrochemical conditions reveals average \u201cthreshold capacity\u201d values at different current densities, beyond which short circuiting occurs. Cycling cells below this threshold capacity significantly enhances cell lifetime, enabling stable symmetric cell cycling at 2.2 mA cm-2 without short circuiting.

Piezoelectricity requires non-centrosymmetric structures with an electric band-gap, whereas magnetism demands broken time-reversal symmetry. Most of the well-known 2D piezoelectric materials \u2013 e.g., 1H-MoS2 monolayer \u2013 are not magnetic. Being intrinsically magnetic, semiconducting 1H-LaBr2and 1H-VS2 monolayers can combine magnetism and piezoelectricity. We compare piezoelectric properties of 1H-MoS2, 1H-VS2 and 1H-LaBr2 using density functional theory. Our results show that ferromagnetic 1H-LaBr2 2D monolayer displays a larger piezoelectric strain co-efficient (d_{11}= -4.527 pm/V, which is close to d_{11}= 4.104 pm/V of 1H-VS2 monolayer) compared to that of well-known 1H-MoS2 monolayer (d_{11}= 3.706 pm/V), while 1H-MoS2 monolayer has a larger piezoelectric stress co-efficient (e_{11}= 370.675 pC/m) than the 1H-LaBr2 monolayer (e_{11}= -94.175 pC/m, which is also lower than e_{11}= 298.100 pC/m of 1H-VS2 monolayer). These in-plane piezoelectric d_{11} coefficients are quite comparable with piezo-response of bulk wurtzite nitrides \u2013 e.g., d_{33} of GaN is about 3.1 pm/V. The large d_{11} for 1H-LaBr2 monolayer originates from the low elastic constants, C_{11}= 30.338 N/m and C_{12} = 9.534 N/m. Interestingly, the sign of the piezoelectric co-coefficients for 1H-LaBr2 monolayer is different to that of the 1H-MoS2 or 1H-VS2 monolayers. The negative sign arises from the negative ionic contribution of e_{11}, which dominates in the 1H-LaBr2 monolayer, whereas the electronic part of e_{11} dominates in 1H-MoS2 and 1H-VS2. Furthermore, we explain the origin of this large ionic contribution of e_{11} for 1H-LaBr2 in terms of the Born effective charges (Z_{11}) and the sensitivity of the atomic positions to the strain (\\frac{du}{d\\eta}). Surprisingly, we observe a sign reversal in the Z_{11} of Mo and S compared to the nominal oxidation states, which makes both the electronic and ionic parts of e_{11} positive, and results in the high value of e_{11}. Additionally, our interatomic bond analysis using crystal orbital Hamilton populations indicates that the weaker covalent bond in 1H-LaBr2 monolayer is responsible for large \\frac{du}{d\\eta} and elastic softening (lower elastic constants).

ESD can deposit uniform thin films by including dilute solutes in these droplets. One mode of ESD, self-limiting electrospray deposition (SLED), has been shown to exist when glassy polymers are sprayed in a volatile solvent below the polymer glass transition temperature (Tg). This leads to charge accumulation on the coating surface that slows the growth of the film thickness. Since solutes can be easily blended in dilute ESD solutions, we investigate the SLED limits of self-limiting and non-self-limiting solute blends. As a motivating application, we focus on mechanical properties of the film. Specifically, we blend self-limiting polystyrene (PS) and SU-8 epoxy resin with different non-self-limiting mechanical modifiers, such as plasticizers and curing agents. To characterize the resulting morphologies and mechanical properties, we employ scanning electron microscopy and nanoindentation of as received and smoothed films. The results illustrate the formation of composited polymers that exhibit self-limiting ability by SLED, depending on the interaction between the two components. Further, mechanical properties could be effectively fine-tuned within these compositional ranges.

Urban water profiling was utilised in the Eerste River catchment (South Africa) to establish antibiotic usage in a catchment where comprehensive prescription records were not readily available and where portions of the community did not have sufficient access to sanitation. This technique enabled the environmental exposure to be quantified throughout the catchment area and the identification of contamination hotspots. Monitoring occurred over a 10-month period. 812 samples were processed using UPLC-MS/MS for the quantitation of 56 antimicrobials and 26 of their metabolites. Spatiotemporal trends were established, with consideration to community behaviour, seasonal changes, and physiochemical properties of the analytes. The Eerste River samples collected upstream from the town of Stellenbosch had the lowest antibiotic loads (< 4 g/day), unafflicted by industrial presence and with only small impact from farming activity. This was followed by sites downstream from a treated wastewater treatment plant (serving 178K people) discharge point (influent: 500-800 g/day and effluent 50-100 g/day), which indicates a high efficiency of wastewater treatment allowing for an effective reduction of ABs and a lower environmental burden compared to the river sites receiving untreated waste from communities in informal settlements (6-12K people) that are not connected to the sewer infrastructure (with AB levels accounting for 100-600 g/day). Temporal trends exhibited reduced daily loads during the summer to early autumn. This is likely due to seasonal patterns in community health. However, weather patterns are also important to consider \u2013 particularly for the river sites. South Africa has notable rainfall and temperature seasonality.

In this study, we demonstrate the bipolar dopability of the Zintl arsenide Eu5In2As6. The electrical resistivity at 300 K with n-type polarity was decreased to 7.6 x 10^-1 ohmcm using La as an electron dopant.

We have developed a new method called Flexible Boundary Layer using Exchange (FlexiBLE) that solves the problem by adding a biasing potential to the system that closely maintains QM/MM separation. The method rigorously preserves ensemble averages by leveraging their invariance to exchange of identical particles. With a careful choice of the biasing potential, and the use of a tree algorithm to include only important QM and MM exchanges, we find the method has an MM-forcefield-like computational cost and thus adds negligible overhead to a QM/MM simulation. Furthermore, we show that molecular dynamics with the FlexiBLE bias conserves total energy and remarkably, dynamical quantities in the QM region are unaffected by the applied bias.

In pursuit of a better utilization of the phosphates recovered from waste water treatment, we herein report that condensed phosphates can be employed to phosphorylate hydride reagents under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions to furnish phosphite (HPO3)2\u2212, a versatile chemical with phosphorus in the +3 oxidation state. Hydride phosphorylation, as a two-electron one-proton reduction of a main group element oxide, constitutes a direct parallel with CO2 reduction to formate. Using potassium hydride as the hydride source, sodium trimetaphosphate (Na3P3O9 ), triphosphate (Na5P3O10), and pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7) engendered phosphite in 44, 58, and 44% yields based on total P content, respectively, under their optimal conditions. Formation of overreduced products including hypophosphite (H2PO2\u2212) was identified as a competing process, and mechanistic investigation revealed that hydride attack on in situ generated phosphorylated phosphite species is a potent pathway for overreduction. The phosphite generated from our method could be easily isolated in the form of barium phosphite, a useful intermediate for production of phosphorous acid. This method circumvents the need to pass through white phosphorus (P4) as a high energy intermediate and mitigates involvement of environmentally hazardous chemicals. A bioproduced polyphosphate from baker\u2019s yeast was demonstrated to be a viable starting material for the production of phosphite. This example demonstrates the possibility of accessing reduced phosphorus compounds in a more sustainable manner, and more importantly, closing the modern phosphorus cycle.", "date": "2021-11-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food; Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The \u00b5IMZI shows capability for investigating optical properties of as small as picoliter volumes with an exceptionally high sensitivity.

Isborn", "abstract": "Simulation of optical spectra is essential to molecular characterization and, in many cases, critical for interpreting experimental spectra. The most common method for simulating vibronic absorption spectra relies on the geometry optimization and computation of normal modes for ground and excited states. In this report, we show that utilization of such a procedure within an adiabatic linear response theory framework may lead to state mixings and a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, resulting in a poor description of absorption spectra. In contrast, computing excited states via a self-consistent eld method in conjunction with a maximum overlap model produces states that are not subject to such mixings. We show that this latter method produces vibronic spectra much more aligned with vertical excitation procedures, such as those computed from a vertical gradient or molecular dynamics trajectory-based approach. For the methylene blue chromophore, we compare vibronic absorption spectra computed with: an adiabatic Hessian approach with linear response theory optimized\nstructures and normal modes, a vertical gradient procedure, the Hessian and normal modes of maximum overlap method optimized structures, and excitation energy time correlation functions generated from a molecular dynamics trajectory. Due to mixing between the bright S1 and dark S2 surfaces near the S1 minimum, computing the adiabatic Hessian with linear response theory time-dependent density functional theory with the B3LYP density functional predicts a large vibronic shoulder for the absorption spectrum that is not present for any of the other methods. Spectral densities are analyzed and we compare the behavior of the key normal mode that in linear response theory strongly couples to the optical excitation while showing S1/ S2 state mixings. Overall, our study provides a note of caution in computing vibronic spectra using the excited state adiabatic Hessian of linear response theory optimized structures and also showcases three alternatives that are not as subject to adiabatic state mixing effects.", "date": "2021-11-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

By incorporating 0.60 wt.% of ANFs, both the tensile strength and toughness increased by 264 % and 219 % respectively, while the Young\u2019s modulus had a 406 % increase compared to the control photoresin.", "date": "2021-11-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

This challenge is by its own very interesting and relevant,but is even more complex in a federated machine learning approach where multiple partners jointly train a model under privacy-preserving conditions where chemical structures must not be shared between the different participating parties in the federated learning.

LSPR tunability triggered through compositional and morphological changes during the synthesis (size, shape and doping percentage) is becoming well-established while the principles underlying dynamic, post-synthetic modulation of LSPR are not as well understood. Recent reports have suggested that the presence of a depletion layer on the NC surface may be instrumental in governing the LSPR modulation of doped metal oxide NCs. Here, we employ post-synthetic electron transfer to colloidal Sn-doped In2O3 NCs with varying size and Sn doping concentration to investigate the role of the depletion layer in LSPR modulation. By measuring the maximum change in LSPR frequency after NC reduction, we determine that a large initial volume fraction of the depletion layer in NCs results in a broad modulation of the LSPR energy and intensity. Utilizing a mathematical Drude fitting model, we track the changes in the electron density and the depletion layer volume fraction throughout the chemical doping process, offering fundamental insight into the intrinsic NC response resulting from such electron transfer events. We observe that the maximum change in electron density that can be induced through chemical doping is independent of Sn concentration, and subsequently, the maximum total electron density in the presence of excess reductant is independent of the NC diameter and is dependent only on the as-synthesized Sn doping concentration. This study establishes the central role that surface depletion plays in the electronic changes occurring in the NCs during post-synthetic doping and the results will be instrumental in advancing the understanding of optical and electrical properties of different colloidal plasmonic NCs.

The shear viscosity of RDX is predicted to be of similar magnitude to the viscosity of TATB at low GPa-range pressures, and to be roughly an order of magnitude lower than the viscosity of HMX. The temperature dependence of the shear viscosity is Arrhenius at a given pressure, and the exponential pre-factor and activation term exhibit a strong, yet complicated, pressure dependence. An empirical pressure-temperature dependent function for RDX shear viscosity is developed that simultaneously captures a wide range of MD predictions while taking an analytic form that extrapolates smoothly beyond the fitted regime. The relative strength of the pressure and temperature dependencies of these two physics terms is found to be of similar magnitude for RDX, HMX, and TATB, which motivates incorporating these results in future RDX grain scale modeling.", "date": "2021-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.); Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A quadrupole-ion mobility-time of flight instrument previously modified to enable ECD in transmission mode (without ion trapping) immediately following a mobility separation was further modified to allow for deuterated ammonia (ND3) to be leaked in after m/z selection. Collisional activation was minimized to prevent deuterium scrambling from giving structurally irrelevant results. This arrangement was demonstrated with the extensively studied protein folding\nmodels ubiquitin and cytochrome c. Ubiquitin was ionized from conditions that stabilize the native state and conditions that stabilize the partially-folded A-state. IM of deuterated ubiquitin 6+ ions allowed the separation of more compact conformers from more extended conformers.\nECD of the separated subpopulations revealed that the more extended (later arriving) conformers had significant, localized differences in the amount of HDX observed. The 5+ charge state showed greater protection against HDX than the compact 6+ conformer, and the 11+ charge state, ionized from conditions that stabilize the A-state, showed much greater deuterium incorporation. The 7+ ions of cytochrome c ionized from aqueous conditions showed greater HDX with exterior and more unstructured regions of the protein, while interior, structured regions, especially those involved in heme binding, were more protected against exchange.

For low-temperature vehicle exhaust, dispersed Pd ions are able to adsorb NOx even in H2O-rich exhaust in the presence of carbon monoxide. In order to understand this phenomenon, changes in Pd ligand environment have to be monitored in-situ. Herein, we directly observe the activation of hydrated Pd ion shielded by H2O into a carbonyl-nitrosyl complex Pd2+(NO)(CO) in SSZ-13 zeolite. The subsequent thermal desorption of ligands on Pd2+(NO)(CO) complex proceeds to nitrosyl Pd2+ rather than to carbonyl Pd2+ under various conditions. Thus, CO molecules act as additional ligands to provide alternative pathway through Pd2+(NO)(CO) complex with lower energy barrier for accelerating NO adsorption on hydrated Pd2+ ion, which is kinetically limited in the absence of CO. We further demonstrate that hydration of Pd ions in the zeolite is a prerequisite for CO-induced reduction of Pd ions to metallic Pd. The reduction of Pd ions by CO is limited under dry conditions even at a high temperature of 500\u00b0C, while water makes it possible at near RT. However, the primary NO adsorption sites are Pd2+ ions even in gases containing CO and water. These findings clarify additional mechanistic aspects of the passive NOx adsorption (PNA) process and will help extend the NOx adsorption chemistry in zeolite-based adsorbers to practical applications.", "date": "2021-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we employ native mass spectrometry in conjunction with a variable temperature apparatus to determine the thermodynamics of individual lipid binding events to the human G-protein-gated inward rectifier potassium channel, Kir3.2. We find that Kir3.2 displays distinct thermodynamic strategies to engage phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphorylated forms thereof. The addition of a 4\u2019- phosphate to PI with 18:1-18:1 (DO) tails results in an increase in favorable entropy along with an enthalpic penalty. The binding of PI with two or more phosphates is more complex where lipids bind to Kir3.2 with the cytoplasmic domain in either a docked or extended configuration. Remarkably, the interaction of 4,5-bisphosphate DOPI (DOPI(4,5)P2) with Kir3.2 is solely driven by a large, favorable change in entropy. Installment of a third 3\u2019-phosphate to DOPI(4,5)P2 results in an alternative thermodynamic strategy for the first binding event whereas each successive binding event shows strong enthalpy-entropy compensation. PI(4,5)P2 with 18:0-20:4 tails results in an inversion of thermodynamic parameters where the change in enthalpy now dominates. Collectively, the data show that entropy can indeed play important roles in regulating membrane protein-lipid interactions.", "date": "2021-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

For example, the phenethyl alcohol obtained by the preferential hydrogenation of the C=O group of acetophenone is a valuable intermediate for the production of spices, flavors, and medicines. Furthermore, as the demand for 1-phenylethanol (PhE) continues to increase, the catalytic hydrogenation of acetophenone (AP) is becoming more and more important. The hydrogenation of acetophenone is a complex multi-step reaction. At present, relatively few catalytic systems are used in this reaction. The enantioselective hydrogenation on heterogeneous catalysts is due to its inherent operational and economic advantages, such as the atomic economy. It is one of the most ideal methods as it is easy to separate and recycle the catalyst. However, the traditional synthesis way in batch reactors usually takes a long time with an unsatisfying conversion which is not conducive to industrialization. Heterogeneous non-precious metal catalysts are advantageous for their implementation in flow reactor systems for industrial applications due to their ease of separation, low cost, and environmental protection. Herein, we report the first use of non-noble metal Ni-supported graphene-based catalysts for hydrogenation of acetophenone to phenylethanol with high efficiency in the flow reactor which can significantly improve mass and heat transfer. The conversion rate after optimizing the reaction conditions can be as high as 99.14% with a satisfactory conversion rate of 97.77%. This catalyst is magnetic and has good cyclability. After 48 hours of uninterrupted continuous experiments, the Ni-based catalyst still maintains high catalytic activity, the conversion rate still reaches 88.44%, and the catalyst structure remains intact and stable.", "date": "2021-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The possibility of an antigenic shift to M2 S31 necessitates ranking the biological activities of amantadine variants. Several amantadine variants have been tested by different laboratories, but various M2 wild type influenza A strains have been used with different sensitivity against amantadine and the unambiguous comparison between potencies is not straightforward. Here, we compared the anti-influenza activities of 57 synthetic amantadine variants against influenza A WSN/33 viruses with amantadine-sensitive M2 WT, with a range of over three digits providing a reference set of potencies for structure-activity relationships, and amantadine-resistant M2 S31N proteins (and observed no potent compounds). 17 compounds were selected and tested against M2 L26F, V27A, A30T, G34E viruses. We tested few reference compounds using electrophysiology and explored point mutations which both showed that M2 is the target of potent antiviral potency against the M2 WT, L26F, V27A viruses. Major findings are: (a) Several amantadine variants from Kolocouris group block only M2 WT and M2 L26F-mediated proton current and the corresponding viruses replication. (b) A compound from Vazquez\u2019s group is a triple blocker of M2 WT, L26F, V27A channels and viruses replication. (c) A compound from Vazquez\u2019s group blocks only M2 L26 channel and virus replication.

The compounds and their cocktails while not to be more toxic than amantadine might be useful for re-purposing of amantadine class of drugs in the case (i) of the prevalence of M2 L26F and or M2 V27A strains (ii) of an antigenic shift of the virus to M2 WT and (iii) because they inhibited a broad panel of M2 WT and M2 S31N viruses including the H1N1pdm09). (d) We showed that the mechanism of antiviral activity against A/California/07/2009 or A/PR/08/1934 and possibly also M2 WT viruses compared to WSN/33 viruses is not due to inhibition of an early stage of virus infection or a late stage of M2 channel function during endocytosis or inhibition of HA binding to host cells or a different pH for HA fusion or a lysosomotropic effect.

However, off-target reactivity challenges the field. Extensive efforts have been exerted to solve this issue by varying the reactivity attributes of electrophilic warheads, with features such as reversibility or metabolic vulnerability. Here we report the development of a new approach to increase the selectivity of covalent probes and small molecule inhibitors that is independent of warhead reactivity features and can be used in concert with already-existing methods. Using the Bruton\u2019s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib scaffold for our proof-of-concept, we reasoned that increasing the steric bulk of fumarate-based electrophiles on Ibrutinib should improve selectivity via the steric exclusion of off-targets but ideally retain rates of cysteine reactivity comparable to that of an acrylamide. Using chemical proteomic techniques, we demonstrate that elaboration of the electrophile to a tert-Butyl (t-Bu) fumarate ester significantly decreases time-dependent off-target reactivity and abolishes time-independent off-target reactivity but retains BTK target engagement. While an alkyne-bearing probe analog of Ibrutinib has 247 protein targets, our t-Bu fumarate Ibrutinib probe analog has only 7 protein targets. Of these 7 targets, BTK is the only time-independent target. This 2-order-of-magnitude increase in selectivity is also conferred to the t-Bu inhibitor itself. By shotgun proteomics, we investigated the consequences of treatment with Ibrutinib and our t-Bu analog and discovered that only 8 proteins are downregulated in response to treatment with the t-Bu analog compared to 107 with Ibrutinib. Of these 8 proteins, 7 are also downregulated by Ibrutinib and a majority of these targets are associated with BTK biology. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously-unappreciated opportunity to increase cysteine-reactive covalent inhibitor selectivity through electrophilic structure optimization.", "date": "2021-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Having precise control over the structural parameters of the porous network is crucial for expanding their applicability. To this end, the use of block copolymers (BCP) as sacrificial structure-directing agents via micelle co-assembly is a particularly attractive route, since the resultant pore size is directly related to scaling laws for the radius of gyration of the pore-forming macromolecule. However, tailoring the molecular weight of the BCP via bespoke synthesis is an elaborate process that requires precise control over highly sensitive reactions conditions. Alternative methods have emerged, based on supramolecular assembly or the addition of different swelling agents, but, to-date, these present a negative impact on the structural order and pore size dispersity of the final inorganic mesoporous films. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method for control over pore size, porosity and structural order, which relies on a synergistic combination of BCP selective swelling via solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and locking of the structure by condensation of the inorganic sol-gel precursors. The results obtained in this work for TiO2 establish SVA as a new, straightforward, simple, and powerful route efor the fabrication of mesoporous thin-film materials with controllable structural characteristics.

However, establishing the model Hamiltonian is a tedious task, requiring the construction and optimization of many geometries. Today, most of these geometries are constructed by hand, based on chemical intuition or random choices. Hence, the quality of the training set is unlikely to be optimal and its construction is not reproducible. Herein, we propose a reformulation of the construction of the training set as a strategy-based game, aiming at an efficient exploration of the relevant patterns constituting the model Hamiltonian. Based on this reformulation, we exploit a typical active learning solution for machine-learning such a strategy game: an upper confidence tree (UCT) based framework. However, in contrast to standard games, evaluating the true score is computationally expensive, as it requires a costly geometry optimization. Hence, we augment the UCT with a pre-exploration step inspired by the variance-based Design of Experiments (DoE) methods. \nThis novel mixed UCT+DoE framework allows to automatically construct a well adapted training set, minimizing computational cost and user-intervention. As a proof of principle, we apply our UCT+DoE approach on the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111), for which a relevant model Hamiltonian has been established previously. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the custom built UCT and its significant benefits on a DoE-based approach.", "date": "2021-11-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the case of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), this entrapment leads to poor heating efficiency for magnetic hyperthermia and suppresses the possibility to manipulate them in the cytosol. Current strategies to limit their entrapment are based on their functionalization with cell-penetrating peptides in order to promote their translocation directly across the cell membrane or their endosomal escape. However, these strategies suffer from potential release of free peptides in cell and to the best of our knowledge there is currently a lack of effective methods for the cytosolic delivery of MNPs after incubation with cells.\nHerein, we report the conjugation of fluorescently labelled cationic peptides to \u03b3-Fe2O3@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles by click chemistry to improve MNP access to the cytosol. We compare the effect of Arg9 and His4 peptides. On one hand, Arg9 is a classical cell-penetrating peptide, able to enter cells by direct translocation and on the other hand, it has been demonstrated that sequences rich in histidine residues promote endosomal escape, most probably by the proton sponge effect. The methodology developed allows to have a high co-localization of the peptides and core-shell nanoparticles in cells and to attest that the grafting onto nanoparticles of peptides rich in histidine promotes NP access to the cytosol. The endosomal escape was confirmed by a calcein leakage assay and by ultrastructural analysis in transmission electron microscopy. No toxicity of the nanoparticles functionalized with peptides was found. We show that our conjugation strategy is compatible with the addition of multiple substrates and can thus be used for the delivery of cytoplasm-targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2021-11-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Biological Materials; Core-Shell Materials; Magnetic Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This method must be able to capture the effects of static disorder (site-to-site variations in the rate constants), as well as dynamic correlation (interdependent probabilities of finding reactants and products next to each other). Combining the intuitions of the mean-field steady state (MFSS) method and the pair approximation (PA), we consider representative pairs of sites in a self-consistent bath of the average pairwise correlation. Pre-averaging over the static disorder in one site of each pair makes this half heterogeneous pair approximation (HHPA) efficient enough to simulate systems of several species and calibrate rate constants. According to the simulated kinetics, a static disorder in the hole transfer steps suffices to reproduce the stretched exponentials in the observed kinetics. The identity of the dominant hole scavenger is found to be temperature-dependent -- the methoxy anion at 80 K and the methanol molecule at 180 K. Moreover, two distinct groups of 5-coordinate titanium (Ti5c) sites emerge -- a high-activity group and a low-activity group -- even though no such division exists in the rate constants. Since the division is quite insensitive to the type of static disorder, the emergence of the two groups might play a significant role in a variety of photocatalytic processes on TiO2.", "date": "2021-11-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemical Kinetics; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It is a fundamental problem in drug discovery but challenging due to (i) the requirement of simultaneous optimization of multiple properties and (ii) the large chemical space to explore. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to solve this task by mimicking the chemist's intuition in terms of matched molecular pairs (MMPs). Although MMPs is a typical and widely used strategy by medicinal chemists, it offers limited capability in terms of exploring the space of solutions. There are more options to modify a starting molecule to achieve desirable properties, e.g. one can simultaneously modify the molecule at different places including changing the scaffold. This study trains the same Transformer architecture on different datasets. These datasets consist of a set of molecular pairs which reflect different types of transformations. Beyond MMP transformation, datasets reflecting general transformations are constructed from ChEMBL based on two approaches: Tanimoto similarity (allows for multiple modifications) and scaffold matching (allows for multiple modifications but keep the scaffold constant) respectively. We investigate how the model behavior can be altered by tailoring the dataset while keeping the same model architecture. Our results show that the models trained on differently prepared datasets transform a given starting molecule in a way that it reflects the nature of the dataset used for training the model.

In this study, we used X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to measure soil lead levels surrounding a home with exterior leaded paint (about 10% Pb w/w) after it was repainted in fall of 2019.  The painted wooden exterior was prepared for painting by dry scraping without the use of tarps or plastic barriers.

Furthermore, the derivatives of the relativistic decoupling matrix are considered to form the complete analytical derivative of the X2C Hamiltonian.\nTo reduce the associated computational costs, we apply the diagonal local approximation to the unitary decoupling transformation (DLU) and the (multipole-accelerated) resolution of the identity approximation.

We establish a new approach that reduces, by \u2273108\u00d7, the computational cost of finding the time-averaged rate at dynamic steady state (i.e. the limit cycle for linear and nonlinear systems of kinetic equations). Our developments are motivated by and conceived from physical and mathematical insight drawn from examination of a simple, didactic case study for which closed-form solutions of rate enhancement are derived in explicit terms of periods of oscillation and elementary step rate constants. Generalization of such closed-form solutions to more complex catalytic systems is achieved by introducing a periodic boundary condition requiring the dynamic steady state solution to have the same periodicity as the kinetic oscillations and solving the corresponding differential equations by linear algebra or Newton-Raphson-based approaches. The methodology is well-suited to extension to non-linear systems for which we detail the potential for multiple solutions or solutions with different periodicities.

To investigate the limits of this theory at the nanoscale, where the continuum assumptions required by the DLVO theory break down, here we investigate NP dimerization by computing the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) of this process using fully atomistic MD simulations.

However, despite its importance in nature, lipid-conjugation of small molecules is not commonly used in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry, and the effect of such conjugation has not been systematically studied. To understand the composition of lipids found in natural products, we carried out a chemoinformatic characterization of the \u2018natural product lipidome\u2019. According to this analysis, lipidated natural products predominantly contain saturated linear medium-length lipids, which are significantly shorter than those found in membranes and lipidated proteins. To study the usefulness of such modifications in probe design, we systematically explored the effect of lipid conjugation on five different small molecule chemotypes and find that permeability, cellular retention, subcellular localization, and bioactivity can be significantly modulated depending on the type of lipid tail used. We demonstrate that medium-length lipid tails can render impermeable molecules cell-permeable and switch on their bioactivity. Saturated medium-length lipids (e.g. C10) are found to be ideal for the bioactivity of small molecules in mammalian cells, while saturated long-chain lipids (e.g. C18) often significantly reduce bioavailability and activity.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP), which has revolutionized biological imaging and assays, is one of the most re-designed proteins.

The motivation for these studies is often their use as fuel in so-called direct methanol or direct formic acid fuel cells, promising alternatives to hydrogen-fueled proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The fundamental research spans from screening studies to identify the best performing catalyst materials to detailed mechanistic investigations of the reaction pathway. These investigations are commonly performed in standard three electrode electrochemical cells with a liquid supporting electrolyte to which the methanol or formic acid is added. In fuel cell devices, however, no liquid electrolyte will be present, instead membrane electrolytes are used. The question therefore arises, to which extend results from conventional electrochemical cells can be extrapolated to conditions found in fuel cells. We previously developed a gas diffusion electrode setup to mimic \u201creal-life\u201d reaction conditions and study electrocatalysts for oxygen gas reduction or water splitting. It is here demonstrated that the setup is also suitable to investigate the properties of catalysts for the electro-oxidation of small organic molecules. Using the gas diffusion electrode setup, it is seen that employing a catalyst - membrane electrolyte interface as compared to conventional electrochemical cells can lead to significantly different catalyst performances. Therefore, it is recommended to implement gas diffusion electrode setups for the investigation of the electro-oxidation of small organic molecules.

In this study, we used a novel combination of real-time in-line microscopy, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), post SEM analysis, and filtration metrics (water flux and rejection) to study mineral fouling mechanisms of Ca-P and CaCO3 salts in synthetic effluent nanofiltration. We used nanofiltration (NF) polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) membranes, prepared by static layer-by-layer (LbL) coating of a cationic polymer - polydiallyl dimethylammonium chloride, and anionic polymer - poly styrenesulfonate (six bi-layer) on a polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) membrane. Increasing permeate recovery over filtration time was simulated through additions of CaCl2 with NaHCO3 or NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4. Using the novel combination of methods, we delineated the mechanisms governing fouling development with time for both CaCO3 and Ca-P. For CaCO3, a transition from heterogeneous precipitation on the membrane surface (scaling) to particulate fouling due to bulk precipitation was identified. For Ca-P, a transition from fouling by amorphous particles to fouling by crystalline particles was identified; and this phase-change was captured in real-time images using an in-line microscope. We also found that for similar precipitation potentials measured by weight, Ca-P fouling was more detrimental to water flux (86% decrease) compared to CaCO3 (20% decrease) due to the voluminous amorphous phase. We established in-line microscopy as a new useful method to study mineral fouling, as it gives invaluable information on the suspended particles in real-time.

Furthermore, the transportation sector accounts a significant part of other air pollutant emissions that have damaging consequences to human health. Up until now, it was unclear what the greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions consequences of electrifying vehicles in India would be, as replacing traditional vehicles with electrified ones reduces tailpipe emissions, but it will increase the emissions from the power sector when vehicles are charging. We mitigate that gap in the literature by performing a state specific life-cycle assessment of GHGs and criteria air pollutant emissions for representative passenger vehicles (four-wheelers, three-wheelers, two-wheelers and buses) driven in Indian states/union territories. We consider several vehicle technologies (internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)). We find that in most states, four-wheeler BEVs have higher greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutant emissions than other conventional or alternative vehicles and thus electrification of that vehicle class would not lead to emissions reductions. In contrast, in most states, electrified buses and three-wheelers are the best strategy to reduce greenhouse gases, but these are also the worst solution in terms of criteria air pollutant emissions. Electrified two-wheelers have lower criteria air pollutant emissions than gasoline only in five states. The striking conclusion is that unless the Indian grid becomes less polluting, the case for widespread electrification of vehicles for sustainability purposes is simply not there. Moving towards a sustainable, low carbon and low pollution electricity grid is a requirement to make a widespread transportation electrification case for India.", "date": "2021-11-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The cyclic loop biligand consists of a linear peptide joined to a macrocycle peptide through triazole linkage, and it was isolated through two iterative in situ screens. This biligand allosterically inhibited kinase activity of Akt2 but it was cell-impermeable, as isolated from the screening process. Since Akt2 is an oncoprotein hyperactivated via phosphorylation at Ser474 in cancers, we sought to visualize p-Akt2 in live cancer cells using the developed biligand. To this end, we matured this biligand into a cell-penetrant reagent through systematic iterations of its chemical structure to promote cell-penetrating properties, while retaining its binding and inhibition for p-Akt2. Two retro-inverso, N-methylated versions of the macrocyclic ligand were developed which were uptaken by live cancer cells, while retaining their high affinities for pAkt2. Interestingly, the stereochemistry of two amino acid residues in the cell-penetrant ligands exhibited strong influence on their extent of cell penetration. This phenomenon of difference in cell penetration was explored through metadynamics simulations of each ligand in the cell membrane. It was found that the ligand uptaken to a greater extent by cells had more intramolecular interactions with itself and had fewer cholesterol molecules associated with it, which aided in its cell-penetration.", "date": "2021-11-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Most research on battery health prognostics focuses on the R&D setting where cells are subjected to the same usage patterns, yet in practice there is great variability in use across cells and cycles, making forecasting much more challenging. Here, we address this challenge by combining electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a non-invasive measurement of battery state, with probabilistic machine learning. We generated a dataset of 40 commercial lithium-ion coin cells cycled under multistage constant current charging/discharging, with currents randomly changed between cycles to emulate realistic use patterns. We show that future discharge capacities can be predicted with calibrated uncertainties, given the future cycling protocol and a single EIS measurement made just before charging, and without any knowledge of usage history. Our method is data-efficient, requiring just eight cells to achieve a test error of less than 10%, and robust to dataset shifts. Our model can forecast well into the future, attaining a test error of less than 10% when projecting 32 cycles ahead. Further, we find that model performance can be boosted by 25% by augmenting EIS with additional features derived from historical capacity-voltage curves. Our results suggest that battery health is better quantified by a multidimensional vector rather than a scalar State of Health, thus deriving informative electrochemical `biomarkers' in tandem with machine learning is key to predictive battery management and control.", "date": "2021-11-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The coordination number and strength of Ca2+ ions with phosphate species, oxygen-containing additives, and solvent molecules played a crucial role in tuning nucleation processes and surface stability of CaP under the simulated body fluid (SBF) or aqueous solutions upon the addition of oligomeric lactic acid (LACn, n=1, 8) and changing pH values. As revealed by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well as high-throughput experimentation (HTE), the binding of LAC molecules with Ca2+ ions and phosphate species could stabilize both pre-nucleation clusters and brushite (DCPD, CaHPO4\u00b72H2O) surface through intermolecular electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. When the concentration of Ca2+ ions ([Ca2+]) is very low, the amount of the formed precipitation decreased with the addition of LAC based on UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis due to the reduced chance for the LAC capped Ca2+ ions to coordinate with phosphates and the increased solubility in acid solution. With the increasing [Ca2+] concentration, the kinetically stable DCPD precipitation was obtained with high Ca2+ coordination number and low surface energy. Morphologies of DCPD precipitation are in plate, needle, or rod, depending on the initial pH values that tuned by adding NH3\u00b7H2O, HCl, or CH3COOH. The prepared samples at pH \u2248 7.4 with different Ca/P ratios exhibited negative zeta potential values, which were correlated with the surface electrostatic potential distributions and potential biological applications.

Hybrid materials based on polyoxometalates (POMs) are particularly interesting due to the versatile catalytic, redox, electronic, and magnetic properties of this large family of metal-oxo clusters, yet the combination of different clusters has been scarcely reported. Hence, herein we propose a novel and general strategy for combining multiple types of metal-oxo clusters in a single hybrid molecule. Two novel hybrid POM structures (HPOMs) bis-functionalised with dipentaerythritol (R-POM1-R; R = (OCH2)3CCH2OCH2C(CH2OH)) were synthesised as building-blocks for the formation of heterometallic hybrid triads (POM2-R-POM1-R-POM2). Such a modular approach resulted in the formation of four novel heterometallic hybrids combing the Lindqvist {V6}, Anderson-Evans {XMo6} (X = Cr or Al) and trisubstituted Wells-Dawson {P2V3W15} POM structures. Their formation was confirmed by multinuclear Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy, as well as Mass Spectrometry, Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy (DOSY) and elemental analysis. Their thermal stability was also examined by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), which showed that overall the HPOM triads exhibit higher thermal stability than comparable hybrid structures containing only one type of POM. The one-pot synthesis of these novel compounds was achieved in high yields in aqueous and organic media under simple reflux conditions, without the need of any additives, and could be applied for creating other hybrid materials based on a variety of metal-oxo cluster building-blocks.", "date": "2021-11-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The dependence on manual operation makes it challenging to simulate enzymes and enzyme variants in a high-throughput fashion. In this work, we developed a Python software, EnzyHTP, to automate molecular model construction, QM, MM, and QM/MM computation, and analyses of modeling data for enzyme simulations. To test the EnzyHTP, we used fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD) as a model system and simulated the enzyme interior electrostatics for 100 FAcD mutants with a random single amino acid substitution. For each enzyme mutant, the workflow involves structural model construction, 1 ns molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechnical calculations in 100 MD-sampled snapshots. The entire simulation workflow for 100 mutants was completed in 7 hours with 10 GPUs and 160 CPUs.

A sound, physical model to understand why propellerenes exhibit a conformation preference for either a C2 or D3 conformation that moves beyond a phenomenological explanation is needed. We have therefore performed a computational study to rationalize the conformational preference of propellerenes. Using an activation strain analysis approach, we find that the conformational preference of propellerenes is ultimately determined by the flexibility of the wings. When wings are relatively flexible, as is the case for ortho-substituted propellerenes, a favorable contraction of the radial bonds connecting the core and the propellerene wings is possible, and the more distorted C2 conformation will be preferred. The more rigid wings of benzenoid propellerenes, on the other hand, cannot deform sufficiently, and will therefore always adopt a D3 conformation. Our approach represents a unique method to pinpoint the conformational preferences of propellerenes, and, in principle, any sterically congested molecule.", "date": "2021-11-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To this end, two regularized second-order methods (including a new, size-extensive Brillioun-Wigner approach) are applied to the HEG, the one-dimensional Hubbard model and the graphene-water interaction energy.

The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein.

The reaction is catalysed by [Au(IPr)NiPr2] (IPr = N,N\u2019-1,3-Bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) and is 100 % atom efficient.

The cSNAr step is turnover-limiting for phenol-based nucleophiles while proteodeauration likely becomes turnover-limiting for aniline-based nucleophiles.

Herein, we conducted a systematic DFT study on the transition metal Co, Ni and alloyed nanoclusters/rods systems to simulate an atomic process from the initial nanoclusters growth to nanorods/wires. We found that the highly active sites of nanorods depend on an interesting electrostatic phenomenon. The surface electrostatic potential analysis shows that all nanoclusters and nanorods structures have formed \u03c3-hole. Unlike nanoclusters, the \u03c3-hole only appears at terminal sites in nanorods, called terminal \u03c3-hole. The elemental composition in nanorods has a certain influence on the maximal surface electrostatic potential (VS,max) i.e., terminal \u03c3-hole.

Spherical \u2018microbeads\u2019 made of plastics are now ubiquitous in a wide range of personal healthcare and cleansing products, used by the average North American consumer now at upwards of quadrillions per day.

Recent studies throughout the important Great Lakes system of North America have reported microbeads at essentially all locations examined. On the shorelines, in surface waters, throughout water columns, and in sediments of these freshwater systems, microbeads are now ever-present, and are accumulating in significant amounts. Their small and stable shape and composition, and limited pathways to degradation produce a long lifespan, with the capacity to remain in the freshwater environment for potentially hundreds of years.

We as well present findings from our own local study of microplastic/bead accumulation downstream of the Great Lakes, in the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers near Montreal. Aspects of microbead contamination represent a unique subset of the worldwide microplastic problem, in that much control remains over their life cycle and eventual fate.

Herein, a triadic photoanode comprising a porous TiO2 electron collector scaffold sensitized by CNx coupled to a molecular cobalt polyoxometalate (CoPOM = [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10\u2500) catalyst is reported. Complete water oxidation to dioxygen under visible (\u03bb > 420 nm) light irradiation is demonstrated, with photocurrents down to relatively low bias potentials (0.2 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic polymer is shown to act as an effective and non-sacrificial electrostatic linker for immobilization of the anionic CoPOM onto the negatively charged surface of CNx. The optimized deposition of CoPOM using the PEI linker translates directly into improved efficiency of the transfer of photogenerated holes to water molecules and to enhanced oxygen evolution.

Here we focus on understanding the role of different hydration properties of cation on the thermodynamics of clay swelling by water adsorption. We have used mica as the reference clay, Na+, Li+, and H+ ions as the interstitial cations, and performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of water adsorption in mica pores (of widths d = 4\u221240 \u00c5). We found that water adsorption in Na-, Li- and H-mica pores is qualitatively similar; however significant quantitative differences are observed, especially at smaller d. Higher water density in H-mica pores (\u03c1H) was expected due to the smaller size of H+ ions having higher hydration energy. However, a counter-intuitive trend of \u03c1Li > \u03c1Na > \u03c1b (bulk density) > \u03c1H was observed due to adsorption energy where the contribution of mica framework atoms was also found to be significant. The disjoining pressure (\u03a0), swelling free energy (\u2206\u03a9ex), and several structural properties of confined water and ions were calculated to perform thermodynamic analysis of the system. Our detailed calculations have captured the structural evolution of ions and water, especially the transitions from mono- to bi- and multilayer as a function of d. Oscillatory behavior in the \u03a0 and \u2206\u03a9ex profiles with diminishing to zero for d \u2265 11 \u00c5 is observed in all three mica systems. A shift in the location of global minima of \u2206\u03a9ex towards the higher d values and \u2206\u03a9ex becoming more repulsive is observed in the increasing order of hydration energy of Na+, Li+, and H + ions. The \u2206\u03a9ex for Na-mica is characterized by global minima at d = 6 \u00c5 corresponding to crystalline swelling, a significant barrier for crystalline swelling from d = 6 to 9 \u00c5 and lower for crystalline (d = 9 \u00c5) to osmotic swelling (d > 12 \u00c5). For Li-mica, the energy barrier for crystalline to osmotic swelling is lesser compared to the Na-mica system, whereas for H-mica the \u2206\u03a9ex > 0 for all d thus favoring osmotic swelling. We found that the hydration of cations by surface atoms plays a key role in the thermodynamics of clay swelling. The Na+ ions hydrate more number of surface oxygens, act as anchors, and hold the mica pore at d = 6 \u00c5 by sharing hydrating water with ions of opposite sides forming an electrostatically connected bridge of mica Na-water-Na-mica. The Li+ ions do hydrate surface oxygen atoms, albeit lesser number and sharing of hydration shell with nearby Li+  ions is also minimum. Both, surface hydration and water sharing, is minimum in the H+ ion case, as they are mostly present in the center of the pore as diffusive ions; thus exerting a consistent osmotic pressure on the mica frameworks, favoring swelling.", "date": "2021-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Chemical and electrochemical studies showed that one-electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi-reversible RhII/I process at \u20130.96 V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/0). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon Rh(II) species that was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41 V vs Fc+/0 that corresponds to iron-centered oxidation in the dppf backbone.

Building upon the many-body expansion formalism, we construct a series of MB-nrg models by fitting 1-body and 2-body reference energies calculated at the coupled cluster level of theory for large monomer and dimer training sets.

One solution to reduce the cumulative\nelectricity cost is demand side management, i.e., to adjust the power load based on time-variant electricity prices. However, varying the power load of CO2-electrolyzers often leads to changes in Faraday efficiency towards target components and thereby influences the product composition. Such deviations from the target product composition may be undesired for downstream processes. We tackle this challenge by proposing a flexible operating scheme for a modular eCO2R process. We formulate the economically optimal operation of an eCO2R process with multiple electrolyzer stacks as a parallel-machine scheduling problem. Adjusting the power load of each sub-process properly, we can save electricity costs while the desired product composition is met at any time. We apply an algorithm based on wavelet transform to solve the resulting large-scale nonlinear scheduling problem in tractable time. We solve each optimization problem with a deterministic global optimization software MAiNGO. We examine flexible operation of a modular eCO2R process for syngas production. The case studies show that the modular structure enables savings in the cumulative electricity cost of the eCO2R process via flexible operation while deviations in the syngas composition could be reduced. Also, the maximum ramping speed of the entire process is found to be a key parameter that strongly influences the cost saving.", "date": "2021-11-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Towards a transition into carbon-neutral future, it would be of great interest to reduce the fossil carbon footprint of the methanol synthesis by investigating alternative routes. A potential way to produce methanol in a sustainable manner is to utilize biogas, which is a carbon-neutral feedstock. However, it is challenging to provide sufficient biogas to large-scale plants. For this reason, we investigate in this paper the possibility of producing methanol in small-scale decentralised plants. We analysed the techno-economic-environmental performance of the downscaling of the standard methanol production via steam reforming and we compared it with the novel synthesis via direct CO2 hydrogenation with green H2. We observed that, with cheap electricity and high methanol value, these processes are both profitable, with a slight advantage for the steam-reforming route. However, the direct CO2 hydrogenation route can be improved by developing tailor-made less costly equipment, thus showing a potential for application in an energy storage context (i.e. with extremely cheap electricity). We also observed that the use of biomethane as feedstock for centralized methanol production shows a similar performance as the localized methanol synthesis, due to the high cost of the raw material. Therefore, we can conclude that, with every technology analysed, the shift towards a biogas-based methanol manufacture results in a more expensive product and that small-scale localized production may play a role in the bio-based methanol supply.

Understanding the solution state conformation and aggregation of conjugated polymers is crucial for controlling morphology during thin-film deposition and the subsequent electronic performance. However, a precise multiscale structure of solution state aggregates is lacking. Here, we present an in-depth small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of the solution state structure of an isoindigo-bithiophene based D-A polymer (PII-2T) as our primary system. Modeling the system as a combination of hierarchical fibrillar aggregates mixed with dispersed polymers, we extract information about conformation and multiscale aggregation and also clarify the physical origin of features often observed but unaddressed or misinterpreted in small-angle scattering patterns of conjugated polymers. The persistence length of the D-A polymer extracted from SAXS agrees well with a theoretical model based on the dihedral potentials. Additionally, we show that the broad high q structure factor peak seen in scattering profiles can be attributed to lamellar stacking occurring within the fibril aggregates and that the low q aggregate scattering is strongly influenced by the polymer molecular weight. Overall, the SAXS profiles of D-A polymers in general exhibit a sensitive dependence on the co-existence of fibrillar aggregate and dispersed polymer chain populations. We corroborate our findings from SAXS with electron microscopy of freeze-dried samples for direct imaging of fibrillar aggregates. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by fitting the scattering profiles of a variety of D-A polymers. The results presented here establish a picture of the D-A polymer solution state structure and provide a general method of interpreting and analyzing their scattering profiles.

This material was ABS based, and used barium titanate ceramic as the high-dielectric compound of the composite, and involved the use of a surfactant and a plasticizer to facilitate processing. Initial small amounts of material were compounded using an internal batch mixer, and studied using polymer thermal analysis techniques, such as thermogravimetric analysis, rheometry, and differential scanning calorimetry to determine the proper processing conditions.  The production of the material was then scaled-up through the use of a twin-screw extruder system, producing homogeneous pellets.

The stability and mechanics imparted by the interfacial layer of crystals underpin product shelf-life, as well as optimal processing conditions and performance in applications. Shelf-life is affected by the stability against bubble dissolution over a long time scale, which leads to slow compression of the interfacial layer. In processing flow conditions, the imposed deformation is characterized by much shorter time scales. In practical situations, the crystal layer is therefore subjected to deformation on extremely different time scales. Despite its importance, our understanding of the behavior of such interfacial layers at different time scales remains limited. To address this gap, here we investigate the dynamics of single, crystal-coated bubbles isolated from an oleofoam, at two extreme timescales: the diffusion-limited timescale characteristic of bubble dissolution 10,000 s, and a fast time scale characteristic of processing flow conditions, 0.001 s. In our experiments, slow deformation is obtained by bubble dissolution, and fast deformation in controlled conditions with real-time imaging is obtained using ultrasound-induced bubble oscillations. The experiments reveal that the fate of the interfacial layer is dramatically affected by the dynamics of deformation: after complete bubble dissolution, a continuous solid layer remains; while after fast, oscillatory deformation of the layer, small crystals are expelled from the layer. This observation shows promise towards developing stimuli-responsive systems, with sensitivity to deformation rate, in addition to the already known thermo- and photo-responsiveness of oleofoams.", "date": "2021-11-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

However, so far this aspect has been completely neglected in the discussion of Mo6S8 as cathode material for mono- and multivalent-ion batteries. In this work we therefore have studied the impact of dispersion forces on stability and kinetics of Mo6S8 intercalation compounds. For this purpose, a series of charge carriers (Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Zn, Al) has been investigated. Interestingly, dispersion forces are observed to only slightly affect the lattice spacing of the chevrel phase, nevertheless having a significant impact on insertion voltage and in particular on the charge carrier mobility in the material. Moreover, upon varying the charge carriers in the chevrel phase, their diffusion barriers are observed to scale linearly with the ion size, almost independent of the charge of the considered ions. This indicates a rather unique and geometry dominated diffusion mechanism in the chevrel phase. The consequences of these findings for the ion mobility in the chevrel phase will be carefully discussed.", "date": "2021-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Using a host of analytical techniques, we reveal how modulating the terephthalic acid linker with hydroxy, amine, and fluorine groups impacts the resulting physical and electronic structure of the Ni catalytic sites. These changes further impact the selectivity for H2O2, with the Ni-Amine-MON reaching near 100% Faradaic efficiency at minimal overpotential for the 2e- H2O2 pathway in alkaline electrolyte. Finally, we translate the Ni-Amine-MON catalyst to a gas-diffusion reaction geometry and demonstrate a H2O2 partial current density of 200 mA/cm2 while maintaining 85% Faradaic efficiency. In all, this study puts forth a simple route to catalyst modulation for highly effective H2O2 electrosynthesis.", "date": "2021-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The isosurface representation of the electron charge density allows us to incorporate the rigorous geometric constraints of closed surfaces towards the analysis and chemical interpretation of the charge density response to perturbations.  Visual inspection of 2D isosurface motion resulting from applied external electric fields reveals how isosurface curvature flows within and between atoms, and that a molecule can be uniquely and completely partitioned into chemically significant regions of positive and negative curvature.  These concepts reveal that carbonyl oxygen activation proceeds primarily through curvature and charge redistribution within rather than between Bader atoms.  Using gradient bundle analysis\u2014the partitioning of formaldehyde into infinitesimal volume elements bounded by QTAIM zero flux surfaces\u2014the observations from visual isosurface inspection are verified.

These lipids have a range of uses including nutritional supplements and precursors to biodiesel. Single-cell thraustochytrids are especially attractive in this regard in that they can produce over 50% of their weight as triglycerides. Furthermore, the distribution of saturated and unsaturated triglycerides can be modulated by changes in strain variation and modulation of fermentation conditions. Nonetheless, there remains a need for versatile downstream processing to enrich these so-called \u201csingle cell oils\u201d into classes based on degree of unsaturation. In this study, we report a novel strategy for enriching saturated triglycerides produced in thraustochytrids. The method features direct reaction of elemental sulfur with the algae oil extract. The sulfur copolymerizes with >90% of the unsaturated triglycerides, providing a new route to a class of materials previously used in environmental remediation, Li-S battery cathodes, slow-release fertilisers, and insulation. The unreacted oil is enriched in saturated triglycerides, which can be isolated by extraction for potential use in biodiesel production.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant attention as platforms for catalysis at site-isolated, interstitial catalyst sights. Unlike homogeneous catalysis, relatively few strategies have been advanced to evaluate the origin of catalytic activity in MOF-promoted reactions. Many of the MOFs that have been examined as potential catalysts are comprised of molecular constituents that represent viable catalysts in the absence of the extended MOF lattice, and thus interfacial sites and leached homogeneous species represent potential sources of catalyst activity. Here, we demonstrate that analysis of deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and olefin epoxidation diastereoselectivity provides direct probes of the origin of catalytic activity in MOF-promoted oxidation reactions. These analyses support direct involvement of lattice-based Fe sites in the turnover-limiting step of C\u2013H activation with Fe-MOF-74-based materials (i.e., the MOF functions as a bona fide catalyst) and evidence that Cu2-based MOF MIL-125-Cu2O2 functions as a solid-state initiator for solution-phase oxidation chemistry and is not involved in the turnover limiting step  (i.e., the MOF does not function as a catalyst). We anticipate that the simple experiments described here will provide a valuable tool for clarifying the role of MOFs in C\u2013H oxidation reactions.", "date": "2021-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, developments in Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have primarily revolved around the ordered crystalline state, and the glassy state of PBAs has not yet been explored. Here we report the discovery of a disordered glassy state of the PBA via mechanically induced crystal\u2013glass transformation.

Most of the recent research on electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction (CO2R) focuses on achieving maximum selectivity for desired products at the highest possible current density. This approach assumes that maximising current density leads to the lowest cost of CO2R (e.g. $\u00b7kg-1 CO2 converted) because it requires the lowest catalyst loadings and electrode area per kg of CO2 treated and thus minimising the electrolyser equipment cost. Using a techno-economic analysis (TEA) model with experimental data from a two-cell vapor fed electrolyser, we show this assumption is not valid for CO2 conversion to CO if the process model accounts for relationships between current density, selectivity, cell voltage, ohmic losses, and product separation costs. Instead, our model predicts the lowest CO production costs at current densities from 500 \u2013 700 A\u00b7m-2. At current densities above 1000 A\u00b7m-2, growing ohmic losses in the electrolyser lead to increasing power costs that become much larger than any capital savings related to reduced electrode area at the higher current density. Further, we investigate different opportunities that could bring down the CO production cost, however, in all the cases, the lowest CO production cost was found at current densities between 600 \u2013 1400 A\u00b7m-2. This work also provides insights that can help identify feasible design spaces for both catalysts and electrolysers to develop CO2 conversion technologies that could soon compete on a cost basis with the natural reforming technologies to produce CO (0.60 $\u00b7kg-1 market price).", "date": "2021-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Reaction Engineering; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

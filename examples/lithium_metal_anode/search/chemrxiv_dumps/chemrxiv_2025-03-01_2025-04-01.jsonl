Nevertheless, effective strategies to leverage these models for 2D COF synthesis remain underdeveloped, and the specialized expertise required, combined with the high computational costs of exploring the vast chemical space, poses additional barriers to their practical application. In this work, we present a machine learning framework, named MlCOFSyn, designed to assist in the synthesis of 2D COFs.

These functionalities are critical for the controlled synthesis of 2D COFs but have been largely underexplored due to the lack of accessible theoretical tools.

The results indicate that while CTAB exhibits similar behavior to NaI, the formation of the compact pair state in CTAB is significantly less active compared to NaI. This reduced formation leads to a noticeable delay in the generation of separated species, a process that occurs more efficiently in the NaI system.

It has been experimentally shown that the ratio and chemical nature of terminal groups, Tx, present on the Ti3C2Tx (Tx = O, OH or F) surface under electrochemical conditions affect selectivity and activity trends of the MXene electrocatalyst. In the present manuscript, we use electronic structure theory calculations to comprehend the selectivity trends in the CO2RR over Ti3C2Tx with different terminal groups, including *OH and *F adsorbates. We show that the traditional modeling approach used in calculations to derive activity and selectivity trends, which only includes the most stable intermediate state in the analysis, is not consistent with experimental observations. Rather, it is necessary to include energetically less favorable intermediate states and coadsorbates in the analysis of mechanistic pathways. Remarkably, the inclusion of less stable intermediates and coadsorbates opens up new reaction channels that are energetically more favorable, and only by considering these extensions are we able to map our results to the experimental data.

While great progress has been achieved for InP, covering the visible range, the development of infrared-emitting InAs NCs has been relatively low-paced. This is due to the synthetic challenges arising from the highly covalent bonding in InAs and the small choice of available arsenic sources, which are essentially limited to tris(trimethylsilyl)arsine and tris(dimethylamino)arsine. Most importantly, wider adoption of these syntheses is hampered by their reliance on hazardous pyrophoric and costly reagents. In this work, we report for the first time the multigram synthesis of tribenzoylarsine, which can be used as a novel nonvolatile, nonpyrophoric, and hence safer, precursor for metal arsenide nanoparticles. We demonstrate that tribenzoylarsine reacts with indium oleate without additional reducing agents yielding small (~2 nm) InAs NCs. By tuning synthesis parameters (in particular, the addi-tion of zinc oleate or using continuous injection) it is possible to cover the photoluminescence range of 630\u2013780 nm with full width at half maximum as low as 170\u2013210 meV, which is a very competitive value to the existing synthetic approaches.

Starting from the extraction of total RNA to the LC-MS analysis of digested RNA, the commonly used approach is used in SqMS. To eliminate the biases that resulted from MS ionization efficiency, the SqMS method adjusts the MS signal of each ribonucleoside with a corresponding factor. Each adjustment factor is derived from measuring a serially diluted control sample, which contains a comparable set of RNA modifications as in our samples of interest. By using a post-column UV detector and the information on molar absorptivity, the ribonucleoside concentration in each diluted control sample is determined and plotted against the corresponding MS signal. The resulting dilution curve of each detectable ribonucleoside is equivalent to the standard curve, thus no ribonucleoside standard is required.

Quorum sensing (QS) systems are microbial communication mechanisms that regulate gene expression based on population density and are known to be more active in biofilm-associated bacteria than in planktonic bacteria. We hypothesize that bacteria dispersed from biofilms in DWDS influence QS-related mRNA levels detected in tap water effluent. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, a common bacterium found in DWDS, as a model organism, we examined the expression of the lasI gene, a key component of the las QS system, responsible for synthesizing QS signaling molecules.

Our experiments confirmed that P. aeruginosa exhibits significantly higher lasI mRNA levels in biofilms compared to planktonic states.

Aminated cinnamic acid analogs (ACAA) were tested for vacuum stability, absorption at 355 nm, crystal size, and molecular coverage. Among them, 4-aminocinnamic acid (ACA) and 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamic acid (DMACA) were found to perform at similar or superior levels for lipid IMS compared to conventional MALDI matrices. ACA generated few in-source fragments, leading to better visualization of thermally labile molecules such as gangliosides. ACA was compared to 2,5-dihydroxyacetophone (DHA) for ganglioside imaging using murine brain tissue. ACA outperformed DHA by generating higher-quality MALDI images due to its higher sensitivity for ganglioside and higher extinction coefficient at 355 nm. ACA also produces a more accurate ganglioside molecular signature with reduced in-source fragmentation, minimizing the production of GM1-like fragments from other gangliosides compared to DHA. Due to its strong extinction coefficient at 355 nm and its vacuum stability, DMACA was a prime candidate for dual polarity phospholipid MALDI IMS at high spatial resolution. DMACA outperformed both 1,5-diaminonaphtalene (DAN) and DHA at their respective laser power in terms of intensity, signal-to-noise, and annotations. DMACA also allows for lower laser power to be used without compromising sensitivity, which allowed a reduction in the spot size from ~6 \u00b5m to ~4.5\u00b5m. This lower laser burn pattern allows true 5 \u00b5m spatial resolution MALDI IMS without oversampling while maintaining high quality signal from a commercial timsTOF fleX instrument without any modifications.

Highly super-specular scattering is observed in the impulsive scattering channel that is attributed to anisotropic momentum transfer to the liquid surface. The thermal desorption channel exhibits a cos\u03b8 angular distribution. Compared to Ne scattering from dodecane, fractional energy loss in the impulsive scattering channel is much larger across a wide range of deflection angles. A soft-sphere model is applied to investigate the kinematics of energy transfer between the scatterer and liquid surface.

In such cases, the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr  \"half-and-half\" functional (BH&H-LYP) has emerged as a go-to choice, especially in time-dependent density functional theory calculations for excitation energies.   Here, we examine the assumption that 50%  exact exchange sacrifices thermochemical accuracy, using a sequence of functionals B(alpha)LYP with different  percentages of exact exchange, 0 <= alpha <= 100.   We find that alpha = 50, corresponding to BH&H-LYP, is nearly optimal and affords accuracy similar to B3LYP  for thermochemistry, barrier heights, and excitation energies.  Although  atomization energies are significantly less accurate with 50% Hartree-Fock exchange, this  emerges as the sole rationale for the taboo against values alpha > 25. Overall, BH&H-LYP emerges as a reasonable choice for problems that are dominated by self-interaction error,  including charge-transfer complexes and core-level excitation energies.  While B3LYP remains more accurate for  valence excitation energies, the use of 50% exact exchange appears to be an acceptable compromise and BH&H-LYP can be used without  excessive concern over its diminished accuracy for ground-state properties.", "date": "2025-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This causes inconsistent predictions for the same molecule based on the chosen resonance form in common property prediction frameworks like Chemprop, which implements a directed message-passing neural network (D-MPNN) architecture on the input molecular graph. To address this issue of resonance variance, we introduce the Resonance Invariant Graph Representation (RIGR) of molecules that ensures, by construction, that all resonance structures are mapped to a single representation, eliminating the need to choose from or generate multiple resonance structures. Implemented with the D-MPNN architecture, RIGR is evaluated on a large dataset with resonance-exhibiting radicals and closed-shell molecules, comparing it against the Chemprop featurizer. Using 60% fewer features, RIGR demonstrates comparable or superior prediction performance. Alternative approaches, such as data augmentation with resonance forms, are assessed, and their limitations are explored.

The character of the roots is determined from literature results for the MBHE-HL, by analogy with the TTHE-HL. These results are based on parallel flow and counter-current flow of the fluid in the intermediate tube, for a wide range of parameters.

Efficient and case-adaptive friction models are crucial for the simulation accuracy of liquid transients. The paper reviews different mathematical models and their numerical implementation for compressible liquid transient simulations. Different aspects of compressible liquid transient modeling and simulation are profoundly explored with the help of relevant literature. The major aspects reviewed are the high-pressure applications of liquids, compressible modeling of liquids, gas shock tube simulation and its extension to liquid shock cases, the importance of numerical techniques such as Riemann solvers in simulation, the need for the development of benchmark results in compressible liquid flows, the evolution of unsteady friction modeling and limitations of models, and scope for improvement of valve-induced surge modeling. Almost every application where liquid compressibility effects are significant is covered under this review. A range of liquid equations of state for different liquids are discussed, and the compressible modeling of liquid water is profoundly analyzed by evaluating the performance of different state equations for the fluid. The significance of the gas shock tube problem in the branch of compressible flows is discussed, and the ways in which it could be extended to compressible liquid shock cases are elaborated through the conceptual problem of the water shock tube. The numerical techniques, especially the Riemann solvers, and the evolution of their different variants are explained with the help of relevant literature. Different formulations for steady and unsteady friction that are generally employed in mathematical models are analyzed, and their limitations for complex transient cases are discussed.

We developed a DPD gas model with exponential repulsive potentials to simulate the air-water interface, coupled with a systematic temperature scaling methodology that enables parameter transferability across different temperatures. Our model accurately captures the air-water surface tension over a broad temperature range and reproduces experimental surface pressure-area isotherms of DPPC monolayers in quantitative agreement at 293K and within experimental uncertainty at higher temperatures. The simulations reveal detailed insights into the liquid condensed (LC) and liquid expanded (LE) phase coexistence, characterized by local thickness variations and lipid tail orientational order. At low temperatures, we observe distinct LC domains with highly ordered lipid tails coexisting with LE domains, which progressively diminish in size and mix with LE phases as temperature increases toward the critical point. Complementary experimental measurements using a temperature-controlled Langmuir trough and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirm these phase transitions and domain formations, providing direct visualization of temperature-dependent morphological changes in DPPC monolayers. The model successfully predicts the temperature-dependent structural transitions in both monolayers and bilayers, including the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition, with equilibrium properties matching experimental measurements.

Utilizing the hierarchical-equations-of-motion (HEOM) approach to capture non-Markovian and non-perturbative effects, we analyze both cavity-chromophore and LSP-chromophore systems. Our analysis reveals that the optimal antioxidation performance depends on the competition between cavity-chromophore coupling and cavity-bath (dissipation) interaction. Importantly, in the strong cavity-chromophore coupling regime, increasing cavity dissipation can enhance antioxidation through quantum coherence-induced population transfer. Conversely, in the weak cavity-chromophore coupling regime, increasing cavity dissipation can counterintuitively reduce the antioxidation capability due to a quantum Zeno-like effect. Furthermore, in the LSP-chromophore system, engineering the LSP structure, particularly the LSP dissipation rate, can similarly be used to optimize the antioxidation effect.

Many currently available commercial programs excel at modeling traditional reversible inhibitors. However, many of these non-covalent docking programs are unsuitable for docking TCIs because they do not model the post-reaction protein-ligand structure. Attempts to modify existing methods or formulate new ones that can simulate covalent docking often utilize classical mechanical potentials that inherently lack the ability to modulate bonding topologies in an effort to reduce computational overhead. Not only are such modifications ill-suited to covalent docking, they can lead to a reduction in docking accuracy and impose limitations on the transferrability of a method to other protein systems. Herein we aim to address these shortcomings by utilizing a hybrid simulation workflow that employs both classical and quantum mechanical (QM/MM) potentials capable of bond rearrangement. The workflow, named CovCIFDock, is comprised of modules natively available in CHARMM and is an extension of the recently published CIFDock flexible docking method. Protein-ligand complexes are docked classically in the pre-reactive state in order to facilitate computational speed, after which a QM/MM minimization is conducted to form the protein-ligand bond and refine the final pose.

We found that long-chain fatty acid conjugated ZnDPA sensors do not distinguish anionic membranes as effectively. Furthermore, cellular uptake and plasma membrane retention of ZnDPA sensors can be significantly modulated depending on the type of lipid conjugation used.

Excellent progress has been achieved in the understanding of polyelectrolytes behaviors at the macroscopic level; electrostatic interaction and counterion/water release is believed to be dominant in the long distance recognition stage and in the association stage respectively. Physics based mean-field theories are dominant, and notably, the Manning-Oosawa counterion condensation theory could well predict the effective charges of polyelectrolytes. However, short-range interactions are often ignored in these theories, resulting in largely unknown atomistic structures of solvated polyelectrolytes and their subsequent solid/liquid complexes upon association. An interdisciplinary and data-driven approach is taken in this work in order to find a framework to predict the counterion locations precisely in each polyelectrolyte and the subsequent polyelectrolyte self-organization behaviors, and the results show that no known theory could be able to address this confusion. A new chemistry theory of \u201cadaptive delocalization of charges and electrons via dynamic chemical bonding\u201d is introduced here for creating the bridges, and the physics-based origin of the theory is also discussed. Our new theory indicates the quantum effect of electron pairs\u2019 orbital exchange is not only common in the electron shell of individual atoms of the periodic table, but also is widely existing in organic molecules/polymers, particularly in the hydrate state or solid state. The new theory is further demonstrated to be able to explain the nature of many non-covalent interactions including Argin-Argin interactions/CH-O interactions/CH-\u03c0 interactions/alkali metal-O interactions, the atomistic mechanisms of basic synthetic methods (F, O nucleophilic substitutions), hydration/ionization of Br\u00d8sted acids and polyelectrolytes, hydrophobic effect, the origin of hydrophobicity of fluorocarbon, competitive ion pairing, selected specific ion effect and the Hofmeister series. With the new set of knowledge, the atomistic counterion structures of polyelectrolyte complexes/complex coacervation are well predicted based on the molecule structures, and the subsequent dynamic change depending on concentration and salt concentration is also predictable qualitatively. The adaptive delocalization theory consisting of three chemistry laws is demonstrated to govern polyelectrolyte self-organization behaviors and thermodynamic behaviours in synthetic aqueous solution, evidenced by a good agreement between theory and reported experimental facts on polyelectrolyte ionization/association (including charge regulation). The broad impact in rational design of drugs (water replacement and multivalent bonding), catalysis (dehydrative amination and asymmetric phase-transfer alkylation), and polymers (solubility in organic solvents, stealth effect (anti-fouling property), cation resulted doping of conjugated polyelectrolytes) with predicting rationales, as well as in advanced understanding of the origin of static charges on polymer surface at molecule level is also discussed.", "date": "2025-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry; Biopolymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Irradiation experiments typically showed that compounds bearing only carboxylic acids and/or alcohols on a saturated carbon backbone were the most resistant to photochemical degradation, but also that some compounds with CRAM-like formulas and chemical functionality were notably more stable in the presence of DOM. Within microbial incubations, all of our synthesized CRAMs were entirely stable after 8-months in various aquatic settings.

CueO has been studied as a direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalyst owing to its high dioxygen-reducing activity. Our previous study demonstrated reductive inactivation in the DET-type bioelectrocatalysis of CueO in the presence of Cu2+, which was known to facilitate substrate oxidation in solution. Considering the structural data, we hypothesized that sixth-bound copper (Cu6) induced reductive inactivation. CueO variants deleting putative Cu6 ligands (His145, His406, and Met417) were characterized bioelectrochemically. As expected, the reductive inactivation was significantly suppressed in H145A while slightly suppressed in H406A variants. In contrast, Cu2+ tolerance was slightly decreased in the M417A variant. These results indicate that His145 and His406 are the major and minor ligands of Cu6 that induce reductive inactivation, respectively, whereas Met417 might contribute to stabilizing the Cu6 coordination sphere. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of chronoamperograms representing the time-dependent Cu2+ response revealed that the deletion of Cu6 ligands affected both the binding and redox kinetics of the enzyme-substrate-copper complex. Additionally, Cu6-induced inactivation was observed using an enzymatic assay in solution for the oxidation of 1,1\u2032-ferrocenedimethanol. Therefore, reductive inactivation likely occurs in concert with biological Cu+ oxidation, which may contribute to the regulation of the Cu2+/Cu+ ratio.", "date": "2025-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Conventional methods struggle in controlling electrode tip size and length, reproducibility and success rate of fabrication. Here, we established a reliable, straightforward and user-friendly method to fabricate and shape CFNEs, enabling control over tip diameter, length, and tailor tip geometry. This method utilizes real-time microscopy imaging for positioning cylindrical carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs) into a potassium hydroxide droplet, where a series of time- and voltage- controlled pulses enables a gentle, stepwise electrochemical etching of the CFME tips. The microscope-guided electrode positioning determines the etched region, while voltage pulse size and number control the extent of CFME tip removal. Hence, real-time adjustments to electrode positioning at the droplet\u2019s liquid-air interface and incremental voltage pulses enable precise electrode sculpturing, akin to woodcarving with a knife. Using this method, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of short (10 \u03bcm) CFNEs with tip diameters of ~100 nm and sculptured into two distinct geometries: cone and needle shaped electrodes. These CFNEs exhibited excellent electrochemical properties and were employed for low-current noise electroanalysis of dopamine (DA) released from individual ~200 nm liposomes preloaded with DA. The data, supported by in silico simulation, suggest that electrode shape influences detection efficiency of liposome sub-populations based on their size, thus highlighting the critical role of electrode geometry in vesicle-based electroanalysis studies.", "date": "2025-03-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Electrochemical Analysis; Nanodevices; Nanofabrication; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

CRPC is challenging to diagnose, as it often manifests with few to no symptoms. Imaging agents that allow visualization of changes in AR signaling remain a high-priority goal. Here, we report on the development of visible- and near-infrared AR inhibitors for fluorescence imaging (ARi-FL). On the basis of an aryloxycyclohexane AR antagonist, we incorporated a neolinker into the nonsteroidal scaffold, which we could subsequently conjugate to fluorophores via an amide-coupling reaction. Cell assays confirmed that ARi-FL had a high binding affinity to AR (~13 nM). The nondimeric form of AR in individual cells could be visualized in human AR-expressing cells, showing a correlation with AR protein levels, which were blockable (10X). In vivo and ex vivo properties were evaluated in animal models of AR-expressing human prostate cancer using noninvasive imaging systems in the near infrared window. The ARi-FLs and the accompanying experiments demonstrate effective, selective binding to AR with practical synthetic yields and notable metabolic stability, addressing a long-standing challenge in the field of AR-targeted diagnostics. ARi-FL permitted semi-quantitative labeling and noninvasive measurements of AR levels. ARi-FL and analogs may prove to be valuable tools for studying and monitoring the mechanisms of AR signaling, progression, and treatment in both preclinical and clinical settings.

We hypothesize that a two-phase glue made by blending a self-healing hydrogel (SHH) made of starch, PVA and borax, with silicone will form a bridge between the two materials eliminating need for surface and bulk modification processes. Experiment: The glue was made by dispersing drops of the SHH in silicone, followed by forming a thin layer of this dispersion on a typical silicone surface. Curing of the dispersion bonds it with the later. To bond hydrogel to this glue, its top surface was removed mechanically or chemically, to expose the gel phase to the surface, on which the SHH prepolymer mix was crosslinked. Results: The hydrogel particles in the glue acted as anchors for the hydrogel layer to bond to it; the silicone phase of it, bonded to the elastomeric layer, thereby creating strong attachment between the two. The bonding strength of SHH-TPG was estimated via pull-off experiments which showed that debonding force increases linearly with solid fraction of SHH and sub-linearly with the ageing time of the bonded interface  .

Therefore, experimental realization of potential \u201cbreakthrough\u201d MOFs is hindered by uncertainty on the synthesis conditions that would allow the constituent nodes and linkers to self-assemble into the targeted MOF structure. Here, a multiscale endeavor using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, followed by metadynamics with DFT-informed classical atomistic potentials, followed by standard molecular dynamics (MD) and Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX) simulations with a metadynamics-informed, coarse-grained (CG) model, was used to study the self-assembly mechanism of cubic-symmetry porous crystals inspired by the IRMOF-n family of MOFs. Mechanistic differences were examined for different values of node-linker coordination strength\u2014understood as the free energy penalty for breaking a coordination bond in a solvated environment. Our integrated analyses of HREX-derived free energy surfaces and standard MD trajectories indicate that at coordination strengths typical of the IRMOF-n family in dimethylformamide (DMF) (i.e., 52 kJ/mol), disassembled nodes and linkers are favored to overcome a small 1.3 kJ/mol free energy barrier to first form solid amorphous clusters, which then overcome a series of barriers (the largest of which is 3.7 kJ/mol) to heal and form ordered, more stable, cubic-symmetry crystals. This healing seems to occur through the splintering/reattaching of small clusters from/to large clusters. Our analyses also suggest that if coordination strength is moderately weakened (e.g., to 40 kJ/mol), crystals form without the preliminary formation of amorphous clusters. However, further coordination strength weakening (e.g., to 36 kJ/mol) makes the formation of sizable crystals unfavorable thermodynamically. On the other hand, strengthening the coordination would increase the free energy barrier to heal the amorphous clusters into crystals. Accordingly, if coordination becomes too strong (e.g., 65+ kJ/mol), healing may become unlikely. In practical terms, our study suggests that MOF formation is favored only when the free energy of coordination, accounting for solvent effects, falls within a relatively narrow range (approximately 40 to 65 kJ/mol), at least at 300 K, for MOFs with cubic symmetries.", "date": "2025-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding that elucidates the relationship between catalytic selectivity and mechanistic pathways has yet to be achieved. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the OER mechanism in a series of Ca-based perovskites. Our findings indicate that early transition metals in CaMO3 favor a conventional OER pathway, characterized by a four-step concerted proton-electron transfer process leading to O2 formation from H2O. In contrast, perovskites containing Mn, Fe, and Co exhibit two proton-electron transfer steps, favoring the selective formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) over O2. This shift in selectivity is attributed to polaronic effects, which strengthen the metal-oxo bonding, enabling a transition from conventional OER to H2O2 evolution. Furthermore, we reveal that the thermodynamic stability of these perovskites in aqueous environments is significantly influenced by pH, where acidic conditions destabilize the perovskite structure. These insights suggest that modulating polaronic effects and maintaining high pH environments are key to optimizing both the stability and catalytic activity of perovskite oxides in OER applications.", "date": "2025-03-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In the present research, we introduce a new platform and broadly applicable technique for the difluoromethylation of various N-heterocyclic substrates using low-cost and commercially available bromo(difluoro)acetic acid in the presence of K2CO3 at room temperature to produce >70 desired complex Het\u2212NCF2H products featuring either imine and/or ketone functional group, which were hitherto impossible to produce.

Crucial to success is the more nucleophilicity and less steric hindrance on the nitrogen atom of the heteroarene ring that enables N-difluoromethylative dearomatization of N-heterocycles. Overall, this unique transformation was transition metal-free, practical, scalable (>50 grams), tolerant to diverse reactive functional groups with excellent chemoselectivity, adaptable to diversities of challenging N-heteroaromatic ring systems, and could be used for the late-stage diversification of 18 commercial drug molecules.

Rate constants were estimated at 25 \u00b0C using the pKas and utilizing a simplified Eigen equation without statistical factors. Steps with estimated rate constants \u2265 10^3 M^-1 s^-1 \u2013 a conservative boundary \u2013 were included in the data set. An additional set of 15,138 proton transfer steps were estimated using the Eigen-Bernasconi equation for proton transfers from carbon acids to heteroatom bases for which intrinsic rate constants and Br\u00f8nsted \ud835\udefd values were known. Steps for proton transfers from carbon with estimated rate constants \u2265 10^-1 M^-1 s^-1 were added to the data set. Each entry was encoded in SMIRKS format, which is commonly used for machine learning, with electron-flow specification. The objective of this work was the creation of a structurally rich data set rather than accurate calculation of rate constants.", "date": "2025-03-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this position, CcO receives electrons, which were generated during cellular respiration, and uses these electrons to reduce dioxygen to water, thereby acting as an electron sink in the respiratory chain. As electrons and protons are taken up from opposite sides of the membrane, the enzymatic activity of CcO contributes to the generation of an electrochemical gradient acting across the membrane hosting the respiratory chain proteins, which drives the synthesis of ATP. Due to its importance in bioenergetics, CcO is subject of intense studies for decades. Nevertheless, hardly any information is currently available regarding the proton uptake rate of CcO, especially regarding the impact of the electrochemical gradient on this rate. In this study, a single-proteoliposome assay is employed to follow proton uptake of individual CcOs from Rhodobacter sphaeroides operating against the action of a well-defined pH gradient. Our measurements reveal that proton uptake is not affected by small pH gradients (< 0.7 pH units) and decays exponentially for larger pH gradients. Furthermore, a linear dependence of substrate concentration on the proton uptake rate is observed over more than 3 orders of magnitude. The obtained scaling laws are surprisingly simple, considering the fact that 4 protons have to be taken up to reduce dioxygen to water, and are discussed in terms of the sequential uptake of protons and electrons occurring during CcOs catalytic cycle.", "date": "2025-03-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Residual detergent in DLPs is not exchangeable with the surrounding solution. This work focuses on DLPs formed by the transmembrane C-terminal domain of the human amyloid precursor protein (C99), although evidence of DLP formation by other membrane proteins is provided. Size exclusion chromatography, light scattering and electron microscopy showed that C99-DLPs are spherical with modest polydispersity (7-16 monomers) and are stable for months in solution. C99-DLPs revert to traditional protein-detergent complexes upon addition of detergent. Circular dichroism and 2D IR spectroscopies revealed that \u03b2-sheet content is significantly higher in C99-DLPs than that of C99 in detergent micelles. C99-DLPs were taken up by mammalian cells, trafficked to a perinuclear location and appeared to accumulate in or next to LC3B-positive punctae, which likely are stalled autophagosomes. C99-DLPs appeared to remain intact in cells as there was no evidence of protein degradation over a period of days. This work challenges the broad assumption that native single-span membrane proteins always require either a bilayer or membrane mimetic to prevent aggregation / precipitation from solutions.

A key mode of action for ASOs relies upon RNase H-engagement in the nucleus, however, the site for mature mRNA is the cytoplasm. This disconnect limits the efficacy and biomedical applications of ASOs. In this paper, we have established a new mechanism of action for achieving potent and targeted mRNA knockdown by leveraging a lysosomal degradation pathway. To achieve this, we employ autophagosome-tethering compound (ATTEC) technology that utilises bifunctional small molecules for lysosomal trafficking. In this manner, to achieve degradation of target mRNA located in the cytoplasm, we conjugated an ATTEC warhead, ispinesib, to RNase H-inactive ASOs. These fully 2\u2032-O-Methylated RNase H-inactive ASOs have higher chemical stability and tighter mRNA binding than conventional \u2018gapmer\u2019 sequences, but cannot be recognised by RNase H. Our RNase H-inactive ASO-ispinesib conjugates produced a higher degree of knockdown than even state-of-the-art RNase H-active \u2018gapmer\u2019 ASOs. Using lysosomal trafficking antisense oligonucleotide (LyTON) technology, we knock down Menin (MEN1), a promising clinical target in leukemias. Engineered to degrade mRNA independent of RNase H recognition, LyTONs will enable gene silencing using oligonucleotide chemistries with higher chemical stability, tighter mRNA binding affinity, and improved cell delivery profiles.

However, the efficient separation of REE ions from these sources remains challenging due to their similar chemical properties and the complex interactions within dilute mixtures. This study explores an electrohydrodynamic-based approach for separating REE ions from a dilute feedstock containing competing cations using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) continuum model that incorporates ion transport via diffusion, advection, and electromigration. Numerical simulations highlight the competition between flow velocity, microfluidic channel dimensions, and electrohydrodynamic effects in determining separation selectivity. We showed that the e-field-based separation process is governed by three distinct regimes: (i) a diffusion-advection balance regime, where diffusion counteracts flow-induced advection, resulting in limited ion separation and reducing separation selectivity by promoting a more uniform ion concentration distribution; (ii) an electromigration-dominant regime, where the applied electric field overcomes advection effects, enabling selective ion migration and enhanced separation selectivity; and (iii) an advection-dominant regime, where high flow velocities dominate electromigration, leading to poor separation performance. Our results reveal that optimal separation is achieved when electromigration dominates over both diffusion and advection, which occurs under conditions of slow flow and strong electric fields. Additionally, narrower channel geometries intensify local electric field gradients, further enhancing electromigration and improving ion selectivity but also increasing sensitivity to flow velocity variations. This work emphasizes the need to address charge neutrality issues in CFD modeling and, more importantly, a fundamental understanding of the interplay between flow dynamics, channel design, and electrohydrodynamic forces to develop efficient methods for extracting critical metals from dilute feedstocks.

However, such studies are more challenging for large and macrocyclic anionophores, as their preparation is usually more complicated, limiting the number of compounds tested in anion transport studies.\nHere we present a series of twelve macrocyclic bambusuril anion transporters to investigate how variations in fluorinated substituents affect their transport properties.

IP6 is challenging to study due to its phytase instability and propensity to precipitate. Here we suggest that the thiophosphate bioisostere, myo-inositol hexakisthiophosphate (IT6), will mitigate these issues, as thiophosphate substitution has been found to be phytase resistant and improve solubility. Assessment of the chemical properties of IT6 has indeed validated these characteristics. In addition, we performed biophysical characterization of IT6 binding to the virulence factors Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium AvrA, Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopA, and Clostridioides difficile TcdB.

Their performance is typically evaluated on in-distribution (ID) data, i.e., data originating from the same distribution as the training data. However, the real-world applications of such models often involve molecules that are more distant from the training data, which necessitates assessing their performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this work, we investigate and evaluate the performance of twelve machine learning models, including classical approaches like random forests, as well as graph neural network (GNN) methods, such as message-passing graph neural networks, across eight data sets using seven splitting strategies for OOD data generation. First, we investigate what constitutes OOD data in the molecular domain for bioactivity and ADMET prediction tasks. In contrast to the common point of view, we show that both classical machine learning and GNN models work well (not substantially different from random splitting) on data split based on Bemis-Murcko scaffolds. Splitting based on chemical similarity clustering (K-means clustering using ECFP4 fingerprints) poses the hardest challenge for both types of models. Second, we investigate the extent to which ID and OOD performance have a positive linear relationship. If a positive correlation holds, models with the best performance on the ID data can be selected with the promise of having the best performance on OOD data. We show that the strength of this linear relationship is strongly related to how the OOD data is generated, i.e., which splitting strategies are used for generating OOD data. While the correlation between ID and OOD performance for scaffold splitting is strong (Pearson r \u223c 0.9), this correlation decreases significantly for cluster-based splitting (Pearson r \u223c 0.4). Therefore, the relationship can be more nuanced, and a strong positive correlation is not guaranteed for all OOD scenarios.

Despite its significance, a mechanistic understanding of PEGylation\u2019s role in enhancing protein stability is incomplete, limiting the ability to design PEGylated proteins with predictable properties. Solvation, a well-known driving force in protein folding and stability, is hypothesized to play a central role in protein stabilization via PEGylation, but molecular mechanisms underlying solvent-driven stabilization are not well understood. Here, we investigated solvent dynamics and the interactions of solvent with the PEGylated carbohydrate recognition domain of human Galectin-3 (Gal3C) in aqueous solutions. Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, which captures subpicosecond molecular ensembles, revealed polymer-length dependent differences in protein dynamics and solvent dynamics for PEGylated Gal3C. Slower solvent dynamics correlated with increased conjugate thermal stability. Complementing these data, multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy provided evidence that Gal3C conjugated to longer PEG forms a non-covalent interaction \u201cshroud\u201d, which correlated with changes in dynamics of the solvent and protein backbone. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations supported an interpretation of the experimental results that PEGylation did not reduce the protein\u2019s solvent accessible surface area. The integration of these data challenge the idea that PEGylation stabilizes conjugated proteins by dehydrating a protein\u2019s surface. Instead, these data support a mechanism whereby PEGylation improves protein stability by stabilizing the protein\u2019s solvation shell. These insights offer guidance for optimizing polymer length to achieve the desired thermal stability in biologics.", "date": "2025-03-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Unlike conventional carbon-based reinforcements, tG exhibits an electromagnetic field amplification factor (AF) of 3e9, derived from an unbroken chain of experimental and theoretical evidence. The synergy of curvature-induced localization and Plasmon Hybridization Theory (PHT) enables van der Waals (vdW) expansion within bronze matrices from 0.4 nm to 577 nm, allowing ultralow tG concentrations of just 0.005 wt% to drive transformative enhancements in mechanical performance. When incorporated into lead-free bronze, tG increases wear resistance by 458% and reduces CO\u2082 emissions by 78.2%, offering an unprecedented combination of performance and sustainability. These effects stem from quantum plasmonic reinforcement mechanisms, which improve stress transfer, load distribution, and molecular cohesion at the nanoscale. Unlike conventional alloying elements such as Pb or Ni, which rely on bulk material properties, tG fundamentally alters wear resistance through nanoscale force redistribution. This study establishes tG as a disruptive material for next-generation metallic nanocomposites, merging fundamental nanoscience with industry-relevant tribological validation.

We present a novel, affordable, copper-block semi-batch reactor system that reaches the desired reaction temperature in less than four minutes. Through simulation, we demonstrate the superiority of this system over the commonly used stainless-steel reactors. We utilized this system to measure the isothermal kinetics of PE pyrolysis at temperatures between 411 and 449 \u00b0C.

The initial decomposition steps exhibited similar activation energies of 360\u00b117 and 357\u00b106 kJ/mol, indicating that molecular weight has little effect on the initial PE pyrolysis rate.

Electrochemical capacitors exhibit promising device characteristics to help level grid scale power fluctuations, including fast charge-discharge kinetics and long device lifetimes. This is especially true for ionic liquids, which promise increased safety and performance, as compared to volatile organic electrolytes commonly used in batteries. However, large scale implementation of ionic liquid-based capacitors remains limited by low device energy densities, as the interfacial capacitance of ionic liquid-electrode interfaces decreases significantly under large polarization. Here, we investigate how incorporating metal cations of varying size and valence into ionic liquids modifies electric double layer formation. We find that alkali cations substantially amplify interfacial capacitance in salt-in-ionic liquid electrolytes, overcoming capacitive limitations caused by ion crowding. Remarkably, we observe capacitive enhancement exceeding 350% in lithium- and sodium-containing electrolytes at Au and Cu electrodes under large polarization, where ion crowding diminishes interfacial capacitance in neat ionic liquids. Our data indicates that metal cation underpotential deposition plays a key role in capacitive enhancement, and we observe that this process can be highly reversible under cycling.

Crystalline swelling mechanisms have been well established through hydration techniques applied to dry clay in a humid environment, while osmotic swelling has been observed through the gradual concentration of a diluted clay suspension into a more compact, glassy state.

Cis-trans isomerization in unsaturated fatty acids increases cell membrane rigidity, decreasing fluidity of the lipid acyl tails.  These changes maintain membrane homeostasis, but the effect size is difficult to quantify in vivo.  In this work, we explore the impact of fatty acid cis-trans isomerization on the properties and dynamics in a membrane model based on Pseudomonas putida using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.  In our hypothetical model, we convert between all-cis and all-trans membranes, and report on the variation in membrane properties under these conditions.  In addition to changes in membrane thickness and lipid diffusion, we find that the unsaturation site for a cis fatty acid has a higher probability to come to the membrane surface than the equivalent trans fatty acid.  The reduced availability of unsaturation sites on the membrane surface may have downstream implications for their accessibility to enzymatic attack, potentially influencing the activity of cis-trans isomerase and other peripheral membrane proteins that act on lipid unsaturations. Since cis-trans isomerization can occur rapidly without new lipid biosynthesis, natural selection has adopted cis-trans isomerization as one of many responses to environmental stress.

We report quantum-chemistry calculations of g-tensors and hyperfine coupling tensors (A-tensors) for the nitroxide radical spin label in the pressure range of 0-15 GPa.

Computational approaches, particularly protein-protein docking, are essential for modeling ternary complexes and predicting critical interactions. However, existing docking methods struggle with cereblon (CRBN)-based ternary complexes. To address this, we introduce a computational approach combining HADDOCK protein-protein docking with induced fit PROTAC docking.

Besides the full-length product (FLP), ON samples contain many closely related impurities that must be profiled to ensure drug quality. Separation techniques, such as ion-pairing reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC), anion-exchange chromatography (AEX), and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) are used for ON impurity profiling. However, it is challenging to resolve impurities comprising the same number of nucleotides as the FLP. Here, we investigated the performance of ion-paring HILIC (IP-HILIC) as an alternative, mass-spectrometry (MS) compatible LC mode for ON impurity profiling. In IP-HILIC, ion pair reagents (IPRs) are expected to reduce the relative contribution of the phosphate moiety on retention, potentially increasing separation selectivity based on the nature of nucleobases and conjugated groups. A fully phosphorothioated, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated 16-mer antisense ON served as an FLP model compound, along with shortmer, longmer, PS-PO converted, deaminated and non-conjugated products, which are potential impurities. We describe the effect of several parameters on the IP-HILIC performance, such as IPR hydrophobicity, eluent pH, and column temperature. The addition of IPRs to the eluent resulted in a unique separation selectivity compared to IP-RPLC, AEX, and HILIC. In particular, IP-HILIC successfully separated the deamination impurity (DA)\nfrom the FLP. This is noteworthy as current MS-compatible, one-dimensional LC methods cannot resolve this impurity and MS resolution is often insufficient to differentiate the FLP and DA due to a 1 Da mass difference.

Current treatments, primarily cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, offer only symptomatic relief. Drugs targeting only one pathological condition have generated only limited efficacy. Thus, combining two or more therapeutic interventions into one molecule is believed to provide higher benefits for the treatment of AD. In this study, we designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated 16 novel tacrine (THA) derivatives, incorporating (hetero)aryl groups or deuterium at position 7 of the parent molecule to improve efficacy and reduce hepatotoxicity. The compounds were frist screened in silico to assess their oral bioavailability and potential to penetrate the CNS. In vitro assays were performed to evaluate ChE inhibition, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and hepatotoxicity. The metabolic stability of selected candidates was determined using human liver microsomes, where compound 5e exhibited improved stability, while derivatives 5i and 5m showed rapid metabolism. Notably, deuterium incorporation in compound 7 did enhance metabolic stability, probably due to metabolic switching. Given the involvement of NMDAR excitotoxicity in AD, the compounds were evaluated for their NMDAR antagonistic activity. Among them, compound 5m exhibited the most potent and voltage-independent inhibition at the GluN1/GluN2B subunits. Based on its promising in vitro profile, compound 5m was advanced to in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, confirming its BBB permeability and favorable CNS distribution.

A major class of such molecules are proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). PROTACs are catalytic heterobifunctional small molecules that simultaneously bind a protein of interest (POI) and an E3 ligase. These PROTACs induce a proximity-dependant ubiquitination of the POI, which causes its subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system. While PROTACs have successfully transitioned from academia to industry, increasing awareness of off-target effects and related toxicities highlight the urgent need for precise control mechanisms over their activity. Achieving this level of control, however, remains challenging with traditional chemistries. DNA nanotechnology, with its unparalleled programmability and structural versatility, presents a powerful tool for achieving such control. Here, we report the design and characterization of oligonucleotide-linked PROTACs (OligoPROTACs). These constructs comprise PROTAC warheads covalently linked to separate, complementary DNA strands, brought together in space via DNA hybridisation. OligoPROTACs are able to degrade the POI in a distance-dependant manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first-instance of a dynamic off-switch mechanism for PROTAC activity, enabled by toehold-mediated strand displacement using a third DNA strand.

Currently, there are no approved treatments for MarV infections, though various antiviral interventions, including small-molecule inhibitors like Favipiravir, are under development. This study employs a multi-scale molecular simulation approach to identify potential inhibitors of Marv VP35 from an African natural compounds library. Structure-based virtual screening was performed to identify potent hits, with Favipiravir as the reference compound. A total of 134 molecules outperformed Favipiravir in docking scores (at least -1.2 kcal/mol), and these were further evaluated for toxicity and pharmacokinetics. Fifteen compounds were shortlisted for molecular dynamics simulations over 50 nanoseconds at 300 \u00b0 K to account for receptor flexibility and biological conditions. All shortlisted compounds demonstrated greater stability than Favipiravir, except compound CO921. Binding free energies were calculated using MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA methods, leading to the re-ranking of the compounds. Ultimately, compound SA260, followed by NA1411, EA636, SA394, and CO1641 emerged as the most promising inhibitors of Marv VP35. Additionally, six other compounds were identified as potential alternatives. The findings suggest these compounds may effectively antagonize dsRNA binding, leading to VP35 inhibition and subsequent Marv immunosuppression.

These models have benefitted from the large amount of data available in bioactivity databases. However, an issue that is often overlooked when using this data, is the broad diversity in the biological assays present. The effect of small molecules on a protein can be measured in various ways and this can influence the outcome. Yet, currently there is a lack of standardized, specific assay metadata, whilst this could help increase understanding of the origin of datapoints, improve data curation and lead to better models.\nTo make use of the existing information on the biological context, we set out to create and validate multiple assay descriptors and test their use in protein-ligand interaction models. Dimensionality reduction of embedded free text assay descriptions from ChEMBL showed that the BioBERT embeddings capture relevant features. Additionally, clustering of these embedded descriptions groups the assays in a way that enriches purity, matches manually categorized assays and yields sensible topic describing words. From ligand-protein combinations with multiple measurements, it becomes apparent that the deviation between different measurements in general is higher than the deviation of measurements within assay categories, with a logarithmic mean absolute error of 0.83 and 0.66, respectively. Incorporating this biological context into the PCM models in the form of BioBERT-based embeddings improved the average R2 from 0.67 to 0.69 across different datasets and splits. Conversely, using simpler methods such as bag-of-words (in which frequently used words are used as features) no improvement was seen (average R2 0.66). In addition, this novel method for assay categorization facilitates data curation and provides a useful overview of the biological context of studied targets. In conclusion, biological assay context is important for bioactivity modeling and provides a means to easily get insight into this context.\n", "date": "2025-03-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Chief among the analytical advantages of ACV is its ability to generate an alternating current at integer multiples (harmonics) of the applied frequency, effectively gathering several datasets at once. However, interpretation of ACV data is hindered by the lack of a unified theory to predict higher harmonics for arbitrary reaction schemes, and by the experimental artefacts of uncompensated cell resistance and background current. The present paper outlines a method for predicting an arbitrary number of harmonics for systems with up to two charge transfer events and any number of coupled first-order chemical reactions, accounting also for cell resistance and background current described by a constant phase element. Results for an ``ideal\" experiment (no cell resistance and no background current) are presented up to the third harmonic for schemes with first-order reactions, and up to the first harmonic for schemes with second-order reactions. After these ``ideal\" cases, the effects of cell resistance and background current are explored. In general, irreversible charge transfer causes smaller phase angles, and coupled chemical reactions cause the aspect ratios of complex-plane ACV plots to become more circular. Uncompensated cell resistance can also lower the phase angle, imitating the effects of slow charge transfer or fast chemical reactions. At high frequencies, a combination of cell resistance and capacitance can cause the error in the potential to be so great that the current magnitude actually decreases with the onset of charge transfer. An ability to interpret the electrochemical fingerprints of each system in ACV experiments, as a function of the underlying physical parameters, can aid in the design of electrochemical devices that rely on the controlled utilization of electrochemical reactivity.", "date": "2025-03-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis; Theory - Computational; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

In response to critical environmental issues caused by these non-renewable materials, mycelium-based composites (MBCs) have attracted widespread attention. MBCs provide a renewable alternative where mycelium grows on lignocellulosic fibers forming a lightweight, low energy cost, and an effective insulating material. However, the bottleneck of large-scale architectural applications of MBCs lies in conventional mold-based manual manufacturing processes. Even though 3D-printable mycelium composites facilitate automated production and greater design freedom, the size is still limited at the centimeter scale due to the extended time required for layers to fuse from hyphal growth. The development of shootable MBCs, which can potentially overcome these constraints for flexible forms and automated large-scale construction, has not yet been explored. This study investigates biopolymer modification methods for psyllium husk gels to engineer shootable MBCs with high cohesive and adhesive properties that enable deposition on vertical surfaces. Engineered formulations demonstrated consistent shootability over a span of 50 minutes with minimal material loss (<10%), and robust mycelium growth at both the surface and throughout the cross section. The resulting composition exhibits circular building lifecycle principles as all ingredients are biodegradable and compostable at the end of building life.

This work investigates the impact of diazotization conditions on the redox state of TEMPO and its subsequent immobilization efficiency on electrodes. Two diazotization methods were employed: one using nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (NOBF\u2084) and the other using tert-butyl nitrite (tBuONO) in combination with boron trifluoride acetonitrile complex (BF\u2083-CH3CN). Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical simulations revealed that the redox state of TEMPO is significantly influenced by the diazotization agents. NOBF\u2084 primarily oxidizes TEMPO to its oxoammonium form (TEMPO\u207a), while the tBuONO/BF\u2083-CH3CN system leads to the formation of non-redox species alongside TEMPO\u207a. The electrochemical grafting of these TEMPO-derivatized diazonium salts onto glassy carbon electrodes showed that the presence of TEMPO radicals during the electroreduction process hinders immobilization efficiency. This effect is attributed to the spontaneous reduction of diazonium salts by TEMPO radicals, which decreases the availability of diazonium species for surface grafting. The formation of non-redox species, which are regenerated after immobilization on the surface, appears to be a promising approach for achieving reproducible layers with higher surface concentrations.", "date": "2025-03-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The alternating along (AA) configuration (positive charges in the inner ring and negative in the outer ring while alternating in z-direction) demonstrates higher water uptake at saturation and water adsorption starts at a much lower pressure than other configurations. Analysis of water clustering pattern in AA reveals radial as well axial expansion of water clusters which facilitates accommodation of extra water molecules. Increasing charge magnitude shifts the type-V isotherm inflexion point leftwards along the pressure axis, thereby increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cylinder. Probing different energetic interactions and electrostatic potentials of the configurations suggest unique relaxation of the water clusters in the AA patterned cylinders. Investigating the effect of charge magnitude and pore size provides more insight into their hydrophilic nature. Finally, analyzing the hydrogen bonding and adsorbed phase characteristic at saturation hints at strong ordering induced by the pore confinements and the electrostatic configurations compared to bulk liquid water.

While often neglected by electrochemists, these electric potential differences can significantly impact the interpretation of experimental results. To assist in comprehension of these concepts, which are pertinent to the electrochemistry of many aqueous chemical systems, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a several-hours-long hands-on laboratory activity that we performed with undergraduate and graduate students in electroanalytical chemistry courses. The activity requires that students construct a simple two-compartment electrochemical cell from inexpensive and readily available disposable plastic cuvettes, commercially available polymeric ion-exchange membranes, two nominally identical reference electrodes placed in liquid electrolytes that wet each side of the membrane, and a voltmeter or a potentiostat to measure the open-circuit potential between the reference electrodes, i.e. the cell potential. Using commercially available reference electrodes, each consisting of a wire (e.g. Ag/AgCl) immersed in a fritted tube containing an aqueous electrolyte, measured open-circuit potentials report on the magnitude of both Donnan and liquid-junction electric potential differences. These electric potentials are dictated by the composition of ions in each electrolyte, through interactions with the ion-exchange membrane and porous frits at the tip of each reference electrode. When a cation-exchange membrane separates aqueous solutions consisting of different concentrations of hydrochloric acid (HCl) or potassium hydroxide (KOH), the cell responds like a pH or pK probe, respectively, because the membrane interfaces are more sensitive to the activity of H+ and K+ over Cl\u2013 and OH\u2013, respectively. Analogously, when an anion-exchange membrane is used, the cell should respond like a pCl or pOH probe, respectively, because the membrane interfaces are more sensitive to the respective activity of Cl\u2013 and OH\u2013 over H+ and K+. When the solutions contain large concentrations of multiple types of ions, measured open-circuit potentials typically deviate from values dominated by Donnan potential differences and are instead dominated by liquid-junction-like effects where electric potentials within and across ion-exchange membranes form due to differences in permeabilities of the ions. When reference electrodes consist of wires immersed directly into the aqueous electrolytes that wet the membranes, and not in fritted tubes, measured open-circuit potentials also include contributions from the chemical potential of redox-active species that are present in the aqueous electrolytes as Nernst potentials. While this hands-on laboratory activity is suitable for most upper-level undergraduate students in physical science and engineering disciplines, the concepts of Donnan electric potential, liquid-junction electric potential, and species chemical potential are advanced enough to educate graduate students and senior researchers alike.

Saliva was also shown to have potential as a sample matrix and, like anterior nasal swabs, could be obtained non-invasively (e.g., passive drool). However, due to its inherent complexity and heterogeneity across patient populations (e.g., presence of mucins and RNases), saliva was largely disregarded as point-of-care diagnostics were being developed and broadly implemented. For molecular diagnostic approaches (e.g., RT-PCR or RT-LAMP), these matrix effects from saliva could lead to undesirable false positives or false negatives. The opportunity to address these challenges by normalizing the performance of saliva could enable important applications of molecular tests, particularly at the point-of-care. Towards these goals, we developed a one-pot RT-LAMP assay for the colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva samples.

Starting from this parent method, non-overlapping fragments and neglect of interfragment charge transfer excitations are assumed to arrive at the ExC procedure. This leads to an ExC Hamiltonian that pro- vides equivalent electronic absorption and circular dichroism spectra as the parent sTD-DFT method for largely separated fragments. The ExC approach easily accelerates the computa- tion of such spectra of molecular aggregates by about two orders of magnitude compared to sTD-DFT. The latter itself is already faster by about 4\u20135 orders of magnitude compared to regular TD-DFT. We demonstrate the performance of the approach for excitation spectra of organic molecular clusters. Given that the fragment electronic structure in the ExC-sTD- DFT approach is solved independently, computation of spectra for systems with \u223c10,000 atoms can be performed within minutes of computation time. Furthermore, the role of electrostatic embedding in the independent fragments is investigated. For the purposes cov- ered in this work, the embedding can be simplified by employing a dielectric continuum, thus, greatly reducing the overall computational complexity. This approach may be used in screening photophysical properties of large molecular aggregates and soft matter materi- als.

In overcrowded alkene-based molecular motors, rotary motion is accomplished through consecutive cis-trans photoisomerization reactions and thermal helix inversion steps. To date, a complete understanding of the photoisomerization reactions of overcrowded alkene motors has not been achieved yet. In this work, we use quantum chemical calculations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) nonadiabatic dynamics simulations to investigate the photoinduced dynamics of a push-pull alkene-based molecular motor in two different solvents: cyclohexane and methanol. We show that, while in both solvents the main photorelaxation pathway of our investigated push-pull motor involves two different excited-state minima, in polar methanol the photorelaxation dynamics is much faster than in nonpolar cyclohexane because of two main effects: (i) a lowering of the energy barrier between the excited-state minima, and (ii) a reduction of the energy gap with the ground state at the largely twisted dark minimum, where the excited-state decay takes place. Both effects can be attributed to solvent-polarity stabilization of the charge-transfer excited state along the photorelaxation pathway. In line with the experimental findings, our simulations also indicate that in methanol the accelerated photoinduced dynamics goes along with a faster fluorescence decay and a large reduction in the forward photoisomerization yield of our investigated motor.", "date": "2025-03-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Pure SSOS improved the heat sealability of paper, whereas pure MAL did not exhibit this behavior.

Our approach shows that when a target molecule can be split apart by a solution in which it is placed, the forces inside the molecule can be deduced by analyzing the properties of the surrounding solution. Our method can be suitable for selecting DNA (or other systems with controllable denaturation) targeted for specific applications and/or to optimize the denaturants for any given DNA. Our theory has been developed for DNA chemical denaturation for low and medium denaturation degrees, including but not limited to 50\\% denaturation as a reversible first-order reaction. Specifically, we show the degrees of influence of hydrogen bonding, dispersion, polar forces, proton donor/acceptor ratio, dipole induction, orientation parameter, and electrostatic interaction on the denaturation process of DNA. The absolute enthalpy values for DNA chemical denaturation are significantly lower than those in the thermal denaturation process (positive). We show that the mechanism for reaching 50\\% DNA denaturation differs thermally and chemically. The thermal denaturation process mainly involves breaking hydrogen bonds via heating, while the chemical denaturation process involves replacing the hydrogen bonding of DNA with denaturants. We show that hydrogen bonding is the most significant part of the enthalpy of chemical denaturation for the T4 bacteriophage DNA, and the proton-donor effect is the dominant mechanism in disrupting hydrogen bonds in DNA denaturation. The influence of this effect is two times greater than that of the proton-acceptor effect. We also show that another essential factor for DNA denaturation is the orientation component, which is part of the polar cohesion parameter.  We show that the total cohesion parameter measured at 50\\% of DNA chemical denaturation represents the electrostatic (repulsion) forces that maintain the DNA helix.    The conclusions above were achieved using the cohesive energy density approach and corresponding equations based on the thermodynamics of the denaturation process. Independent experimental data, which we analyzed using our theory, supported these conclusions.

For the widely recognized tetrazine-triggered cleavage of trans-cyclooctenes (TCO), the complexities of post-click tautomerization are the key barrier to achieving next-level molecular tools. Strategies to anchor directing functionalities to tetrazines (Tz) accelerate tautomerization, but their scope has been limited by interlocking impacts on Tz click reactivity and stability. Here we shift the tautomerization driving force from the Tz to the TCO, introducing iTCO, a click-cleavable linker that unlocks remarkably efficient release with highly reactive tetrazines, regardless of click orientation.

One strategy to form porous liquids is the dissolution of discrete and permanently porous molecular species at relatively high concentrations in cavity-excluded solvents, thus introducing permanent porosity into the liquid in which it is dissolved and ensuring a solution of reasonable porosity is obtained. To access high-performance porous liquids for target applications, the selection of both the porous molecular species and the cavity-excluded solvent is key to ensuring the solvent is permanently excluded and the pore carrier is highly soluble. Finding new solvents that fit both these requirements is challenging, often resulting in a trial-and-error approach. While predictive data-driven models may be attractive, the youth of the porous liquid field currently limits the availability of data necessary to train robust models. Here, we present a computational workflow for the discovery of new porous liquid solutions combining solubility prediction software and a size-exclusivity prediction algorithm that correctly predicts size-exclusivity; this is followed by experimental validation with a representative system. Our workflow yielded size-excluded solvent and soluble porous organic cage pairs, leading to the realisation of a new porous liquid with enhanced methane uptake compared to previous systems discovered in a purely experimental high-throughput brute-force manner, highlighting the advantages of incorporating a computational workflow in the discovery of new porous liquids.", "date": "2025-03-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This study compared microbial conversion of CO from three inoculum sources in identical TBRs: anaerobic sludge (AS) from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), anaerobic digestate (AD) from a biogas plant, and cow manure (CM). TBR performance was monitored daily. The microbial composition of the inoculum and biofilm samples were analyzed using 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing. AS showed the fastest adaptation, stabilizing within 10 days, while AD and CM took longer. Overall, AS and AD reactors achieved similar CO conversion and methane production rates, reaching 6 Nm\u00b3m\u207b\u00b3d\u207b\u00b9 and 1 Nm\u00b3m\u207b\u00b3d\u207b\u00b9, respectively, at a CO loading rate of 7.75 Nm\u00b3m\u207b\u00b3d\u207b\u00b9. All the reactors showed reduced microbial diversity as compared to inocula. The reactor with AS showed relatively lower spatial microbial dissimilarity than CM. Despite initial diversity differences, Euryarchaeota and Firmicutes became the dominant phyla in all TBR biofilms, with Methanothermobacter as the main genus in the CO conversion process. These findings suggest that although essential microbes for CO utilization were present in all reactors, inoculum composition significantly impacted the time required to reach stable CO conversion and reactor performance.", "date": "2025-03-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Patel; Sara M. Hashmi", "abstract": "Impressive improvements in the ability of microfluidic devices to reliably fabricate a wide variety of droplet, capsule, and particle architectures necessitate comparable improvements in techniques to measure and characterize these materials in line with fabrication.  Measurement and control of droplet surface tension are needed to ensure droplet stability while minimizing excess use of surfactants.  Standard techniques to measure surface tension typically measure one droplet at a time, off-chip.  Fluidics can be leveraged to measure surface tension in-line with droplet formation.  Typically, this requires channel geometries that enable extensional flow. Transient relaxation of deformed droplets is then measured at the exit of a constriction.  We propose an alternative approach, in which a single value of steady deformation within a constriction is used to measure surface tension. We flow emulsion droplets through a series of increasingly narrow constrictions and measure steady deformation. We measure surface tension over a wide range of surfactant concentrations.  We use nonionic surfactant Span 80 to pinch-off and stabilize water drops in mineral oil and anionic surfactant SDS to stabilize mineral oil drops in water.  In a subset of experiments, water droplets contain varying concentrations of polyethylene glycol diacrylate, a common blank-slate hydrogel polymer. We calculate surface tension using Taylor's small deformation theory, which describes the relationship between steady deformation in shear flows and the Capillary number, the ratio of the applied viscous stress to restoring surface tension stress. Validation using both the transient deformation fluidic approach and pendant drop measurements on individual droplets demonstrates the viability of our approach.  The use of multiple constrictions allows measurement of hundreds of droplets at several distinct shear rates without the need to vary control parameters. Importantly, our results suggest that steady state measurements of deformation in pressure driven flows provide accurate assessments of surface tension, even when droplets are slightly confined.  This steady deformation approach represents a readily-accessible option for measuring surface tension of micro-scale droplets in pressure driven flow through rectangular channels, without requiring specialized channel geometries.", "date": "2025-03-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Surfactants; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

The durability of polyepoxy-inorganic substrate interfaces depends on surface treatments (physical and chemical) and environmental curing conditions such as temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress. Detecting real-time changes at these interfaces is crucial to prevent failures. This study used a Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) with multiple beam interferometry to investigate interface degradation during curing and aging. A stoichiometric mixture of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and amine-terminated polyoxypropylene glycol (JeffAmine D-230) was confined between smooth alumina substrates under varying humidity. The SFA and fringes of equal chromatic order (FECO) technique enabled real-time imaging and refractive index measurements of the confined polyepoxy. Curing strains and stresses were monitored over 48 hours. Key findings include: (1) low tensile forces promote complete curing across different humidity levels, dominated by molecular interactions; (2) high tensile forces prevent full curing unless compressive forces are applied; (3) high humidity rapidly induces water diffusion, increasing plasticization and preventing cure. Additional micro-tensile tests and failure analysis imaging revealed primarily cohesive (polymer-polymer) rather than adhesive (polymer-substrate) failure modes.

This approach allows CFCs to exhibit multifunctional properties, including enhanced thermal conductivity and flame resistance, making them ideal for fire-proof drone enclosures, electronic casings, and thermal-energy-storage equipment applications. The thermal conductivity was further increased by adding carbon nanotubes (CNT) to the MINET matrix. The rheological properties of MINET allowed for CNT loading concurrently alongside graphene, without preventing processing. Rheological evaluations and Vickers hardness assessments were conducted to optimize the maximum CNT loading for efficient molding and robust mechanical properties. Thermal conductivity analysis demonstrated that CNT-reinforced MINET composites have a higher thermal conductivity when compared to standard graphene-MINET formulations. Infrared thermal imaging confirmed that CFC MINET composites have better dynamic heat transfer properties than CFC epoxy samples. Flammability tests indicated an improved flame resistance, particularly for silicone oil CFC MINET CNT formulations.

However, specific chemical functionalization of CNT is required to disperse them homogeneously within an aqueous matrix. Therefore, we synthesized and characterized (through XPS, TGA, Raman, DLS and Zeta Potential) a water-soluble CNT derivative (fCNT) bearing quaternary ammonium groups, and we used it to prepare alginate-based nanocomposite hydrogels. We employed two different gelation techniques (external and internal) to obtain two plain hydrogels (HG1 and HG2 respectively) and two fCNT-filled composites (HG1-fCNT and HG2-fCNT respectively) and we compared the physical properties of the four different materials. Hydrogels were characterized through SEM microscopy and elastic modulus measurements. Moreover, an exhaustive investigation of the electrical properties of the hydrogel samples was carried on by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the range of 1-104 Hz. Notably, the addition of fCNT enhanced the conductivity of the hydrogel from internal gelation (HG2-fCNT) by more than one order of magnitude, thereby making it a promising candidate as a scaffold for electroactive tissues such as muscle. The observed features are even more appealing when considering active electrostimulation of cells. The stability of the scaffolds in the culture medium was improved by an enhanced calcium concentration.\nFinally, the behavior of the four hydrogels as scaffolds for muscle tissue engineering was investigated through comprehensive studies of myoblast viability, proliferation, and differentiation. While similar and satisfying behaviours were observed for all samples in terms of cytocompatibility and proliferation, a relevant improvement in differentiation was obtained by the addition of fCNT in the case of HG2-fCNT.\nThese outcomes hint at the feasibility of using the fCNT combined with the alginate hydrogel in order to support the myoblasts growth and proliferation.\n", "date": "2025-03-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Carbon-based Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, in certain ultramicroporous materials, physisorption can be impacted by subtle structural changes on decreasing temperature that slows or even stops adsorbate diffusion, circumventing thermodynamic expectations. These unique ultramicroporous materials are described as temperature-regulated gating adsorbents and given their special properties, can facilitate mix-and-match gas separations by simply controlling temperature. To date, though understood to be remarkably useful, there is still ambiguity about how best to identify, characterize, and rationalize the performance of these materials. To address this issue, we provide a practical analytical framework of a model gating material, Al(HCOO)3, ALF. Our work illustrates how the gating effect in ALF originates from the changing dynamics of the formate linkers that define the apertures between porous cavities. As the dynamics of the formates increase with temperature, new kinetic adsorption regimes for an adsorbate can be accessed, marked by kinetic inflection temperatures (KITs), which correspond to adsorbate-specific kinetic barriers encountered during diffusion. Identifying these temperatures is essential, as they allow kinetic or absolute gating separations to be devised without exhaustive experimentation. However, though a temperature regime may facilitate favorable diffusion kinetics for certain adsorbates, the thermodynamic driving forces for adsorption may have already been overcome making adsorption quantities minimal. By using gas sorption studies with noble gases, H2, N2, O2, CO2, and C2H2, as well as crystallography, spectroscopy, and modeling, our work elucidates how the convoluted effects of thermodynamics and kinetics affect a system like ALF, and how they can be leveraged for separation design. We do this by rationalizing the origin of temperature-regulated gating in ALF and showing how targeted density functional theory calculations and routine temperature programmed desorption experiments can predict real-world conditions for untested gas separations. Our work serves as a guide to the future characterization of suspected temperature-regulated gating materials, and, more generally, ultramicroporous materials that may inherently possess this behavior.", "date": "2025-03-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In recent decades, growing evidence has identified soluble amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) oligomers as key species in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of AD, underscoring the urgent need for early detection methods. Fluorescence spectroscopy techniques using extrinsic fluorescent labels, such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), are valuable for studying A\u03b2 aggregation in vitro but are unsuitable for routine use in clinical settings due to their complexity and limited applicability in biological fluids. This study investigates the intrinsic fluorescence of Amyloid-\u03b2(1\u201340), A\u03b240, as a label-free approach to detecting and characterising the oligomers formed during the early stages of aggregation. A\u03b240 exhibits autofluorescence dominated by tyrosine emission, which undergoes strong blue shift and quenching during oligomerization. Additionally, an aggregation-induced emission in the visible spectral region emerges, correlating with A\u03b2 oligomer concentration and providing a means to detect and quantify oligomers. At the critical aggregation concentrations of A\u03b240 (cac1 = 0.5 \u00b5M and cac2 = 19 \u00b5M), distinct aggregation behaviours are observed, which are in agreement with the results of previous aggregation studies. By employing steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, a widely accessible and practical technique, these findings establish a direct link between A\u03b2 early aggregation and intrinsic-fluorescence changes, demonstrating their potential as a tool for detecting and analysing A\u03b2 oligomers. This approach eliminates the need for extrinsic probes, simplifying experimental procedures and reducing artefacts, making it a promising strategy in the context of early AD diagnostics.

To reveal these \u03c3-DQI effects, we take a bridge-cutting approach where we conceptually excise the bridging paths of a sila-adamantane molecular wire, paring the cluster down to its bicyclic [3.3.1] and linear oligosilane forms. Scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction (STM-BJ) measurements reveal that conductance in single-molecule junctions of the tricyclic sila-adamantane is 2.7-times lower than their bicyclic Si[3.3.1] analog. The only structural difference between their cluster cores is a remote dimethylsilylene bridge that is present in sila-adamantane yet absent in Si[3.3.1]. Density functional theory calculations reveal that this dimethylsilylene bridge enforces C\u2083 steric symmetry at the sila-diamondoid bridgehead positions, allowing each electrode to couple into the three cluster bridge dimensions equally. Though each bridge alignment is sterically equivalent, they have profound electronic differences: when electrodes align with the long branches of sila-adamantane, strong \u03c3-DQI interactions occur between the key frontier molecular orbitals implicated in charge transport that suppress electronic transmission across the molecular junction. We can exploit these alignment-dependent \u03c3-DQI effects to create new forms of stereoelectronic conductance switches, where a reversible mechanical stimulus controls which pathway through the diamondoid framework the electrodes align through. This represents the first example of dynamic modulation of \u03c3-DQI and enables us to achieve switching ratios (average on/off ~ 5.6) higher than previously reported \u03c3-stereoelectronic switches. Ultimately, these studies reveal how the dimensionality and symmetry of crystalline silicon influence charge transport at its most fundamental level, and how these principles can be harnessed to control \u03c3-quantum interference in single-molecule electronic applications.", "date": "2025-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The photoelectron spectra are obtained using slow electron velocity-map imaging of cryogenically cooled anions (cryo-SEVI); here, cold anions are vibrationally excited by an IR laser pulse prior to photodetachment (IR cryo-SEVI). Infrared action spectra of the anion CH2 stretching fundamentals are measured by monitoring growth and depletion of features in photoelectron spectra as the IR laser is tuned, yielding excitation frequencies of the symmetric (\u03bd1) and antisymmetric (\u03bd5) CH2 stretching modes of 2590\u00b12 cm-1 and 2658\u00b12 cm-1, respectively. We then use IR cryo-SEVI to explore the effect of vibrational excitation of the two modes on the anion photoelectron spectrum. Interpretation of these spectra is facilitated by quantum calculations performed for each isotopologue on accurate six-dimensional potential energy surfaces of both neutral and anionic vinylidene. IR cryo-SEVI spectra resulting from excitation of these two close-lying anion vibrations are noticeably different. Excitation of the \u03bd1 mode leads to several new features that appear in the photoelectron spectra which closely match the Franck-Condon allowed transitions predicted by theory. Excitation of the \u03bd5 mode in H2CC\u00af reveals complicated spectral features in the vicinity of the 5_1^1 sequence band that are not seen for D2CC\u00af.

Furthermore, poor transverse directional alignment coupled with slow printing rates limit their applicability for industrial production. We hypothesize that interfilamentous welding strength can be enhanced by modifying the chemistry of the building blocks and the topological arrangement of the macromolecular structure. To test this, we carried out coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics of both linear and branched polymer across representative interfaces. We observe that the diffusion controlled interdigitation follows a power law, with the exponent decreasing from 0.34 to 0.11 as grafting density increases from 7.5% to 196% (sidechains are grafted to both sides of a monomer unit). Surprisingly, the addition of sidechains enhances welding efficiency, as dense bottlebrush polymers with high grafting density reach maximum rupture strength faster than linear polymers. However, their saturated rupture strength is lower. This observation is subsequently corroborated by experimental lap shear tests using ungrafted polyethylene and branched polyethylene grafted by octane. Our MD simulations show that while linear polymer welding relies on backbone entanglement, in bottlebrush polymers, sidechains play a dominant role in enhancing interfacial strength, surpassing the contribution of the backbone. And linear polymers require more time to diffuse into neighboring filaments to achieve desired bulk properties. Furthermore, our molecular dynamics simulations reveal a brittle rupture behavior with significant hardening in linear and comb-like (mildly grafted) polymers, while bottlebrush (densely grafted) polymers display elastomeric behavior with a pronounced stress plateau prior to fracture. By comparing the gyration radii of all topological polymers, we found that they exhibit an increase in gyration radius parallel to the stretching direction and a decrease perpendicular to the deformation. The increase becomes more pronounced with higher grafting density. These results not only provide deeper insight into the underlying welding mechanisms of topological polymers but also present a potential approach for mitigating the anisotropy that is inherent in FDM-based additive manufacturing.

Here we report the first demonstration of cobalt single-atom catalysts anchored on carbon-nitride (Co-CN) as an all-in-one photocatalysts for the semi-hydrogenation reaction of acetylene to ethylene using water as the proton source and no organic solvents or hydrogenated organics, offering advantages over current hydrogenation technologies. Carbon nitride is a photoactive support that hosts the individual catalytic active sites of cobalt thus combining photosensitizer and cocatalyst in one unit, in line with first-principles modelling. Under visible light irradiation, Co-CN reduces acetylene to ethylene with stable activity for over 40 days of continuous operation and \u226599.9%, selectivity and provides means for coupling organic upgrading to produce valuable oxidation products. The heterogenous Co-CN can be easily recovered and reused repeatedly without loss of catalytic activity and structural integrity. Thereby, the reported hydrogenation photocatalyst overcomes the need of coupling a separate photosensitiser to a catalyst providing an integrated and recyclable platform, and using noble metal catalysts with an external H2 gas feed.\nThanks to these features, together with longevity and semi-hydrogenation selectivity, this system holds potential for practical implementation of light-driven acetylene reduction and for exploration of other non-noble metal single atom heterogenous photocatalysts to achieve this important transformation using water as the proton source.", "date": "2025-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Experimental results collected on molecules isolated from interaction with other species provided, in turn, an ideal breeding ground for developing ab initio simulations capable of interpreting and predicting photoemission spectra. Regarding the atom- and site-specific core ionization binding energies (BEs), accurate methods facilitate the interpretation of experimental data, also helping to assign the contributions of all non-equivalent atoms of the same species even in unresolved features arising from a molecular structure. In this context, we have developed, extensively tested and made available to a broad readership a computational protocol rooted on plane-wave/pseudopotential density functional theory (hereafter referred to as PW-DFT), based on a \u2206SCF approach, to predict X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS) in molecules, molecular aggregates and molecular thin films deposited on inorganic substrates. Calculations have been performed using a representative set of semilocal and global/range-separated hybrid density functionals, containing increasing fractions of Hartree-Fock exact exchange (EXX). Specifically, PBE, B3LYP (20 % EXX), HSE (range separated with 25 % EXX at short range) and BH&HLYP (50 % EXX) have been used for the assessment of the computational protocol. Equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) has been employed as reference theoretical method for comparison. The computational protocol has been tested against a wide set of molecular classes encompassing aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic compounds as well as drugs and biomolecules, demonstrating to be generally accurate and robust even using semilocal DFT. Moreover, valence photoemission measurements represent a complementary tool to core photoemission, particularly useful to investigate the properties of delocalized and \u03c0- conjugated molecular orbitals, and sensitive to chemical modifications which involves large molecules through non covalent interactions. We have used the same set of density functionals to assess their capability to predict valence-shell ionization spectra for different molecular classes using Kohn-Sham eigenvalues as estimators. Finally, our PW-DFT data-set of C1s, N1s and O1s BEs have been used to train machine learning (ML) models finalized to the prediction of XPS spectra in isolated organic molecules from their structure.

The adsorption energies of H, O, and OH for the corresponding intermediate reactions were obtained by density functional theory calculations. While for H and O the adsorption energy increases with coverage, for OH the lowest adsorption energy was observed at 0.5~ML. Then, after applying elastic strains, the trends observed for the unstrained slab were maintained for the three adsorbates. Although neither tension nor compression modified the optimum coverage, they do change the differences in relative energies. This is considered to be a consequence of the deformations promoted on the surface. Finally, the catalytic activity of the HER and ORR was computed for the distinct coverages and elastic strains. Volcano plots confirmed for both reactions that the more favorable adsorption energy promoted by tensile strains leads to an increment of the activity and that the most active coverage is 0.25~ML. Furthermore, an analysis of the free energies of each step of the dissociative mechanism of the ORR unveils that both coverage and elastic strains can modify the rate-limiting step and, therefore, the catalytic activity of a material.

Recent advances in hardware and algorithms have produced a variety of methods for multitask modeling. This report compares the performance of six MMRM algorithms: Profile-QSAR (pQSAR), Alchemite, a meta learner (MetaNN), a multitask feed-forward neural network (MT-DNN), Bayesian factorization with side information (Macau) and Inductive Matrix Completion (IMC). To ensure a fair comparison, each was trained by an expert, in several cases an author, of each method. All used the same sets of 159 kinase and 4276 diverse ChEMBL assays, employing the same realistically novel training/test set splits. MMRMs generally performed much better than a benchmark of single-task random forest regression models for our use case of virtually screening the compound collection on which the models were trained. The comparison was complicated, because methods that train all models simultaneously must leave out the test-set measurements for all assays to avoid test-set leakage, here 75% of measurements. MMRMs which train models one-at-a-time need only leave out data for each assay as it is trained, training on 99+% of data. This does not affect the accuracy of the final production models trained on 100% of data but does affect evaluation of how the final models will perform. The comparisons, therefore, included 3 training/test set collections: \u201call-out\u201d models that leave out all test sets during training; \u201cone-out\u201d models where practical; and \u201csubset-out\u201d models, which only built models for about 10% of kinase assays or 1% of diverse assays, but could thus train evaluation models on about 90% or 99% of the measurements respectively. Many methods achieve similar accuracy. However, models trained on only 75% of the data performed much worse than those trained on 99+%. This indicates that all-out models seriously underestimate the performance of the final production models. Subset-out models were closer to one-out. A compromise method is to assess performance of the final models by multiple subset-out models, a more practicable computation for 1000s of assays. MMRMs demonstrated little advantage over single-task models for \u201ccold-start\u201d predictions on our novel test-set compounds not only unlike the specific assay\u2019s training set, but also never tested on any of the other multitask supporting assays. Instead, the accuracy advantage was mainly from imputations within these sparse assay collections, compounds unlike the training set for the assay of interest, but with some measurements on other assays. This implies that MMRMs are best suited for hit-finding, off-target, promiscuity, mechanism-of-action, polypharmacology or drug repurposing prediction of compounds from the source used to train the overall multitask model. They have little advantage over single-task models, at much higher cost, for virtual screening of vendor archives or exploratory generative chemistry. Given that accuracy of the final models is often comparable between several of the algorithms, the paper concludes with a detailed discussion of other practical pros and cons of each method that might help choose which method to employ.

The structural and thermodynamic data obtained with the new potential using the well-tempered metadynamics (WMetaD) technique reproduce experimental and ab initio MD simulation data well.

Fueled by the need for general methods to couple C(sp3)-fragments, this area has seen an explosion of renewed interest. In contrast to widely employed polar cross-coupling chemistry to forge C(sp2)\u2013C(sp2) bonds (Suzuki, Negishi, Kumada, etc.), radical cross-coupling is advantageous when applied to the coupling of saturated systems due to the mild conditions employed and enhanced chemoselectivity associated with single electron chemistry. Indeed, the ability to employ ubiquitous carbon-based fragments (carboxylic acids, alcohols, amines, olefins, etc.) in cross-coupling has dramatically simplified access to a variety of complex molecules. Despite these advantages, enantiospecific coupling reactions involving free radicals are unknown and generally believed to be impossible due to their near-instantaneous racemization (picosecond timescale). As a result, controlling the stereochemical outcome of radical cross-coupling can only be achieved on a case-by-case basis using bespoke chiral ligands or in a diastereoselective fashion guided by nearby stereocenters. Here we show how readily accessible enantioenriched sulfonylhydrazides and low loadings of an inexpensive achiral Ni-catalyst can be enlisted to solve this vexing challenge for the first time thereby enabling enantiospecific, stereoretentive radical cross-coupling between enantioenriched alkyl fragments and (hetero)aryl halides without exogenous redox chemistry or chiral ligands.

However, condition recommendation remains a challenging issue due to the broad conditions space. Recently, accurate condition recommendations via machine learning have emerged as a novel and efficient method to find a suitable condition to achieve the desired transformations. Nonetheless, accurately predicting yields is challenging due to the complex relationships involved. Herein, we present our strategy to address this problem. Two steps were taken to ensure the quality of the dataset. First, we selected a diverse and representative set of substrates to capture a broad spectrum of substrate structures and reaction conditions using an unbiased machine-based sampling approach. Second, experiments were conducted using our in-house high-throughput experimentation (HTE) platform to minimize the influence of human factors. Additionally, we proposed an intermediate knowledge-embedded strategy to enhance the model's robustness. The performance of the model was first evaluated at three different levels\u2014random split, partial substrate novelty, and full substrate novelty. All model metrics in these cases improved dramatically, achieving an R2 of 0.89, MAE of 6.1%, and RMSE of 8.0% in full substrate novelty test dataset. Moreover, the generalization of our strategy was assessed using external datasets from reported literature, delivering  an R2 of 0.45, MAE of 13%, and RMSE of 15% Meanwhile, the model could recommend suitable conditions for some reactions to elevate the reaction yields. Besides, the model was able to identify which reaction in a reaction pair with a reactivity cliff had a higher yield. In summary, our research demonstrated the feasibility of achieving accurate yield predictions through the combination of HTE and embedding intermediate knowledge into the model. This approach also has the potential to facilitate other related machine learning tasks.

Prominent SIL candidates are equimolar mixtures of lithium salts with weakly interacting anions and glyme. In particular, the equimolar mixture of lithium ([Li]+)(bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([NTf2]-) and triglyme (G3) is of great interest. It has been suggested that this mixture exhibits a behavior similar to ionic liquids due to the formation of stable 1:1 complexes of  [Li]+ with G3 molecules. We use up to multi-mocrosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to better understand the structure and dynamics of the mixtures for varying mixing ratios and temperatures and to characterize the typical coordination patterns of the [Li]+ complexes. We find that at low [Li][NTf2] content, each [Li]+ cation is, on average, coordinated by two G3 molecules. For nearly equimolar mixtures, the complex changes to a one-fold G3-coordinated cation plus one additional anion. For higher than equimolar salt concentrations, cations are increasingly surrounded by their counterions, forming lithium bridges between adjacent anions. We observe that the structure primarily depends on the mixture composition while it is remarkably temperature-insensitive. The latter suggests that cluster equilibria in the SIL are subject to only small entropy differences, retaining the SIL-like structural features up to more than 200 degrees Celsius. We demonstrate that the structural changes have a major impact on the transport properties of the system: For the investigated temperatures, the self-diffusion coefficients of all components decrease by several orders of magnitude with increasing [Li][NTf2] content, while the viscosity strongly increases. For mole fractions between 0.4 and 0.5, both  [Li]+ and G3 move concertedly and exhibit similar self-diffusion coefficients, indicating the formation of stable 1:1 complexes.

However, we were more interested in investigating how the internal electric field affects the electric dipole transitions in bulk materials or above the nanoscale. We have synthesized Eu-doped BiOF in place of BiOCl, as fabricating thick nanosheets (over 150 nm) with BiOCl is quite challenging due to the lower electronegativity of chlorine and its larger size compared to fluorine. The increased electronegativity and reduced fluorine size lead to a stronger structure (F-Bi-O-Bi-F) along the c-direction, accompanied by a shorter distance between van der Waals bonds.

Since molecular properties are determined by the molecular conformation, pruning duplicates via a structural similarity metric like the RMSD will reduce redundant calculations and hence directly impact the cost of automated workflows in computational chemistry. However, the traditional RMSD metric struggles when dealing with local symmetry in molecules and atom permutation, often leading to inflated errors and computational inefficiency. \nThis work addresses these challenges by providing clear definitions for structural similarity within conformational ensembles and developing an efficient divide-and- conquer algorithm for their distinction. The proposed permutation invariant RMSD (iRMSD) approach efficiently overcomes challenges associated with symmetric molecules and multiple rotamers by incorporating a procedure that assigns canonical atom identities and optimizes the atom-to-atom assignment process. This procedure leads to significant reductions in computational complexity, making the method highly suit- able for rapid, large-scale conformational analysis and automated property prediction workflows, both by effective pruning of duplicate conformations and enabling cross-methodology ensemble comparison.", "date": "2025-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Within soil systems, microorganisms decompose soil organic matter to generate energy and obtain carbon for growth, concomitantly release heat and CO2 as metabolic byproducts. The calorespirometric (CR) ratio \u2013 defined as the ratio of heat production to CO2 evolution, is a key indicator of carbon use efficiency and soil anaerobicity. However, conventional methodologies typically measure heat and CO2 separately, with CO2 often quantified by intermittent sampling. This discontinuous approach, compounded by the inherent heterogeneity of soil, introduces uncertainties in calorespirometric analysis. To address this limitation, an infrared CO2 sensor was mounted onto a stainless-steel calorimetric ampoule, containing soil-glucose mixtures, enabling simultaneous real-time measurements within an isothermal microcalorimeter. The novel configuration permits continuous monitoring of both parameters, validated through comparative analysis with traditional methods. The derived CR ratio aligned with theoretical predictions for carbohydrates metabolism. Furthermore, parallel oxygen measurements enabled quantification of CR ratio based on O2 (heat-to-O2), and the respiratory quotient (CO2-to-O2)), offering deeper insight into microbial carbon-energy coupling and turnover in soil systems.

This study investigates volatile organic compound (VOC) surface emissions induced by GUV254 and GUV222 lamps across various surface materials. Near surface proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) measurements revealed significantly increased surface emissions during GUV illumination.

The magnitude of the enhanced surface emissions was found to decrease with increasing GUV pathlength resembling the expected decrease of the irradiance. Overall, greater surface emissions were induced by the GUV222 lamp compared to the GUV254 lamp.

In this work, we use a stochastic resolution of the identity approach coupled with a Chebyshev expansion to compute various polariton photophysical properties, with a substantially reduced computational effort than would be needed for a direct diagonalization of the same Hamiltonian, which is often the bottleneck for such large dimensionality. Such quantities of interest are the total density of states (the eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian) and the transmission spectrum (a probe of the photonic degrees of freedom), the latter of which is a direct observable in the experiment.

Currently, human guidance is nearly always required to avoid the untractable complexity of all a priori possible reaction steps, which consequently greatly limits automated predictive applications.

In this work, we present a theoretical framework based on atomic reactivity as well as a \"neophile\" kinetic model, demonstrating how they enable unbiased automated reaction modelling with molecules of size typically encountered in experimental methodologies. Our framework allows the identification of unlikely or redundant reaction steps based on first principles and previous analyses, while the neophile kinetic model separates crucial reaction intermediates from inconsequential ones. These advances greatly improved modelling efficiency and allowed us to automatically model 17 unimolecular gold(I)-catalyzed reactions of increasing complexity starting only from the reactant and catalyst. In 11 reactions, the experimental product distribution is closely reproduced, with an additional 4 being essentially correct. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to predictively model catalytic reactions without human guidance through a convenient reformulation of the problem. We anticipate that this work will enable the rapid generation of unbiased reaction data.

Here we report on a new class of chiral azaindole\u2013phenylethanoic acid rotary motors in which, like motor proteins, anisotropy is inherent through structural asymmetry in the motor itself. The motor-molecules consist of a 7-azaindole group attached through a C\u2013N bond to a phenyl ring bearing a 2-(R or S)-(alkyl)ethanoic acid side chain. As the carboxylic acid group of the motor catalyses hydration of a carbodiimide fuel, the phenyl ring continuously directionally rotates about the azaindole stator. The stereogenic centre on the rotor side chain gives rise to diastereomeric conformations in both of the chemically distinct states (carboxylic acid and acyl-pyridinium) of the motor during the catalytic cycle. This generates a directional bias of 8:1 (clockwise:counter-clockwise; alkyl substituent = C6H5CH2-) for motor rotation powered by an achiral fuel, diisopropylcarbodiimide. The addition of one enantiomer of a hydrolysis promoter to the fuelling system increases the directionality of clockwise motor rotation to >30:1 (alkyl substituent = CH3-). The addition of the other enantiomer reverses the direction of catalysis-driven motor rotation (1:2 clockwise:counter-clockwise; alkyl substituent = CH3-).

To predict the transformation entropy of plastic crystals, we developed a comprehensive database of tetrahedral plastic crystal molecules (neopentane analogs) and used several types of features, including chemical functional groups, molecular symmetry, DFT-calculated vibrational entropy, and energy decomposition analysis to train a machine learning model. To select the most relevant features, we used a correlation matrix to screen out highly correlated features and ran sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) regression on the remaining features.

Furthermore, data for canonical peptides (non-modified) is more abundant than for non-canonical (chemically modified). We explored whether current methods are sufficient to generalize from canonical data to non-canonical datasets. To do this, we first considered two critical aspects of the modeling problem, namely choice of similarity function for guiding dataset partitioning and choice of molecular representation. Similarity-based dataset partitioning is an evaluation technique that divides the dataset into train and test subsets, such that the molecules in the test set are different from those used to fit the model. We demonstrate, across four peptide function prediction tasks, that chemical fingerprint-based similarity measures outperform traditional sequence alignment-based metrics for partitioning canonical peptide datasets, challenging standard practices. We have also found that the deep-learned embeddings from Chemical Language Models (CLMs) generally outperform  chemical fingerprints and other peptide-specific pre-trained models, performing best for non-canonical peptides and second best for canonical. Despite this, models trained on only one of the two peptide classes fail to properly extrapolate to the other. However, by enriching the canonical datasets with a small proportion of non-canonical peptides, we are able to build robust joint models that generalise adequately to both canonical and non-canonical data.

Diffusion coefficients indicated a strong influence of water on SAA, with SAA displaying higher mobility, whereas HCB exhibited greater accumulation in the HS phase.

Among these enzymes, human SAMHD1 has emerged as a novel dNTPase, demonstrating special catalytic structure and property. This metalloenzyme regulates cellular dNTP concentration through its ability to hydrolyze all four canonical dNTPs into their corresponding 2'-deoxynucleosides and inorganic triphosphates, a reaction requiring coordinated iron and magnesium ions for enzymatic activity. In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations are employed to investigate the mechanistic details of dATP hydrolysis mediated by two metal ions. Starting from the resolved crystal structure, Model1, containing a Fe2+ in the active site, was constructed. Our calculations demonstrate that SAMHD1 employs a bridging hydroxide anion OH\u2212 to attack P\u03b1 site of dNTP, triggering the cleavage of P\u03b1\u2013O5' bond via a trigonal-bipyramidal transition state. Simultaneously, His215 donates a proton to O5' of the leaving group, leading to the formation of 2'-deoxyadenosine and triphosphate. It is further demonstrated that the native Fe2+-Mg2+ bi-metallic centre help catalyse this hydrolysis reaction with a barrier of 13.4 kcal/mol, while the substitution from Fe2+ to Fe3+ abolishes the catalytic activity of SAMHD1. The comparisons between different QM/MM models highlight the high affinity of SAMHD1 for Fe2+ relative to Mn2+ and Mg2+ at one of bi-metallic sites. In addition, the metal ion swapping between Fe2+ and Mg2+ from their crystallographic positions is shown to elevate the energy of the reactant state, underscoring the critical influence of metal coordination geometry on catalytic activity.

In this study, we constructed an HII model system composed of a 90:10 phytantriol:farnesol ratio and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations demonstrated that the model remained stable across various water-to-lipid ratios, and the impact of the water-to-lipid ratio on the HII structural properties was consistent with previous experimental observations. We then used this model to investigate the localization and interactions of two drug molecules: vancomycin and clarithromycin. The results show that the highly lipophilic clarithromycin predominantly associates with the lipid phase, whereas vancomycin, due to its combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, tends to localize at the water-lipid interface, interacting with both phases. We also constructed an HII system with repeating HII units enclosed within Pluronic F127 polymers. Simulations revealed that the F127 polymers interact with the lipid phases at the HII interface region, facilitating excess water permeation into the HII phase system. To investigate the initial surface release mechanism of the drug molecules, we performed umbrella sampling (US) simulations. The energy profiles from the umbrella sampling indicate that polymer-lipid-water interactions at the HII interface reduce the energy barrier for drug release, making the release of vancomycin easier compared to clarithromycin. Our in vitro release study further confirmed that vancomycin exhibited higher release compared to clarithromycin.

By combining analytical solutions with finite element simulations, we first show that a single blocker can distort a background gradient enough to create or eliminate stagnation points, significantly modifying particle transport. We then introduce a second, explicitly sized blocker at one of these stagnation points and measure how its finite radius alters the diffusiophoretic velocity field for a test particle. Even moderate changes in the second blocker\u2019s size can cause noticeable shifts in the substrate distribution, highlighting the importance of accounting for explicit particle radii under crowded or consumption-driven conditions. Our findings underscore that subtle geometric variations\u2014such as the radii and positions of two or more blockers\u2014can profoundly affect diffusiophoretic motion, providing a more complete picture of how blocking and crowding phenomena shape intracellular transport.", "date": "2025-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The study examines the effects of bacterial concentration, curing conditions, and the incorporation of steel fibers and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers on the compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths of concrete. The primary self-healing mechanism is identified as microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP), where bacterial activity facilitates calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083) deposition to seal cracks.

For centuries, it was believed that an absorbance spectrum \u2013 showing the likelihood of a photon to be absorbed by a chromophore at a given wavelength \u2013 is an accurate predictor of how well a photochemical process will proceed when irradiated with different colours of light. Over the last decade this paradigm has been repeatedly challenged for many photochemical systems, as a distinct mismatch between the absorption spectrum and the wavelength resolved photochemical reactivity has been observed. Herein, we unravel the underlying mechanisms behind the mismatched reactivity and absorbance. Initially, we probe the impact that an equilibrium established between reversible photochemical processes has on the mismatch. Subsequently, we establish a critical link between photophysics and photochemistry with a theory based on the selective excitation of specific microenvironments leading to molecular transitions that allow for favourable wavelength-dependent reactivity. Time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy measurements confirm the presence of this selectivity, with both displaying significant red-edge effects that are observed in fluorescence spectroscopy literature, further supporting our theory. By synthetically tethering chromophores together, we further evidence the importance of microenvironments and their wavelength-dependent excited-state lifetimes, presenting the missing link that explains the mismatch for many photochemical systems. The implications of the theory presented herein stretch from additive manufacturing to photodynamic therapy and beyond, meaning that researchers can leverage photochemical mismatches of their design by simply changing the properties of the environment surrounding the chromophore.", "date": "2025-03-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, NLCs often display unpredictable drug partitioning between solid and liquid lipid phases, potentially compromising controlled release profiles. Here, we demonstrate a novel hybrid NLC approach that directs drug loading primarily to the solid phase while maintaining the structural advantages of established NLCs. Using cyclosporine A (CsA) as a model peptide, we exploited the significant solubility differential between medium-chain solid lipids (glyceryl caprylate: 338.95 \u00b1 77.68 mg/mL; glyceryl caprate: 88.63 \u00b1 8.80 mg/mL) and liquid lipid component (soy liquid lecithin: 1.39 \u00b1 0.09 mg/mL) to create a natural concentration gradient favouring a solid phase loading. By strategically combining these medium-chain lipids with selective surfactants, particularly PEG-100 stearate, we enabled the controlled transformation of initially supercooled melts into organised Type I imperfect crystal structures that effectively encapsulate CsA within the solid lipid matrix. This approach allowed single-step hybrid NLC production at temperatures up to 20 \u00b0C lower than conventional methods while reducing homogenization power requirements by 38%. Our optimised formulations maintained particle size (<200nm), polydispersity (<0.3), and spherical morphology during four-week storage at 4 \u00b0C, room temperature, and 40 \u00b0C.

In order to investigate the effect of the terminal group of the end-on ligand on the nanoparticle arrangement, three types of AuNPs were employed by using azobenzene ligands with three different terminal groups (ethyl, acetyl, and nitrile). The obtained AuNPs with ethyl group (Au-L1e/d) are in a weakly ordered state, those with acetyl group (Au-L2e) show a hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline phase upon heating, and those with nitrile groups (Au-L3e) are highly aggregated and do not melt even when heated up to 220\u00b0C.

There is a trade-off between the magnitude of the dipole moment and the aggregation/assembly behavior of the AuNPs. Au-L1e/d and Au-L2e exhibit trans-cis isomerization of the azobenzene ligands upon photoirradiation both in dispersed solution and in the film state. Furthermore, they also exhibit a gradual color change from orange to purple in solution, when the solutions are allowed to stand at rt for 24 h after photoirradiation. By means of tunneling electron microscopy (TEM), it is found that the nanoparticles irreversibly coalesce into a non-uniform morphology after being left to stand for 24 h. Prior to photoirradiation, the ligands are found to be densely packed on the gold surface; this dense packing may be responsible for the desorption after the isomerization to cis forms and the particle growth.

This redistribution of charge provides a compelling explanation for long-standing discrepancies in the modeling of this interface, including the stabilization of partially charged interfacial species such as H$^+$ and most importantly the severe underestimation -- by an order of magnitude -- of the interfacial capacitance in force-field-based methods. Our findings highlight the crucial role of electronic charge spillover in defining interfacial behavior which provides critical insights about the approximations in classical descriptions and for the development of more accurate computational models of electrochemical systems.", "date": "2025-03-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Optimisation of the reaction conditions revealed that the addition of water (3 M) enhances catalytic efficiency, particularly for PNO reduction, suggesting a crucial role of proton availability in facilitating N\u2013O bond cleavage. Through a combination of techniques such as nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, NMR, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the mechanism of this photocatalytic transformation. The reaction is initiated by photoexcitation of the Re-Cl complex, followed by reductive quenching by DIPEA, generating the singly reduced species (1ERS), which serves as the catalytically active species. The deoxygenation mechanism proceeds via proton-assisted N\u2013O bond cleavage, forming a metal-hydroxo intermediate. The rate-limiting step is identified as the electron transfer to the substrate.

However, robust explanations of the foundational underpinnings of this behavior remain elusive. An impediment to the advancement of fundamental understanding is the lack of analysis framework that is simultaneously capable of elucidating water interaction mechanisms and characterizing equilibrium isotherm types while providing a quantitative definition of hydrophobicity. To this end, the study herein develops such a framework that is demonstrably capable of dictating multiple isotherm types, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. A novel hydrophobicity map is utilized to indicate relationships between isotherm types and explicit forms of hydrophobicity. Applied to the assessment of 15 non-functionalized carbons, the nature of water in extreme confinement offered by angstrom sized pores is characterized by both bulk fluidic and molecular behavior. Accounting for fluid-solid and fluid-fluid-solid interaction, the angstrofluidic nature of water in microporous carbon appears to be remarkably similar to equivalent non-functionalized Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) materials and ensembles of graphene layers. Coupling molecular level with bulk fluid behavior, Ising Model- Modified Kelvin Analysis (IMMKA) provides a characterization methodology which identifies nanocapillarity and nanowetting components, partitions various forms of hydrophobicity and is presented in a simple, rigorous, analytic form. The analysis produces results that are consistent with independent data assessment, macroscopic observations of contact angle and the 10-4-3 potential model. Functionalized materials are also considered and novel relationships with surface functionality and fundamental angstrofluidic features of water are delivered herein. Critical to elucidation of hydrophobic phenomena and to novel technologies designed at the molecular level, this study provides validated means for further enhancing angstrofluidic descriptions of water in extreme confinement.

We demonstrate that for all families of particle studied, except those where the corners are capped with aromatic ligands, the optical gap, the onset of light absorption, blueshifts with deceasing particle-core size. For the particles where the corners are capped with alkyl phosphines, phosphine oxides or amines the optical gap is predicted to correspond to an excitation where both the hole and excited electron are delocalised over the inorganic core of the particle, a core-to-core excitation, and hence resemble the cartoon picture of a quantum dot. In contrast, we predict that for particles exclusively capped with bisulfide or alkylthiolate ligands, the optical gap corresponds to a charge-transfer excitation with the hole localised on a subset of ligands and only the excited-electron delocalised over the inorganic core of the particle. For particles where the corners are capped with aromatic ligands the optical gap is predicted to correspond to a ligand-to-ligand excitation, which because of its localised nature does not significantly shift with particle size. However, for these particles with aromatic ligands, core-to-core excitation, lie only slightly higher in energy, and these excited states will shift with particle size and will likely become the optical gap for large(r) particles. Moreover, as core-to-core excitations are predicted to be much more intense than ligand-to-ligand excitations, experimentally one is likely to observe a blueshift with particle size even for particle sizes where the optical gap technically is a ligand-to-ligand excitation.

Colston; Santiago C. Monsalve; Severin T. Schneebeli", "abstract": "The pKa values and associated protonation states of ionizable lipids in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are strongly dependent on their chemical environment. This phenomenon leads to poorly understood structure-function relationships that influence payload delivery, tissue-selective biodistribution, and manufacturing. For example, the charge- and biodistribution of an mRNA-loaded LNP can vary based on the type of ionizable lipid used, the molar ratio of its components, and its cargo. Yet, the spatial resolution of experimental protonation state measurements is currently limited to the apparent charge of an ionizable lipid averaged over all environments/conformations of an LNP \u2014 best represented by its apparent pKa value. Such measurements are too coarse to capture the heterogenous charge distributions of ionizable lipids in LNPs, which influence biocorona formation and interactions with the payload. Similar limitations are inherent to classical fixed protonation-state in silico models that cannot capture the environment-dependent protonation states and pKa values determining local pKa. To address this gap in experimental and computational tools available to accurately determine the local charge distributions in LNPs, this work now incorporates a scalable continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) model to simulate the self-assembly processes of five reported distinct LNP formulations. Parameters for ionizable lipids were generated from fitting fixed lambda-state calculations performed with Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX) to improve conformational sampling during parameterization. Simulated systems were composed of 100 ionizable lipids (50 mol%), cholesterol (40 mol%), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (10 mol%), and mRNA (20 nucleotides) to model the interior of an LNP. Self-assembly was simulated for 100 ns at different pH values to validate the apparent pKa for each system. The theoretically calculated apparent pKa values matched reasonably well with those measured experimentally (mean absolute error = 0.5 pKa units), and all systems exhibited pH-dependent structures. Overall, this work provides a new computational platform technology to (i) predict the pKa values of ionizable lipids in different chemical environments and (ii) enable a structure-based way to model the heterogeneous, environment-dependent charge distributions of ionizable lipids in LNP systems typically encountered during LNP manufacturing and delivery.", "date": "2025-03-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The framework is protocol-agnostic, instrument-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, making it adaptable to various laboratory settings. This work represents a significant step toward fully autonomous laboratories by enabling continuous quality control, reducing the expertise barrier for complex analytical techniques, and facilitating proactive maintenance of scientific instrumentation.

In this study, we combine 43Ca isotopic enrichment with dynamic nuclear polarization (MAS-DNP) under cryogenic conditions to enhance the 43Ca sensitivity and capture transient calcium species in their native state in the course of HAP formation. Fine calibration of the Hartmann-Hahn cross-polarization conditions (low vs high radio-frequency powers) enables to distinguish different calcium-based phases based on the strength of their 43Ca quadrupolar couplings. Hence, we can record the 43Ca NMR fingerprint of sub-millimolar concentrations of PNS and two dimensional 1H-43Ca correlation NMR spectra of calcium phosphate solid phases can be recorded within hours.

It is crucial to maintaining the balance and responsiveness of the nervous system to sensory input. The binding of ligands, in this case glycines, in the extracellular domain (ECD) of the receptor initiates a series of conformational re-arrangements that culminate in the opening of the ion channel in the transmembrane domain. There are five binding sites for orthosteric ligands at the interface between the five subunits of the receptor. Experiments suggest that two or three bound glycines are sufficient to activate the receptor and that the occupancy of binding sites affects (un)binding rates. Here we evaluate\n the dynamics and interplay of empty and occupied binding pockets and their potential cooperativity. We investigate an ECD model for the glycine receptor, built from cryoEM data, by performing molecular dynamics simulations for different combination of ligand occupancies. We highlight the role of glycine in contracting the binding site, optimizing the water content to the amount necessary to mediate crucial interactions, and dragging Loop C to cover the pocket. Each subunit participates in two adjacent binding pockets acting in turn as principal and complementary subunit, with structures, like Loop B and Loop F, directly connected. This suggests a combination of push-pull mechanisms mediated by ligands in a potentially frustrated system, which may favour specific occupancy patterns and/or alternation of binding sites with different levels of contraction.\n ", "date": "2025-03-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The 229Th nucleus has an excited state at 8.355 eV which can be reached using a VUV laser as demonstrated in recent experiments. Incorporating 229Th into a host crystal is an essential step towards developing an ultra-stable nuclear clock. To be a suitable host, a material must have a band gap larger than the nuclear transition frequency. Thus, most research to date has focused on fluorides like LiSrAlF6 and CaF2, for they feature ionic bonding and large band gaps. However, ionicity of chemical bonding can be pushed to its limits by use of superhalogens - polyatomic anions whose electron affinity can be greater than that of the halogens. An additional concern for fluorides is the presence of 19F nuclear spins in the material that can couple to the spin of the 229Th, detrimental to clock performance. In this work we investigate salts containing superhalogen anions, with the goal of identifying promising new hosts for 229Th clocks. Specifically, we investigate compounds of Ca, Sr, and Ba with three anions - [BF4]- , [ClO4]- , and [SO4]2- . By computing the electronic properties of the pure and thorium-doped materials, we predict that M(BF4)2 have the widest band gaps, making them a promising materials class. On the other hand, MSO4 could produce the most accurate clocks by eliminating inhomogeneous broadening due to nuclear spin interactions.

Ideally, molecular dynamics simulations should sample all enzyme configurations along the reaction path using post Hartree-Fock or DFT QM/MM electrostatic embedding methods, but these are computationally expensive. Here, we introduce a simple approach to improve the third-order density functional tight binding (DFTB3) semi-empirical method to model hydride transfer reactions in enzymes. We identified deficiencies in DFTB3's description of the potential energy surface for the hydride transfer step in Crotonyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase (Ccr) and developed a systematic methodology to address these limitations. Our approach involves modifying DFTB3's repulsive potential functions using linear combinations of harmonic functions, guided by analysis of C-H and C-C distance distributions along the reaction path. The optimized DFTB3 Hamiltonian significantly improved the description of the hydride transfer reaction in Ccr, reproducing the reference DFT activation barrier within 0.1 kcal/mol. We also addressed  the transferability of our method by applying it to another hydride transfer reaction bearing the 1,4-dihydropyridine motif but exhibiting distinct structural features of the reactant, as well as the hydride transfer reaction in Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR). In both cases our adapted DFTB3 Hamiltonian correctly reproduced the DFT reference and experimentally observed activation barriers. The low computational cost and transferability of our method will enable more accurate and efficient QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of hydride transfer reactions, potentially accelerating research in enzyme engineering and drug design.

Here, we examine whether integration with polymer physics theory effectively enhances the transferability of machine learning models to predict properties of architecturally and compositionally diverse polymers. To do so, we first generate ToPoRg-18k--a dataset reporting the moments of the distribution of squared radius of gyration for 18,450 polymers with diverse architectures, molecular weights, compositions, and chemical patterns. We then systematically assess the performance of several different models on a series of transferability tasks, such as predicting properties of high molecular weight systems from smaller ones or predicting properties of copolymers from homopolymers. We find that a tandem model, GC-GNN, which combines a graph neural network with a fittable model based on ideal Gaussian chain theory, surpasses both standalone polymer-physics and graph neural network models in predictive accuracy and transferability.  We also demonstrate that predictive transferability varies with polymer architecture due to deviations from the ideal Gaussian chain assumption. Furthermore, the integration with theory  endows GC-GNN with additional interpretability, as its learned coefficients correlate strongly with polymer solvophobicity.

While there are many prior reports demonstrating acquisition of 103Rh solution NMR spectra, there are few examples of 103Rh SSNMR spectra in the literature. Here, we utilize the large 31P-103Rh scalar couplings (J-couplings) to efficiently acquire 31P-detected high-resolution 103Rh SSNMR spectra. 31P{103Rh} J-resolved NMR experiments were used to measure 31P-103Rh J-couplings.

The sideband selective experiments offer significant time savings as compared to existing direct detection methods, which require days of acquisition to obtain a directly detected MAS spectrum, or yield low-resolution static powder patterns.

In this work, we address challenges relating to performance of the Cr(III/II) negative electrolyte, most notably sluggish electron-transfer kinetics and parasitic hydrogen evolution during the charge cycle. Specifically, we expanded on prior studies from the inorganic coordination chemistry literature demonstrating that Cr(III) chloride complexes undergo slow equilibration in aqueous solutions to form distributions of three species where the coordination environment around the metal center can be described generally as [CrClx(H2O)6\u2212x](3\u2212x)+ with 0 < x < 3, each yielding a distinct optical absorption signature. By correlating this speciation behavior with electro-analytical measurements over a range of chloride concentrations, we found the the reversibility of the Cr(III/II) redox feature improves dramatically as chloride concentration increases above 5 mol/L due to the increased concentration of tetraaquo chromium species Cr(H2O)4Cl2+. We used these insights to formulate a weakly acidic ICRFB electrolyte that relies on concentrated LiCl to drive favorable speciation for Cr-chloride at room temperature. This electrolyte exhibits markedly improved reversibility and evidence for diminished H2(g) production in analytical measurements; however, per-cycle capacity fade for this Cl-rich electrolyte still exceeded that of the conventional HCl-based ICRFB electrolyte by at least a factor of two. Despite these findings, insights into the relationship between speciation and electrochemical reversibility are potentially useful in informing the design of Cr-based aqueous electrolytes for energy storage and related applications.", "date": "2025-03-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Electrochemistry; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

To address this issue, we propose a data-driven approach to provide accurate trip-specific battery consumption for EV drivers. First, we present a new multi-fidelity battery performance dataset with 117 laboratory verified current profiles from 23 velocity-based drive cycles, capturing diverse road conditions, driving and charging patterns. We also introduce charge usage score, a metric comparing battery consumption to a reference trip at constant maximum velocity for same duration. Secondly, we demonstrate that incorporating additional trip-specific features, such as terrain, driving and charging patterns improves charge usage score prediction. The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) of machine learning prediction reduced from 5.2% to 4.3% for current-based models and 7.5% to 5.3% in velocity-based models. Finally, we show that charge usage scores can be predicted using only 10% of initial trip data, achieving MAPE of 7.4% (velocity-based models) and 4.4% (current-based models), respectively. Using this early prediction capability, we demonstrate that switching from an assertive to a defensive driving style can save 3% more charge over an 800 second trip. Essentially, this closed-loop feedback system allows drivers with sufficient time to adjust their route, charging strategy and driving style in real time, reducing range anxiety.

The TmUCNPs surrounded by a thin layer of MEH-PPV were photoexcited at 976 nm using a continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared laser. The NIR light was selectively absorbed by the sensitizer of the TmUCNPs, leading to the formation of submillisecond-lifetime excited states of Tm ions in the UCNPs through stepwise multiphoton energy transfer between Yb and Tm. The visible emission from the Tm ions, coupled with their long excited-state lifetime, allowed for the production of locally excited states of the MEH-PPV through the excitation energy transfer (EET) from the individual TmUCNPs.

Furthermore, efficient RNA self-replication involving activated uridine and adenosine still remains a challenge. Here, we employed classical molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the binding specificity of different imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediates, which was suggested to control the yield and fidelity of the reaction.

Among them are cholera toxin (CT) from Vibrio cholerae that causes cholera, and shiga toxin (STx) from Shigella dysenteriae and certain strains of Escherichia coli which cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). While the glycolipid ligands for CT and STx (gangliosides GM1 and Gb3, respectively) have long been known, recent studies have shown that fucosylated structures, like Lewisx (Lex), also play a role in CT binding. This realization raises questions about the importance of interactions between these toxins and non-glycolipid components of the glycocalyx, which are not well understood. To address this challenge, we created glycocalyx models of defined thickness and tunable molecular composition through grafting of mucin-like glycopol-ymers on solid-supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). The synthesized mucin-like glycopolymers comprised a hyaluronic acid (HA) backbone, an anchor tag (biotin or hexa-histidine) at the HA reducing end, and side chains of relevant oligosaccharides (Lex, Gb3 or lactose) at defined densities. Analyses by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and spectroscopic ellipsometry provided quantification of the thickness, mesh size and target glycan concentration of the glycocalyx models, and of toxin binding kinetics. The B subunit pentamers of both CT and STx showed significantly enhanced affinity in the model glycocalyx environment due to multivalent binding to their respective target glycans. Most notably, toxin binding increased super-linearly with the concentration of the target glycan in the model glycocalyx.

Here, we add another class of natural enzymes, which utilize the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor, to the toolbox of photobiocatalysis.

Periodic DFT-based calculations of the magnetic anisotropy energy, i.e., the energy required to rotate the magnetization from parallel to perpendicular relative to the surface normal, predict in-plane magnetic anisotropy, contradicting the experimentally observed easy-axis anisotropy.

Achieving this goal requires a compre-hensive understanding\n of the electrochemical behavior of these filaments. Here, we investigated how the electrochemical behavior of three commercial filaments was affected by alumina polishing, electrochemical activa-tion in 0.5 M NaOH, and electrodepositing Au nanoparticles (NPs). Our goal was to understand if/how a selection of commercial filaments responds to these commonly used pretreatments rather than perform an exhaustive study of all possible combinations of filaments and pretreatments. We characterized the physical properties of each filament/pretreatment using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman microscopy measurements. We then benchmarked the background electrochemical processes (capacitance and solvent window) and the peak potential separation (\u2206Ep) of two common outer-sphere redox species (ruthenium hexamine and ferrocene methanol) for each filament under each pretreatment (i.e., nine total conditions). We subsequently investigated how the filaments responded to inner-sphere redox couples that were sur-face sensitive (ferrocyanide oxidation), dependent on surface adsorption (dopamine oxidation), and sensitive to surface oxides (Fe2+ oxidation). We found that the electrode form factor (i.e., size, ge-ometry, and contact method) matters tremendously when evaluating a 3D printable material\u2019s elec-trochemical properties because uncompensated resistance can lead to misinterpretations of the HET kinetics using voltammetric methods. We also observed that the selected filaments do not respond to pre-treatments identically, and that detailed characterization (especially electrochemical character-ization, including non-faradaic background processes) must be employed when evaluating fila-ments. and electrodepositing metal nanoparticles is a very effective method of producing high-quality sensing interfaces regardless of filament and is probably underutilized in the field.

Experiments indicate that hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites from solution proceeds through amorphous nanoaggregates that gradually evolve in ordering and solubility to the zeolite, suggesting a continuous amorphous to crystal transformation.  Here, we combine molecular simulations, advanced algorithms to identify zeolite order, and computer vision to elucidate the pathway of zeolite formation from solution to nanocrystal. We show that at hydrothermal synthesis conditions, the transformation of precursor aggregates into zeolite is barrierless and proceeds via continuous crystallization within a glassy matrix. Our temperature-size phase diagram for the precursor aggregates reveals that the lines of zeolite-amorphous equilibrium and of maximum crystallization rate converge for nanoparticle diameters of ~3 nm and temperatures of ~200 \u00b0C, eliminating the nucleation barrier and terminating the first-order amorphous-to-zeolite transition below that temperature. Zeolite-like pores and short-range order emerge early within glassy precursors, well before detectable crystallinity appears in simulated or experimental TEM images. These findings explain the puzzling continuous character of zeolite crystallization and the catalytic activity of X-ray amorphous, protozeolite, and embryonic zeolite intermediates. The observed mechanism parallels behavior in other nanoscale systems, such as water in nanodroplets, where finite-size effects also lead to the suppression of the first-order liquid-crystal transitions.

Employing the NIST thermodynamic parameters of substances at saturation, linear regressions of exothermic heat over T give \u03b5_exo=B-(3+2A)/2 RT. B is the molar heat of liquefication, which equals the latent heat (\u2206H_v^\u03a6) at the boiling point. A reflects the molecule's symmetry; the more symmetric the molecular orbits, the smaller A. For example, the symmetry of inert gas atoms gives the operation number n = 1 in the theoretical frame of the geometric symmetry of atomic mass distribution. However, three p orbits give n = 7; correspondingly, A values of Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe are 2.5518, 2.9104, 2.9140, and 2.9178. Similarly, a tetrahedron of C sp3 gives n = 8, CH4: A=2.9519.

Here, we develop a C\u2013H/C\u2013X metathesis reaction through a radical swapping protocol where a hydrogen and halogen are traded between molecules via reversible hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) that allows for mild C\u2013H halogenation.

The approach is intended to support innovation processes for clean technology. Thus, it needs to facilitate a dialogue and encourage innovators to share uncertain information. Such information could potentially hamper the development process if conclusions are drawn based on concepts before scale-up. For the required flexibility and transparency, we propose a series of direct exchanges and preliminary evaluations. The Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, outlined to implement the European Green Deal, calls for the transition towards use of safe and sustainable chemicals, hence the Joint Research Center (JRC) published a framework for Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) chemicals and materials. Among the key features of the framework is the application for early-stage developments of innovations, during which the outcome can be influenced, and parameters are not fully decided. The method proposed in this publication, life cycle-based risk and opportunity mapping (LCBROM), may be used both prior an SSbD assessment to facilitate its scoping process, as well as during an SSbD procedure. An LCBROM intends to bring together knowledge and requirements from different stakeholders in an innovation process and has been applied in four case studies within the area of clean technology. By applying the method we have realized that i) opportunity mapping is key for good involvement of the innovation owner but can only be performed if there is a suitable benchmark technology as reference or the consequences of inaction can be defined, ii) Several methods exist that in theory could be applied for assessing emerging technologies, although none seems to be commonly used, and iii) LCBROM has the potential to fulfill four criteria that we see as crucial for tools intended for assessing innovations at low TRL. A major benefit of the mapping approach is the increased transparency and communication between technology developer, problem owner and assessment experts.

Particularly for construction applications, wood that is resistant to fungal degradation is highly desirable. Chemical modifications, such as acetylation, have been successfully demonstrated to inhibit wood decay by microorganisms. It is well known that acetylation reduces wood moisture content, which slows down motions within the cell wall when measured by X-ray fluorescence microscopy experiments and molecular simulations. The open question is whether acetylation inhibits decay strictly by reducing moisture content, or if specific interactions with the acetyl group hinder motion within the cell wall and further inhibit decay. We investigate these hypotheses directly through molecular simulation, acetylating exposed hemicellulose and lignin hydroxyl groups in existing models for secondary plant cell wall structure to 5-18% weight-percent gain. By comparing diffusive behavior for cell wall polymers, water, and select ions (Na+ and Fe3+ ), we can track the dynamics within the cell wall and identify the causal mechanisms for reduced transport and uptake of these metal ions by acetylated cell walls. We find that the change from hydroxyl to acetyl group alone does not account for reduced transport, with only modest changes in diffusion when acetylated cell walls are expanded to provide constant moisture level. The most substantial changes in diffusion occur where the additional acetylation displaces water, reducing the moisture content for the cell wall. Utilizing these simulations, we further analyze the interactions between ions and cell wall polymers and the evolution of dynamic water pockets within the structure. Ions interact more frequently with the acetyl group than the hydroxyl groups they replace, yielding to increased ion interactions on aggregate upon acetylation. Collectively, these findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which acetylation affects secondary plant cell walls at atomic resolution.", "date": "2025-03-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Biological Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

More specifically, the formation of ionic aggregates in solutions containing large concentration of TFSI anions was shown to alter the water and anions reactivity at electrochemical interfaces, often improving the performance of aqueous rechargeable batteries. However, insights into the role of WiSE solvation structure on ion transfer at electrochemical interfaces are scarce. Herein, interfaces between two immiscible electrolytes (ITIES) are used to study the energetics for ion transfer between aqueous LiCl and LiTFSI solutions and dichloroethane. Combining electrochemical measurements at microinterfaces with metadynamics molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the effect of solvation properties on the energy for transferring Li+ and Cl-/TFSI- ions across the liquid/liquid interface is studied. While increasing the LiCl concentration increases the amount of ion pairs, it only marginally impacts the ions transfer energy. Instead, using large LiTFSI concentrations at which ionic aggregates are formed, ion transfer across the liquid/liquid interface shows a unique behavior that departs from that observed for polarizable or non-polarizable interfaces. Ions do not freely cross the interface, with a transfer energy found \u22488-10 kcal/mol. However, upon polarization, ionic aggregates are found to breach the liquid/liquid interface, locally mixing both solutions.

We report binucleated dizinc catalysts that show exceptional alternating selectivity in this reaction. Metalation of binucleating bis(pyrazolyl)alkanes (PDRH) gives neutral complexes PDRZn2X3 (X = Cl, Br, I) with two dis-tinct zinc sites.

Counterions dynamics is also affected, the most interesting aspect being the presence of a fraction of mobile ions slowly diffusing, compared to the average behavior, which increases with polyelectrolyte branching and their size. Informed by the results on systems with single-size counterions, we also investigate possible changes in behavior of these polyelectrolytes when neutralized by a binary mixture of bulky and small counterions at different relative concentration. Our results show that small counterions demonstrate a greater tendency for remaining located within the inner regions of the polyelectrolyte, particularly when their molar fraction is low and the polyelectrolyte is highly branched. This results in the spatial separation of the two species into core-shell-like structures, which dramatically decreases the diffusivity of the smaller counterions.

The standard methods for measuring apelin rely on immunoaffinity assays, which are not able to reliably distinguish between apelin isoforms. Here we demonstrate an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography \u2013 tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantification of apelin peptide isoforms apelin-12, apelin-13, [Pyr1]-apelin-13, and apelin-17 in human plasma samples. This method is capable of detecting endogenous apelin in human plasma with a limit of detection in the picomolar range and a coefficient of variation of less than 20%. Using this method specific apelin peptides can be detected in plasma from human subjects allowing for future investigations of apelins in health and disease.", "date": "2025-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

While deep learning models have significantly improved affinity predictions, many state-of-the-art approaches rely on complex architectures with tens or hundreds of thousands of trainable parameters, which may lead to overfitting and reduced generalizability. In this study, we introduce ECIF-GCN, a minimalist deep graph learning model that extends the Extended Connectivity Interaction Features (ECIF) framework by incorporating a fully connected graph representation and leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to process molecular interactions. ECIF-GCN was trained and evaluated on LP-PDBbind, a benchmark specifically designed to minimize protein and ligand similarity across dataset splits, providing a rigorous assessment of model generalization. Despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters compared to more complex architectures, ECIF-GCN achieved the lowest RMSE (1.52) in the test set of LP-PDBbind, outperforming models such as InteractionGraphNet and RF-Score, which contain a substantially larger number of parameters. These results demonstrate that high predictive accuracy in binding affinity estimation does not require highly overparameterized deep learning models. These results highlight the potential of minimalist deep learning architectures in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, providing a balance between predictive power, computational efficiency, and generalization ability, and suggest that a carefully designed low-parameter model can achieve state-of-the-art performance, reinforcing the idea that overparameterization is not a prerequisite for robust molecular modeling.", "date": "2025-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, CO2RR only takes place in acidic electrolytes upon addition of spectator cations and the mechanistic basis for this requirement remains unclear. Herein, we present scanning voltammetry experiments conducted in bulk acidic electrolytes in conjunction with dynamic electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) analysis of CO2 consumption and product formation. By quantifying both faradaic CO2 consumption via electroreduction and non-faradaic CO2 consumption via electrolyte carbonation in real-time, we deconvolute the direct role of the added electrolyte cations from their indirect role in fostering a transient local pH swing. We find that across coinage metals and electrolyte compositions, CO2RR commences only upon substantial depletion of hydronium and coincides with non-faradaic CO2 uptake via carbonation. Doping Ag with Pt to promote hydronium consumption via efficient H2 evolution serves to lower the overpotential for CO2RR onset in scanning voltammetry experiments by ~1 V. These findings together indicate that interfacial alkalinization is a pre-requisite for, rather than merely a consequence of CO2RR, and that the primary role of the supporting electrolyte cations is to establish a non-equilibrium interfacial ionic environment depleted in hydronium ions. The findings imply a putative mechanistic model in which hydronium ions serve to inhibit CO2 activation at coinage metal surfaces.

Patel; Jazmin Green; Hyo-Shin (John) Park; Stephanie Luster-Teasley Pass; Renzun Zhao", "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination has posed a significant environmental and public health challenge due to their ubiquitous nature. Adsorption has emerged as a promising remediation technique, yet optimizing adsorption efficiency remains complex due to the diverse physicochemical properties of PFAS and the wide range of adsorbent materials. Traditional modeling approaches, such as response surface methodology (RSM), struggled to capture nonlinear interactions, while standalone machine learning (ML) models required extensive datasets. This study addressed these limitations by developing hybrid RSM-ML models to improve the prediction and optimization of PFAS adsorption. A comprehensive dataset was constructed using experimental adsorption data, integrating key parameters such as pH, pHpzc, surface area, temperature, and PFAS molecular properties. RSM was employed to model adsorption behavior, while gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were used to enhance predictive performance. Hybrid models\u2014linear, RMSE-based, multiplicative, and meta-learning\u2014were developed and evaluated. The meta-learning HOP-RSM-GB model achieved near-perfect accuracy (R\u00b2 = 1.00, RMSE = 10.59), outperforming all other models. Surface plots revealed that low pH and high pHpzc maximized the adsorption while increasing log Kow consistently enhanced PFAS adsorption. These findings establish hybrid RSM-ML modeling as a powerful framework for optimizing PFAS remediation strategies. The integration of statistical and machine learning approaches significantly improves predictive accuracy, reduces experimental costs, and provides deeper insights into adsorption mechanisms. This study underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in environmental engineering and highlights future opportunities for integrating ML-driven modeling with experimental adsorption research.", "date": "2025-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Herein, we report a series of 1,1\u2032-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL)-derived chiral bipyridine ligands that enable iridium-catalyzed regio- and enantioselective meta-borylation of \u03b1,\u03b1-diarylcarboxamides generating an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields and excellent regio- and enantioselectivities. The chiral sidearm, BINOL, holds a Lewis acid aluminum center and interacts with the Lewis basic substrate to control the reaction outcome. The strategy enables the effective transfer of the chiral information, overcoming the challenges of long-range asymmetric induction, presumably due to the closer proximity of the chiral scaffold of the ligand and the (pro)stereogenic center of the substrate. The prochiral substrates were desymmetrized with up to an excellent 99% ee. An unprecedented kinetic resolution for such transformation has also been disclosed with moderate to good selectivity (s-factor up to 19.5). The synthetic utility was demonstrated through a successful scale-up experiment and subsequent transformation of the boronate ester to various functional groups. Further, mechanistic studies indicate that the catalyst primarily governs the enantioselectivity of the desymmetrization reaction, while the kinetic resolution of the mono-borylated product plays a secondary role in further enhancing the product\u2019s enantioselectivity.

In these unique materials, the first excited singlet state (S1) lies below the lowest triplet state (T1), enabling efficient reverse inter- system crossing. Previous computational studies have focused on accurately calculating the inverted energy gap and establishing qualitative structure-property relationships; in this study we quantify relationships that correlate molecular structure with the S1- T1 energy gap, \u2206EST. Using a newly developed benchmark set of 15 heptazine-based INVEST molecules (HEPTA-INVEST15), we demonstrate strong linear correlation (R2 > 0.94) between the degree of intramolecular charge transfer and \u2206EST . Our analysis reveals that strongly electron-donating groups like -N(CH3)2 and -NH2 minimize the magnitude of inverted gaps in monosubstituted heptazines, while paradoxically, triple -NH2 substitution produces the most negative \u2206EST among trisubstituted derivatives.  This contradiction highlights the complex interplay between resonance effects, inductive stabilization, and excited-state aromaticity governing relative stabilization of the S1 and T1 states. We analyze how deviation from single-excitation character, quantified through %R1 values and transition density matrix norms, provides a mechanistic explanation for the relative stabilization of S1 versus T1 states. These correlations generalize effectively to an expanded set of 46 di- and tri-substituted heptazine molecules (HEPTA-INVEST46).

Here, we propose a hierarchical incremental learning research protocol named HiDiscover to systematically expedite the mechanistic exploration in multi-component materials. As illustrations, we study Li-ion transport and gas adsorption in nanoporous framework materials, as well as molecular packing in organic active layers for photovoltaics. The HiDiscover protocol enables the detailed differentiation and facile extraction of ionic and molecular arrangements, and reveals quantitative microscopic features that are difficult to discern through conventional molecular simulations, thereby informing materials design. Our approach is seen to improve the reliability of mechanistic descriptions for three different processes in three different classes of materials.

This solubility limit, shared by the various RE and A combination investigated is likely constrained by the Ni4+ content (t26) whose electronic effect limits doping, regardless the size of RE and A atoms. Alkaline earth (hole) doping induces a decrease in the volume of the unit cell of RE1-xAxNiO3, despite the presence of larger alkaline earth atoms, and an increase in the orthorhombic distortion in the case of RE = Nd (Nd1-xAxNiO3). After topotactic reduction, RE1-xSrxNiO2 infinite-layer were obtained by mixing the perovskite phase with 2 moles of CaH2 in a tube sealed under secondary vacuum and treated at low temperature (250\u00b0C). Thermogravimetric analysis was used to determine the oxygen stoichiometry of the compounds with accuracy. We find that while the perovskite parent compound RENiO3 displays a high crystalline quality, regardless the nature of the rare-earth (Nd or La), marked stacking faults are present in reduced NdNiO2 infinite-layer, as determined by X-ray diffraction measurements using synchrotron radiation. High pressure diffraction experiment further demonstrate the role of pressure in attenuating the effect of these stacking faults that were also partially simulated and modelled using the FAULTs program. These defects are virtually absent for Sr2+ doping at 7 % or when Nd is replaced by La. The occurrence of such stacking faults is confirmed by HRTEM analysis in the case of NdNiO2. These stacking faults are more pronoucened in the reduced infinite layer compositions for which the parent perovskite structure is more distorted, as measured by the departure of the Ni-O-Ni angle from 180\u00b0, establishing therefore a memory effect between the distortion of the perovskite structure and the occurrence of stacking faults after reduction. The more the perovskite structure is distorted, the greater the stacking fault rate. Finally, we report and discuss the magnetic properties, the electrical resistivity and the specific heat of La and Nd based infinite layer compositions with respect to their structural properties.

To identify the responsible enzyme, we applied CRISPR-BEST to knock out genes in the lysocellin-producing strain S. longwoodensis. This allowed us to propose the first annotation of the lysocellin biosynthetic gene cluster and identify the responsible P450 enzyme, LyoI, through reconstitution of the function in vivo. LyoI knockout provided access to the non-oxidized precursor (pre-lysocellin) which allowed both in vitro validation of the unusual direct hydro-2,2\u2019-bifuran to hydro-2,2\u2019-bifuran-2-ol oxidation and investigation of the impact on biological activity.

Herein, we demonstrate internally catalyzed siloxane dynamic chemistry resulting from amides covalently linked through alkyl chains to siloxanes. Small-molecule studies show the formation of exchange products resulting from the reaction of two amide-containing siloxane molecules. From the rubbery plateau modulus, each siloxane-exchange-based CAN exhibits a cross-link density that is temperature-invariant, or nearly so, characteristic of associative CANs. The alkyl length in the siloxane-containing monomer tunes the network cross-link density. Cross-link density recovery after reprocessing is achieved, with the required reprocessing time and temperature decreasing with increasing cross-link density. Stress relaxation is also faster with increasing cross-link density. The faster dynamics and reprocessability with increasing cross-link density arise because associative exchange is second order in siloxane (i.e., cross-linker) concentration. Capitalizing on this, we demonstrate the melt-extrusion of our highest cross-link density CAN, achieving the same cross-link density in extruded and compression-molded CANs.

Among the different technologies, flow cell electrolysers employing foam electrodes offer promising scalability and efficient gas removal. However, the relationship between electrolyte flow uniformity and electrochemical performance remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the influence of flow uniformity on the overpotential in electrocatalytic flow cells by combining Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with experimental electrochemical measurements.  Three flow cell geometries\u2014labeled short, medium, and long\u2014were designed to achieve varying degrees of flow uniformity at the electrode interface. CFD simulations were conducted using OpenFOAM to quantify the velocity distribution across the electrode plane, introducing a Velocity Uniformity Coefficient (VUC) as a metric to evaluate flow homogeneity. The prototypes were fabricated via stereolithography and tested using Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide and Ni oxyhydroxide catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively.  Electrochemical performance was assessed using chronopotentiometry and I-V curves at high current densities (up to 4.5 A), revealing a strong correlation between VUC and overpotential. Designs exhibiting higher flow uniformity (lower VUC) demonstrated significantly lower overpotentials, indicating more efficient catalytic activity. Notably, the \u201clong\u201d design achieved the lowest VUC and best electrochemical performance.

Intermolecular interaction analysis of individual residues are consistent with experimental mutagesis reports, and highlight the importance of specific residues, many of which are evolutionarily conserved, and some are involved in pathogenic mutations.

Recently, two separate studies have elucidated the 3D structure of OAT1 using cryogenic electron microscopy. These structures will be helpful in understanding the OAT1 drug binding and releasing mechanism. This in turn will help in designing drugs that can control the OAT1 functioning and help in controlling the drug concentration in blood. We hypothesize that the OAT1 should have a specific drug binding site where the drug can bind and cease or slower its functioning. In the current work, we have utilized molecular docking simulations to predict the inhibitors that can bind to the OAT1 substrate binding site. Ligand binding to this site will competitively inhibit the substrate, thereby inhibiting OAT1 function.

These ligands formed strong interactions with the protein, as analyzed using the PLIP web server. In addition, the ligand showed drug likeliness properties, a measure of their potential as drugs.

Among these, efficient methods for crosslinking biorelevant molecules (BMs), in- cluding native biomolecules and synthetic drugs and probes, are foundational for constructing multifunc- tional bioconjugates. Despite decades of development, practical crosslinking strategies remain limited, largely relying on reactions with highly reactive but scarce thiol groups and often requiring wasteful, stepwise operations. Expanding the scope to include less reactive but more abundant amino groups could significantly enhance the bioconjugation toolbox, while the ability to differentiate amine subtypes would further refine chemoselectivity and improve precision in crosslinking. Umpolung of primary amines via isothiocyanation presents a promising approach for linking BMs through two nucleophilic handles. How- ever, conventional isothiocyanation reactions typically require highly electrophilic reagents or strongly oxidative conditions, rendering them unsuitable for complex molecular systems. Herein, we present a robust and non-chemist-friendly protocol for the isothiocyanation of primary alkyl amines using CS2 un- der ambient aerobic oxidation conditions, eliminating the need for additional promoters. These mild con- ditions not only ensure broad compatibility with endogenous functional groups in BMs but also unlock a powerful new capability: selective differentiation between primary and secondary alkyl amines.

In particular, understanding the formation of covalent, lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) linkages is crucial because these interactions are known to significantly contribute to plant recalcitrance. In this work, a new mechanism for the formation of LCC linkages in LCB is explored. Our proposal is based on the formation of the oxocarbenium intermediate in sugar moieties in hemicellulose and the subsequent formation of glycosidic bonds between polysaccharides and lignin. We applied density functional theory calculations to monosaccharides and monolignol molecules serving as model precursors for LCB. Namely, mannopyranose, xylopyranose, arabinofuranose, and glucopyranuronic acid were used as hemicellulose models; p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol were employed as lignin models. Computations without the presence of explicit water molecules predict the stable formation of the proposed glycosidic bonds between all lignin and all sugar models, with some exceptions for mannopyranose and arabinofuranose. Whereas including explicit water molecules showed that, for all systems, the formation of LCC bonds is more thermodynamically favourable than in the absence of water or when using implicit solvent models. In addition, the explicit solvent models indicate that hydrogen bonding between water and organic molecules promotes the formation of more stable LCC bonds. Finally, transition states and intermediates associated with the formation of oxocarbenium ions were computationally found for mannopyranose and xylopyranose, allowing us to evaluate the kinetics of LCC linkage formation for major components of hemicellulose in the secondary cell walls of plants. These results, in combination with recent experimental evidence on hemicellulose-lignin interactions in native biomass, suggest that glycosylation reactions via the oxocarbenium intermediate can occur in the secondary cell walls of plants.  Specifically, the hydrated nature of the hemicellulose matrix and the proximity of lignin to hemicellulose in native LCB provides the necessary conditions for the formation of the LCC linkages proposed herein.  Overall, this study provides further evidence for the formation of covalent LCC linkages in LCB.

In this work, we show the power of targeting the density matrix, a linear-scaling sparse SE(3) equivariant matrix that encodes the exact density.  We introduce Graph2Mat, a universal function for converting molecular graphs into equivariant matrices.  We demonstrate how a machine learning model that combines this Graph2Mat approach with state-of-the-art molecular graph representations can accurately predict the density matrix of molecular systems.  The models achieve state-of-the-art performance on electron density prediction by matching the accuracy of grid-based methods, while using datasets that are at least one order of magnitude smaller.  Accurately predicted electron densities can also accelerate Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations by reducing the number of self-consistent field (SCF) iterations needed to converge.  In this work, we get an average 40% reduction on the number of SCF steps in DFT calculations of QM9 molecules with SIESTA.

To test this hypothesis, we curated computational kinetic data and developed models trained exclusively on small molecules to predict relative thermal stability rankings of polymers containing C, H, O, N, F, and Cl. Experimental degradation data from 41 common polymers and $\\sim$7k small molecules was used to benchmark the ability of small-molecule kinetics to predict polymer behavior without additional training data.

Cost-efficient strategies include the concept of additivity via the many-body expansion that treats a molecule as the sum of its parts.

Nevertheless, this framework is incompatible with anionic ligands, because a stable homoleptic, polyanionic parent complex cannot be simulated readily. Here, I explore alternative approaches, first identifying the limits of stability of heteroleptic TMCs when successive Cl- anions are added in representative complexes formed with neutral H2O and CO ligands. I establish that expected linear relationships are preserved, albeit not as strongly as in complexes with neutral ligands. I propose data-efficient interpolation and extrapolation schemes for TMCs that achieve root mean square errors as low as 0.15\u20130.36 eV on HOMO/LUMO levels and gaps or ionization potentials and electron affinities and 4 kcal/mol on adiabatic spin-splitting energies for Fe(II) complexes.

Transition path sampling (TPS) offers a practical way to explore transition routes between metastable minima such as conformers and isomers on the multidimensional potential energy surface. However, TPS has historically suffered from the computational cost vs. accuracy trade-off between affordable force-field simulations and expensive high-fidelity quantum mechanical calculations. ML interatomic potentials combined with TPS offer a new approach for the exploration of transition pathways at near-quantum mechanical accuracy, while keeping the computational cost comparable to classical force fields. In this study, we employ the HIP-NN-TS and ANI-1x neural network-based ML potentials, both trained on the ANI-1x dataset of 5 million HCNO structures. We first verify the correctness of our approach by applying it to alanine dipeptide and compare the resulting energy surface and transition paths to the literature. Our findings suggest that proposed approach holds promise for conformational searches, as evidenced by the chemical accuracy (errors \u2272 1 kcal/mol) for thermal molecular dynamics trajectories of alanine dipeptide. While we were able to successfully reconstruct alanine dipeptide\u2019s potential landscape using both HIP-NN-TS and ANI-1x frameworks, we observed that ML models with lower accuracy may still recover additional important conformations.

Finally, we evaluated a more intricate case, azobenzene, and reiterated that seemingly simple torsions may bear a challenge for ML potentials and limit their applications in TPS.

In the microscopic world, cell crawling and vesicle transport on microtubules rely on the movement of molecular motors. Common to all scales is the unifying principle of breaking symmetry to accumulate work through non-reciprocal motion trajectories. Inspired by nature, the field of soft robotics has developed different actuators that respond to the environment and manipulate objects. However, these actuators typically exhibit reciprocal motion trajectories, where work done in one direction is negated in the return motion. This critically prevents work accumulation in cyclic operation. Here, we introduce a radically simple and universally applicable concept for hydrogel engine systems that overcomes this limitation and achieves non-reciprocal forward and backward motion trajectories through hard-coded kinetic asymmetry in swelling and deswelling transitions. This enables continuous extraction of mechanical work in cyclic operation using a single, uniformly applied stimulus, without the need for complex, externally orchestrated control methods. Our concept leverages physical intelligence in the context of a material-embodied ratchet mechanism, which is independent of scale and geometry, and generalizable to many stimuli. The hydrogel engine system has been successfully implemented in various soft robotic devices, serving as artificial cilia for fluid pumping and conveyor belts for object\ntransport. Starting from thermoresponsive macroscopic engines, the concept is generalized to smaller sizes by microscale printing and to other stimuli.

Unfortunately, current PFAS degradation routes require higher temperatures or highly corrosive conditions and/or lead to incomplete defluorination and generation of shorter alkyl chains. Fortunately, fluorinated compounds are highly vulnerable to reduction. Inspired by the lithium metal battery literature, we develop an ambient temperature and pressure electrochemical degradation process that takes advantage of reactive metals and highly reducing environments. We show that electrodeposited lithium metal can enable 95% degradation and 94% defluorination of a long chain PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) without forming any shorter C2-C7 PFAS as end products. More importantly, we show mineralization to LiF.

We expand the scope to other PFAS compounds and of the 33 PFAS compounds tested, 22 demonstrated degradation amounts exceeding 70% (with some degradation up to 99%), and complete mineralization to inorganic fluorides. Finally, we use the mineralized F\u2212 as a fluorine source for the synthesis of fluorinated non-PFAS compound such as ethane sulfonyl fluoride to complete a circular fluorine loop from waste to valuable product.

We describe herein the isolation of the key radical intermediate state of an acridinium-based conPET catalyst and detailed investigations of its photochemistry by a suite of (photo)reactivity, photoluminescence, and transient absorption techniques, supported by computational studies. We observe strong wavelength and solvent dependencies in the reactivity profile, which correlate well with observations of a long-lived, fluorescent excited state that would be compatible with diffusion-limited reactivity. However, photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies reveal that, counter-intuitively, this state does not actually participate in reactivity. Instead, we see changes occurring far faster than the diffusion limit, which provides strong, direct evidence for preassembly of the photocatalyst and substrate prior to photoexcitation, rather than any alternative hypotheses of conPET reactivity. Moreover, it demonstrates that such preassembly can be mechanistically important even for photocatalysts that possess a long-lived excited state.", "date": "2025-03-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, existing models often come with inevitable limitations: valid only within finite thermodynamic ranges, rely on heavy physical assumptions, or treat specific observed reactivity as isolated occurrences. We present the derivation of the non-linear relationship that generalises the relationship between activation energies with respect to reaction energies in chemical reactions, providing a broader and more overarching model than the classical Bell-Evans-Polanyi relationships, Leffler equation, and Marcus equation. This formulation is reached with minimal assumptions, stemming from the principle of microscopic reversibility. In contrast to the commonly observed Br\u00f8nsted slopes and intrinsic barriers which represent the local approximation of the kinetic-thermodynamic response of a family of reactions only within a small range of reaction energies, we introduce a new set of thermodynamic-independent parameters (Emin, Eeq and \u03b8) that capture the global kinetic-thermodynamic relationship across the entire thermodynamic range. We showcase the applicability of this model and the insights it provides from a set of 1,2-hydride shifts, cyclisations and Beckmann rearrangements, identifying the origin of differences in activation barriers across substrates and enabling the rational evaluation of reactivity trends. The findings demonstrate the chemical significance of the three parameters in the non-linear model inherently affording information about the reaction unattainable through simple data fitting. The equation governing the non-linear relationship provides new paths for the rational modulation of energy barriers, new perspectives towards developing reaction methodology.

Most importantly, we demonstrate that convex nanoparticle electrodes mitigate bubble pinning by promoting unlimited growth and spontaneous detachment. We develop a diffusional theory that explains and generalizes our simulations, predicting the onset currents that drive nanobubbles into a non-stationary growth regime. This theory reveals that the transition to continuous bubble growth occurs when the electrochemically generated gas rate surpasses the diffusion-limited escape rate, independent of electrode size and convex shape but sensitive to the electrode support. The theoretical model extends the predictions to other gas-evolving electrochemical processes, highlighting its relevance for diverse catalytic systems. Surprisingly, our calculations reveal that bubble detachment contributes minimally to the total current. Instead, the enhanced catalytic efficiency of convex electrodes stems from their ability to sustain an exposed reactive surface, even during bubble growth. These findings provide a fundamental framework for designing nanoelectrodes that optimize gas evolution by prioritizing surface exposure rather than relying solely on bubble detachment.

Consequently, our aim is to assess the effectiveness of sponge-like, laterally spaced, hydrogenated titania nanotubes (S-TiO2-NTs) as an immobilisation scaffold for M13 phages in electrochemical systems. The electrodes used in this study were fabricated via anodisation and calcination in a hydrogen atmosphere.

Moreover, measurements over 8 days, at 37\u00b0C and in human serum, were performed to evaluate the stability of the phage-modified electrodes. The obtained results demonstrated that the phages were successfully adsorbed on the electrode surface, which was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the S-TiO2-NTs with wild-type M13 phage were used to detect E. coli bacteria. The limit of detection (LOD) for the electrode was LOD = 3 cells/ml, and the linear range was 10-104 cells/ml.

However, the experimental study of several important physical and chemical processes occurring in oceans remains challenging. In such cases, molecular simulations may be of great help. We have recently demonstrated that molecular dynamics calculations using a state-of-the-art force field can accurately describe the thermophysical properties of seawater by employing a detailed chemical model of the solution. In this study, we extend our previous work by investigating additional properties that require simulations on larger sample and time length scales. The aim of our work is twofold. First, the extended time and size scales of our simulations allow for a relatively precise determination of the electrical conductivity. This is a fundamental property of seawater for which accurate experimental data are available, serving as a further test of the employed force field. Second, the incorporation of CO2 to the sample enables us the evaluation of its diffusion coefficient. To the best of our knowledge, there is not a single estimate (neither experimental nor computational) of the carbon dioxide diffusivity at realistic oceanic conditions. To validate our results, we have also determined DCO2 in pure water. Our simulation results show excellent agreement with experimental data in pure water, which reinforces our confidence in the predicted CO2 diffusivity in seawater. This study, along with previous works, provides a rigorous test of the reliability of the Madrid-2019 force field (together with TraPPE for CO2 ) in saline environments.

The photoswitch\u2019s photophysics are shown to be remarkably different to, and more complex than, those observed for closely related photoactive monomethines dyes, which typically relax in picoseconds by internal conversion. In the rhodanine photoswitch the allowed Franck-Condon excited state relaxes on a sub-picosecond timescale to populate a forbidden (dark) state which rapidly relaxes to a new optical region of the excited state surface. This relaxed dark excited state then relaxes further through at least two intermediate states before finally recovering the ground state in about one nanosecond. The dark states are characterised by transient infra-red spectroscopy and the entire reaction pathway modelled by quantum chemical calculations. Comparison of calculated and measured IR data suggest a triplet mediated isomerization pathway is responsible for the slow excited state dynamics. The triplet state is populated via coupling of nearly degenerate n* and * states in the dark state. This unexpected isomerization pathway has implications for the synthesis, analysis and future applications of rhodanine photoswitches.

Such processes have attractive applications for industrial decarbonization including CO2 capture or mineralization and low-temperature production of Ca(OH)2. Conventional methods of electrochemical acid-base production utilize ion exchange membranes (IEMs) to inhibit proton (H+) and hydroxide (OH\u2013) recombination, but these components lead to high resistive losses, low current densities, and poor tolerance for polyvalent metal ions, which compromise energy efficiency and complicate applications involving mineral resources.

Bulk phase separation occurs for most commercial plastics, giving rise to poor material properties. The fundamental physical limitation is due to the long-chain nature of polymers, which lead to a negligible entropic driving force for mixing. Here, a combined theory and experimental approach demonstrates that the introduction of dynamic covalent bonds to connect the ends of two immiscible polymers can dramatically increase the miscibility criteria compared to the case of blends. This is distinct from compatibilization, where copolymers or crosslinks arrest phase separation of two species. The enhanced miscibility for polymers with dynamic connections is due to the combinatoric entropy of the trifunctional dynamic bond junctions, which can be connected to three chains of the same type or a combinations of both polymers. This junction entropy favors mixing and shifts the thermodynamic criteria for phase separation. Further, predictions indicate that higher functionality dynamic crosslink points can exhibit a factor of seven increase in the critical (\u03c7N)_c that sets the criteria for phase separation.

The anode was further optimized through the incorporation of onion-like carbon (OLC) and Super P65 carbon black (CB) as additives. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrated that the OLC composite exhibited superior performance, including remarkable performance values like initial coulombic efficiency of 79%, a maximum reversible capacity of 383 mAh/g at 0.05 A/g, and a retained capacity of 244 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 1 A/g. Particularly, for sulfur rich polymer precursors, without adding additional elemental sulfur, these values are amongst the highest reported so far. The enhanced performance of the OLC composite is attributed to the improved sodium-ion accessibility by the porous onion-like carbon structure, which enables an increase of surface redox activity. These findings highlight the importance of carbon additives in optimizing the electrochemical behaviour and cycling stability of heteroatom-doped carbon anodes for sodium-ion battery applications, even with a simple polymer precursor without any templating or additional doping.", "date": "2025-03-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Carbon-based Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Electrochemical, DNA-based (E-DNA) sensors meet these needs by utilizing conformational changes in electrode-bound, redox reporter-modified DNA probes upon target binding. The recognition event alters the electron transfer rate from the redox reporter, which can be monitored using square wave voltammetry by synchronizing the excitation frequency with the charge transfer rate. However, the kinetic nature of the surface-bound sensing process makes signaling strongly temperature-dependent, an aspect that has been widely overlooked and that restricts the application of E-DNA sensors to temperature-controlled environments. Here, we explore the relationship between electrochemical signal, square wave frequency, and temperature across different DNA constructs. Doing so, we identified the architectures most susceptible to temperature-induced signal fluctuations and developed two straightforward correction strategies. These approaches are particularly effective for electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors, enabling accurate and stable measurements over a wide temperature range, from 22 \u00baC to 37 \u00baC. By eliminating the significant influence of temperature on signaling, we broaden the applicability of E-DNA sensors, enhancing their performance for point-of-care testing, continuous molecular monitoring, and other real-world scenarios where temperature fluctuations are unavoidable.

However, the photophysics of most of the examples of this class of emitters suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) because of their relatively large singlet-triplet energy gap (EST). Thus, the organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with emitters from this class typically show severe efficiency roll-off. Here, two MR-TADF emitters DiKTaSe and tBuCz-DiKTaSe have been designed and synthesized. The introduction of selenium in the form of an annelated benzoselenophene enhances spin-orbit coupling and increases the RISC rate. The presence of a twisted ortho-substituted tert-butylcarbazole moiety in tBuCz-DiKTaSe helps to increase the intermolecular distance between adjacent emitters and suppresses aggregation-caused quenching of the emission in films. In addition, the large size of the selenium atom and long C-Se bonds induce helical chirality in both DiKTaSe and tBuCz-DiKTaSe. Finally, the OLEDs with DiKTaSe showed maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 22.7% while OLEDs with tBuCz-DiKTaSe showed a higher EQEmax of 27.8% and less-pronounced efficiency roll-off, with EQE100/EQE1000 of 23.5/12.5%.

Their potential in rational enzyme engineering makes them valuable for the synthesis of diverse C-glycosides. However, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear. To address this, we investigated the C-glycosylation of phloretin catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase GgCGT in the presence of the coenzyme UDP-glucose. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a cluster model, we identified the most favorable pathway for C-glycosylation. The reaction proceeds via an initial proton transfer from phloretin to UDP-glucose, followed by the nucleophilic attack of phloretin on the glucose moiety and subsequent dissociation of UDP in an SN2-like manner. The SN2 step yields non-aromatic intermediate, which can be rapidly converted to C-glycoside even without an enzymatic environment. The key residue that facilitates the rate-determining SN2 step is His-27, which stabilizes phloretin via hydrogen bonding. Additionally, to clarify why alternative products such as O-glycosides are not formed, we also investigated the O-glycosylation pathway. Our calculations revealed that O-glycosylation was promoted by proton transfer from UDP-glucose, like C-glycosylation, but was suppressed by structural fixation due to hydrogen bonding among phloretin, glucose, and GgCGT.

The alternative pathway, a concerted radical capture and carbon\u2013carbon bond formation, has been largely overlooked. This study investigates the ligand effect and kinetics of nickel-mediated radical capture and reductive elimination, which provide evidence to distinguish between stepwise and concerted pathways. Through radical clock experiments, spectroscopic investigation, electrochemical studies, and multivariate linear regression analysis of a series of [(py-box)Ni(Ar)]BArF4 complexes, we established a strong correlation between the rate of radical capture and HOMO and LUMO energies, along with charge stabilization of the aryl actor ligand.

Redox-active nitrogen ligands and non-redox-active phosphine ligands exhibit contrasting reactivity, with only redox-active ligands facilitating radical capture and carbon\u2013carbon bond formation. This critical role of ligand redox activity can be attributed to the participation of the LUMO in bond cleavage and formation. Among redox-active ligands, bidentate and tridentate ligands exhibit similar rates, suggesting a consistent mechanism with relatively minimal ligand effects.

At the core of this workflow, a reinforcement learning agent assembles an interpretable reactor model by iteratively simplifying general differential balance equations and fitting the resulting candidate model to experimental data. We demonstrate the performance of our workflow in two case studies.

The agent accelerates the model derivation process significantly compared to an exhaustive enumerative search.

A liquid-phase esterification reaction of (2-bromophenyl)methanol and acetic anhydride was used as a test system.

In this work, a workflow for automated generation of digital twins is extended to handle complex experimental systems comprised of interdependent, spatially distributed phenomena. The search for accurate models is performed by hierarchically connected reinforcement learning agents that operate on a basis of ontological system knowledge. The extended workflow is shown to reliably find accurate models of chemical systems, exemplified on a phase transfer catalysis reaction and a Taylor-Couette reactor. For the latter, its non-ideal flow patterns were predicted within a deviation of 5%, and automatically generated compartmentalizations were found to have comparable physical interpretations to bespoke models from literature. Additionally, the reinforcement learning agents were able to accurately recalibrate models up to two times faster when drawing upon pre-training under a different operation condition. By generalizing all parts of the automated modeling procedures, we enable the efficient (re-)use of knowledge previously confined to the human modeler.

With growing recognition of electrochemistry as a powerful tool to improve the scope and sustainability of organic synthesis, increasing efforts have been directed toward developing asymmetric electrocatalytic reactions to access challenging chiral molecules. However, many useful electrochemical reactions rely on direct electrolysis without a catalyst, making them inherently difficult to render enantioselective. Supporting electrolytes are integral to electrochemical systems and, in addition to ensuring sufficient solution conductivity, they can influence the rate and selectivity of electrochemical transformations. Chiral supporting electrolytes can mediate asymmetric reactions via direct electrolysis, but their use in organic electrosynthesis remains largely unexplored. Here, we describe the use of substoichiometric chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes to facilitate the oxidation of racemic trivalent phosphines to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides. Our approach relies on a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) strategy that exploits the rapid pyramidal inversion of an anodically generated phosphoniumyl radical cation, while a high concentration of chiral phosphate at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface enhances enantioselective control during rate-limiting nucleophilic addition.

However, its cyclability and stability are poor due to oxidation of silicon during the reaction, which also results in stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen. Despite this, the exact contribution of stoichiometric component in the reaction remains unknown. This study demonstrates that the stoichiometric hydrogen contribution when using silicon photocatalysts is dependent on the type of sacrificial reagent. In the presence of triethanolamine and sodium sulfite, which increase the solution's pH, over 90% of the hydrogen produced originates from the stoichiometric reaction. In contrast, when alcohol-based sacrificial reagents are used, the ratio of catalytic to stoichiometric hydrogen depends on the size of the alcohol molecule. Smaller alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, result in higher overall hydrogen production; however, more than 40% of it originates from the stoichiometric reaction of silicon with water. As the alcohol size increases, the amount of water near the catalyst surface is limited, leading to decreased hydrogen production rates but improved photocatalyst stability. This study highlights the major role of the undesirable side reactions in silicon based photocatalysis and the need for more rigorous hydrogen quantification protocols to determine true photocatalytic activity.

Here, we introduce novel sodium-based coordination systems comprising 1,10-phenanthroline-5-carbonitrile (CNphen) and sodium 2,6-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzenethiolate (NaTMSBT). Under the control of the stoichiometry of Na(TMSBT) and CNphen, two molecular assemblies can be obtained in the solid state. [Na(THF)(CNphen)(TMSBT)]N (Na1D) represents an unprecedented neutral linear assembly, whereas {[Na(CNphen)4](TMSBT)}N (Na2D) is a two-dimensional polymeric arrangement with the sodium ion being octahedrally coordinated similar to 18 valence electron transition metal complexes, and the thiolate acting as counter anion. Due to the high electron-rich character of TMSBT and electron-deficient CNphen, Na1D and Na2D feature bright low-energy emissions from intra- and intermolecular through-space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states, respectively. An exceptionally short C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 distance between CNphen and TMSBT, enabled by the weak covalent character of the Na\u2013ligand bonds, leads to a highly efficient TSCT process.

To fabricate nanotip electrodes with suitable size and geometry, the carbon fiber is generally etched using flame etching or electrochemical etching. However, current methods suffer from low reproducibility and poor success rates. In this work, we present a novel, simple-to-use method for fabricating highly sensitive pointy electrodes with tip diameters of ~150 nm. This method uses the controlled heat from a time- and temperature-regulated box-shaped metal heating filament of a micropipette puller. Scanning electron microscopy showed that electrodes produced by this approach exhibit a unique rough surface densely covered with carbon nanocavities and nanodots. Further, characterization using energy dispersive spectroscopy and Raman microscopy together with square wave and cyclic voltammetry revealed an increased abundance of graphitic edge plane defects at the electrode surface, resulting in a remarkable increase in sensitivity and electron transfer kinetics for the detection of redox-analytes and multiple catecholamine neurotransmitters while reducing surface fouling. Limiting the nanoelectrode tip length to \u223c10 \u00b5m and inserting it into the cytoplasm of SH-SY5Y cells resulted in excellent low-noise amperometric recordings of intracellular norepinephrine content stored in individual secretory vesicles, which serves as a great proof of concept for the use of these nanostructured electrodes also for studies on neurotransmission at single cells.

To further improve performance, the 1D COF was in situ grown on carbon nanotubes (CNT), yielding COF@CNT composites with a unique dendritic core-shell structure that maximises active-site exposure. The COF@BFPPQ-4C composite delivers exceptional long-term cycling stability, exhibiting a maximum capacity of 329 mAh g\u207b\u00b9 at 100 mA g\u207b\u00b9 and retaining about 100 mAh g-\u00b9 even at 5000 mA g-\u00b9, and outstanding rate capability. Cathodes prepared with a high CNT ratio and in situ growth strategy outperform conventional composites. The COF@BFPPQ\u2019s maximum capacity contribution reaches 421 mAh g\u207b\u00b9, surpassing previously reported values. Through capacity analysis, XPS, and DFT calculations, we propose that each COF@BFPPQ unit participates in the reversible storage of two PF\u2086\u207b anions and eight Li-ions during the charge/discharge processes. This work highlights the potential of molecularly engineered 1D COFs as high-performance organic cathodes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).", "date": "2025-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This study reveals how specific ligand chemistries catalyze or constrain the aggregation dynamics of peptide-driven DLA using silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a platform. We first functionalized AgNPs with nine ligands\u2014phosphines, thiolates, and polyphenols\u2014 chosen for their unique interactions with metal surfaces and impact on stability and reactivity. Our aim is to pinpoint which ligands best promote fractal structure formation, providing fresh insights into the deliberate design of nanoparticles. By analyzing ligand charge, functional group, and binding affinity we uncover the mechanistic factors that drive fractal growth, oxidation dynamics, and structural stability. Comprehensive spectroscopic and microscopic analyses reveal that aromatic phosphine ligands\u2014particularly bis(p-sulfonatophenyl)phenylphosphine (BSPP)\u2014 uniquely promote fractal assembly, whereas thiol- and polyphenol-based ligands primarily lead to non-fractal aggregates. This trend is likely due to an optimal balance of electrostatic stabilization and controlled ligand desorption. In contrast, thiol and polyphenol ligands either bind too strongly, preventing the necessary ligand displacement for fractal assembly, or lack the electronic and steric properties required to modulate oxidation dynamics. Our data confirm this mechanism: X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy detects oxidized silver species in BSPP-Ag fractals, zeta- potential measurements indicate charge neutralization, and small-angle X-ray scattering shows increased light scattering of BSPP-AgNPs, suggesting surface heterogeneity.

This mZn occurs especially in the central nervous system, where it plays a fundamental role in signal transduction. Accordingly, a dysregulated zinc homeostasis is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

In this study, we investigate how nanophase structuring within ternary solvents impacts the kinetics of strain-promoted azide-alkyne click reactions. Ternary solvents were designed to either promote or suppress nanophase structuring, with dynamic light scattering being used to assess nanoscale domain formation. High-throughput UV-Vis kinetic analysis revealed that hydrophobic reactants exhibited significantly enhanced reaction rates within ternary solvents, beyond the hydrophobic effects induced within water-containing binary solvents. Rates were elevated for ternary compositions within a small, specific region of the ternary phase diagram expected to contain oil-in-water nanophases. This kinetic enhancement effect was removed when hydrophilic reactants were used or when nanophase stability was reduced. These findings suggest that the structure of ternary solvent nanophases can be harnessed to modulate reaction kinetics and have influence beyond that of the bulk solvent properties like the polarity or water-induced hydrophobic interactions between reagents.

However, despite rapid recent improvements, record Se solar cells only reach a third of their achievable efficiencies at the radiative limit, primarily due to a low open-circuit voltage relative to the band gap. The origins of this voltage deficit, along with the high doping densities often reported for trigonal selenium (t-Se), remain unclear. Here, we explore the point defect chemistry of t-Se combining first-principles calculations with experimental studies of thin-films from state- of-the-art PV devices. Our findings reveal a remarkable ability of the helical t-Se chains to reconstruct and form low-energy amphoteric defects, particularly in the case of self-vacancies and hydrogen, pnictogen, and halogen impurities. While chalcogen impurities and self-interstitials also form low-energy defects, these are electrically neutral. We also find that both intrinsic and extrinsic point defects do not contribute significantly to doping, either due to electrical inactivity (chalcogens) or self-compensation (hydrogen, halogens, pnictogens). Finally, we show that intrinsic point defects do not form detrimental non-radiative recombination centres and propose that PV performance is instead limited by other factors.

In the case of aqueous-based CO2 absorbents, which have been identified as the basis for one of the most promising and scalable DAC approaches, a large energetic penalty is associated with heating and boiling off water, as required for solvent regeneration in a conventional thermal-swing DAC process. This could be avoided by employing alternative solvent regeneration methods based on electrochemical or photochemical pH swings. Photochemical approaches involving photoacids or photobases are particularly promising, as they offer the prospect for using abundant and renewable solar energy, though efficient solvent regeneration and recycling in a realistic multi-cycle DAC process remains challenging. Here, we report a photochemically-driven DAC process (photo-DAC) in which atmospheric CO2 capture by an aqueous oligopeptide, i.e., glycylglycine (GlyGly), is enabled through a pH swing by a guanidine photobase, i.e., pyridine-substituted diiminoguanidine (PyDIG). Upon irradiation with UV light, the PyDIG photobase undergoes photoisomerization from the E,E to the Z,Z isomer, corresponding to a pKa increase of 2.8 units that activates GlyGly for DAC through deprotonation. After the GlyGly/PyDIG solvent is saturated with atmospheric carbon dioxide, leaving it in the dark under ambient conditions leads to isomerization of PyDIG from the Z,Z back to the E,E isomer, which is accompanied by a pH drop and CO2 release. To demonstrate the recyclability of the GlyGly/PyDIG solvent, we have completed three consecutive DAC cycles, with a measured average cyclic capacity in the range of 0.21\u20130.26 mols CO2 per mol of GlyGly/PyDIG, and minimal loss in efficiency from one cycle to another. These results open the prospect for energy-efficient DAC cycles completed entirely at ambient conditions, thereby avoiding the significant energy penalties associated with heating and boiling aqueous solvents.", "date": "2025-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.); Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resins, which contain non-selective basic functional groups and selective iron oxide nanoparticles (FeOnp), can effectively remove phosphate from wastewater. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the mechanisms of phosphate selectivity and influence of competing ions, hindering needed efforts to model adsorption dynamics and design scalable adsorption processes for varying wastewaters. To address these gaps, we integrated aqueous-phase adsorption analysis with solid-phase, synchrotron-based X-ray characterization; this integration facilitated elucidation of the distribution and speciation of iron, phosphate, and competing anions on HAIX resins. We compared a quaternary ammonium-functionalized HAIX resin (SBA) to a tertiary amine version (WBA) to determine the role of functional groups. X-ray radiography revealed differences in FeOnp speciation (goethite vs. ferrihydrite) and distribution (peripheral vs. homogeneous) between the resins, resulting in varied phosphate affinity and intraparticle diffusion resistance. Using micro-X-ray fluorescence (\u03bc-XRF) and micro-X-ray absorption near-edge structure (\u03bc-XANES) spectroscopy, we identified differences in where and how phosphate binds across resin types and wastewaters. Across wastewater compositions, FeOnp sites in WBA contribute more to phosphate adsorption than in SBA, possibly due to variations in Fe distribution and speciation. Phosphate adsorption densities calculated from quantitative \u03bc-XRF maps matched those from aqueous analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of this integrated approach. Overall, results demonstrate the use of synchrotron-based X-ray characterization for investigating adsorption mechanisms and advance HAIX as a phosphate recovery technology from complex wastewaters.", "date": "2025-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Environmental Science; Natural Resource Recovery; Water Purification; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we circumvent the transparency criterion by synthesizing the fillers in-situ post-fabrication, thus enabling the fabrication of composites using VAM. To demonstrate the versatility and utility of our approach, we converted Xolography-printed hydrogels into magnetic and conductive hydrogel composites with filler weight fractions of up to 65 wt%.

Compared to conventional, carbon-fiber-based porous electrodes, non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) offers a versatile manufacturing approach to tailor electrode microstructures and enhance electrochemical performance, yet optimizing mass transport remains a key challenge.

We show that conditioning neural network-based models on trainable embedding vectors can effectively account for quantitative differences between methods. This allows for joint training on multiple datasets that would otherwise be incompatible. Therefore, this procedure circumvents the need for re-computations at a unified level of theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training on multiple reference methods enables transfer learning between tasks, resulting in even lower errors compared to training on separate tasks alone. Furthermore, we show that this approach can be used for multi-fidelity learning, improving data efficiency for the highest fidelity by an order of magnitude.

Herein, we propose a new strategy that successfully overcomes these limitations through using an electron-donating motif to modulate NO-affinitive catalysts, thereby creating dual active site with synergistic functionality. Specifically, we integrate electron-donating nanoparticles into a Fe single-atom catalyst (FeSAC), where Fe sites ensure strong NO adsorption, while electron-donating motifs promote water dissociation and NO hydrogenation. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), and theoretical calculations reveal that electron-donating motifs increase Fe site electron density, strengthening NO adsorption. Additionally, these motifs also promote water dissociation, supplying protons to lower the NO hydrogenation barrier. This synergistic interplay enables a cascade reaction mechanism, delivering a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3% and a NH3 yield rate of 709.7 \u00b5g h-1 mgcat.-1 under 1.0 vol% NO in neutral media, outperforming pure FeSAC (NH3 yield rate: 444.2 \u00b5g h-1 mgcat.-1, FE: 56.6%) and prior high-NO-concentration systems. Notably, a record NH3 yield of 3123.8 \u03bcg h-1 mgcat.-1 was achieved in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under a 1.0 vol% NO.

A promising approach is redox sorbent-based electrochemically induced DAC, which operates at ambient conditions with significantly lower energy costs while utilizing clean electricity. However, the oxygen sensitivity of redox sorbents remains a major challenge. Thus, the feasibility of achieving electrochemically induced DAC with redox sorbents remains uncertain. Despite the vast difference in partial pressures between carbon dioxide (CO2) and molecular oxygen (O2) in air, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate in plant leaves can preferentially react with CO2 in the sunlight, thus achieving the net CO2 removal. Motivated by the nature-based DAC solution, we hereby developed an aqueous-soluble oxygen-tolerant fluoflavine disulfonate (FFDS) sorbent for DAC. Electrochemical characterizations, spectroscopic studies, along with theoretical calculations, reveal that FFDS undergoes proton-coupled electron transfer and exhibits a redox potential higher than the two-electron transfer oxygen reduction potential. When exposed to simulated flue gas containing 10% O2, the FFDS sorbent demonstrates reversible CO2 capture and release with an average CO2/e molar ratio of 0.88. Implemented for both indoor and outdoor DAC in Singapore, FFDS sorbent shows stable cycling performance over 40 days with a three-day DAC under the normal discharge-charge mode, and exhibits an enhanced CO2 capture capacity and a Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99% with an accelerated overnight DAC under the deep discharge-charge mode. Doubling the concentration of FFDS leads to a twofold increase in CO2 capture/release capacity, regardless of whether the three-day DAC is conducted indoors or outdoors.

Using methyl methacrylate (MMA) as a case study, the framework examines the EoL supply and management chain for plastic-related chemicals, leveraging publicly available regulatory data to identify potential chemical redistribution, environmental releases, and EoL exposure scenarios. The analysis finds potential inter-EoL transfers, where chemicals transition between EoL activities before disposal or reuse, potentially leading to unintended environmental releases. Other chemicals detected alongside MMA in EoL streams (co-occurring chemicals) suggest contamination in recycled materials, unintentional environmental releases during recycling, and releases from wastewater treatment systems. However, data limitations and reporting variability introduce uncertainties that may affect chemical tracking accuracy. This study underscores the need to integrate facility, process, and equipment-level data to address these challenges to refine environmental release estimates and exposure assessments.

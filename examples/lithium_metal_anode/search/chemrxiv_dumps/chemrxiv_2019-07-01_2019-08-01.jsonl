Herein, we describe the colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals (NCs) of this compound, through a hot-injection route entail- ing the reduction of rhenium (+7) oxide with a long chain ether. This synthetic protocol is fundamentally different from the more widely em- ployed nucleophilic lysing of metal alkylcarboxylates for other metal oxide NCs. Owing to this difference, the NC surfaces are populated by ether molecules through an L-type coordination along with covalently bound (X-type) hydroxyl moieties, which enables easy switching from nonpolar to polar solvents without resorting to cumbersome ligand exchange procedures. These as-synthesized NCs exhibit absorption bands at around 590 nm (\u22482.1 eV) and 410 nm (\u22483 eV), which were respectively ascribed to their LSPR and interband absorptions by Mie theory simulations and Drude modeling. The LSPR response arises from the oscillation of free electron density created by the extra Re d-electron per ReO3 unit in the NC lattice, which resides in the conduction band. Further, the LSPR contribution facilitates the observation of dynamic optical modulation of the NC films as they undergo progressive electrochemical charging via ion (de)insertion. Ion (de)insertion leads to distinct dynamic optical signatures, and these changes are reversible in a wide potential range depending on the choice of the ion (lithium or tetrabu- tylammonium). Nanostructuring in ReO3 and the description of the associated plasmonic properties of these NCs made this optical modulation feasible, which were hitherto not reported for the bulk material.

Hence, the inherent multivariate nature of porous liquids makes them amenable to high-throughput optimisation strategies. Here we develop a high-throughput robotic workflow, encompassing the synthesis, characterisation and property testing of highly-soluble, vertex-disordered porous organic cages dissolved in a range of cavity-excluded solvents. As a result, we identified 29 cage-solvent combinations that combine both higher cage-cavity concentrations and more acceptable carrier solvents than the best previous examples. The most soluble materials gave three times the pore concentration of the best previously reported scrambled cage porous liquid, as demonstrated by increased gas uptake.

Currently, no unified framework exists to comprehensively describe these photophysical properties, namely the absorption maxima, emission maxima, Stokes shifts, vibronic progressions, extinction coefficients, Stark tuning rates, and spontaneous emission rates, especially one that includes the effects of the protein environment. In this work, we study the correlations among these properties from systematically tuned GFP environmental mutants and chromophore variants. Correlation plots reveal monotonic trends, suggesting all these properties are governed by one underlying factor dependent on the chromophore's environment. By treating the anionic GFP chromophore as a mixed-valence compound existing as a superposition of two resonance forms, we argue that this underlying factor is defined as the difference in energy between the two forms, or the driving force, which is tuned by the environment. We then introduce a Marcus-Hush model with the bond length alternation vibrational mode, treating the GFP absorption band as an intervalence charge transfer band. This model explains all the observed strong correlations among photophysical properties; related subtopics are extensively discussed in Supporting Information. Finally, we demonstrate the model's predictive power by utilizing the additivity of the driving force. The model described here elucidates the role of the protein environment in modulating photophysical properties of the chromophore, providing insights and limitations for designing new GFPs with desired phenotypes.

We confirm that the models developed in this study can reliably predict the RIs of the top 1,000 compounds, and are thus able to capture their ranking. We believe that this is the first study to develop a data-derived model that ensures the reliability of RI predictions by model augmentation in the extrapolation region on such a large scale. These results underscore the tremendous potential of machine learning in facilitating molecular (hyper)screening approaches on a massive scale and in accelerating the discovery of new compounds and materials, such as organic molecules with high-RI for applications in opto-electronics.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2019-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Quantum Computing; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These roadblocks are here approached, respectively, by the combination of a cellulose separator with a cathode-facing conductive porous carbon interlayer, based on their previously reported individual benefits. The cellulose separator increases cycle life by 33%, and the interlayer by a further 25%, in test cells with positive electrodes with practically relevant specifications and a relatively low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Despite the prolonged cycle life, the combination of the interlayer and cellulose separator increases the polysulfide shuttle current, leading to reduced Coulombic efficiency. Based on XPS analyses, the latter is ascribed to a change in the composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li. Meanwhile, electrolyte decomposition is found to be slower in cells with cellulose-based separators, which explains their longer cycle life. These counterintuitive observations demonstrate the complicated interactions between the cell components in the Li-S system and how strategies aiming to mitigate one unwanted process may exacerbate another.

The cell biology studies including cytotoxicity assays, ROS production assays suggested Toluidine blue to be a biocompatible dye as reduced ROS levels and cytotoxicity was observed after exposure of Toluidine blue on Tau stressed cells. The photo-excited Toluidine blue modulates the cytoskeleton network in cells, which was supported by immunofluorescence studies of neuronal cells. The studies in UAS Tau E14 transgenic Drosophila model suggested that photo-excited Toluidine blue was potent to restore the survival and memory deficit of Drosophila. The overall findings of our studies suggests that Toluidine blue to be a potent molecule in rescuing the Tau-mediated pathology by inhibiting its aggregation, reducing the cytotoxicity; modulating the tubulin level and behavioral characteristics of Drosophila. Thus Toluidine blue can be addressed as a potent molecule against Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "date": "2019-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among many techniques, quantum chemical topology (QCT) has emerged as a robust technique to understand the features of the chemical bond and electron organization within molecules. One consolidate tool within QCT is the topological analysis of the electron localization function (ELF). Most research on ELF and chemical bond has focused either on singlet ground states or the first excited triplet. However, most photochemical reactions and photophysical processes occur in excited states with the same spin-symmetry as the ground state. In this work, we develop a proposal on how to compute the ELF in excited states of any symmetry within linear-response time-dependent density functional theory. Then, we study the evolution of the chemical bonds in the ground and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of a prototypal Schiff Base (the salicylidene methylamine, Scheme 1). We found that the topological analysis of the ELF along reaction paths explain the presence of a barrier for the proton transfer in the ground state and the absence of it in the excited state. Briefly, in the ground state, the cleavage of the O-H bond results in a structure with high electrostatic potential energy due to an excess of electron lone-pairs (3) in the Oxygen atom, which explains the barrier. In the excited state, the electronic transition promotes an enhancement of the basicity of Nitrogen by allocating three nonbonding electrons in the basin of its lone-pair. This excess of electrons in the N exerts an electrostatic attraction of the proton, which we suggest as the primary driven-force of the barrierless reaction. Because in excited states the molecule can develop more vibrational kinetic energy than in the ground state, we perfumed an ab initio molecular dynamics of the proton transfer in the excited state and corroborate that our conclusions on the topology of the ELF do not change due to dynamic effects.", "date": "2019-07-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Experimental PDFs retrieved from electron diffraction (ePDF) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represent an attractive alternative to traditional PDF obtained from synchrotron X-ray sources, when employed on minute samples. Nonetheless, the inelastic scattering produced by the large dynamical effects of electron diffraction may obscure the interpretation of ePDF.  In the present work, precession electron diffraction (PED-TEM) has been employed to obtain the ePDF of two different sub-monolayer samples \u2013\u2013lipoic acid protected (~ 4.5 nm) and hexanethiolated(~ 4.2 nm, ~ 400-kDa core mass) gold nanoparticles\u00ad\u00ad\u2013\u2013randomly oriented and measured at both liquid-nitrogen and room temperatures, with high dynamic-range detection of a CMOS camera. The electron diffraction data were processed to obtain ePDFs which were subsequently compared with PDF of different ideal structure-models. The results demonstrate that the PED-ePDF data is sensitive to different crystalline structures such as monocrystalline (truncated octahedra) versus multiply-twinned (decahedra, icosahedra) structuresof the face-centered cubic gold lattice. The results indicate that PED reduces the residual from 46% to 29%; in addition, the combination of PED and low temperature further reduced the residual to 23%, which is comparable to X-ray PDF analysis. Furthermore, the inclusion of PED resulted in a better estimation of the coordination number from ePDF.

HBs are characterized by two main features, strength and directionality, with a high degree of heterogeneity across different chemical groups. These characteristics are dependent on the electronic configuration of the atoms involved in the interaction, which, in turn, is influenced strongly by the molecular environment where they are found. Studies based on the analysis of HB in solid phase, such as X-ray crystallography, suffer from significant biases due to the packing forces. These will tend to better describe strong HBs at the expenses of weak ones, which are either distorted or under represented. Using quantum mechanics (QM), we calculated interaction energies for about a hundred acceptor and donors, in a rigorously defined set of geometries. We performed about 180,000 independent QM calculations, covering all relevant angular components, and mapping strength and directionality in a context free from external biases, with both single-site and cooperative HBs. We show that by quantifying directionality, there is not correlation with strength, and therefore these two components need to be addressed separately. Results demonstrate that there are very strong HB acceptors (e.g.,DMSO) with nearly isotropic interactions, and weak ones (e.g.,thioacetone) with a sharp directional profile. Similarly, groups can have comparable directional propensity, but be very distant in the strength spectrum (e.g., thioacetone and pyridine). These findings have implications for biophysics and molecular recognition, providing new insight for chemical biology, protein engineering, and drug design. The results require rethinking the way directionality is described, with implications for the thermodynamics of HB.</div>", "date": "2019-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A widely applied approach to studying folding landscapes is to describe the dynamics along a small number of reaction coordinates. However, other strategies involve more elaborate analysis of the complex phase space. There have been many attempts to obtain a more detailed representation of all available conformations for a given system. In this work, we address this problem using a metric based on internal distances between amino acids to describe the differences between any two conformations. Using an effective projection method, we are able to go beyond the usual one-dimensional representation and thus visualize landscapes in two dimensions. We refer to this method as Energy Landscape Visualization Method (ELViM). We have applied this methodology using C\u03b1 structure-based model (SBM) to study the folding of two well-known proteins: SH3 domain and Protein-A. Our visualization method yields a detailed description of the folding process, making possible the identification of transition state regions, and establishing the paths that lead to the native state. For SH3, we have analyzed structural differences in the distribution of folding routes. The competition between the native and mirror structures in protein A is discussed. Finally the method is applied to discuss the conformational changes of the Elongation Factor Thermally unstable (EF-Tu) and its transition states. Distinct features of the ELViM are that it does not require or assume an existence of a reaction coordinate, and it does not require kinetic information regarding the investigated system.", "date": "2019-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Most organic molecules, however, are colorless ultraviolet absorbers. Therefore, photocatalysts absorbing in the visible spectral region are essential for transferring the required energy and charges to make challenging chemical transformations possible. A selection of a photocatalyst for driving oxidative or reductive reactions is crucial and is commonly based on their electrochemical potentials as well as the potentials of the starting materials. This selection, however, sometimes proves limiting and misleading, especially when the thermodynamic driving forces of the charge-transfer steps are relatively small. Here, we show that porphyrinoids with differences in their electrochemical potentials exceeding 0.5 V can photocatalyze the same model reaction of N-alkyl-2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium salt with alkynyl p-tolylsulfone to form the same alkylated alkynyl product in similar yields. Our studies reveal that switching between parallel reaction pathways makes the attainment of these conversion efficiencies possible. Electron-rich catalysts drive the formation of alkyl radicals principally via a photoinduced electron transfer to the pyridinium ion and a sequential hole transfer recovers their ground states, i.e., PET-HT mechanism. Conversely, a photoinduced hole transfer dominates the initial formation of the reduced forms of electron-deficient porphyrins that then transfer electrons to the pyridinium salt to release the same alkyl radicals, i.e., PHT-ET mechanism. This discovery demonstrates a paradigm where reaction mechanism adjust to the electronic properties of catalysts and opens doors for transformative diversification and broadening of the applicability of photochemical transformations.<br /><br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Photochemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As a matter of fact, the immobilization capability of the functionalized surface is one of the limiting factors for the final yield of the binding reaction. In this work, we locally deposited many reactive polymers on a single solid support, allowing for a direct comparison of functionality of probes immobilized on different polymers and demonstrating a new way of multiplexing. Our goal was to investigate the immobilization efficiency of reactive polymers, as well as the resulting affinity of the molecular probes, in a single experiment. This idea was demonstrated by spotting a large number of different reactive polymers on an untreated Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> chip, and depositing the same molecular probe on all the spots immediately after. This method proved to be efficient and could be used as an initial qualitative assay to decide which functionalization better suits a certain application. We also showed that the localized functionalization method is applicable to proteins as well as oligonucleotides. Moreover, by means of real-time binding measurements performed with the Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor (IRIS), we demonstrated that this functionalization technique is comparable to the uniformity of classical flat-coating solution. The comparison between the binding curves that were obtained from different polymer spots with the same probe allowed us to decide which polymers would work better to immobilize a model protein, \u03b1-Lactalbumin, as well as a peptide extracted from the latter, namely LAC-1. The final outcome is promising, and it highlights the multiplexing power of this method: first, it allows to characterize dozens of polymers at once, within a single 60-minutes experiment. Secondly, it removes the limitation, related to coated surfaces, that only molecules with the same functional groups can be tethered to the same solid support.

Here we report the synthesis and application of atomically precise inorganic cluster nanomolecules consisting of an inorganic core and a covalently linked densely packed layer of saccharides. These hybrid agents are stable under biologically relevant conditions and exhibit multivalent binding capabilities, which enable us to study the complex interactions between glycosylated structures and a dendritic cell lectin receptor.

The suitability\nof this LSPR for some applications depends on its capacity to concentrate light\nin small regions of space, known as near-field hot spots. This efficiency to\ncreate near-field hot spots can be judged through an LSPR figure-of-merit such\nas Quality factor, defined as the ratio of LSPR peak energy to its linewidth. The\nfree electron density determines the LSPR peak energy while the extent of electron\nscattering controls the LSPR linewidth and hence these factors together essentially\ndictate the value of the Quality factor. An unfortunate tradeoff arises\nwhen dopants are introduced since the aliovalent\ndopants generating the free electrons (increasing LSPR energy) also act\nas centers of scattering of electrons (increasing LSPR linewidth), thereby\ndecreasing the LSPR Quality factor. Dopant selection is hence of paramount\nimportance to achieve a high value of LSPR Quality factor.

In our recent work  [Chem. Mater., 30, 4361 (2018)], we demonstrated our latest developments in organic CSPs by  screening a set of 28 pyrrole azaphenacene isomers which led to one new molecule with higher thermodynamic stability and carrier mobilities in its crystalline form, compared to the one reported experimentally. Hereby, using the lattice energy landscapes for pyrrole azaphenacenes as examples, we applied machine-learning techniques to statistically reveal in more details, on how molecular symmetry and Z' values translate to the crystal packing landscapes, which in terms affect the coverage of landscape through quasi-random crystal structure samplings. A recurring theme in crystal engineering is to identify the probabilities of targeting isostructures to a specific reference crystal upon chemical functionalisations. For this, we propose here a global similarity index in conjunction with the Energy-Density Isostructurality (EDI) map to analyse the lattice energy landscapes for halogen substituted pyrrole azaphenacenes. A continue effort in the field is to accelerate CSPs for sampling a much wider chemical space for high-throughput material screenings, we propose a potential solution to this challenge drawn upon this study.

This is often associated to the decrease of water's dielectric constant at high temperatures, apparently allowing water to behave like an organic solvent. The decrease of the solubility at high pressures, in turn, is explained by a mild increase of the dielectric constant of water. Nevertheless, the relationship between the dielectric constant of water, hydration, and the solubility of polar and non-polar molecules in SBCW, remains poorly understood. Here, we study through molecular dynamics, the hydration thermodynamic parameters and the solubility of non-polar and polar aromatic model systems, for which a solubility increase in SBCW is observed. We show that the temperature dependence of the hydration free energy of the model non-polar solutes is nonmonotonic, exhibiting a solute size independent maximum at ~475 K, above which hydration becomes entropically favorable and enthalpically unfavorable. The monotonic increase of the solubility, separated here in hydration and vaporization or sublimation components of the pure liquid or solid solute, respectively, is, in turn, related to the temperature increase of the latter, and only to a minor extent with the decrease of the hydration free energy above ~475 K, via the hydration entropy. A solubility increase or decrease is also found at high pressures for different solutes, explained by the relative magnitude of the hydration and the vaporization or sublimation components of the solubility. For the model solid polar system studied, the hydration free energy increases monotonically with the temperature, instead, and the solubility increase is caused by the decrease of the sublimation component of the solubility. Thus, despite of the observed increase of the hydration free energy with pressure, related to the entropic component decrease, our results indicate that the dielectric constant plays no significant role on the solubility increase of non-polar and polar solutes in SBCW, opposite to the dielectric constant picture. The structure of water next to the solutes is also investigated and a structural enhancement at room temperature is observed, resulting in significantly stronger pair interactions between a water molecule and its third and fourth nearest water neighbors. This structural and energetic enhancement nearly vanishes, however, at high temperatures, contributing to a positive hydration entropy. <br />", "date": "2019-07-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical and Chemical Processes; Physical and Chemical Properties; Solution Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that susceptibility to hydrolysis varies significantly with the vector for water attacks on silicon backbone atoms, which matches strain-induced anisotropic changes in the backbone electronic structure. Efficient semiempirical density functional tight binding (DFTB) calculations are shown to reproduce DFT predictions for select reaction pathways and facilitate more exhaustive explorations of configuration space.

Specifically, through constructing spin-adiabatic states from a two-state Hamiltonian (with spin-orbit coupling matrix elements) at each geometry, one can readily employ advanced geometry optimization algorithms to acquire a \u201ctransition state\" structure, where the spin crossing occurs. In this work, we report the implementation of a fully variational spin-adiabatic approach based on Kohn-Sham density functional theory spin states (sharing the same set of molecular orbitals) and the Breit-Pauli one-electron spin-orbit operator. For three model spin-crossing reactions [predissociation of N2O, singlet-triplet conversion in CH2, and CO association to Fe(CO)4], the spin-crossing points were easily obtained. Our results also indicated the Breit-Pauli one-electron spin-orbit coupling can vary significantly along the reaction pathway on the spin-adiabatic energy surface. On the other hand, due to the restriction that low-spin and high-spin states share the same set of molecular orbitals, the acquired spin-adiabatic energy surface shows a cusp (i.e. a first-order discontinuity) at the crossing point, which prevents the use of standard geometry optimization algorithms to pinpoint the crossing point. An extension with this restriction removed is being developed to achieve the smoothness of spin-adiabatic surfaces.", "date": "2019-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In contrast to other catalysts that affect \u03b1-C-H oxidations of tertiary amines, the system under investigation employs exclusively peroxy esters as oxidants. More common oxidants (e.g. tBuOOH) previously reported to affect amine oxidations via free radical pathways do not provide amine \u03b1-C-H oxidation products in combination with the herein described catalyst system. Motivated by this difference in reactivity to more common free radical systems, the investigations described herein employ initial rate kinetics, kinetic profiling, Eyring studies, kinetic isotope effect studies, Hammett studies, ligand coordination studies, and EPR studies to shed light on the Fe catalyst system. The obtained data suggest that the catalytic mechanism proceeds through C-H abstraction at a coordinated substrate molecule. This rate-determining step occurs either at an Fe(IV) oxo pathway or a 2-electron pathway at a Fe(II) intermediate with bound oxidant. We further show via kinetic profiling and EPR studies that catalyst activation follows a radical pathway, which is initiated by hydrolysis of PhCO3 tBu to tBuOOH in the reaction mixture.

Here, several semi-empirical and density-functional theory (DFT) methods are assessed for their ability to describe the potential energy surface and reaction energies of the covalent modification of a thiol by an electrophile. Functionals such as PBE and B3LYP fail to predict a stable enolate intermediate. This is largely due to delocalization error, which spuriously stabilizes the pre-reaction complex, in which excess electron density is transferred from the thiolate to the electrophile. Functionals with a high-exact exchange component, range-separated DFT functionals, and variationally-optimized exact exchange (i.e., the LC-B05minV functional) correct this issue to various degrees. The large gradient behaviour of the exchange enhancement factor is also found to significantly affect the results, leading to the improved performance of PBE0.

They limit flow-rates achievable for a given pressure drop, and are plagued by fouling. Approaches to reduce the wall interactions include hydrophobic coatings, liquid-infused porous surfaces, nanoparticle surfactant jamming, changing the surface electronic structure, electrowetting, surface tension pinning, and atomically flat channels. A better solution may be to avoid the solid walls altogether. Droplet microfluidics or sheath flow achieves this, but require continuous flow of both the liquid transported and the outer carrier liquid.  Here we demonstrate a new approach, where wall-less aqueous liquid channels are surrounded by an immiscible magnetic liquid, both being stabilised by a quadrupolar magnetic field. This creates self-healing, uncloggable, anti-fouling, and near-frictionless liquid-in-liquid fluidic channels with millimetre effective slip lengths. Pumping is achieved by moving permanent magnets that have no physical contact with the liquid channel. We show that this magnetostaltic pumping method can be used to transport whole human blood with very little damage due to shear forces; haemolysis is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to traditional peristaltic pumping.

We first mathematically formulate the MOF-based sensor array problem under dilute conditions.

If not, they must be optimized by minimizing the error ReaxFF makes on a relevant training set. Because this optimization is far from trivial, many methods, in particular genetic algorithms (GAs), have been developed to search for the global optimum in parameter space. Recently, two alternative parameter calibration techniques were proposed, i.e. Monte-Carlo Force Field optimizer (MCFF) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES). In this work, CMA-ES, MCFF and a GA method (OGOLEM) are systematically compared using three training sets from the literature. GA shows the smallest risk of getting trapped into a local minimum, whereas CMA-ES is capable of reaching the lowest errors for two third of the cases. For each method, we provide reasonable default settings and our analysis offers useful guidelines for their usage in future work. An important side effect impairing the parameter optimization is numerical noise. A detailed analysis reveals that it can be reduced, e.g. by using exclusively unambiguous geometry optimizations in the training set. Even without this noise, many distinct near-optimal parameter vectors can be found, which opens new avenues for improving the training set and detecting overfitting artifacts.<br />", "date": "2019-07-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The most common continuous-flow separation approach is liquid-liquid extraction based on differential distribution of molecules between organic and aqueous phases. This approach has limited selectivity; it can hardly separate different hydrophobic organic molecules from each other. Continuous-flow electrophoresis can facilitate much more selective separation in a single phase, but it is currently limited to aqueous electrolytes which are incompatible with many hydrophobic organic molecules. Further, water electrolysis in aqueous electrolytes results in generation of large volumes of gas making steady-state operation a major technical challenge. Here, we introduce non-aqueous continuous-flow electrophoresis (NACFE) in which the electrolyte is a solution of an organic salt in an aprotic organic solvent. We demonstrate that NACFE can maintain stable separation of multiple species during 10 hours. The non-aqueous nature of NACFE and its ability to support steady-state operation make it suitable for its incorporation into continuous-flow organic synthesis.</div>", "date": "2019-07-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Process Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Analytical Apparatus; Chemoinformatics; Electrochemical Analysis; Imaging; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors, and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial datasets spanning a wide variety of chemical endpoints. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary datasets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.", "date": "2019-07-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Bootsma; Steven Wheeler", "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing (bio-)organic and organometallic systems and proved remarkably accurate in computing the small free energy differences that underpin many chemical phenomena (e.g. regio- and stereoselective reactions). We show that the lack of rotational invariance of popular DFT integration grids reveals large uncertainties in computed free energies for some isomerizations, torsional barriers, and regio- and stereoselective reactions.  The result is that predictions based on DFT-computed free energies for systems with very low-frequency vibrational modes can change qualitatively depending on molecular orientation.  For example, for a metal-free propargylation of benzaldehyde, predicted enantioselectivities based on B97-D/def2-TZVP free energies using a popular pruned (75,302) integration grid can vary from 62:38 to 99:1 by simply rotating the transition state structures. Relative free energies for the regiocontrolling transition state structures for an Ir-catalyzed C\u2013H functionalization reaction computed using M06/6-31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ and the same grid can vary by more than 5 kcal/mol, resulting in predicted regioselectivities that range anywhere from 14:86 to >99:1. Errors of these magnitudes occur for different functionals and basis sets, are potentially widespread among modern applications of DFT, and can be reduced by using much denser integration grids than commonly employed.<br />", "date": "2019-07-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Homogeneous Catalysis; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Canongia Lopes; Margarida Costa Gomes; Agilio Padua", "abstract": "A general, transferable polarisable force field for molecular simulation of ionic liquids and their mixtures with molecular compounds is developed.  This polarisable model is derived from the widely used CL\\&P fixed-charge force field that describes most families of ionic liquids, in a form compatible with OPLS-AA, one of the major force fields for organic compounds. Models for ionic liquids with fixed, integer ionic charges lead to pathologically slow dynamics, a problem that is corrected when polarisation effects are included explicitly. In the model proposed here, Drude induced dipoles are used with parameters determined from atomic polarisabilities. The CL\\&P force field is modified upon inclusion of the Drude dipoles, to avoid double-counting of polarisation effects. This modification is based on first-principles calculations of the dispersion and induction contributions to the van der Waals interactions, using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) for a set of dimers composed of positive, negative and neutral fragments representative of a wide variety of ionic liquids. The fragment approach provides transferability, allowing the representation of a multitude of cation and anion families, including different functional groups, without need to re-parametrise. Because SAPT calculations are expensive an alternative predictive scheme was devised, requiring only molecular properties with a clear physical meaning, namely dipole moments and atomic polarisabilities. The new polarisable force field, CL\\&Pol, describes a broad set set of ionic liquids and their mixtures with molecular compounds, and is validated by comparisons with experimental data on density, ion diffusion coefficients and viscosity. The approaches proposed here can also be applied to the conversion of other fixed-charged force fields into polarisable versions.<br />", "date": "2019-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

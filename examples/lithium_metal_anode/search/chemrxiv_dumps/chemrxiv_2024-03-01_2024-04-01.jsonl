However, the diversity and heterogeneity of chemical composition of agave species may pose challenges. This study investigates the impact of species heterogeneity on the pyrolysis of three different agave species (Agave sisalana, Agave tequilana, and Agave wercklei), aiming to correlate pyrolysis and biomass properties. Solid characterization and Py-GC/MS were used to understand agave physicochemical characteristics and organic group distribution in volatiles, respectively.A multi-step model and advanced numerical methods were employed for the kinetic study. The physicochemical characteristics showed similar values but a distinct distribution of inorganic compounds, predominantly composed of alkaline metals (6-11%w.b.), potentially influencing the organic groups\u2019 distribution in the volatiles. High relative areas of aliphatic components (13-28% at 773K and 16-36% at 873K) and low quantity of acidic groups (<2%) could be attributed to the catalytic deoxygenation promoted by alkaline metals. These findings are significant for future application of agave in bio-oil production by pyrolysis, as commercial biomasses often yield a high content of oxygenated and acid groups. For the kinetic study, six decomposition profiles were identified in the pyrolysis, encompassing the decomposition of extractives, saponins, lignocellulose, and oxalate salts. The similarity in profiles resulted in approximately equivalent kinetic parameter values and mechanisms among the species. The average values of Ea ranged from 71-324 kJ mol-1, k0 values varied between 107-1022, and the reaction mechanisms included n-order and Avrami-Erofeyev types. The validity of the parameters was verified through curve reconstruction. The inorganic composition was chosen as the parameter related to pyrolysis characteristics, as it was the only parameter that differed significantly among the species. Based on the data, normalization and the proposed model demonstrated satisfactory values of R\u00b2 (>0.9251), QOF (>94%), and MSE (<2.73\u00d710-3).

The thermal treatments impact not only the mechanics of the degummed fibroin fibers but also the structural configuration of the re-solubilized protein, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting silk-based materials. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a non-thermal surface treatment that removes the sericin gum layer while preserving the molecular structure of the fibroin protein, and con-sequently, maintaining the hierarchical integrity of the exposed fibroin microfiber.

LolO hydroxylates C2 of 1-exo-acetamidopyrrolizidine before coupling the C2-bonded oxygen to C7 to form the tricyclic (nor)loline core. Each reaction requires abstraction of hydrogen (H\u2022) from carbon by an oxoiron(IV) (ferryl) intermediate, but different sites are targeted, and the carbon radicals have different fates. There have been prior indications that the disposition of the substrate and the intermediate in the active site controls the site of H\u2022 abstraction and can impact the fate of the radical in related enzymes. These indications led us to determine whether active-site reconfiguration in the second LolO-catalyzed reaction might contribute to the observed change in the outcome. Whereas the single ferryl complex in the C2 hydroxylation reaction was previously shown to have typical M\u00f6ssbauer parameters, the second of two ferryl complexes to accumulate during the oxacyclization step has an isomer shift greater than that of any such complex characterized to date in an Fe/2OG enzyme. Moreover, it abstracts H\u2022 from C7 ~20 times faster than does the first ferryl complex in its previously reported off-pathway hydroxylation of C7. The detectable hydroxylation of C7 in competition with cyclization by the second ferryl complex is not enhanced in 2H2O solvent, suggesting that the C2 hydroxyl is deprotonated prior to C7\u2013H cleavage. These observations are consistent with coordination of the C2 oxygen to the second ferryl complex, which may reorient its oxo ligand, the substrate, or both to positions more favorable for C7\u2013H cleavage and cyclization.", "date": "2024-03-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This bias can be mitigated by incorporating a separation step prior to characterization. For this reason, asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) with on-line multiangle light scattering (MALS) has become an important platform for determining particle size. AF4-MALS has been used to report particle concentration, particularly for complex biological particles, yet the impact of light scattering models and particle refractive indices (RI) have not been quantitatively assessed. Here, we develop an analysis workflow using AF4-MALS to simultaneously separate and determine particles sizes and concentrations. The impacts of the MALS particle counting model used to process data and the chosen RI value(s) on particle counts are systematically assessed for polystyrene latex (PSL) particles and bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in the 20-500 nm size range. Across spherical models, PSL and OMV particle counts varied up to 13% or 200%, respectively. For the coated-sphere model used in the analysis of OMV samples, the sphere RI value greatly impacts particle counts. As the sphere RI value approaches the RI of the suspending medium, the model becomes increasingly sensitive to the light scattering signal-to-noise ultimately causing erroneous particle counts. Overall, this work establishes the importance of selecting appropriate MALS models and RI values for bioparticles to obtain accurate counts and provides an AF4-MALS method to separate, enumerate, and size polydisperse bioparticles.", "date": "2024-03-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Mechanistic studies reveal that under operation, the precursor materials are converted to \u03b3-CoOOH nanofibers and Co2O3 nanoparticles, both well-known prototype OER catalysts. The report demonstrates that the presence of crystalline mix metal sulfide precursors is critical for the simultaneous in-situ formation of the active catalysts, highlighting that use of these earth-abundant minerals might offer an economically and chemically viable route for scalable catalyst development.", "date": "2024-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Electrocatalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study introduces a specialized set of charge and Lennard-Jones parameters tailored for electrostatically embedded QM/MM calculations, aiming to accurately model both adsorption processes and catalytic reactions in zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs). To validate our approach, we compare adsorption energies derived from QM/MM simulations against experimental results and Monte Carlo simulation outcomes. The developed parameters showcase the ability of QM/MM simulations to represent long-range electrostatic and van der Waals interactions faithfully. This capability is evidenced by the prediction of adsorption energies with a low root mean square error of 1.1 kcal/mol across a wide range of adsorbates. The practical applicability of our QM/MM model is further illustrated through the study of glucose isomerization and epimerization reactions catalyzed by two structurally distinct Zr-MOF catalysts, UiO-66 and MOF-808. Our QM/MM calculations closely align with experimental activation energies. Importantly, the parameter set introduced here is shown to be compatible with the widely used universal force field (UFF). Moreover, we thoroughly explore how the size of the cluster model and the choice of density functional theory (DFT) methodologies influence the simulation outcomes.

We assess the performance of both elastic models, namely for Gaussian and Langevin chains, comparing against coarse-grained bead-spring simulations of ionic microgels with explicit electrostatic interactions. We examine the applicability scope of the models under variation of parameters such as ionization degree, microgel concentration and salt concentration.

Recent literature studies demonstrated a possible pathway for a continuous flow synthesis of paracetamol from \u03b2-pinene. While this process is currently not of commercial interest, the available literature synthesis demonstrates the technical feasibility of such chemical conversion as well as several new chemical transformations. However, the environmental efficiency of the proposed flow synthesis was not determined. Here, we perform a life cycle assessment to quantify the environmental impacts of a potential industrial-scale paracetamol manufacture from bio-waste \u03b2-pinene. For this purpose, scaled-up process models of continuous paracetamol manufacture were developed in Aspen Plus and a complete life cycle inventory was estimated. A GWP of 58 kg CO2-eq./kg product was predicted, and key impact contributing aspects of the designed process were identified through a hotspot analysis. A comparative feedstock analysis showed that \u03b2-pinene derived from Kraft pulping waste can be a cleaner feedstock than the benchmark feedstock benzene. The obtained LCA results represent highly conservative estimates, given the early design stage, and thus promise to surpass standard industry practises, once optimised.

Although the well-known Br\u00f8nsted-Evans-Polyani (BEP) scaling \u2013 a one-dimensional linear regression model \u2013 has been widely applied in such microkinetic models, they still rely on calculated reaction energies and may not generalize beyond a single facet on a single class of materials, e.g., a terrace sites on transition metals.

Using a combination of (electro)analytical techniques, encapsulated RuOx anodes are shown to effectively suppress Cl- transport to buried catalyst active sites while allowing for the desired OER to occur, leading to increases in OER faradaic efficiency at moderate overpotentials. Evidence for the ability of SiOx overlayers to block Cl- ions from reaching the active buried interface was obtained by monitoring the OH stretching mode of OH adsorbates using in situ Raman spectroscopy.  This study also reports trade-offs between the activity, selectivity, and stability of bare and encapsulated Ru and RuOx electrocatalysts, finding that the magnitude of these trade-offs strongly depends on the nature of both the catalyst and overlayer material.

Although earlier studies have shown high removal of plastic contaminants during coagulation, flocculation and settling, a limited number of experiments have examined the removal of nanoplastics in relevant water chemistries including higher pH values and in the presence of organics. In this study, the removal of nanoplastics and microfibers is assessed using conventional (alum) and alternative coagulants including aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) and cationic polyamines (pDADMAC) in a synthetic wastewater matrix for pH conditions between 7 and 8.6. Our results show that plastic removal is considerably reduced at higher pH values when alum is used as a coagulant. At the shorter settling time of 30 s, removal of pristine and aged nanoplastics declined from 64 \u00b1 3% and 76 \u00b1 3% respectively (pH 7) to less than 20% at pH values higher than 7.8.  Similarly, polyester microfiber removal was observed to decline from 97 \u00b1 1% at pH 7 to 85 \u00b1 3% at pH 8.6 for samples collected after 3 min of settling. Replacing alum with polynuclear aluminum coagulants resulted in greater plastic contaminant removal at pH values above 8 with a maximum observed microfiber removal of 95 \u00b1 1% (ACH; pH 8.6; 3 min settling time) and a maximum observed nanoplastic removal of 71 \u00b1 5% (ACH+pDADMAC; pH 8.2; 30 s settling time). Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) measurements revealed that ACH coagulant species results in a thicker deposition layer on negatively charged surfaces compared to alum. The addition of pDADMAC to ACH led to a more favorable interaction with a model negatively charged surface, indicated by a faster and more rigid deposition of the alternative coagulant. Taken together, these results show that environmental conditions, including water pH and interactions with wastewater colloids, affect plastic contaminant removal during primary wastewater treatment. Alternative coagulants, particularly ones that contain stable cationic species, offer municipalities improved removal of plastic contaminants under these challenging treatment conditions.

Further, we observe that these defects lead to a localization of the molecular orbitals (MOs) involved in the band-edge excitons  creating large electric dipoles in  the MOs. In the excitonic states, these  dipoles cause multiexponential PL decay from the band-edge states with a highly anisotropic polarization of the emission.

Boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann liquid flow simulation, however, are much beyond from ideal and how to precisely determine the boundary conditions for liquid flow with slip remains a challenge. In this study, we integrate the slip boundary condition for fluid flow for Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian fluid. Our primary emphasis is to comprehend the influence of slip effects on the flow characteristics of real shear-thickening fluid (STF), encompassing Newtonian, shear-thinning, and shear-thickening behaviors under varying applied stresses or strain rates. In order to achieve this, we have introduced the combination of modified bounce back and specular reflection (MBSR) scheme and half way bounce back and specular reflection (HBSR) scheme. In theory, the interactions between the parameters of the combination and the slip length are explicitly deduced. The specified combination parameter is decided by the slip length given and the relaxation time. These slip boundary conditions are analyzed for their distinct results. Our process has been tested for accuracy and reliability for Newtonian flow as well as non-Newtonian flow and the results are compared with the analytical solution. We also develop a theoretical model to elucidate the flow characteristics of real shear-thickening fluid (STF) in a channel with slip effects. Investigating pressure and channel height variations, we observe nuanced responses. Initially, under increasing pressure, the regime with Newtonian flow rate $Q1$ dominates, reaching a peak. As pressure rises yielding dominance to another regime with shear-thinning flow rate $Q2$, while regime with shear-thickening flow rate $Q3$ remains zero. Further pressure escalation prompts a monotonically increasing trend in $Q3$, achieving dominance. Simultaneously, $Q1$ and $Q2$ approach zero. These trends hold true with and without slip effects, with higher flow rates in the presence of slips for a given pressure drop and viscosity. Additionally, as channel height increases, $Q1$ predominates at lower heights, transitioning to dominance by $Q2$ and then $Q3$ at larger heights.", "date": "2024-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

In this work, we introduce QSPRpred, a toolkit for analysis of bioactivity data sets and QSPR modelling, which attempts to address the aforementioned challenges. QSPRpred's modular Python API enables users to intuitively describe different parts of a modelling workflow using a plethora of pre-implemented components, but also integrate customized implementations in a \"plug-and-play\" manner. QSPRpred data sets and models are directly serializable, which means they can be readily reproduced and put into operation after training as the models are saved with all required data pre-processing steps to make predictions on new compounds directly from SMILES strings. The general-purpose character of QSPRpred is also demonstrated by inclusion of support for multi-task and proteochemometric modelling. The package is extensively documented and comes with a large collection of tutorials to help new users. In this paper, we describe all of QSPRpred's functionalities and also conduct a small benchmarking case study to illustrate how different components can be leveraged to compare a diverse set of models. QSPRpred is fully open-source and available at https://github.com/CDDLeiden/QSPRpred.\n\nScientific Contribution\nQSPRpred aims to provide a complex, but comprehensive Python API to conduct all tasks encountered in QSPR modelling from data preparation and analysis to model creation and model deployment.

We assessed their anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines like MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and PC-3.

Among these derivatives, the silicon-tethered compound B-4a demonstrated the highest potency against breast cancer cells. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that B-4a effectively modulates cell cycle regulatory kinases (cdk-2 and cdk-4) and their associated cyclins (cyclin B1, cyclin D1), inducing apoptosis.\nAdditionally, B-4a displayed a noteworthy impact on tubulin polymerization, distinct from the parent colchicine, and significantly disrupted the vimentin cytoskeleton, contributing to G1 arrest in breast cancer cells. Moreover, B-4a exhibited substantial anti-metastatic properties by inhibiting breast cancer cell migration and invasion.

A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that uses solid polymer electrolytes is a critical technology for enhancing the energy efficiency for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) because a thin electrolyte layer can effectively reduce the ohmic resistance. The stable operation of the CO2RR in MEA-based cells with an anion-exchange membrane (AEM), however, is hindered by the accumulation of bicarbonate salts, which are derived from alkali-metal cations in anolytes, on the cathode side. Therefore, for stable operation of CO2 electrolysis using an MEA-based cell, the amount of alkali-metal cations needs to be reduced. However, the minimal amount of alkali-metal cations required to operate the reaction system has not been elucidated. Quantitative analysis of the amount of alkali-metal cations transported from the anode to the cathode is essential to obtain the insight into the necessary amount for the operation. In this study, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the correlation between the production of high-value C2+ compounds, such as ethylene and ethanol, and the transported alkali-metal cations. As a result, although the presence of transported alkali-metal cations on the cathode surface significantly contributes to the generation of C2+ compounds, the rate of K+ ion transport did not match the selectivity of C2+. This result suggests a continuous supply of high amount of K+ to the cathode surface is not required for C2+ formation. On the basis of these findings, we achieved a faradaic efficiency (FE) and a partial current density for C2+ of 77% and 230 mA cm\u22122, respectively, even after switching the anode solution from 0.1 M KHCO3 to a dilute K+ solution (<7 mM) in an MEA-based cell using AEM and Cu nanoparticles as the cathode catalyst. These values of FE and partial current density were almost identical to those when 0.1 M KHCO3 was continuously supplied as the anode solution. Based on this insight, we successfully improved the durability of the system against salt precipitation. The FE for ethylene remained constant for as long as 60 h at 150 mA cm\u22122 when continuously flowing 0.1 M KHCO3 as anolyte. However, the FE suddenly decreased after 60 h due to the cessation of CO2 gas flow, caused by salt precipitation in the cathode flow channel. On the contrary, by intermittently supplying 0.1 M KHCO3, we confirmed that the amount of visible K+ salt in the cathode flow field remained negligible even after more than 90 hours of stable operation.", "date": "2024-03-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Fuels - Energy Science; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For a textile recycling purpose, it is necessary to find ways to safely remove them from the fibres. Among other alternative solvents, ionic liquids showed solvation properties that are promising for recycling textile waste.

Understanding the nanostructured domains and their dependence on the applied thermal annealing conditions is one crucial challenge. Here, the conjugated small-molecule donor p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is used as a model system to demonstrate how isothermal annealing alone, without addition of any processable additives during solution casting, leads to a high ordering of domain structures.  Using scanning transmission X-ray microspectroscopy (STXM), the domain structures are probed at the resonance energy of 284.7 eV corresponding to the C1s to Pi* transition. The STXM data analysis reveals the in-plane orientation of the conjugated backbone comprising the heterocyclic aromatic compounds dithienosilole (DTS), bithiophene (BT), and fluorobenzothiadiazole (FBT). The analysis further exhibits the presence of ordered domains accompanied by the disordered boundaries in thin films where the increase in the domain sizes and the high degree of molecular order (anisotropy) is associated to the relatively slow crystallization dynamics of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules during isothermal annealing at 90 \u00b0C.  The analysis of the out-of-plane component of the directed resonance intensity shows deviations in the local out-of-plane tilt angles to the lower values, for the most ordered regions in the thin film, suggesting the more out-of-plane orientation of Pi* resonance.

The equipment necessary to detect fentanyl in field settings (e.g., handheld spectrometers) is restricted to highly trained, well-funded, and specialized personnel. Established point-of-need technologies, such as lateral flow immunochromatographic strips, are available; however, they often involve multiple contact-based steps (e.g., collection, mixing) that pose a higher risk to users handling unknown substances. Herein, we developed a colorimetric displacement assay capable of contactless detection of fentanyl as liquid or solid samples. The basis of our assay relies on the presence of fentanyl to displace a redox mediator, ferrocene carboxylic acid, inclusively bound in the cavity of a supramolecular host, CB[7]. The displacement is only possible in the presence of high affinity binding guests, like fentanyl (KA  ~ 106 M-1). The liberated redox guest can then react with indicator reagents that are free in solution, producing either: (i) a distinct blue color to indicate the presence of fentanyl or (ii) remain a pale blue tint in the absence of fentanyl. We demonstrate rapid and specific detection of fentanyl free base and fentanyl derivatives (e.g., acetyl fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl) against a panel of 9 other common drugs of abuse (e.g., morphine, cocaine, heroin). Furthermore, we highlight the intended use of this assay by testing grains of fentanyl derivatives on a surface with a drop (i.e., 25 \u00b5L) of assay reagent.

While inert imido ligands exhibit skew values (k) close to 1, highly reactive imido moieties display significantly lower skew values (k << 1) as found in metallocene or bis-imido complexes.

Pro and Hyp at the respective Xaa and Yaa positions provides maximum triple helical stability.  Previously, we reported that peptoid residues also known as N-substituted Glycines (N-Glys) in the Xaa position generate hyperstable collagen triple helices. Here, we demonstrate that N-Glys at the Yaa position also stabilize the triple helix, with the position (Xaa or Yaa) and side chain structure of N-Gly profoundly affecting the triple helix stability. CD spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography indicated that N-Glys at the Yaa position were more conducive to triple helical folding than amino acids, although they were unable to access the most favorable phi-psi angles for the triple helix represented by Hyp. Metadynamics simulations showed a more diffused conformational space for N-Glys at the Yaa position than at the Xaa position due to minimal steric crowding from neighboring Gly. Only the S-isomers of chiral N-C(alpha) branched N-Glys were compatible with triple helical folding, with differences in backbone conformation and accessible rotamers between Xaa and Yaa positions.

While molecular force fields are parameterized to accurately model a protein's potential energy surface, it remains challenging in practice to evaluate how well force fields can capture ensemble-averaged experimental observables, since it requires simulation of the complete folding landscape.  In this work, we employ massively parallel molecular simulations, performed using the Folding@home distributed computing platform, to investigate the ability of nine force fields (AMBER14SB, AMBER99, AMBER99SB, AMBER99SB-ildn, AMBER99SBnmr1-ildn, CHARMM22*, CHARMM27, CHARMM36 and OPLS-aa) with TIP3P explicit solvent to accurately reproduce experimental observables for chignolin, a beta-hairpin mini-protein with an experimental folding time of ~600 ns.

Of these, the highly anisotropic q-1D vdW crystal structure and the visible-light optical/optoelectronic properties of antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) have led to its widespread consideration as a promising building block for photovoltaic and non-volatile phase change devices. However, while these applications will greatly benefit from well-defined and sub-nanometer-thick q-1D structures, little has been known about feasible synthetic routes that can access single covalent chains of Sb2S3. In this work, we explore how encapsulation in single or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs or MWCNTs) and visible-range transparent boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) influences the growth and phase of Sb2S3 nanostructures. We demonstrate that nanotubes with smaller diameters had a more pronounced effect in the crystallographic growth direction and orientation of Sb2S3 nanostructures, promoting the crystallization of the guest structures along the long-axis [010]-direction. As such, we were able to reliably access well-ordered few- to single covalent chains of Sb2S3 when synthesized within defect-free SWCNTs with sub-2 nm inner diameters. Intriguingly, we found that the degree of crystalline order of Sb2S3 nanostructures was strongly influenced by the presence of defects and discontinuities along the Sb2S3-nanotube interface. We show that amorphous nanowire domains of Sb2S3 form around defect sites in larger, multi-walled nanotubes that manifest inner wall defects and discontinuities, suggesting a means to manipulate the crystallization dynamics of confined sub-10 nm-thick Sb2S3 nanostructures within nanotubes. Lastly, we show that ultrathin, predominantly amorphous, Sb2S3 encapsulated within BNNTs can impart functionality onto the host nanotube, showing a ~30-fold increase in electrical conductivity and displayed photocurrent generation compared to empty BNNTs in pressed pellets. Altogether, our results serve to solidify the understanding of how q-1D vdW pnictogen chalcogenides crystallize within confined synthetic platforms and are a step towards realizing functional materials from ensembles of encapsulated heterostructures.", "date": "2024-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Doping ILs with alkali metal salts creates an electrolyte that is of interest for batteries, among others. These salt-in-ionic liquids (SiILs) are a class of super-concentrated, strongly correlated and asymmetric electrolytes. The transference number of the alkali metal cations has been found to be negative, owing to the small but highly negatively charged aggregates which form between alkali metal ions and the anions. Here, we investigate Na-based SiILs with a surface forces apparatus and by atomic force microscopy. We find evidence of confinement induced structural changes, giving rise to unprecedented long-range (non-exponentially decaying) interactions. This observation is supported by the soft structure revealed by the force curves, and supplemented by theory and simulations. The long-ranged interactions in SiILs are reminiscent of polymer-like interactions, suggesting analogous high aspect ratio aggregates at the mica interfaces, rather than a purely electrostatic origin.

Published scores approximate a general notion of CASP-based synthesizability with nearly unlimited building block resources. However, this approach is disconnected from the reality of small laboratory drug design, where building block resources are limited, making a notion of in-house synthesizability that uses already available resources highly desirable. In this work, we show a successful de novo drug design workflow generating active and in-house synthesizable ligands of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL). We demonstrate the successful transfer of CASP from 17.4 million commercial building blocks to a small laboratory setting of roughly 6,000 building blocks with only a decrease of -12% in CASP success. Moreover, we present a rapidly retrainable in-house synthesizability score, successfully capturing our in-house synthesizability without relying on external building block resources. We show that including our in-house synthesizability score in a multi-objective de novo drug design workflow, alongside a simple QSAR model, provides thousands of potentially active and easily in-house synthesizable molecules. Further, we highlight differences between general and in-house synthesizability scores and demonstrate potential problems with the out-of-distribution predictive performance of synthesizability scores on generated molecules.

This research focuses on the heat and mass transfer as well as the reaction mechanism within the Al@AP propellant through molecular modeling. The direct contact between the metal fuel and oxidizer leads to an immediate redox reaction at the corresponding interface, facilitating the diffusion of oxygen atoms from surrounding AP molecules into the Al particles. Heat is transferred from the Al particles to the surrounding oxidizer, instead of inward heat transfer from the AP-HTPB interface as observed in the conventional Al/AP composite. This novel assembly method significantly accelerates the reaction rate, more than doubling that of the conventional Al/AP composite. Moreover, two extreme pressure conditions (e.g., condensed phase vs. vacuum) are considered to examine the pressure effect on the combustion process of micro-unit composite fuel. The simulation results demonstrate that pressure has a negligible effect on the rapid combustion stage of burning Al particles, as it is primarily governed by the diffusion mechanism. Under vacuum conditions, the reaction products of propellants drive the burning Al in the gas flow, leading to the detachment of the metal fuel from the oxidizer. The reaction mechanism transitions to surface reactions on Al particle with gaseous products. In terms of agglomerations, the coalescence of two burning Al droplets is observed to form a larger product owing to the reduced distances within AP particle. The Al droplets are almost consumed before coalescence due to the rapid combustion, resulting in no negative impact on the Al combustion, as observed in conventional composites.

Silybin, a natural compound from Silybum marianum, is well-known as a hepatoprotective agent. This paper describes the synthesis of madecassic acid-silybin conjugate compounds and evaluation of their cytotoxic activity against a range of liver cancer cell lines. Depending on the reaction conditions, the direct conjugation products of 2,3,23-triacetylmadecassic acid and silybin were found to be either an ester at position 7 of silybin (40%) and its 2,3-dehydrated derivative (20%), a 2,3-dehydrated ester at position 3 of silybin (42%), or an ester at position 3 of silybin with madecassic acid. We have also used linkers such as glycine, \u03b2-alanine and 11-aminoundecanoic acid. For further diversification, 2,3,23-triacetylmadecassic acid was dehydrated to form the \u03945,6-compound, and was converted to amide derivatives on reaction with glycine or \u03b2-alanine, and finally condensed with silybin to afford esters at position 3 of silybin. In total, sixteen new conjugates have been synthesized. The conjugates were tested in vitro for their cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells using the MTT assay. Results confirmed the conjugated compounds demonstrated a stronger cytotoxic effect versus those of the parent compounds. Of these compounds, the most promising conjugate, compound 8, was evaluated for cytotoxic activity on the Hep3B, Huh7, and Huh7R liver cancer cell lines and also for induction of apoptosis. This compound caused a rapid and significant induction of caspase 3 activity in HepG2 cells and induced cell cycle arrest in S phase, effects distinct from the activity of madecassic acid. This is the first study on the synthesis and the cytotoxicity of the madecassic acid-silybin conjugates, and of their testing against liver cancer cell lines and provides evidence for a distinct biological profile versus madecassic acid alone.", "date": "2024-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Tellurium, a novel member of single-element 2D materials, is showing pioneering characteristics such as simplicity in chemistry, structure, and synthesis which make it highly suitable for various applications. This study presents the first memristor design based on nanoscaled elemental tellurium synthesized by vapor transport deposition (VTD) method at a temperature as low as 100 \u00b0C in full compliance with a back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. We demonstrate that the memristive behavior of nanoscaled tellurium can be enhanced by selecting gold as the substrate material which results in a lower set voltage and reduced energy consumption. In addition, the formation of conductive paths which in turn lead to resistive switching behavior on the gold substrate is proven to be driven by the gold-tellurium interface reconfiguration during the VTD process as revealed by energy electron loss spectroscopy analysis of the interface.

BC measurements obtained through this method were validated against a reference aethalometer in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, demonstrating a very strong agreement (R2 = 0.95 and slope = 0.97).

Target proteins and ubiquitin E3 ligase substrate receptors are tethered to mobile swivel arms of a Y-shaped DNA scaffold, which presents them in close proximity to PROTAC analytes flown across the sensor. PROTAC-induced ternary complex formation is measured by fluorescence energy transfer (FRET), while binary interactions are detected by fluorescence quenching. The assay is applied to cereblon (CRBN) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) as E3 ligase substrate receptors, a range of compounds including AT1, MZ1, dBETs, and ARV-825 as PROTACs, and the two bromodomains of Brd2, Brd3, Brd4, and BrdT proteins as targets. Automated workflows enable the measurement of 384 real-time sensorgrams in a single run using picomo-lar sample quantities. Ternary and binary binding kinetics and proximity-mediated binding enhancements are analyzed.

Employing both force field and ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories along with the inclusion of only certain solvent molecules in the excited state calculations, we determine that the methanol molecules axial to the chromophore are responsible for the majority of the inhomogeneous broadening, with a single methanol molecule that forms an axial hydrogen bond dominating the response.

This quantification gives access to the potential coupling, reorganization energy and curvature of the potential energy surfaces involved in electron transfer, independent of any prior assumptions about the system of interest. We showcase these claims with the Creutz\u2013Taube ion, a prototypical Class III mixed valence complex. We find that the symmetric dimension is responsible for the asymmetric band shape, and trace this back to the offset of the ground and excited state potentials in this dimension. The significance of the symmetric dimension originates from geometry dependent coupling, which in turn is a natural consequence of the well-established superexchange mechanism. The conceptual connection between the symmetric and antisymmetric motions and the superexchange mechanism appears as a general result for bridged systems.", "date": "2024-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In adaptation to the marine environment, cyanobacteria use metallophores to acquire trace metals when necessary as well as reduce potential toxicity from excessive metal concentrations. Leptochelins A-C were identified as structurally novel metallophores from three geographically dispersed cyanobacteria of the genus Leptothoe. The leptochelins are halogenated linear NRPS-PKS hybrid products with multiple heterocycles that have potential for hexadentate and tetradentate coordination with metal ions. The genomes of the three leptochelin producers were sequenced, and retrobiosynthetic analysis revealed one candidate biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) consistent with the structure of leptochelin. The putative BGC is highly homologous in all three Leptothoe strains, and all possess genetic signatures associated with metallophores. Post-column infusion of metals using an LC-MS metabolomics workflow performed with leptochelin A and B revealed promiscuous binding of iron, copper, cobalt, and zinc, but with greatest preference for copper. Iron depletion and copper toxicity experiments support the hypothesis that leptochelin metallophores may play a key ecological role in iron acquisition and in copper detoxification. In addition, the leptochelins possess significant cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines.", "date": "2024-03-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Natural Products; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Environmental biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Current methods to monitor the evolution of hydrogen in such photocatalytic systems such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, manometry or Raman spectroscopy are either expensive and low throughput or lack sensitivity and selectivity over other gasses. This impediment hinders the generation of photo-driven hydrogen evolution data necessary for machine learning and artificial intelligence-based protocols. This work presents an open-source approach for studying solar-driven hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) in parallel that uses colorimetric hydrogen detection films in tandem with an image analysis software capable of providing metrics such as hydrogen amount, hydrogen evolution rates, incubation times, and plateau times, and more.  The sensing medium is composed of 0.05 % (w/w) Pt impregnated molybdenum (VI) oxide or tungsten (VI) oxide which was incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol) films placed under clear, gas impermeable septa. To conduct experiments, users require only blue reaction-driving high intensity LEDs, a camera, and uniform lighting to take pictures as the septa darken. This work introduces a sample configuration in which nine samples in hydrogen sensitive septa-capped vials were illuminated and the gas evolution is monitored using a RaspberryPi for image capture and storage. Two calibration methods are presented, one uses a gravimetric hydrogen evolution with Zn/HCl that is compared to a direct hydrogen injection. Both methods allow the accurate correlation of normalized intensity values of film photographs to mole fractions of H2 ranging from 0 to 50%. Four light-driven HERs are described that highlight the capabilities of the detection method, two of which were conducted using the novel septa-based instrumentation while the other two experiments used the films on a 108 multiwell plate using a previously discussed photoreactor.

The X:R-Y bond covers at least four situations, meets the unique criterion of force combination, and possesses at least five characteristics.

The quasisolid (QS) phase only appears at temperatures between melting and ice nucleation, regardless of sample size, and this phase has a negative thermal expansivity (NTE). However, polarization or molecular undercoordination creates the supersolid phase in skins of water and ice, droplets, ionic hydration cells, and volumetric water with a current flow or under a 106 eV/cm electric bias.

To address this challenge, we have developed an economic model that accounts for sorbent degradation in DAC processes. By factoring in capacity loss over time, our model provides a more accurate estimate of the cost associated with DAC and highlights the optimum time for sorbent replacement. We then identified sorbent characteristics and process features that minimize both the carbon footprint and the cost of captured CO2. To further investigate the interplay of sorbent properties and DAC cost, we constructed a series of alkyl- and epoxy-functionalized polyamine sorbents. The sorbents\u2019 CO2 uptake, heat of adsorption and capacity fade were adjusted via a one-step modification, varying the proportions of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. We then integrated the experimentally-measured parameters, including the form of degradation, into our economic model to probe which combination of sorbent properties results in the lowest cost of DAC for a fixed operating condition. The results provide guidelines and priorities for sorbent performance metrics that will yield the most cost-effective DAC technologies.", "date": "2024-03-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, a design strategy is proposed to address both issues. Two MR-TADF emitters TPPO-tBu-DiKTa and TPA-tBu-DiKTa have been synthesized. Twisted ortho-substituted groups help increase the intermolecular distance and largely suppress the ACQ. In addition, the contributions from intermolecular charge transfer states in the case of TPA-tBu-DiKTa help to accelerate RISC.

Here, we investigate the interaction of Lewis bases with the tetrahalides (MX4 X = Cl, Br) and metal alkoxy halides (MXx(OR)4-x, x = 1-3, R = OiPr, OtBu). The tetrahalides yield the expected Lewis acid-base adducts MX4L2 (L = tetrahydrofuran or phosphine oxide). The mixed alkoxy halides react with Lewis bases in a more complex way. 31P NMR spectroscopy reveals that excess of phosphine oxide yields predominantly the complexation product, while a (sub)stoichiometric amount of phosphine oxide causes disproportionation of the MXx(OR)4-x species into MXx+1(OR)3-x and MXx-1(OR)5-x. The combination of complexation and disproportionation yields an atypical Job plot. In the case of zirconium isopropoxy chlorides, we fitted the concentration of all observed species and extracted thermodynamic descriptors from the Job plot. The complexation equilibrium constant decreases in the series: ZrCl3(OiPr) > ZrCl2(OiPr)2 >> ZrCl(OiPr)3, while the disproportionation equilibrium constant follows the opposite trend.

Surface roughening is one of the key surface phenomena to Cu activation, in which the surface forms numerous atomic vacancies and adatoms. However, the atomic structure of such surface motifs, in the presence of relevant adsorbates has remained elusive. Here, we explore the chemical space of Cu surface restructuring under coverage of CO and H in realistic electroreduction conditions, by a combination of grand canonical density functional theory and global optimization techniques, from which we construct a potential-dependent grand canonical ensemble representation of the surface. Significant vertical displacement of  surface Cu atoms is observed in the regime of intermediate and mixed CO and H coverage. This regime, while predicted to be thermodynamically inaccessible, is kinetically controlled, presenting a tough challenge for theory. To investigate the kinetic trapping effects, we develop a quasi-kinetic Monte Carlo simulation to track the evolution of the system during a simulated cathodic scan. The simulation reveals the path that the system takes across the coverage space and the metastable structures that the system evolves into along the way. Chemical bonding analysis is performed on the metastable structures with elevated Cu*CO species to understand its formation mechanism. By molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, the surface chemistry of the Cu*CO species is explored, and we identifies potential mechanisms via which the Cu*CO species may diffuse or dimerize.

Maximizing non-radiative deexcitation channels is crucial to improve the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPTAs.

Furthermore, photothermal therapy (PTT) generally relies on linear one-photon absorption of the light source by the OPTA, with less consideration given to non-linear two-photon absorption (2PA) strategies, despite their potential benefits. Here, a synergistic strategy, which combines intramolecular and intermolecular quenching, is employed to maximize the photothermal efficiency of diphenylamino substituted distyryl dicyanobenzene (DSB), an outstanding two-photon absorbing chromophore. One to three DSB units have been introduced on the conic p-tert-butyl-calix[4]arene (CX), serving as a preorganizing platform to allow aggregates formation and promote intramolecular quenching within the multichromophoric systems. Importantly, the multichromophoric molecules had very high two photon absorption capabilities with cross sections (2PA) reaching maximal values of 3290 GM at 810 nm.

While the formation of glucagon amyloid fibrils has been documented, their biological functions remain enigmatic. Recently, we demonstrated experimentally that glucagon amyloid fibrils can act as catalysts in several biological reactions, including esterolysis, lipid hydrolysis, and dephosphorylation. Herein we present a multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulation of the acylation step in the esterolysis of para-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA), catalyzed by native glucagon amyloid fibrils, serving as a model system to elucidate their catalytic function. This step entails a concerted mechanism, involving proton transfer from serine to histidine, followed by the nucleophilic attack of serine oxy anion on the carbonyl carbon of p-NPA. We computed the binding energy and free-energy profiles of this reaction using the PDLD/S-LRA-2000 and the empirical valence bond (EVB) methods. This included simulations if the reaction in an aqueous environment and in the fibril, enabling us to estimate the catalytic effect of the fibril. Our calculations obtained a barrier of 23.4 kcal\u2219mol\u20131 for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, compared to the experimental value of 21.9 kcal\u2219mol\u20131 (and a calculated catalytic effect of 3.2 kcal\u2219mol\u20131 compared to  the  observed effect of 4.7 kcal\u2219mol\u20131) This close agreement together with the barrier reduction when transitioning from the reference solution reaction to the amyloid fibrils provides supporting evidence to  the catalytic role of glucagon amyloid fibrils. Moreover, by employing the PDLD/S-LRA-2000 approach further reinforced exclusively the enzyme's catalytic role. The results presented in this study contribute significantly to our understanding of the catalytic role of glucagon amyloid fibrils, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first mechanistic investigation of fibrils using QM/MM methods.

The characterization results of different types of solids collected from the diluted bitumen froth indicate that kaolinite is the dominant clay mineral in the composition of NFT solids. There were differences in the mineralogy of the fine samples depending on the phase (carrier fluid) from which the samples were collected. FTIR analysis shows that the fines that remain in the diluted bitumen even after several hours of sample retention time are mainly kaolinite, though the presence of other minerals such as siderite is very likely. Moreover, the presence of organic functional groups on the surface of the particles is confirmed for all types of solids in the FTIR analysis, regardless of the washing and drying procedures employed. Inspection of the different layers of the diluted bitumen via micrography and measurement of the solids concentration shows higher fine content and smaller particles in the top layer, a dire situation for destabilizing the emulsion in the top layer, supported by the observation that the water droplets in this layer are tiny. Solid partitioning tests revealed the solid particles migrate to the interfacial region and the aqueous phase. The concentration of particles increased in the interfacial region with the presence of asphaltene in the oil phase (dominant effect) and the increased polarity of the oil. The wettability measurements show that without the coverage of solid particles with organics (asphaltene-resin molecules), the fine particles are extremely hydrophilic. The adsorption of asphaltene-resin matter on the fine particles increased the hydrophobicity of the fines, a situation that promotes the partitioning of the fine particles at the interfacial region and the stability of the droplets. It was observed that the contact angle increased with the decreasing polarity of the oil phase. In the interfacial tension measurements, the fine solids with minimal asphaltic matter coverage did not remain suspended in the oil phase and either sedimented rapidly or migrated to the air-oil interface, unlike the organics-covered solids which remained immersed in oil. No decrease in the interfacial tension was recorded for the water-oil systems in the presence of fine solids. Interfacial rheology measurements illustrate the viscoelastic behavior of the interfacial film at lower frequencies and higher fine particle concentrations. We conclude that if not for the interaction between the asphaltic matter and the fine particles, the emulsion stability by fine particles would have been very unlikely.

The modifications introduced are aimed to improve the robustness and computational scaling of the procedures. In particular, the subspace approach in S-GEK/RVO allows the application to SCF/KS-DFT optimization of a machine technique that has proved successful in geometry optimizations. The performance of the three methods is benchmarked for a large number of small to medium-sized organic molecules, at equilibrium structures and close to a transition state, and a second set of molecules containing closed- and open-shell transition metals. The results indicate the importance of the resetting technique in boosting the performance of the r-GDIIS procedure.

This is the first attempt to find an approximation to the multistate universal functional F[D(r)]. It is shown that F (i) does not explicitly depend on the number of electronic states and (ii) is an analytic matrix functional.  The Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-von Weizs\u00e4cker model and the correlation energy of the homogeneous electron gas are turned into matrix functionals guided by two principles: That each matrix functional should transform properly under basis set transformations, and that the ground state functional should be recovered for a single electronic state. Lieb-Oxford-like bounds on the average kinetic and electron repulsion energies in the subspace are given. When evaluated on the numerically exact matrix density of LiF, this simple approximation reproduces the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in the basis of the exact eigenstates accurately for all bond lengths. In particular the off-diagonal elements of the effective Hamiltonian that come from the interactions of different electronic states can be calculated with the same or better accuracy than the diagonal elements. Unsurprisingly, the largest error comes from the kinetic energy functional. More exact conditions that constrain the functional form of F are needed to go beyond the local density approximation.

In the past two decades, introducing a second metal element to form an alloy with Pt has been a common way to enhance the activity and stability of fuel cell cathode catalysts. However, elements such as Fe, Co and Ni suffer from dissolution under acidic conditions, which can seriously deactivate the catalysts at the cathode and poison the membrane. In this work, tin oxides-decorated Pt nanocatalysts (SnOx-Pt/C) are constructed by a two-step impregnation method and show much better stability owing to the chemical inertness of tin oxides in acidic media. The SnOx-Pt/C catalysts showed good performance in oxygen reduction reaction test, (specifically, < 30% loss in mass activity and < 20% in electrochemical activity area after 40,000 cycle scans from 0.6 to 1.2 V. On the one hand, the tin oxides on the Pt surface help to protect surface Pt atoms from oxidation and detachment; on the other hand, the tin oxides favor the adsorption of hydroxyl groups and, meanwhile, weaken the hydroxyl poison on Pt surface. More importantly, SnOx-Pt/C nanocatalysts achieve higher power density of fuel cells in comparison to Pt/C catalysts, and the Ostwald ripening of Pt nanoparticles is suppressed and the cycle life is significantly improved.

Understanding and predicting gas adsorption within porous materials demands comprehensive computational simulations that are often resource intensive, limiting the identification of promising materials. Active learning (AL) methods offer an effective strategy to reduce the computational burden by selectively acquiring critical data for model training. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit immense potential across various adsorption applications due to their porous structure and their modular nature, leading to diverse pore sizes and chemistry that serve as an ideal platform to develop adsorption models. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of AL in predicting gas adsorption within MOFs using \u201calchemical\u201d molecules and their interactions as surrogates for real molecules. We first applied AL separately to each MOF, reducing the training dataset size by 57.5% while retaining predictive accuracy. Subsequently, we amalgamated the refined datasets across 1800 MOFs to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, successfully predicting adsorption of real molecules. Furthermore, by integrating MOF features into the AL framework using principal component analysis (PCA), we navigated MOF space effectively, achieving high predictive accuracy with only a subset of MOFs. Our results highlight AL's efficiency in reducing dataset size, enhancing model performance, and offering insights into adsorption phenomenon in large datasets of MOFs. This study underscores AL's crucial role in advancing computational material science and developing more accurate and less data intensive models for gas adsorption in porous materials.", "date": "2024-03-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While this process is involved in some specific steps of viral RNA replication and splicing, it is also of importance in the context of the (putative) first autocatalytic RNA-based systems that could have preceded the emergence of modern life. The uncatalyzed phosphoesterbond formation is thermodynamically very unfavorable, and many experimental studies have focused on the understanding of the molecular features of catalysis in these ribozymes. However, chemical reaction paths are short-lived and not easily characterized by experimental approaches, so that molecular simulation approaches appear as an ideal tool to unveil the molecular details of the reaction. Here, we focus on the model hairpin ribozyme and highlight that identifying a relevant initial conformation for reactivity studies can be highly challenging due to limitations in both available X-ray and the force field accuracy, together with the necessity of extensive sampling. This is frequently overlooked in mixed quantum/classical studies that predominantly concentrate on the chemical reaction itself. These challenges stem from limitations in both available experimental structures (which are chemically altered to prevent self-cleavage) and the accuracy of force fields, together with the necessity for comprehensive sampling. We show that molecular dynamics simulations, combined with extensive conformational phase space exploration with Hamiltonian replica-exchange simulations, enable to characterize the relevant conformational basins of the minimal hairpin ribozyme in the ligated state, prior to self-cleavage. With all investigated force fields, we find that what is usually considered as a canonical reactive conformation with active site geometries and hydrogen-bond patterns that are optimal for the addition-elimination reaction with general acid/general base catalysis, is metastable and only marginally populated. The thermodynamically stable conformation appears to be consistent with the expectations of a mechanism that does not require the direct participation of ribozyme residues to the reaction. Our study therefore demonstrates that identifying the most pertinent reactant state conformation, holds equal importance alongside the accurate determination of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the chemical steps of the reaction.", "date": "2024-03-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

CLIM offers insights into structural and functional aspects related to carrier transport, defects, and recombination losses in operational photovoltaic devices. Our study reveals the presence of \"blinking\" phenomena in high-quality semiconductor films and their corresponding devices. CLIM demonstrates that highly correlated clusters correspond precisely to grain structures of perovskite layer on glass observed with SEM. Importantly, we find that the perovskite layer in photovoltaic devices exhibits predominant blinking during specific operational conditions. The correlated regions within devices are notably larger than those on bare substrate, indicating different microstructures likely caused by the transport layer at the interface.

This study investigates the structure of the ChCl:LA DES, employing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to assess the accuracy of the transferable and polarizable Cl\\&Pol force field in describing this system. When both compared, we observe that the Cl\\&Pol force field qualitatively captures the primary interactions occurring within the system, albeit with some numerical discrepancies that are anticipated due to its transferable nature. Aiming to refine the original force field, we conduct calculations that incorporate two improvements to the initial model: tuning the $\\sigma$ parameter of the strongest hydrogen-bond interactions and incorporating the Tang-Toennis dumping function to correct the overpolarization of the chloride ions. The first adjustment not only enhances the description of the specifically targeted interactions but also significantly improves the short-range structure of the entire hydrogen-bond network. The second refinement, although minimally impacting the structure at low LA ratios, proves critical at higher ratios by correcting the oversegregation of ionic molecules arising from the original setup of the force field. Consequently, it becomes indispensable for reliably depicting the medium and long-range structure of the system, highlighting that the specific parameter of the force field to be refined depends on the scale of the structure under investigation.

To better control the balance of various properties\u2019 errors, in this study we introduce weighting factors for the optimization objectives. Different weighting strategies are compared to fine-tune the balance between bulk-phase density and relative conformational energies (RCE), using n-octane as a representative system. Additionally, a non-linear projection of the individual property-specific parts of the optimized loss function is deployed to further improve the balance between them. The results show that the overall error is reduced. One interesting outcome is a large variety in the resulting optimized force field parameters (FFParams) and corresponding errors, suggesting that the optimization landscape is multi-modal and very dependent on the weighting factor setup.

However, written instruction in the interpretation of NMR spectra of peptides and proteins is generally focused on advanced techniques and highly complex spectra, with a lack of simple spectra and guides available for beginning students. In order to address this instructional limitation, we have generated a dataset of 1H NMR spectra of a series of simple peptides that include all canonical amino acids. Peptides examined include Ac-X(S/pS)-NH2, Ac-X(T/pT)-NH2, and Ac-XPPGY-NH2, where X = all encoded amino acids, pS = phosphorylated Ser, and pT = phosphorylated Thr. The characterization of each peptide includes a 1-D spectrum and a TOCSY spectrum, with both the raw and processed available. The spectra can be used for instructional applications including analysis of regions of the spectra (e.g. amide HN, aromatic, H\u03b1, and aliphatic regions); identification of spin systems and residue assignment via TOCSY spectra; analysis of conformational features including amide HN chemical shift dispersion and changes due to hydrogen bonding or post-translational modifications; the 3J\u03b1N coupling constant that reports on the \u03c6 torsion angle and on order versus disorder at a given residue; conformational preferences at H\u03b1 via chemical shift index analysis; understanding of diastereotopic hydrogens; dynamic processes, including hydrogen exchange; and identification of proline cis-trans isomerism. In addition, for a limited number of peptides, NOESY spectra are included to allow sequential resonance assignment and for assignment of trans versus cis proline conformations. Spectra from closely related peptides allow the analysis of the relative effects of single amino acid changes. The paper is written to be directly accessible to students as a tutorial guide.

However, their RNA-cleavage activity is insufficient under physiological conditions. Here, we have identified novel dinuclear bismuth(III) complexes that contain dipyridine/dipicolinate-based ligands as artificial ribonucleases to induce efficient RNA cleavage. Our optimization studies of the ligand structure indicated that the dipyridine/dipicolinate scaffold of the ligands plays a key role in maintaining the dinuclear arrangement of the bismuth(III) centers and tuning the Lewis acidity of the bismuth(III) ions to achieve potent RNA-cleavage activity. The mechanistic analysis of the RNA-cleavage reaction suggested that cooperative activation of a phosphate group in RNAs and water molecules coordinated by two bismuth(III) centers results in a rapid nucleophilic attack of the 2\u2032-hydroxy group of a ribose to the phosphate and facilitates the removal of a 5\u2032-alkoxide by protonation to generate a 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate and a 5\u2032-hydroxy product.

Here, we present a systematic investigation of the truncation of heptamethine cyanines (Cy7) to pentamethine (Cy5) and trimethine (Cy3) cyanines via homogeneous, acid-base catalyzed nucleophilic exchange reactions. We demonstrate how different substituents at the C3\u2032 and C4\u2032 positions of the chain and dif-ferent heterocyclic end groups, the presence of different bases, nucleophiles and oxygen, solvent properties, and tempera-ture affect the truncation process. The mechanism of chain shortening, studied by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques, was verified by extensive ab initio calculation, demonstrating the need to model catalytic reactions by highly correlated wavefunction-based methods. We show that entropic effects control the course of this process.

However, it is imperative that such detection process is free from scope of any false positive or false negative response. Herein, we report a new polymeric receptor derived from hydroxyl-functionalized tetra phenyl ethylene (TPE-OH) for specific detection of TKX 50 by monitoring its fluorescence-ON responses on binding to TKX 50.

In this study we designed a series of derivatives of the widely studied donor-acceptor TADF emitter DMAC-TRZ with the objective of correlating their structure to their propensity to orient horizontally in vacuum-deposited doped thin films. This is important as the preferential horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment (TDM) of the emitter, which tends to co-align with the long axis of D-A compounds, leads to enhanced light-outcoupling, and therefore higher maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of the OLED. The decoration of the DMAC donor with substituted aryl groups also affects the emission color and the capacity for the emitters to efficiently harvest triplet excitons. The presence of electron-withdrawing 4-cyanophenyl and 4-trifluoromethylphenyl groups in, respectively, CNPh-DMAC-TRZ and CF3Ph-DMAC-TRZ blue-shifts the emission spectrum but slows down the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC), while the opposite occurs in the presence of electron-donating groups in tBuPh-DMAC-TRZ and OMePh-DMAC-TRZ (red-shifted emission spectrum and faster kRISC). In contrast to our expectations, the OLED performance of the five DMAC-TRZ derivatives does not scale with their degree of horizontal emitter orientation but follows the kRISC rates. This, in turn, demonstrates that triplet harvesting (and not horizontal emitter orientation) is the dominant effect for device efficiency. Nonetheless, highly efficient OLEDs were fabricated with tBuPh-DMAC-TRZ and OMePh-DMAC-TRZ as emitters, with improved EQEmax (~ 28%) compared to the reference DMAC-TRZ devices.

Nanostar properties were first explored to understand how structural changes in geometry, valency, and interaction strength affect phase-separation temperature, size, stability, and permeability. We show that when pairs of nanostars self-assemble in the same solution, the order of phase-separation determines core or shell destination, while the proportion of surfactant nanostars that link the two populations determines shell morphology. For 3 different core nanostars, we demonstrate a range of shell nanostars with different material properties and morphologies.

To this end, we collected 225 publicly available compounds with pIC50 values against MATE1. Subsequently, on the one hand we performed a physics-based approach using an Alpha-Fold protein structure, from which we obtained MM-GB/SA scores for those compounds. On the other hand, we built Random Forest (RF) and Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models using Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints with radius 4 (ECFP4) and chemical structures as graphs, respectively, which also included MM-GB/SA scores as input variables.

The similar binding modes are consistent with the observed similar IC50 values inhibitor when using different substrates experimentally, and practically this can release the experimental scientists from bothering of selecting substrates for MATE1.

Methanol-d4 is conventionally employed as a solvent in SABRE hyperpolarization process. Herein, we investigate SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization of isotopically labeled [15N3]metronidazole and [15N3]nimorazole in nondeuterated methanol-h4 and ethanol-h6 solvents (with the latter one being more preferable for biomedical applications due to its significantly lower toxicity). Optimization of hyperpolarization parameters, such as polarization transfer magnetic field, temperature, parahydrogen flow rate and pressure, allowed us to obtain an average 15N polarization of up to ca. 7.6% for both substrates. The highest 15N polarizations were observed in methanol-d4 for [15N3]metronidazole and in ethanol-h6 for [15N3]nimorazole. At a clinically relevant magnetic field of 1.4 T the 15N nuclei of these substrates possess long characteristic hyperpolarization lifetimes (T1) in the range from ca. 1 to ca. 7 min, with the longest relaxation observed for 15NO2 sites.

In this paper, we used Density Functional Theory in combination with the computational hydrogen electrode methodology, to study the stability and activity of SACs and DACs by adsorbing metal atoms on SnS2 monolayers. With a focus on optimising the selective conversion of CO2 to formic acid, our analysis of the thermodynamics of CO2RR reveals that the Sn-SAC and Sn-DAC catalysts can efficiently and selectively catalyse formic acid production, being characterised by the low theoretical limiting potentials of approximately -0.25 V and an upper limit for the initial thermodynamic barrier for CO2 adsorption in gas phase of 0.5 eV.  Investigation of the catalysts' stability suggests that structures with low metal coverage, with isolated metal centres, may be synthesised.

All technologies were further evaluated across ranges of adoption time, and contextual analysis was performed to evaluate the implications of technology deployment across the world.

Some of the most common three-site force fields are TIP3, SPC/\u03f5 or OPC3, providing a decent range of bulk properties. That does not mean though, that they have realistic inter- atomic forces. These force fields have been parameterized with a top-down approach, meaning, by fitting the force field parameters to the experimental bulk properties. This approach has been the governing strategy also for many variants of four- and more-site models. We test a bottom- up approach, in which the force field is parameterized by optimizing the non-bonded inter-atomic forces. Our philosophy is that correct inter-atomic forces lead to correct geometrical and dynamical properties. The first system we try to optimize with the accurately system tailored atomic (ASTA) approach is water, but we aim to eventually probe other systems in the future as well. We applied our ASTA strategy to find a good set of parameters providing accurate bulk properties for the simple three-site force field forms, and also for AMOEBA, a more detailed and polarizable force field. Even though our bottom-up approach did not provide satisfactory results for the simple three-site force fields (with fixed charges), for the case of the AMOEBA force field it led to a modification of the original strategy, giving very good intra- and inter-molecular forces, as compared to accurate quantum chemically calculated reference forces.

Recent computational efforts have suggested that amino acids can enhance NPF, predicting that they can stabilize new particles via multiple protonation sites, but there has yet to be experimental validation of these predictions. We used mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy to study the structure and stability of cationic clusters composed of glycine, sulfuric acid, and ammonia. When collisionally activated, clusters were significantly more likely to eliminate ammonia or sulfuric acid than glycine, while quantum chemical calculations predicted lower binding free energies for ammonia but similar binding free energies for glycine and sulfuric acid. These calculations predicted several low-energy structures, so we compared experimental and computed vibrational spectra to attempt to validate the computationally-predicted minimum energy structure.  Unambiguous identification of the experimental structure by comparison to these calculations was made difficult by the complexity of the experimental spectra and the fact that the identity of the computed lowest-energy structure depended strongly on temperature.  If their vapors are present, amino acids are likely to be enriched in new particles by displacing more weakly-bound ammonia, similar to the behavior of other atmospheric amines.

In this study, we utilize a variety of surface treatment processes across 37 cells to selectively induce proton exchange and contamination reactions in LLZO.

The absence of comprehensive synthetic techniques and a thorough understanding of the impact of structural factors on the photochemical and thermal properties of this widely available dye hinders its broad application. Herein, we report an efficient copper-catalyzed indigo N-arylation that enables the installation of a wide variety of aryl moieties carrying useful functional groups. The exclusive selectivity for mono-arylation likely originates from a bimetallic cooperative mechanism through a binuclear copper-indigo intermediate. Functional N-aryl-N\u2032-alkylindigos were prepared and shown to photoisomerize efficiently under red light. Moreover, this design allows for the modulation of thermal half-lives through N-aryl substituents, while the N\u2032-alkyl groups enable the independent attach-ment of functional moieties without affecting the photochromic properties. Strong correlation between the structure of N-aryl moiety and the thermal stability of the photogenerated Z-isomers was achieved by multivariate linear regression models obtained through a straightforward data-science workflow.

Combing SEM and AFM, lateral size and thickness of both flakes were characterized, which showed comparable values, and thus removed the effect of aspect ratio during the comparison. Both EEG and EEA flakes were dispersed in ethanol and sprayed coated onto carbon fibres, followed by vacuum assisted resin infusion to make hybrid composites. Testing of their mechanical properties showed that EEG flakes tend to act as points of stress concentration which accelerated the delamination; while the EEA flakes improved interfacial properties owing to the covalent bonding. As a result, with only 0.5 wt.% EEA flakes spray coated onto the carbon fibres, the tensile and flexural strength of graphene/carbon fibre composites improved by 17.6% and 5.4% respectively.

Gaseous and solid atoms under transitional conditions are candidates for exploring remarkable advances in chemical and physical sciences. There is an anomaly in the first law of thermodynamics when studying the transitional behaviors of atoms. By gaining transition energy, gaseous atoms undergo a transition state. Thus, they perform the work self. Symbolically, a plus sign is needed. However, a transition in solid atoms occurs because of the absorbing transition energy, where electrons decrease the potential energy. Therefore, the work rating is a minus sign. The force exerted at the electron level in a gaseous atom is different than that in a solid atom. The potential energy of the electron changes from the transitional energy, thus controlling the orientation. An anomaly resolves by changing the equations of internal energy. Gaseous and solid atoms introduce cooling and heat effects under elastically driven electronic states when reaching the mid-states. A transition state between re-crystallization and liquid states can be considered a mid-state. In generating cooling or heating energy, an electron executes dynamics by remaining within the occupied energy knot. Thus, constantly driven electronic states of atoms cause disorder and irreversible cycling.

They feature two characteristic sequence motifs that distinguish them from homologous short-chain dehydrogenases and reductases. Sequence motif 1, carrying a conserved threonine, glycine and a central aromatic residue, lines the nucleophile binding pocket of HHDHs. It could therefore impact nucleophile binding and presumably also activity of the enzymes. However, experimental evidence supporting this theory is largely missing. Herein, we systematically studied the mutability of the three conserved motif 1 residues as well as their resulting impact on enzyme activity, stability and selectivity in two model HHDHs: HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 and HheG from Ilumatobacter coccineus. In both HheC and HheG, the conserved threonine and glycine only tolerated mutations to structurally similar amino acids. In contrast, the central aromatic (i.e., phenylalanine or tyrosine) residue of motif 1 demonstrated much higher variability in HheC. Remarkably, some of these variants featured drastically altered activity, stability and selectivity characteristics. For instance, variant HheC F12Y displayed up to 5-fold increased specific activity in various epoxide ring opening and dehalogenation reactions as well as enhanced enantioselectivity (e.g., an E-value of 74 in the azidolysis of epichlorohydrin compared to E = 22 for HheC wild type), while exhibiting also a 10 K higher apparent melting temperature. QM and MD simulations support the experimentally observed activity increase of HheC F12Y and revealed alterations in the hydrogen bonding network within the active site. As such, our results demonstrate that multiple enzyme properties of HHDHs can be altered through targeted mutagenesis of conserved motif 1 residues. In addition, this work illustrates that motif 1 plays vital roles beyond nucleophile binding by impacting solubility and stability properties. These insights advance our understanding of HHDH active sites and will facilitate their future engineering.

For the addition of \u2212SO3H groups to the Ti3C2Tx surface (where Tx represents the surface moieties such as -OH or -O), sulfonation with an aryl diazonium salt obtained from sulfanilic acid was employed.

Due to the kinetic disadvantage of direct copolymerization of CO2 and bulk olefins compared to homopolymerization of bulk olefins, considerable research attention has been devoted to synthesis of polyester via the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of a six-membered disubstituted lactone intermediate, 1,2-ethylidene-6-vinyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (\ud835\udf39-L), obtained from telomerization of CO2 and 1,3-butadiene. However, the conjugate olefin on the six-membered ring of \ud835\udf39-L leads to serious Michael addition side reactions. Thus, selective ROP of \ud835\udf39-L, which can precisely control the repeating unit for the production of polyesters potentially amenable to efficient monomer recycling, remains an unre-solved challenge. Herein, we report the first example of selective ROP of \ud835\udf39-L using a combination of organobase and N,N\u2032-Bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]urea as the catalytic system. Systematic modifications of the substituent of the urea shows that the presence of electron-deficient 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl groups is the key to the extraordinary selectivity of ring opening over Michael addition. Efficient monomer recovery of poly(\ud835\udf39-L) was also achieved under mild catalytic conditions. This work proves that it is possible to synthesize monomer-recyclable polyester by only using CO2 and bulk olefin as the feedstock, provid-ing a new strategy to potentially fix CO2 in polymeric materials at large scales.", "date": "2024-03-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling and analyzing biological sequences, but their application to protein design is limited by the high cardinality of the protein space. This study introduces a framework that combines LLMs with genetic algorithms (GAs) to optimize enzymes. LLMs are trained on a large dataset of protein sequences to learn relationships between amino acid residues linked to structure and  function. This knowledge is then leveraged by GAs to efficiently search for sequences with improved catalytic performance.

Systematic evaluations on 105 biocatalytic reactions demonstrated that the LLM-GA framework generated mutants outperforming the wild-type enzymes in terms of feasibility in 90% of the instances. Further in-depth evaluation of seven reactions reveals the power of this methodology to make `the best of both worlds' and create mutants with structural features and flexibility comparable to the wild types.

Here, a mechanistic description of hydroxyl radical-initiated glyoxal oxidation is constructed by gleaning insights from photolysis and radiation chemistry to explain the yields and kinetic trends for oxidation products. The mechanistic description and kinetic measurements reported herein reveal that increasing the formation rate of hydroxyl radicals by changing the ultrasound frequency increases both the rates of glyoxal consumption and the selectivity towards C2 acid products over those from C-C cleavage. Glyoxal consumption also occurs more rapidly and with greater selectivity towards C2 acids under acidic conditions, which favor the protonation of carboxylate intermediates into their less reactive acidic forms. Leveraging such pH and frequency effects is crucial to mitigating product degradation by secondary reactions with hydroxyl radicals and oxidation products (specifically H2O2 and \u2022O2\u2013).

MS coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) presents a number of advantages such as detection with high sensitivity of nanoclusters with high molecular weights. Although many protein-protected metal nanoclusters have been characterized by MALDI-MS, a large dispersion in the number of metal atoms have been reported mainly due to sample preparation.

Obvious matrix effects on ion signals and peak positions by MALDI-MS was observed. The metal atom number of metal nanoclusters embedded in proteins is different depending on the MALDI matrix most probably due to fragmentation.

CDR must capture CO2 from air and safely sequester it. Mg-rich silicate minerals have the capacity to remove ~10^5 Gton CO2 and sequester it in the form of stable and innocuous carbonate minerals or dissolved bicarbonate ions, but their reaction rates under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical and scalable CDR. Here we show that CaO reacts quantitatively with diverse Mg silicates (olivine, serpentine, augite) under thermochemical conditions to form Ca2SiO4 and MgO. Upon exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, Ca2SiO4 is quantitatively converted to CaCO3 and SiO2, and MgO is partially converted into a Mg carbonate within weeks, while the input Mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. The mixture of Ca2SiO4, and MgO can also be completely carbonated to CaCO3 and Mg(HCO3)2 under 1 atm CO2 at ambient temperature within hours. By combining it with CaCO3 calcination to generate CaO, this chemistry enables a new process for CDR wherein the output Ca2SiO4/MgO material is used to remove CO2 from air or soil to form stable (bi)carbonates and the CO2 process emissions are sequestered. Analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could provide CDR at less than 1 MWh per ton CO2 removed, approximately half the energy required just to capture CO2 with leading direct air capture technologies.

In addressing these challenges, we employ a surface modification technique involving lithium borate (LBO) through a dry coating method. The LBO-coated LRLO exhibits a uniform surface layer with a thickness of 15 nm. Furthermore, the performance of LBO-coated LRLO in a full cell is synergistically enhanced when combined with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) as an electrolyte additive. A discharge capacity retention of 82% is achieved after 400 cycles at room temperature. These substantial improvements are attributed to the continual reaction between boron species on the LRLO cathode surface and PF6- anions in the electrolyte. This reaction generates BF4- and suppresses HF acid formation during the high voltage charging process, demonstrating LRLO's potential for practical implementation.", "date": "2024-03-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Coating Materials; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The PE brushes and the brush-supported water molecules and counterions (chloride ions) are first described using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulation data is subsequently used in our ML framework to identify that (1) the {N(CH3)3}+ functional groups of the PMETAC brushes have two distinct hydration states with one state (state 1) being characterized by less structured water molecules and the other state (state 2) being characterized by more structured water molecules and (2) an enhancement in the brush grafting density leads to the progressive dissapparenace of state 2. An increase in the grafting density increases the number of chloride counterions in a given volume around the {N(CH3)3}+ functional group and increases the number of shared water molecules between the {N(CH3)3}+ and Cl-. The chloride counterions are associated with a hydration layer with much less structured water molecules. Therefore, with an increase in the grafting density, an increase in the percentage of shared water molecules leads to the prevalence of the hydration state [of the {N(CH3)3}+ moiety] with less structured water molecules. Finally, we explain how the present findings are commensurate with two key previous related results, namely a significantly large chloride ion mobility inside the PMETAC brush layer and the {N(CH3)3}+-Cl- average distance remaining independent of the PMETAC brush grafting density. We anticipate that the combined ML-MD-simulation approach proposed in this study can be adapted to probe other soft matter systems to reveal new insights of the underlying mechanisms of emergent phenomenon.

This results in an exothermic reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process that potentially enhances triplet harvesting, compared to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with endothermic rISCs. However, the processes and phenomena that facilitate conversion between excited states for INVEST materials are underexplored. We investigate the complex potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the excited states of three heavily studied azaphenalene INVEST compounds, namely cyclazine, pentazine and heptazine using two state-of-the-art computational methodologies, namely RMS-CASPT2 and SCS-ADC(2) methods. Our findings suggest that ISC and rISC processes take place directly between the S1 and T1 electronic states in all three compounds through a minimum-energy crossing point (MECP) with an activation energy barrier between 0.11 to 0.58 eV above the S1 state for ISC and between 0.06 to 0.36 eV above the T1 state for rISC. We predict that higher-lying triplet states are not populated, since the crossing point structures to these states are not energetically accessible. Furthermore, the conical intersection (CI) between the ground and S1 states are high in energy for all compounds (between 0.4 to 2.0 eV) which makes nonradiative decay back to the ground state a relatively slow process. We demonstrate that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) driving the S1-T1 conversion is enhanced by vibronic coupling with higher-lying singlet and triplet states possessing vibrational modes of proper symmetry. We also rationalize that the experimentally-observed anti-Kasha emission of cyclazine is due to the energetically inaccessible CI between the bright S2 and the dark S1 states, hindering internal conversion. Finally, we show that SCS-ADC(2) is able to qualitatively reproduce excited state features, but consistently overpredict relative energies of excited state structural minima compared to RMS-CASPT2.

The structure and composition of mucus play an important role in maintaining barrier properties by acting as a filter for the diffusion of biomolecules and pathogens. The rise in viral infections has underscored the importance of advancing research into mucus-mimicking hydrogels for the efficient design of antiviral agents. However, the performance of an antiviral strategy should not only be assessed based on its efficacy in inhibiting infections but also based on its sustainability. Herein, we demonstrate the gram-scale synthesis of biocompatible, lignin-based virus-binding inhibitors that reduce waste and ensure long-term availability. The lignin-based inhibitors were equipped with sulfate moieties, which are known binding partners for many viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and herpes viruses. In addition, crosslinking the synthesized inhibitors yielded hydrogels that mimicked native mucus with respect to surface functionality and rheology. It is found that the degree of sulfation has a very strong impact on the mesh size distribution of the hydrogels, which provides a new means to fine-tune steric and electrostatic contributions of the virus-hydrogel interaction. This feature strongly impacts the sequestration capability of the lignin-based hydrogels, which is demonstrated by infection inhibition assays involving human herpes simplex virus-1, influenza A viruses, and the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). For HSV-1 and E. coli, these measurements showed a reduction in plaque (HSV-1) and colony-forming units (E. coli) by more than 4 orders of magnitude, indicating potent inhibition by the lignin-based hydrogels.

Pipeline transport of gases is the lowest cost delivery method for gases over long distances, but there are only a few pipeline networks dedicated to hydrogen. It is possible to alleviate clean hydrogen transportation costs by delivering it via existing natural gas pipeline infrastructures. This strategy, however, necessitates dilution of hydrogen by blending it with natural gas as the hydrogen can embrittle existing pipeline materials. An electrochemical hydrogen pump (EHP) is a separation platform capable of de-blending hydrogen from natural gas mixtures at end use locations because many applications require purified hydrogen. In this work, we deploy high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (HT-PEM) EHPs to purify hydrogen from dilute hydrogen-natural gas mixtures (i.e., 5 to 20 vol% hydrogen). The HT-PEM EHP uses an ion-pair HT-PEM with perfluorosulfonic acid-phosphonic acid ionomer blends as electrode binders. Interestingly, we observe that activation overpotentials govern HT-PEM EHP polarization when feeding dilute hydrogen mixtures. We ascribe this observation to interfacial mass transfer resistance of hydrogen through the ionomer binder to the electrocatalyst surface resulting in a lower surface concentration of hydrogen and a lower exchange current density. Pressurizing the anode to 1.76 barabs ameliorates the interfacial mass transfer resistance and enabled us to achieve an EHP limiting current of 1.4 A cm-2 with a 10 vol% of hydrogen in natural gas feed. This configuration also pressurized the hydrogen at the cathode to 2.51 barabs.

To get around this problem and improve the performance of a model that predicts the properties of drug molecules, we came up with a novel architecture that uses a \"bond order matrix\" and structural information to improve molecular graph representations and information in the molecule. Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are a framework used to learn local and global features from irregularly formed data invariant to permutations. We take advantage of MPNN architecture and introduce a \u201csemi-master node,\u201d a unique way of representing the functional groups in a small molecule and aggregating features obtained from the functional groups, in anticipation of reverse engineering small molecules given the desired physicochemical properties. This novel architecture and molecule representation were evaluated on the QM9 dataset, which has 133,000 stable small organic molecules with nine heavy atoms (CONF) out of the GDB-17 chemical universe. The metric for evaluating the model's performance is DFT error, an estimated average error of the properties of each molecule. Our models have shown a performance gain of ~10%.", "date": "2024-03-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The funding investigated stem from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), projects directly funded through the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI), and various initiatives supported by private companies or other funding sources (hydrogen valleys). Specific calls for proposals within the PNRR initiative outline the allocation of funds, emphasizing hydrogen production in brownfield areas (52 expected hydrogen production plants by 2026), hydrogen use in hard-to-abate sectors, and the establishment of hydrogen refuelling stations for road (48 refuelling stations by 2026) and railway transport (10 hydrogen-based railway lines). An in-depth description of funded initiatives covering geographical location, typology, and size (when available), as well as the funding they have received, is presented, by collecting data on about approximately 150 funded initiatives. This overview sheds lights on regions focusing on heavy-duty transport decarbonisation, particularly along cross-borders commercial routes, as evident in northern Italy. Conversely, some regions concentrate more on local transport, typically buses, or on the industrial sector, primarily steel and chemicals. Additionally, the study presents initiatives aimed to strengthen the national manufacturing capacity for hydrogen-related technologies, alongside with new regulatory and incentive schemes for hydrogen. \nThe ultimate goal of this analysis is to foster connections among existing and planned projects, stimulate new initiatives along the entire hydrogen value chain, grow awareness in stakeholders about hydrogen, and promote cooperation and international competitiveness. \n", "date": "2024-03-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science; Power", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Initial conditions (or snapshots for spectra) are typically produced by QM/MM Boltzmann sampling (following MM equilibration or optimization). It is now becoming clear that one should wait for a set period of time, which we call the healing time, before beginning to sample from the QM/MM trajectory. An appropriate healing time should be as short as possible (to avoid unnecessary computational effort), but long enough to equilibrate to the QM/MM ground state distribution. Healing times in previous studies range from tens of femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds, suggesting the need for guidelines to choose a healing time.  We examine the effect of healing trajectory length on the nonadiabatic dynamics and spectrum of a first-generation Donor-Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct in chloroform. Insufficient healing times skew the branching ratio of relaxation back to the ground state and alter the relaxation time for one pathway. The healing time exerts a weaker influence on the spectrum: an insufficient healing time may cause a slight red shift.  Monitoring the solute temperature during the healing trajectory provides a reasonable estimate for the healing time.

It can maintain good stability after 24 hours of continuous operation, and the catalytic activity exceeds most of the similar series of catalysts. The characterization show that F doping can affect the catalytic activity in the form of adjusting the electronic structure and lifting d band center. These structural changes effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption capacity of the composite catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen intermediates in the catalytic process, thereby improving the catalytic activity for alkaline oxygen evolution.", "date": "2024-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Nanoscience; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Electrocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Sparsity of the CI secular problem is revealed by exploring the site permutation space within spin-adapted many-body bases, and highly compressed wave functions may arise by finding optimal site orderings. However, the factorial cost of searching through the permutation space remains a bottleneck for clusters with a large number of metal centers. In this work, we explore ways to reduce the factorial scaling, by combining permutation and point group symmetry arguments, and using commutation relations between cumulative partial spin and the Hamiltonian operators. Certain site orderings lead to commuting operators, from which more sparse wave functions arise. Two graphical strategies will be discussed, one to rapidly evaluate the commutators of interest, and one in the form of a tree search algorithm to predict how many and which distinct site permutations are to be analyzed, eliminating redundancies in the permutation space. Particularly interesting is the case of the singlet spin states for which an additional reversal symmetry can be utilized to further reduce the distinct site permutations.", "date": "2024-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

On an unpatterned membrane, the site of nanopore formation by controlled breakdown is random. Nanopore formation on a specific site on the membrane has previously been realized using local thinning of the membrane by lithographic processes or laser-assisted photothermal etching under immersion in an aqueous salt solution. However, these approaches require elaborate and expensive cleanroom-based lithography processes or involve intricate procedures using custom-made equipment. Here, we present a rapid cleanroom-free approach using single pulse femtosecond laser exposures of 50 nm thick silicon nitride membranes in air to localize the site of nanopore formation by subsequent controlled breakdown to an area less than 500 nm in diameter on the membrane. The precise positioning of the nanopores on the membrane could be produced both using laser exposure powers which caused significant thinning of the silicon nitride membrane (up to 60 % of the original thickness locally), as well as at laser powers which caused no visible modification of the membrane at all. We show that nanopores made using our approach can work as single-molecule sensors by performing dsDNA translocation experiments. Due to the applicability of femtosecond laser processing to a wide range of membrane materials, we expect our approach to simplify the fabrication of localized nanopores by controlled breakdown in a variety of thin film material stacks, thereby enabling more sophisticated nanopore sensors.", "date": "2024-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Nanofabrication", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Contrary to the prevalent TM-centric ionic model, this research reveals that charge compensation upon Li removal occurs without formal Ni oxidation. Instead, oxygen dominates the redox process, facilitated by strong TM\u2013O hybridisation, forming bulk stable 3d8L and 3d8L2 electronic states, where L is a ligand hole. This model supports the observation of O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering features, often attributed to bulk O\u2013O dimers, irrespective of the state of delithiation. Furthermore, there is no evidence of any crystallographic TM migration or void formation. Above 4.34 V vs. Li+/Li, the cathode loses surface O, forming a resistive surface rock salt layer that eventually causes capacity fade.

Coarse-grained (CG) models provide over 100-fold computational efficiency gain over AA models, enabling the study of water crystallization, but have not yet shown to have a LLT.

In the research, we reported the fabrication of 2D S-doped VOx deposited on 2D g-C3N4 to produce H2O2 via the piezo-photocatalytic process. The finding pointed out that adding sulfur to VOx can help improve the catalytic outcomes by modifying the electronic and morphological properties of pristine VOx. In addition, when coupled with g-C3N4, the presence of sulfur limits the formation of graphene in the VOx/g-C3N4 composites, causing shielding effects in the materials. Besides, the research also sheds light on the charge transportation between g-C3N4 and S-VOx under irradiation and how the composites work to trigger the formation of H2O2. It turned out that the formation of H2O2 significantly relies on the reduction of oxygen to generate oxygenic radical species at g-C3N4 sites. Meanwhile, S-VOx provides oxidative sites in the composites to oxidize water molecules to generate H2O2. This study confirms the validation of S-scheme piezo-photocatalysts, thus encouraging further research on developing heterojunction materials with high catalytic efficiency, which can be used in practical conditions.

As an alternative, this study measured C18 liquid chromatography retention times of 39 anionic PFAS and 20 nonfluorinated surfactants using isocratic methanol/water eluent systems. By measuring a series of PFAS with different perfluoroalkyl chain lengths, retention factors at 100% water (k0) were successfully extrapolated even for long-chain PFAS. Molecular size was the most important factor determining the k0 of PFAS and non-PFAS, suggesting that the cavity formation process is the key driver for retention. The log k0 showed a high correlation with the log of partition coefficients from water to phospholipid membrane, air/water interface, and soil organic carbon.

Numerical simulation should provide the necessary molecular description, but the solvent involvement poses a number of challenges. Here, we combine the efficiency and accuracy of neural network potential-based reactive molecular dynamics with the extensive and unbiased exploration of reaction pathways provided by transition path sampling. Using microsecond-scale simulations at the density functional theory level, we show that this method reveals the presence of two competing distinct mechanisms for peptide bond formation between alanine esters in aqueous solution. We describe how both reaction pathways, via a general base catalysis mechanism and via direct cleavage of the tetrahedral intermediate respectively, change with pH. This result contrasts with the conventional mechanism involving a single pathway in which only the barrier heights are affected by pH. We show that this new proposal involving two competing mechanisms is consistent with the experimental data, and we discuss the implications for peptide bond formation under prebiotic conditions and in the ribosome.

However, many photocatalytic reactions suffer from lousy quantum yields, hampering the transition from lab-scale reactions to large-scale or even industrial applications. Molecular dyads can be designed such that the beneficial properties of inorganic and organic chromophores are combined, resulting in milder reaction conditions and improved quantum yields of photocatalytic reactions. We have developed a novel approach for obtaining the advantages of molecular dyads without the time- and resource-consuming synthesis of these tailored photocatalysts. Simply by mixing a cationic ruthenium complex with an anionic pyrene derivative in water a salt bichromophore is produced owing to electrostatic interactions. The long-lived organic triplet state is obtained by static and quantitative energy transfer from the preorganized ruthenium complex. We exploited this so-called Coulombic dyad for energy transfer catalysis with similar reactivity and even higher photostability compared to a molecular dyad and reference photosensitizers in several photooxygenations. In addition, it was shown that this system can also be used to maximize the quantum yield of photoredox reactions. This is due to an intrinsically higher cage escape quantum yield after photoinduced electron transfer for purely organic compounds compared to heavy atom-containing molecules.

Herein, our study introduces a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four-electron to a more advantageous two-electron pathway.

Theoretical computations alongside in-situ infrared spectroscopy indicated that JUC-660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards a desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC-660 was showcased through its application in the electro-Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants.

Importantly, by combining information from each of these scales, we are able to bridge the gap between bottom-up molecular characteristics and macro- scopic properties such as apparent diffusion coefficients of electron transport ($D_{app}$).

A combination of molecular-level properties (such as the reorganization energy) and condensed-phase properties (such as effective electron hopping distances) determine the predicted ranking of electron transport capabilities of the polymers.

The latter holds true if they are compatible with next-generation high-capacity anodes. However, most highly ion-conductive solid electrolytes decompose at the low operating potentials of next-generation anodes, leading to irreversible lithium loss and increased cell resistances. Here we introduce the concept of the dynamic stability of solid electrolytes, and demonstrate how this phenomenon is utilized to improve all-solid-state battery performance. Halide electrolytes such as Li3YCl3Br3 and Li2ZrCl6, considered unstable at low working potentials, are shown to exhibit a structurally reversible redox activity beyond their electrochemical stability windows. Low potentials result in reversible lithiation of these halide solid electrolytes, introducing three advantages to the benefit of all-solid-state battery performance. First, the dynamic stability window is wider than their electrochemical stability window, thereby increasing their compatibility with anodes. Second, the lithiation of these halides increases their ionic conductivity rather than compromising it. Finally, the solid electrolyte contributes to the reversible capacity of the all-solid-state battery. The benefit of this dynamic stability window is demonstrated through halide-based cost-effective red phosphorus anodes that fall within this window, resulting in high reversible capacities (2308 mAh g-1), high rate capacity retention (1024 mAh g-1 at 7.75 mA cm-2) and an extended cycle life (61% retention after 1780 cycles). Furthermore, high areal capacity (7.65 mAh cm-2) and stability (70% retention after 1000 cycles) are achieved for exclusive halide-based full cells with uncoated high-voltage cathodes in combination with red phosphorous anodes.

The initial investigation of the photocatalytic mechanism involved the utilization of density functional calculations on a heterostructure consisting of g-C3N4 and CoN4. The formation energy, total density of states (TDOS), partial density of states (PDOS) and optical absorbance of the g-C3N4/CoN4 heterojunction were comprehensively examined. The findings indicate that the formation of heterojunctions between g-C3N4 and CoN4 is facilitated, and the incorporation of CoN4 leads to a notable enhancement in the light absorption properties of g-C3N4. \nNevertheless, the initial formation of a type-I heterojunction between g-C3N4 and CoN4 is not conducive to the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. In order to handle this, a model is developed for B,F co-doped g-C3N4, which is subsequently joined with CoN4 to form the B,F co-doped g-C3N4/CoN4 heterojunction. A more comprehensive examination of the work function, charge density difference and electric field direction reveals that the combination of B,F co-doped g-C3N4 and CoN4 exhibits the ability to establish a z scheme heterojunction. This approach has the potential to efficiently segregate photogenerated charge carriers while maintaining their activity, hence enhancing the overall photocatalytic efficiency.

However, what metals should be used to mediate M-eNRR remains unanswered. This work provides an extensive comparison of the energy consumption in the classical Haber Bosch (H-B) process and the M-eNRRs. The results indicate that, when employing lithium and calcium, metals popularly used to mediate the M-eNRRs, the energy consumption is more than 10 times that of the H-B process even assuming a 100% Faradaic efficiency and zero overpotentials. A further analysis of other metals in the periodic table reveals that only some heavy metals, including In, Tl, Co, Ni, Ga, Mo, Sn, Pb, Fe, W, Ge, Re, Bi, Cu, Po, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Hg, Pd, Ir, Pt and Au, can potentially con-sume less energy than that of the H-B process.

Their enormous advantages include wide dynamic range, ease of operation and low detector cost. Sets of ion-selective electrodes selective towards various ions can easily be assembled into an electronic tongue system. The additional information gained from other electrodes can help overcome the ISE\u2019s inherent limitations, such as the need for recalibration in more complex samples of variable ionic strength. In this work we developed low-cost ion-selective electrodes made from disposable syringes equipped with plasticized PVC membranes. To characterize the system we have chosen well-studied ionophore valinomycin, and the results in model solutions were comparable to standard ISE electrodes fabricated using commercial bodies. However, quantification of potassium in real samples showed, as expected, that measurement in complex, more concentrated solutions of higher ionic strength, such as beetroot soup, tomato-based food products, and dried fruits, are reproducible but subject to relative error up to 76 %. To overcome this limitation, we have constructed an electronic tongue based on the low-cost syringe electrodes. Different compositions of the array were tested with a series of multivariate algorithms. We have shown that adding a single type of electrode coupled with an ensemble random forest model allows us to quantify potassium in a wide range of food products, and pharmaceutical supplements without recalibration. Compared to a quantification of potassium using a standard calibration curve, the root mean square error of prediction was almost six times lower. We have also shown how the array can be designed to achieve comparable analytical performance using less selec-tive ionophores, such as dibenzo-18-crown-6 instead of valinomycin.", "date": "2024-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Quantum mechanical calculations, employing the B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) density functional theory (DFT), are utilized to compute chemical reactivity, stability, and photoinitiating properties for 4-4 (methylphenylthio) benzophenone.

These stationary phases have some advantages such as peculiar selectivity, high polarity, and thermostability. Many previous works are devoted to such stationary phases. However, there are still no large enough retention data sets of structurally diverse compounds for them. Consequently, there are very few works devoted to quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRR) for ionic liquid-based stationary phases. This work is aimed to close this gap. Three ionic liquids with substituted pyridinium cations are considered. We provide large enough data sets (123 - 158 compounds) that can be used in further works devoted to QSRR and related methods. We provide a QSRR study using this data set and demonstrate the following. The retention index for a polyethylene glycol stationary phase (denoted as RIPEG), predicted using another model, can be used as a molecular descriptor. The use of this descriptor significantly improves the accuracy of the QSRR model. Both deep learning-based and linear models were considered for RIPEG prediction. The ability to predict the retention indices for ionic liquid-based stationary phases with high accuracy is demonstrated. Particular attention is paid to the reproducibility and reliability of the QSRR study. It was demonstrated that adding/removing several compounds, small perturbations of the data set can considerably affect the results such as descriptor importance and model accuracy. These facts have to be considered in order to avoid misleading conclusions. For the QSRR research, we developed a software tool with a graphical user interface, which we called CHERESHNYA. It is intended to select molecular descriptors and construct linear equations connecting molecular descriptors with gas chromatographic retention indices for any stationary phase. The software allows the user to generate several hundred molecular descriptors (one-dimensional and two-dimensional). Among them, predicted retention indices for popular stationary phases such as polydimethylsiloxane and polyethylene glycol are used as molecular descriptors.

Over the years, the importance of statistical mechanics and molecular simulations in the curriculum has increased, especially at the graduate level. Given this shift, in this work, we utilize the microcanonical ensemble, which is typically considered to be intractable, and show that it is helpful to employ it as a pedagogical tool that demonstrates the consistency of microcanonical statistical mechanics with the combined first and second law of thermodynamics. We start with Boltzmann's entropy formula and use differential calculus to establish that dE=TdS - PdV for an isolated, nonideal fluid in an arbitrary number of dimensions, with a constant number of particles (N), volume (V), and energy (E), and with temperature T, pressure P, and entropy S. To this end, we write the partition function for an isolated monoatomic fluid. Further, we derive the average of the inverse kinetic energy, which appears in the formulation of the combined first and second law, and show that it is equal to the inverse of the average kinetic energy, thus introducing the system's temperature (T). Subsequently, we obtain an expression for the pressure (P) of a system involving many-body interactions and introduce the system pressure in the combined first and second law via Clausius's virial theorem. We discuss how intermolecular interactions affect the entropy and pressure of a thermodynamic system. Overall, we inform the derivation of the fundamental thermodynamic relationship dE=TdS-PdV using an isolated (microcanonical) system, thereby providing deeper insight into equilibrium statistical thermodynamics. Indeed, we demonstrated that this material resulted in favorable learning outcomes when taught as a 1.5-hour lecture.

Similar scaling relationships remain unknown for surface-adsorbed ORR electrocatalysts in the acidic aqueous environments germane to proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Herein, we examine ORR catalysis in aqueous perchloric acid media for a structurally diverse array of iron macrocycle complexes adsorbed on Vulcan carbon black. The macrocycles encompass Fe\u2013N4, Fe\u2013N2N\u20322 and Fe\u2013NxC4\u2212x motifs bearing pyrrolic, pyridinic, and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) moieties in the primary ligation sphere, giving rise to a 530 mV range in Fe(III/II) redox potentials, EFe(III/II). Experimental Tafel data in the micropolarization regime were extrapolated to the EFe(III/II) to furnish estimated TOF values that span ~3 orders of magnitude across the family of compounds. Despite the structural diversity of this family of compounds, extrapolated TOF values correlate with Fe(III/II) redox potentials in a roughly log-linear fashion with a shallow scaling factor of approximately 180 mV/decade. These findings highlight that negative shifts in EFe(III/II) lead to diminishing returns in catalytic rate promotion and suggest that changes to the primary ligating environment in a macrocycle are insufficient to break fundamental rate-overpotential scaling relationships in aqueous ORR catalysis.

Instantaneous DEIS measurements allowed to evaluate the effectiveness profile of sodium molybdate, giving high inhibition efficiency (>85%) at concentrations higher than ca. 35 mM. Post-corrosion SEM, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the morphology, ionic and valence composition of the formed passive layers on the surface of AZ31-xLi alloys. Based on experimental observations, a two-stage corrosion mechanism of AZ31-xLi alloys in molybdate-containing NaCl solutions has been proposed.", "date": "2024-03-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Alloys; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, the process efficiency and material lifetime are greatly conditioned and limited by the poorly understood plating process and the presence of competitive reactions. In this work, we propose a methodology to deconvolute the nucleation parameters of iron via a suite of electrochemical techniques, spectroscopy, and analytical models, coupled with microscopic and crystallographic techniques. We perform a systematic analysis with iron-based electrolytes to deconvolute the simultaneous plating and hydrogen evolution reactions, and investigate an array of additives to tune electroplating descriptors. We find that all additives studied are able to regulate the plating process and find that highly stable iron-complexes based on buffers, such as iron-borates or -citrates deliver greater overall electroplating performance. These additives show superior selectivity, with improvements in faradaic efficiencies from 60% to ~90% due to the balanced effects of enhanced nucleation and side reaction suppression. Herewith, the aim of this study is to bridge the knowledge gap between the role of additives, kinetics and efficiency of the electrodeposition reaction, and their interplay defining the quality of the resulting plated layers.

Ahmed; Mohsen Morshedizad; Oliver K\u00fchn; Peter Leinweber", "abstract": "The adsorption of phosphorus (P) onto active soil surfaces plays a pivotal role in immobilizing P, thereby influencing soil fertility and the filter function of soil to protect freshwater systems from eutrophication. Competitive anions, such as organic matter (OM), significantly affect the strength of this P-binding, eventually controlling P mobility and release, but surprisingly, these processes are insufficiently understood at the molecular level. In this study, we provide a molecular-level perspective on the influence of OM on P binding at the goethite-water interface using a combined experimental-theoretical approach. By examining the impact of citric acid (CIT) and histidine (HIS) on the adsorption of orthophosphate (OP), glycerolphosphate (GP), and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) through adsorption experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we address fundamental questions regarding P binding trends, OM interaction with the goethite surface, and the effect of OM on P adsorption. Our findings reveal the complex nature of P adsorption on goethite surfaces, where the specific OM, treatment conditions (including covering the surface with OM or simultaneous co-adsorption), and initial concentrations collectively shape these interactions. P adsorbs on goethite with an order of GP < OP < IHP. Crucially, this trend remains consistent across all adsorption experiments, regardless of the presence or absence of OM, CIT, or HIS, and irrespective of the specific treatment method. Notably, OP is particularly susceptible to inhibition by OM, while adsorption of GP depends on specific OM treatments. Despite being less sensitive to OM, IHP shows reduced adsorption, especially at higher initial P concentrations. Of significance is the strong inhibitory effect of CIT, particularly evident when the surface is pre-covered, resulting in a substantial 70% reduction in OP adsorption compared to bare goethite. The sequence of goethite binding affinity to P and OM underscores a higher affinity of CIT and HIS compared to OP and GP, suggesting that OM can effectively compete with both OP and GP and replace them at the surface. In contrast, the impact of OM on IHP adsorption appears insignificant, as IHP exhibits a higher affinity than both CIT and HIS toward the goethite surface. The coverage of goethite surfaces with OM results in the blocking of active sites and the generation of an unfavorable electric potential and field, inhibiting anion adsorption and consequently reducing P binding. It is noteworthy that electrostatic interactions predominantly contribute more to the binding of P and OM to the surface compared to dispersion interactions.", "date": "2024-03-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this work, we report a biological study of the photoactivated chemotherapy compound Ru-STF31 in the glioblastoma cancer cell line U87MG. Ru-STF31 targets nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), an enzyme overexpressed in glioblastoma. Ru-STF31 is activated by red-light irradiation, which breaks a bond between the ruthenium-based caging group and the NAMPT inhibitor STF31, thereby releasing two photoproducts: the ruthenium cage and the cytotoxic inhibitor STF31. Ru-STF31 showed significantly higher solubility in water and anticancer efficacy compared with the free inhibitor STF-31. It also significantly decreased intracellular NAD+ levels not only in normoxic (21% O2) but also in hypoxic (1% O2) U87MG cells. Strikingly, NAD+ depletion by red light activation of Ru-STF31 in hypoxic U87MG cells could not be rescued by the addition of extracellular NAD+. Our data suggest an active role of the ruthenium photocage released by light activation.", "date": "2024-03-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, functions are highly-non-linear, so parameters from the model are strongly correlated, hence, releasing all parameters free for fitting may lead to data interpretation pitfalls. In this work, a correlative size is introduced in order to avoid numerical artifacts and simplify the comparison between samples. This correlative size is calculated from the intersection point between the Guinier and the Porod region, which estimates the radius of a given geometry placed at the same intersection point in the scattering momentum transfer q-axis. The correlative size can be considered a radius for spheroidal or cylindrical objects while a thickness for 2D materials. This methodology could be applied to follow in situ processes like precipitation or polymerization reactions which are usually affected by aggregation, and for the fast analysis of hierarchical structures, where the procedure was also tested for fractal-like structures", "date": "2024-03-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While drift tube (DT) IM-MS retains a direct link to the primary experimental method to derive CCS values, other IM technologies rely solely on external CCS calibration, posing challenges due to dissimilar chemical properties between lipids and calibrants. To address this, we introduce MobiLipid, a novel tool facilitating CCS quality control of IM-MS lipidomics workflows by internal standardization. MobiLipid utilizes a newly established DTCCSN2 library for uniformly (U)13C labeled lipids, derived from a U13C labeled yeast extract, containing 377 DTCCSN2 values. This automated open-source R markdown tool enables internal monitoring and straightforward compensation for CCSN2 biases. It supports lipid class- and adduct-specific CCS corrections, requiring only three U13C labeled lipids per lipid class-adduct combination across 10 lipid classes, without requiring additional external measurements. The applicability of MobiLipid is demonstrated for trapped IM (TIM)-MS measurements of an unlabeled yeast extract spiked with U13C labeled lipids. Monitoring the CCSN2 biases of TIMCCSN2 values compared to DTCCSN2 library entries utilizing MobiLipid resulted in mean absolute biases of 0.78% and 0.33% in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively. By applying the CCS correction integrated into the tool for the exemplary dataset, the mean absolute CCSN2 biases of 10 lipid classes could be reduced to approximately 0%.", "date": "2024-03-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our investigation involves a comparative analysis of the dumbbell model and the Stockmayer model, focusing on ion solvation and ion-ion correlations. We examine electrolytes containing symmetric monovalent salts dissolved in polar solvents while varying ion density and solvent polarity. Both models predict an augmented solvent coordination number around ions as solvent polarity increases, with the dumbbell solvent displaying a more pronounced effect. Notably, radial distribution functions (RDFs) between solvent and ions yield differing trends; Stockmayer models exhibit a non-monotonic relationship due to strong dipole-dipole interactions at higher polarity, while RDFs for ions and dumbbell solvents consistently rise. In response to increased solvent polarity, Stockmayer solvents within the ion's solvation shell undergo continuous dipole orientation shifts, whereas the dumbbell solvent predominantly adopts pointing-away dipole orientations, diminishing pointing-to orientations. This underscores the significance of the interplay between solvent molecular orientation and dipole rotation. Both models qualitatively predict ion pairing and clustering behaviors across varying solvent dipole strengths and salt concentrations. The Stockmayer solvent generally provides stronger electrostatic screening than the dumbbell solvent due to its neglect of the coupling between molecular orientation and dipole rotation.  What's more, at a high dipole moment regime, ion-ion correlations in Stockmayer solvent can become stronger with increasing dipole moment due to stronger solvent-solvent correlations.

Hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of feedstock alkenes are among the most straightforward and prominent approaches to C(sp3)-S bond formations. However, hydrothiolation of unactivated alkenes typically proceeds in an anti-Markovnikov fashion, and carbothiolation relied on three-component coupling strategies using highly reactive pre-functionalized electrophilic sulfur sources and nucleophilic carbon sources. While carbothiolation of alkenes with a single, bifunctional reagent represents a concise and streamlined synthetic strategy for -alkyl organosulfur compounds, it has not been reported. Herein, by strategically using heterolytic cleavage of C(sp3)\u2212S bond, we report a chemodivergent transfer-hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of alkenes with thioethers serving as bifunctional reagents. These catalytic systems can control the cleavage and reformation of strong C(sp3)\u2212S -bonds. The chemo-control is achieved through careful selection of the counteranion associated with the Rh-centre. Counteranions with relatively strong basicity and coordinating ability, such as TfO-, promote an unusual Markovnikov transfer-thiol-ene reaction. Conversely, less basic and non-coordinating counteranions, such as BF4-, enable an unprecedented thioether-ene reaction, directly adding thioethers across alkenes.

Structures studied herein include rhomboidal (r-), diamond (d-), and trapezoidal (t-) tetra-atomic molecules of the form Ge(x)C(4\u2212x) and Ge(x)Si(4\u2212x) , where x=0-4. The most promising structure for detection is r-Ge(2)C(2) via the \u03bd4 mode with a frequency of 802.7 cm\u22121 (12.5 \u03bcm) and an intensity of 307.2 km mol\u22121. Other molecules potentially detectable, i.e., through vibrational modes or rotational transitions, include r-Ge(3)C, r-GeSi(3), d-GeC(3), r-GeC(3), and t-Ge(2)C(2).

To \naddress this, we present a systematic study on the degradation of a series of polymer networks \nsynthesized via FRP and containing disulfide crosslinkers. Poly(methyl methacrylate) \n(PMMA), polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), and poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) \n(PDMAm) networks were synthesized under standardized polymerization conditions and \nsubjected to degradation by thiol-disulfide exchange.

In contrast, PMA and PDMAm networks were found not to degrade at any\ncrosslinking densities. By analysis of the polymerization kinetics, equilibrium swelling ratios\npre- and post- attempted degradation and theoretical studies, we show that the inability of the \nFRP networks to fully degrade results from the presence of microclusters that form due to the \nrapid polymerization and extensive intramolecular cyclization. These heterogeneous structures \ndo not swell, which prevents a small fraction of the disulfide bonds from being cleaved. \nFurthermore, degradability can be afforded to these networks by significantly reducing the \ninitial monomer concentration, however at the expense of effective crosslinking density, thus \nexplaining the literature discrepancies. Alternatively, strand-cleaving comonomers can be \nemployed instead of cleavable crosslinkers to make the FRP networks fully degradable.

Nevertheless, we report here the discovery of a reaction model occurring exclusively by H-atom QMT with residual primary H/D KIEs. A 2-hydroxyphenylnitrene, generated in N2 matrix, was found to isomerize to an imino ketone via sequential (domino) QMT involving anti to syn OH-rotamerization (the rate determining step) and [1,4]-H shift reactions. These sequential QMT transformations were also observed in the OD deuterated sample, and unexpected primary H/D KIEs between 3 and 4 were measured at 3 to 20 K. Analogous residual primary H/D KIEs were found in the anti to syn OH-rotamerization QMT of 2-cyanophenol in a N2 matrix.

Here, to the best of our knowledge, we showed computational identification of relevant fully inorganic ternary perovskites materials based on electronic structure calculations for the first time. Our first principles calculations were based on DFT as implemented in the VASP program. The identification is based on an efficient and reliable way of calculating semiconductor band gaps.

The complexes featuring pyrene-decorated isocyanides (Cu2 and Cu3) exhibit extended excited-state lifetimes resulting from triplet\u2013triplet energy transfer (TTET) between the short-lived charge-transfer excited state (3CT) and the long-lived pyrene-centered triplet state (3pyr). This TTET process is irreversible in Cu3, producing exclusively the 3pyr state, and in Cu2 the 3CT and 3pyr states are nearly isoenergetic, enabling reversible TTET and long-lived 3CT luminescence.

A challenge in developing this pleiotropic cytokine for clinical application is the construction of variants tailored for engagement with specific receptor IL-4R subunits, which are necessary for selective activation of specific signaling pathways to treat disease with minimum side effects. To establish a platform for preparation of tailored IL-4 variants, we developed a modular and flexible chemical synthesis of IL-4 and applied this approach to the preparation of (i) IL-4 variants that act as receptor antagonist due to presence of unnatural residues that block specific interactions, and (ii) photocaged and in vivo half-life extended IL-4 variants that can be conditionally activated using UV light, achieved by the incorporation of a photocaged Gln116 residue. We were able to show that these different cytokine variants elicit differential STAT5 or STAT6 phosphorylation in lymphocytes or neutrophils in vitro with just one amino acid substitution.

Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technologies represented by proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are potentially applicable for this purpose, but most existing TPD approaches leverage the ubiquitin-proteasome system or lysosomes, which are absent in mitochondria, and TPD in mitochondria (mitoTPD) remains little explored. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a bifunctional molecule comprising TR79, an activator of the mitochondrial protease complex caseinolytic protease P (ClpP), linked to desthiobiotin. This compound successfully induced the degradation of monomeric streptavidin (mSA) and its fusion proteins localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Furthermore, in cells overexpressing mSA fused to short transmembrane protein 1 (mSA-STMP1), which enhances mitochondrial fission, our mitochondrial mSA degrader restored the mitochondrial morphology by reducing the level of mSA-STMP1. A preliminary structure-activity relationship study indicated that a longer linker length enhances the degradation activity towards mSA.

Etherifications, characterized by derivatization of the O\u2013H bond, represent classical reactivity that has been modernized to include mild reactions conditions, diverse reaction partners, and high selectivities. Deoxygenative functionalizations, representing derivatization of the C\u2013O bond, enable the alcohol to act as a leaving group towards the formation of new C\u2013C bonds. Lastly, chain functionalization reactions are described, wherein the alcohol group acts as a mediator in formal C\u2013H functionalization reactions of the alkyl backbone.

The presented ML model (valid for contact angles >110\u00b0), in combination with a new automated image and contour processing approach, is shown to be more accurate than other methods when benchmarked against an experimental data-set, with an estimated error of 1 degree. The ML model is also two orders of magnitude faster at predicting contact angles than Young-Laplace fitting (the current best practice approach).

In this study, we systematically explore the surface relaxation characteristics of ten liquid adsorbates (cyclohexane, acetone, water, and seven alcohols, including ethylene glycol) confined within mesoporous silicas with pore sizes between 6 nm and 50 nm using low-field (12.7 MHz) two-dimensional 1H T1 \u2013 T2 relaxation measurements.

We further demonstrate that alkyl group transverse surface relaxivities correlate strongly with the alkyl/hydroxyl ratio of the adsorbates assessed, providing evidence for a simple, quantitative relationship between surface relaxivity and interfacial chemistry.

Choosing 12 representative structures, rescue experiments were performed following the tamoxifen-induced deletion of GPX4 in Pfa-1 cells to complement the pharmacological induction of ferroptosis with a genetic induction and the experiments were extended to the human epithelial lung adenocarcinoma cell line HCC827. To assess if the compounds act as radical trapping antioxidants (RTAs) that scavenge peroxy radicals which drive lipid peroxidation, a hallmark of ferroptotic cell death, we have used a fluorescence-enabled inhibited autoxidation (Fenix) assay. Mitochondria were identified as the site-of-action using an alkynylated benzodioxol probe together with a copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC)-based Alexa Fluor 488 imaging kit. Our SAR study has yielded insights into the substitution-dependent activity of benzodioxol, aniline and phenol groups as RTAs that inhibit ferroptosis which led to the design of MM-12-Urea as a new broadly applicable chemical probe. Since the investigated functional groups are common motifs in small molecule ligands or natural products, we highlight that it is worth testing their ability to act as RTAs to avoid a potentially compounding factor in their bioactivities.", "date": "2024-03-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Pyrene (Py), as the simplest dimer candidate, is a proper model for studying accurate structure-property relationships of aggregates. Herein, a series of Py and derivatives were systematically investigated. With a largely planar and conjugated conformation, Py shows anomalous aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics due to the oxygen quenching at the molecular level but turn-on fluorescence in the aggregate state because of the oxygen isolation. Although introducing substituents induces molecular motion and weakened luminescence in the molecular state, the impact of substituents on the aggregate-state photophysical properties enormously differs. A small and electron-conjugated substituent (-CHO) can generate long-range ordered dimer stacking, leading to redshifted and weakened emission. Meanwhile, the larger substituent (-CyA) can disrupt long-range stacking and result in discrete dimers, leading to blue-shifted but enhanced emission. Further, incorporating a natural and bulky alicyclic structure (-DAA) inhibits dimer formation and activates strong molecular motions in the crystalline state, resulting in the shortest wavelength and weakest emission. Interestingly, crystalline Py-DAA exhibits both mechanochromic and acidichromic properties, which can be synergistically applied in dynamic encryption-decryption. These results indicate that substituents significantly affect their fluorescent behaviors due to the complexity of aggregate structures. This work not only elucidates the unique AIE performance of Py for the first time but also applies it as an accurate model for regulating the aggregate structures, offering precise molecular design strategies for aggregate-state luminescent materials.", "date": "2024-03-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Dyes and Chromophores; Optical Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To address this, a novel passive dosing method was introduced in the 48 h-acute ecotoxicity test on Daphnia magna and compared to the conventional solvent-spiking method in terms of Cw stability and toxicity results. Among thirteen sorbent materials tested for their sorption capacity, polyethersulfone (PES) membrane was an optimal passive dosing reservoir, with equilibrium desorption of BACs to water achieved within 24 h. The Cw of BACs remained constant in both applied dosing methods during the test period. However, the Cw in solvent-spiking tests was lower than the nominal concentration for long-chain BACs, particularly at low exposure concentrations. Notably, the solvent-spiking tests indicated that the toxicity of BACs increased with alkyl chain length from C6 to 14, followed by a decline of toxicity from C14 to 18. In contrast, the passive dosing method displayed similar toxicity levels of BACs with C14\u201318, indicating higher toxicity of C16 and C18-BACs than inferred by the solvent spiking test.

The acridine dimer and trimer are thoroughly analysed on the basis of matrix-isolation spectroscopy over two spectral ranges and quantum chemical calculations, which agree well with each other. Thereby a novel structure of the acridine dimer is found, which disagrees with a previously reported one.

The one-electron oxidation potential and the hole delocalization have been analyzed for six DNA double strands that cover all possible binary combinations of nucleotides. The results have revealed that the one-electron oxidation potential decreases with respect to the single-stranded DNA, giving evidence that the greater rigidity of a double helix induces an increase in the capacity of storing the positive charge generated upon oxidation.

Essentially, researchers increase or decrease stringency through its influencers without defining and quantitating it. This study was motivated by our insight that while stringency may not be easily definable via its multiple influencers, it can be delineated by its effect: increasing stringency leads to a decrease in the normalized quantity of binders at the output of partitioning. Building on this insight, we introduce a measure of stringency called the Binder-to-Nonbinder Ratio (BNR) and derive an expression for its experimental determination using a single experimental tool: quantitative PCR. The outcomes of our theoretical analysis and the result of SELEX experiments targeting three distinct protein targets underscore the importance of maintaining a BNR significantly greater than zero to avoid SELEX failure due to excessive stringency \u2013 a principle that we term the SELEX non-failure criterion.

Leveraged on these findings, a conformationally rigid double-decker-type truxene with robust CPL properties at high temperatures was applied as an emitter in electroluminescence devices exhibiting CPL with a high g value.", "date": "2024-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Glycosaminoglycans such as heparin allow the capture of BMPs and their retention at the surface of biomaterials, at safe concentrations. Although heparin has strong affinities for BMP2 and BMP4, two important types of growth factors regulating bone and tissue repair, it remains difficult to embed stably at the surface of a broad range of biomaterials and degrades rapidly in vitro and in vivo. In this report, biomimetic poly(sulfopropyl methacrylate) (PSPMA) brushes are proposed as sulfated glycosaminoglycan mimetic interfaces for the stable capture of BMPs. The growth of PSPMA brushes via surface-initiated activator regenerated by electron transfer (SI-ARGET) polymerisation is investigated via ellipsometry, prior to characterisation of swelling and surface chemistry via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and FTIR. The capacity of PSPMA brushes to bind BMP2 and BMP4 is then characterised via surface plasmon resonance. BMP2 is found to anchor particularly stably and at high density at the surface of PSPMA brushes and a strong impact of the brush architecture on binding capacity is observed. These results are further confirmed using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, providing some insight into the mode of adsorption of BMPs at the surface of PSPMA brushes. Primary adsorption of BMP2, with relatively little infiltration is observed on thick dense brushes, implying this growth factor should be accessible for further binding of corresponding cell membrane receptors. Finally, to demonstrate the impact of PSPMA brushes for BMP2 capture, dermal fibroblasts were then cultured at the surface of functionalised PSPMA brushes. The presence of BMP2 and the architecture of the brush are found to have a significant impact on matrix deposition at corresponding interfaces. Therefore, PSPMA brushes emerge as attractive coatings for scaffold engineering and the stable capture of BMP2 for regenerative medicine applications.", "date": "2024-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Thin Films", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Our first-principles study examines the redox behavior of transition metals and O in Ni-rich NMC cathodes as a function of (de)lithiation.   We use ab initio multiple scattering, density-functional theory (DFT) based core-loss spectroscopy, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to give a many-body treatment of both dynamic and static correlations.  Despite Ni, Mn, and Co K-edges calculated using ab initio multiple scattering based on Green's functions showing an excellent match with experimentally obtained X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES), we demonstrate that the ionic model of ascribing shifts in the XANES spectra to changes in metal oxidation states is inappropriate.  We show that in these cases, which are characterised by strong covalency between the transition metal and oxygen, DMFT calculations based on Wannier projections are essential to calculate charges and hence assign oxidation states accurately.  Due to the corresponding charge transfer from O p to Ni d, a ligand hole forms on O in Ni-rich regions. The individual Ni charge remains fairly constant throughout the charging/discharging process, particularly in Ni-rich environments in the material. In contrast, O has dual redox behavior, showing greater involvement in redox in Ni-rich regions while showing negligible redox involvement in Ni-poor regions.   The Ni-O covalent system starts participating in redox around a state of delithiation of ~17%, which represents, in our system, the beginning of charge.  Contrary to previous DFT calculations, we show that Co oxidation does not occur at the very end of charge but rather starts at an earlier state of delithiation of ~67%. The dual behaviour of O in terms of participation in the redox process helps explain the overall higher relative stability of lower Ni content NMCs compared to Ni-rich NMCs or LiNiO_2 in terms of O loss and evolution of singlet oxygen.", "date": "2024-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

After its namesake first reaction, H6H couples the newly installed C6-bonded oxygen to C7 to form the epoxide of scopolamine. Oxoiron(IV) (ferryl) intermediates initiate both reactions by cleaving C\u2013H bonds, but it remains unclear how the enzyme switches target site and promotes (C6)O\u2013C7 coupling in preference to C7 hydroxylation in the second step. In one possible epoxidation mechanism, the C6 oxygen would \u2013 analogously to mechanisms proposed for the Fe/2OG halogenases and, in a parallel study, N-acetylnorloline synthase (LolO) \u2013 coordinate as alkoxide to the C7\u2013H-cleaving ferryl intermediate to enable alkoxyl coupling to the ensuing C7 radical. Here we provide structural and kinetic evidence that H6H instead exploits the distinct spatial dependencies of competitive C\u2013H-cleavage (C6 vs C7) and C\u2013O-coupling (oxygen rebound vs cyclization) steps to promote the two-step sequence without substrate coordination or repositioning for the epoxidation step. Structural comparisons of ferryl-mimicking vanadyl complexes of wild-type H6H and a variant that preferentially 7-hydroxylates instead of epoxidizing 6\u03b2-hydroxyhyoscyamine suggest that only a modest (~ 10\u00b0) shift in the Fe\u2013O\u2013H(C7) approach angle is sufficient to change the outcome. The observation that, in wild-type H6H, \u00b2H\u2082O solvent also increases the C7-hydroxylation:epoxidation ratio by ~ 8-fold implies that the latter outcome requires cleavage of the alcohol O-H bond, which, unlike in the LolO oxacyclization, is not accomplished in advance of C\u2013H cleavage.", "date": "2024-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among these organisms, Renilla luciferase (RLuc), derived from the sea pansy Renilla reniformis, is notable for its blue light emission, making it one of the promising candidates for bioluminescent tagging. Our study focuses on RLuc8, a modified variant of RLuc characterized by eight amino acid substitutions. Recent findings have illuminated that its luminescent emitter, coelenteramide, is capable of existing in multiple protonation states. These states may significantly be influenced by adjacent proton acceptor residues at the enzyme's active site, highlighting the complex interplay between the protein structure and its bioluminescent activity. Herein employing the Quantum Mechanical Consistent Force Field (QCFF/PI) method and the semi-macroscopic Protein Dipole-Langevin Dipole method with Linear Response Approximation (PDLD/S-LRA), we show that the phenolate state of coelenteramide in RLuc8 is the predominant light-emitting species, corroborating experimental results. Our calculations also demonstrate that proton transfer from neutral coelenteramide to Asp162 is integral to the bioluminescence mechanism. Furthermore, our calculations reproduce the observed emission maximum for the amide anion in RLuc8-D120A mutant. In the case of RLuc8-D162A, we predicted that the pyrazine anion, existing in the presence of a Na+ counterion, has an emission maximum consistent with experimental data, suggesting its primary role as potential emitter. Additionally, our calculations on the engineered AncFT-D160A enzyme, structurally similar to RLuc8-D162A but with a significantly blue-shifted emission peak, show that the emission peak of its neutral form of the emitter agrees well with observed data. This agreement may explain the variations in observed emission peaks.

A wide variety of living organisms are constantly being exposed to these chemicals, most of which generate toxic effects. Due to the lack of experimental toxicity data of environmental chemicals, there arises a need to fill data gaps by in silico approaches. One of the most commonly used in silico approaches for toxicity assessment of small datasets is the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), which generates predictive models for the efficient prediction of query compounds. However, the predictions from these models are often erroneous for some compounds, and the reliability of the predictions from QSARs derived from small datasets is often questionable from a statistical point of view. This is due to the presence of a larger number of descriptors as compared to the number of training compounds, which reduces the degree of freedom of the developed model. To reduce the overall prediction error for a particular QSAR model, we have proposed here the computation of the novel Arithmetic Residuals in K-groups Analysis (ARKA) descriptors. We have reduced the number of modeling descriptors, keeping the entire chemical space and preventing the loss of chemical information. We have used here five representative environmentally relevant endpoints (skin sensitization, earthworm toxicity, milk/plasma partitioning, algal toxicity, and rodent carcinogenicity of hazardous chemicals) with graded responses to which the ARKA framework was applied for classification modeling. On comparing the performance of the models generated using conventional QSAR descriptors and the ARKA descriptors, the prediction quality of the models derived from ARKA descriptors was found much better than the models derived from QSAR descriptors signifying the potential of ARKA descriptors in ecotoxicological classification modeling of small data sets. For the ease of users, a Java-based expert system has been developed that computes the ARKA descriptors from the input of QSAR descriptors.

Here, the accuracy of DFT methods for spin\u2013state splittings in iron porphyrin is assessed by  probing the ability to correctly predict the ground states for  six Fe(III) or Fe(II) complexes experimentally  characterized in solid state. For each case, molecular and periodic DFT calculations are employed to quantify the effect of porphyrin  side substituents and the crystal packing effect (CPE) on the spin\u2013state splitting. It is proposed to partition the total CPE into additive components, the direct and structural one, the importance of which is shown to significantly vary from case to case. By knowing the substituent effect, the CPE, and the Gibbs free energy thermodynamic correction from calculations, one can  employ the experimental ground-state information in order to derive a quantitative constraint on the electronic energy difference for a simplified (porphin) model of the experimentally characterized  metalloporphyrin. The constraints derived in such a way\u2014in the form of single or double inequalities\u2014are used to assess the accuracy of dispersion-corrected DFT methods for 6 spin\u2013state splittings of  [Fe(III)(P)(2-MeIm)2]+, [Fe(III)(P)(2-MeIm)]+, [Fe(II)(P)(THF)2] and [Fe(II)(P)] models (where P is  porphin,  2-MeIm is 2-methylimidazole, THF is tetrahydrofuran). These data  constitute the new benchmark set of spin states for crystalline iron porphyrins (SSCIP6).  The highest accuracy is obtained in the case of double-hybrid  functionals (B2PLYP-D3, DSD-PBEB95-D3), whereas hybrid functionals, especially those with reduced admixture of the  exact exchange (B3LYP*-D3, TPSSh-D3), are found to considerably  overstabilize the intermediate spin state, leading to incorrect  ground-state prediction in Fe(III) porphyrins. The present approach, which can be generalized to other transition metal complexes, is not only useful in method  benchmarking, but also sheds light on the interpretations of experimental data for  metalloporphyrins, which are important  models to understand the electronic properties of heme proteins.", "date": "2024-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Therefore, assessing and ensuring drinking water supply is a critical task in modern society. Conventional approaches to analyzing and controlling drinking water quality are labor-intensive and costly with a low throughput. Machine learning (ML) is an alternative, promising technique to assess and ensuring safe drinking water supply. Existing reviews have summarized the applications of ML in safe drinking water supply from different aspects. However, a state-of-the-art, comprehensive review is missing that focuses on applying ML to monitor, simulate, predict, and control drinking water quality, especially in municipal engineered water systems. This review, therefore, critically compiles the applications of ML in assessing and ensuring water quality in engineered water systems. To be comprehensive, we also cover the applications of ML in other drinking-water-related settings such as water sources and water purification processes. We explain the basic mechanics and workflows of ML, focusing on the applications of ML to access and control key factors or etiologies in drinking water from the physical, chemical, and microbiological aspects. Those factors or etiologies affect water quality and public health, such as water pipeline failures, disinfectant by-products, heavy metals, opportunistic pathogens, biofilms, and antimicrobial resistance genes. We then illustrate the distribution of ML models across research topics in safe drinking water supply. Finally, we discuss the challenges and outlooks for the applications of machine learning in safe drinking water supply.

As adoption and implementation of this tool continues, a desire to implement test strips for other drugs may emerge. However, since these strips are designed for urine testing, it is important to understand their applicability to testing drugs themselves.

At low ppm levels, NO2 saturates the PC surface within 10 minutes and the perturbations to the surface are constant over time during the flow of NO2. Upon removal of NO2 flow, and under atmospheric pressures, these interactions are reversible, and the liquid surface structure of PC recovers completely within 30 min.

Sourced either from plants, algae, or bacteria, nanocellulose can be processed into colloid, gel, film and fiber forms. However, the required fundamental understanding of process parameters that govern the morphology and structure-property relationships of nanocellulose systems, from colloidal suspensions to bulk materials, has not been developed and generalized for all forms of cellulose.  This further hinders the more widespread adoption of this biopolymer in applications. Our study investigates the dispersion of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) produced by a bacterial-yeast co-culture, in solvents, highlighting the role of thermodynamic interactions in influencing their colloidal behavior.  By adjusting Hansen solubility parameters, we controlled the thermodynamic relationship between CNFs and solvents across various concentrations, studying the dilute to semi-dilute regimes. Rheological measurements revealed that the threshold at which a concentration-based regime transition occurs is distinctly solvent-dependent.  Complementing rheological analysis with small angle X-ray scattering and zeta potential measurements, our findings reveal that enhancing CNF-solvent interactions increases excluded volume in the dilute regime, emphasizing the importance of the balance between fiber-fiber and fiber-solvent interactions. Moreover, we investigated the transition from colloidal to solid state by creating films from dispersions with varying interaction parameters in semi-dilute regimes.  Through mechanical testing and scanning electron microscopy imaging of the fracture surfaces, we highlight the significance of electrokinetic effects in such transitions, as dispersions with higher electrokinetic stabilization gave rise to stronger and tougher films despite having less favorable thermodynamic interaction parameters.

Polaritons provide a versatile platform for investigating quantum electrodynamics effects in chemical systems, such as polariton-altered chemical reactivity. However, using polaritons in chemical contexts will require a better understanding of the photophysical properties of polaritons, especially at ambient temperature and pressure, where chemistry is typically performed. Here, we investigated leveraging strong light-matter interactions to control the excited state dynamics of colloidal CdSe nanoplatelets (NPLs) coupled to a Fabry-P\u00e9rot optical cavity. Importantly, changes in the cavity quality (Q) factor, which is a measure of photon loss from the cavity, were used to profoundly change the polariton dynamics. As the Q-factor was increased, we observed significant population of the upper polariton (UP) state, exemplified by the rare observation of substantial UP photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. In fact, with low energy excitation at the lower polariton (LP), which is not absorbed by uncoupled nanoplatelets, we observed upconverted PL emission from the UP branch, due to efficient exchange of population between the LP, UP and the reservoir of dark states present in collectively coupled polaritonic systems. Critical physical insight into the mechanism of PL enhancement of the UP, and PL upconversion, was provided by state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations that account for multiple cavity electromagnetic modes and cavity loss. In addition, by resolving lower and upper polariton PL lifetimes, we found timescales for polariton dynamics on the order of 100 picoseconds, implying great potential for NPL based polariton systems to affect photochemical reaction rates.

This study explores the efficacy of three free-base Zr porphyrin metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) - namely MOF-525, MOF-545, and NU-902 - as sensitive materials for QCM-based humidity sensors. Our extended experimental findings reveal that these materials exhibit notable sensitivity, particularly within relative humidity ranges of 40% to 100%. However, we observe potential irreversible adsorption sites within the MOF-545 framework, hindering its ability to revert to its initial state after prolonged exposure. In light of this observation, we conduct periodic cycling experiments at relative humidity levels of 40-70% to evaluate the measurement repeatability and feasibility of these sensors for indoor applications. Interestingly, the periodic cycling study demonstrates that MOF-545 shows promising repeatability, positioning it as a strong contender for indoor humidity sensing. In contrast, MOF-525 may necessitate extended desorption time, and NU-902 displays diminished sensitivity at low relative humidity levels. Nevertheless, a preliminary treatment of the MOF-545 QCM sensor may be necessary to address irreversible adsorption sites and uphold measurement repeatability, as only reversible adsorption sites are currently accessible. This study underscores the potential of MOF-based QCM sensors for effective humidity monitoring in indoor environments, thus facilitating improved comfort and environmental control.", "date": "2024-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Organometallic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To complement existing implementations for ground-state properties and excitation energies, we present the extension of the Gaussian and augmented plane wave method to excited-state nuclear gradients within the CP2K program package. Benchmarks for a test set of 35 small molecules demonstrate that maximum errors in the nuclear forces for excited states of singlet and triplet spin multiplicity are smaller than 0.1 eV/\u00c5. The method is furthermore applied to the calculation of the zero-phonon line of defective hexagonal boron nitride. This spectral feature is reproduced with an error of 0.2 eV in comparison to GW-Bethe-Salpeter reference computations and of 0.4 eV in comparison to experimental measurements. Accuracy assessments and applications thus demonstrate the potential use of the outlined developments for large-scale applications on excited-state properties of extended systems.", "date": "2024-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A pro-found understanding of some of the elementary steps leading to the intricate 4e\u2212/4H+ reduction of O2 is presently lacking. A St = 1 FeIII\u2212(O22\u2212)\u2212CuII (IP) intermediate is proposed to reduce the overpotentials associated with the reductive O\u2212O bond rupture by allowing electron transfer from a tyrosine moiety without the necessity of any spin-surface crossing. Direct evidence of the in-volvement of IP in the HCO catalytic cycle is, however, missing. A number of heme-copper peroxido complexes have been pre-pared as synthetic models of IP; but all of them possess the catalytically non-relevant St = 0 ground state resulting from antiferro-magnetic coupling between the S = 1/2 FeIII and CuII centers. In a complete non-heme approach, we now report the spectroscopic characterization and reactivity of the FeIII\u2212(O22\u2212)\u2212CuII intermediates 1 and 2, which differ only by a single \u2212CH3 versus \u2212H sub-stituent on the central amine of the tridentate ligands binding to copper. Complex 1 with an end-on peroxido core, and ferromag-netically (St=1) coupled FeIII and CuII centers performs H-bonding mediated O\u2212O bond cleavage in presence of phenol to generate oxoiron(IV), copper(II) and PhO\u2022. In contrast, the side-on peroxide complex 2, with a St = 0 ground-state is unreactive towards phenol. Thus, the implications for spin topology contributions to O\u2212O bond cleavage, as proposed for the heme FeIII\u2212(O22\u2212)\u2212CuII intermediate in CcO, can be extended to non-heme chemistry.", "date": "2024-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Small Molecule Activation (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here, the success of transfer learning in resolving the challenges with limited dataset was exploited. A two-step data-driven ML modeling framework named ImputeNet involving training with ML-imputed datasets and then with clean dataset was explored. Through data imputation and transfer learning, it is possible to develop data-driven model with acceptable metrics mirroring experimental measurement. Using the model, optimization studies using genetic algorithm were implemented to analyze the solution in the pareto optimal.

Often, many spectral models have a similar goodness of fit, and distinguishing between them can be impossible without additional information. A further challenge is found in interpreting spectra from samples consisting of multiple chemical compounds. We show here how correlation analysis can be used to interpret large XPS datasets. Correlations in atomic concentrations and binding energies of core lines can be interpreted within a framework of an underlying chemical model and this can yield additional information compared with analysis of each spectrum individually. We give examples of the usage of this analysis on some simple systems, and discuss the potential and limitations of the technique.", "date": "2024-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Spectroscopy (Anal.

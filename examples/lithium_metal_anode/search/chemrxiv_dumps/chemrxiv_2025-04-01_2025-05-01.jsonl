Through an overhaul of the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE), we show that hydroxide ions do adsorb on many late transition metals even under negative bias. This is even so on metals like Cu and Pt, where the OH* binding energy is energetically uphill relative to H2O (l).

A photocrosslinkable group (phenyl azide) and hydrophilic groups were also incorporated to form a hydrogel. Coatings of these polymers produced by spin coating and subsequent photocrosslinking were characterised by laser ellipsometry, which yielded controlled dry layer thicknesses in the range 40 to 140 nm. Furthermore, the swelling capacity was investigated by in-situ ellipsometry in different aqueous media, resulting in a swelling up to three times the original dry film thickness, depending on their crosslinker content.

However, the properties and functions of intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies are largely underexplored. This work unveiled a facile strategy for engineering IDP assemblies. We demonstrate that conjugating a structured motif derived from a protein's phosphorylation site to a self-assembling tripeptide unexpectedly yields self-assembled nanofibers with intrinsic disorder. Specifically, by using glycine linker to attach a pentapeptide derived from a phosphorylation site within a random coil region of SRC kinase to the C-terminus of a widely used self-assembling enabler, we generated a phosphorylated octapeptide. The octapeptide exhibits cell compatibility and forms a hydrogel upon dephosphorylation. Cryo-electron microscopy structural analysis of the nanofibers reveals that the peptides adopt two types of helical arrangements, but exhibit intrinsic disorder at the periphery of the nanofibers. The hydrogels exhibit decreased protein adsorption with increasing peptide concentration. This study represents the first instance of a structured random coil within a protein transitioning into an intrinsically disordered state within self-assembled peptide nanofibers, expanding the pool of peptide sequences for IDPs and providing valuable insights for engineering of peptide nanofibers with intrinsic disorder for the development of cell compatible biomaterials.", "date": "2025-04-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To test this assumption, we employ a grid search and Latin hypercube sampling approach to design experimental combinations of additive weight percentages. We employ high-throughput robotic systems for automating the experiments and a YOLO-based image analysis workflow for determining the degree of solubilization.

Advances in recombinant protein engineering have led to the development of therapeutic antibodies with multi-specific attributes and increasingly complex structural and functional formats. The discovery workflow involves high-throughput screening of critical quality attributes using liquid chromatography (LC) to optimize cell line development and facilitate drug candidate selection. However, several LC techniques, such as Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC), are not directly compatible with Electrospray Ionization (ESI), hindering mass spectrometry (MS)-based identification of impurity peaks. Consequently, significant time and effort are often required to adapt these method conditions to ESI-MS, which slows down discovery efforts. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) is a surface-based ionization technique that offers an attractive alternative to ESI for high-throughput screening due to its rapid analysis times and resistance to buffer/matrix interferences. MALDI-MS is highly compatible with automated liquid handling tools for sample transfer and requires minimal sample volume. To address the increasingly complex needs and challenging timelines of next-generation biologics development, we have developed an LC-MALDI-MS offline approach for rapid peak identification using an LC-fraction collector and MALDI-TOF-MS. This streamlined approach is adaptable to multiple chromatographic techniques, regardless of their inherent MS compatibility, and is suitable for automation. The workflow is versatile and can be applied universally in combination with various chromatographic techniques and analytes, including monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, fusion proteins, and peptides. Importantly, fraction collection and MS data acquisition can be completed within hours without the need for additional method development or sample preparation for MS-based measurements.

This is influenced by side reactions such as recombination and disproportionation. The rates of these reactions are difficult to assess due to the transient nature of the radical intermediates.

Their potential in rational enzyme engineering makes them valuable for the synthesis of diverse C-glycosides. However, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear. To address this, we investigated the C-glycosylation of phloretin catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase GgCGT in the presence of the coenzyme UDP-glucose. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a cluster model, we identified the most favorable pathway for C-glycosylation. The reaction proceeds via an initial proton transfer from phloretin to UDP-glucose, followed by the nucleophilic attack of phloretin on the glucose moiety and subsequent dissociation of UDP in an SN2-like manner. The SN2 step yields non-aromatic intermediate, which can be rapidly converted to C-glycoside even without an enzymatic environment. The key residue that facilitates the rate-determining SN2 step is His-27, which stabilizes phloretin via hydrogen bonding. Additionally, to clarify why alternative products such as O-glycosides are not formed, we also investigated the O-glycosylation pathway. Our calculations revealed that O-glycosylation was promoted by proton transfer from UDP-glucose, like C-glycosylation, but was suppressed by structural fixation due to hydrogen bonding among phloretin, glucose, and GgCGT.

Accordingly, a dysregulated zinc homeostasis is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, we report the method of isopotential electron titration (IET), an approach that directly measures charge transfer between adsorbates and catalytic surfaces. Charge transfer between Pt and adsorbed hydrogen adatoms was investigated using a catalytic condenser architecture, where the Pt surface was separated from a p-type silicon layer by a hafnia dielectric film. By forcing the Pt and Si layers into isopotential conditions, excess charge resulting from transfer between adsorbate and Pt surface was titrated through an external circuit. Hydrogen atoms donated electrons to Pt upon adsorption, adopting a partial positive charge on the surface, which was quantitatively reversed upon their thermal desorption from the surface. Across a temperature range of 125 -200 \u00b0C and hydrogen partial pressures of 0.005 - 1 atm, consistent with a surface hydrogen fractional coverage of 80-100%, the charge transferred to Pt by an adsorbed H atom was measured to be 1.89 \u00b1 0.05 mmol e- mol Pt-1. Bader charge analysis of the extent of charge transfer was comparable to experimental measurements, with a calculated net donation of 4 mmol e- mol Pt-1 by adsorbed hydrogen.

In the case of aqueous-based CO2 absorbents, which have been identified as the basis for one of the most promising and scalable DAC approaches, a large energetic penalty is associated with heating and boiling off water, as required for solvent regeneration in a conventional thermal-swing DAC process. This could be avoided by employing alternative solvent regeneration methods based on electrochemical or photochemical pH swings. Photochemical approaches involving photoacids or photobases are particularly promising, as they offer the prospect for using abundant and renewable solar energy, though efficient solvent regeneration and recycling in a realistic multi-cycle DAC process remains challenging. Here, we report a photochemically-driven DAC process (photo-DAC) in which atmospheric CO2 capture by an aqueous oligopeptide, i.e., glycylglycine (GlyGly), is enabled through a pH swing by a guanidine photobase, i.e., pyridine-substituted diiminoguanidine (PyDIG). Upon irradiation with UV light, the PyDIG photobase undergoes photoisomerization from the E,E to the Z,Z isomer, corresponding to a pKa increase of 2.8 units that activates GlyGly for DAC through deprotonation. After the GlyGly/PyDIG solvent is saturated with atmospheric carbon dioxide, leaving it in the dark under ambient conditions leads to isomerization of PyDIG from the Z,Z back to the E,E isomer, which is accompanied by a pH drop and CO2 release. To demonstrate the recyclability of the GlyGly/PyDIG solvent, we have completed three consecutive DAC cycles, with a measured average cyclic capacity in the range of 0.21\u20130.26 mols CO2 per mol of GlyGly/PyDIG, and minimal loss in efficiency from one cycle to another.

This study employs transient numerical simulations to investigate the effectiveness of passive controllers of varying sizes in managing cavitation and explores their subsequent impact on the performance of a cambered NACA 4412 (base) hydrofoil with fixed trailing edge modifications. Here NACA stands for National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The passive controllers tested are arc-shaped pimples with radii of 2 mm, 1 mm, and 0.5 mm, strategically placed on the suction surface of the cambered section with a circular trailing edge of 0.5 mm radius. These hydrofoils are referred to as pimpled R1, pimpled R2, and pimpled R3. The investigation covers sheet and cloud cavitation regimes at cavitation numbers ranging from 0.92 to 1.6, with an angle of attack of 8\u00b0. The study evaluates the effectiveness of different sizes of passive controllers in controlling cavitation and their impact on hydrofoil performance, including transient cavity evolution, total and time-averaged cavity volumes, and hydrodynamic performance parameters, both qualitatively and quantitatively.  The numerical simulations were conducted using a realizable \u03ba-\u03f5 turbulence model and the Zwart Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) cavitation model. The accuracy of these numerical predictions has been validated against available experimental results, showing strong agreement. The results demonstrate that all hydrofoils with passive controllers exhibit improved cavitation control compared to the NACA4412(base) hydrofoil in all cavitating regimes. Among the tested pimples, R1 significantly reduces transient cavity evolution, time-averaged cavity volume, and cavity length, while also achieving the lowest drag coefficient (Cd). Although R2 and R3 also show improvements, R1 proves to be the most effective. However, the enhanced cavitation control and drag reduction associated with R1 are accompanied by a cost of reduced lift coefficient (Cl), with R1 exhibiting the lowest lift performance.

Our approach starts with a fractional factorial design as the initial sampling strategy to quantify independent and interpretable variable effects and their interactions. We show how these resource-efficient designs can be easily complemented with few additional experiments to identify more complicated behavior using a formal statistical test and how these tests indicated that a linear interaction model was likely not sufficient at reliably estimating the changes in airlaid properties.

However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the mechanisms of phosphate selectivity and influence of competing ions, hindering needed efforts to model adsorption dynamics and design scalable adsorption processes for varying wastewaters. To address these gaps, we integrated aqueous-phase adsorption analysis with solid-phase, synchrotron-based X-ray characterization; this integration facilitated elucidation of the distribution and speciation of iron, phosphate, and competing anions on HAIX resins. We compared a quaternary ammonium-functionalized HAIX resin (SBA) to a tertiary amine version (WBA) to determine the role of functional groups.

Using micro-X-ray fluorescence (\u03bc-XRF) and micro-X-ray absorption near-edge structure (\u03bc-XANES) spectroscopy, we identified differences in where and how phosphate binds across resin types and wastewaters. Across wastewater compositions, FeOnp sites in WBA contribute more to phosphate adsorption than in SBA, possibly due to variations in Fe distribution and speciation. Phosphate adsorption densities calculated from quantitative \u03bc-XRF maps matched those from aqueous analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of this integrated approach.

We show that conditioning neural network-based models on trainable embedding vectors can effectively account for quantitative differences between methods. This allows for joint training on multiple datasets that would otherwise be incompatible. Therefore, this procedure circumvents the need for re-computations at a unified level of theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training on multiple reference methods enables transfer learning between tasks, resulting in even lower errors compared to training on separate tasks alone. Furthermore, we show that this approach can be used for multi-fidelity learning, improving data efficiency for the highest fidelity by an order of magnitude. To test scalability, we train a single model on a joint dataset compiled from 10 disjoint subsets of the MultiXC-QM9 dataset generated by different reference methods.

Herein, we propose a new strategy that successfully overcomes these limitations through using an electron-donating motif to modulate NO-affinitive catalysts, thereby creating dual active site with synergistic functionality. Specifically, we integrate electron-donating nanoparticles into a Fe single-atom catalyst (FeSAC), where Fe sites ensure strong NO adsorption, while electron-donating motifs promote water dissociation and NO hydrogenation. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), and theoretical calculations reveal that electron-donating motifs increase Fe site electron density, strengthening NO adsorption. Additionally, these motifs also promote water dissociation, supplying protons to lower the NO hydrogenation barrier. This synergistic interplay enables a cascade reaction mechanism, delivering a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3% and a NH3 yield rate of 709.7 \u00b5g h-1 mgcat.-1 under 1.0 vol% NO in neutral media, outperforming pure FeSAC (NH3 yield rate: 444.2 \u00b5g h-1 mgcat.-1, FE: 56.6%) and prior high-NO-concentration systems.

A promising approach is redox sorbent-based electrochemically induced DAC, which operates at ambient conditions with significantly lower energy costs while utilizing clean electricity. However, the oxygen sensitivity of redox sorbents remains a major challenge. Thus, the feasibility of achieving electrochemically induced DAC with redox sorbents remains uncertain. Despite the vast difference in partial pressures between carbon dioxide (CO2) and molecular oxygen (O2) in air, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate in plant leaves can preferentially react with CO2 in the sunlight, thus achieving the net CO2 removal. Motivated by the nature-based DAC solution, we hereby developed an aqueous-soluble oxygen-tolerant fluoflavine disulfonate (FFDS) sorbent for DAC. Electrochemical characterizations, spectroscopic studies, along with theoretical calculations, reveal that FFDS undergoes proton-coupled electron transfer and exhibits a redox potential higher than the two-electron transfer oxygen reduction potential. When exposed to simulated flue gas containing 10% O2, the FFDS sorbent demonstrates reversible CO2 capture and release with an average CO2/e molar ratio of 0.88. Implemented for both indoor and outdoor DAC in Singapore, FFDS sorbent shows stable cycling performance over 40 days with a three-day DAC under the normal discharge-charge mode, and exhibits an enhanced CO2 capture capacity and a Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99% with an accelerated overnight DAC under the deep discharge-charge mode. Doubling the concentration of FFDS leads to a twofold increase in CO2 capture/release capacity, regardless of whether the three-day DAC is conducted indoors or outdoors.

Using methyl methacrylate (MMA) as a case study, the framework examines the EoL supply and management chain for plastic-related chemicals, leveraging publicly available regulatory data to identify potential chemical redistribution, environmental releases, and EoL exposure scenarios. The analysis finds potential inter-EoL transfers, where chemicals transition between EoL activities before disposal or reuse, potentially leading to unintended environmental releases. Other chemicals detected alongside MMA in EoL streams (co-occurring chemicals) suggest contamination in recycled materials, unintentional environmental releases during recycling, and releases from wastewater treatment systems. However, data limitations and reporting variability introduce uncertainties that may affect chemical tracking accuracy. This study underscores the need to integrate facility, process, and equipment-level data to address these challenges to refine environmental release estimates and exposure assessments.

However, the inherently low surface area of these ceramic materials poses a significant limitation to their catalytic application. Against this background, this study reveals that loading a very small amount of Pd species onto Sr3Ti2O7, which is a ceramic material synthesized by calcination at 1273 K, leads to the epitaxial bonding of Pd oxide based on the space group of Fm3m to the ab surface of Sr3Ti2O7. Interestingly, the Pd oxide particle with particle sizes in the range of 2\u20135 nm has a superperiodic structure, where ordered and disordered Pd atoms are cyclically repeated in the a-axial direction of Sr3Ti2O7. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the charge transfer from Sr3Ti2O7 to Pd oxide facilitates the formation of an epitaxial junction and causes structural fluctuations in Pd oxide. The Pd/Sr3Ti2O7 catalyst with a unique heterojunction exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the purification of automotive exhaust gases. In addition, the Pd/Sr3Ti2O7 catalyst is more active than the benchmark Pd/Al2O3 catalyst despite its low surface area of only 2 m2 g-1. This study demonstrates that metal oxide-based ceramics can be used as catalyst materials by precisely designing their heterojunctions.

The chemical environment of the catalytic process and the kinetics of structural changes create configurations of typically unknown local geometries and chemistry.

Here, we use experimental data together with a focused artificial-intelligence (AI) approach based on subgroup discovery and symbolic regression to model the evolution of the catalyst reactivity with time on stream. We consider palladium-based alloys synthesized mechanochemically and applied in the selective hydrogenation of concentrated acetylene streams resulting from a hypothetical electric plasma-assisted methane-to-ethylene process. Our AI approach starts with the identification of descriptions of materials and reaction conditions relevant to acetylene conversion. Then, a model for time-on-stream-dependent selectivity focused on situations associated to noticeable acetylene conversion is obtained by the sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator (SISSO) approach. Our AI approach identifies relationships between the measured catalyst reactivity and only few, key parameters, from 21 measured and calculated bulk, surface, and mesoscopic materials' properties and reaction parameters offered as candidate descriptive parameters.

A total of 2159 positive-mode and 3609 negative-mode suspect chemical features were matched against our plastic chemical database, of which 1127/1530 (positive/negative) features were prioritized for targeted fragmentation analysis based on detection frequency (DF > 70%), peak area (> 5000 counts) accurate mass matching (ppm <=5 ppm). Suspect features were then annotated by MS/MS spectrum and retention time prediction. Differences in peak areas by demographic characteristics were also assessed. Among the 65 tentatively identified chemical features, three were candidates confirmed using reference standards: perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFAS compound), 8-hydroxyquinoline (antioxidant), and 1,3-diphenylguanidine (with multiple functions in rubber products). Notably, 62 tentatively identified chemicals were not previously reported in existing exposome databases, raising concerns about gaps in plastic chemical monitoring. In summary, our study highlights the potential of this suspect screening approach to identify and prioritize plastic chemical exposures during fetal development.

As a result, limitations of past chamber experiments and the incomplete understanding of their chemical conditions (e.g., the initiating oxidants, RO2 fate), may skew SOA representation in models. In this work, literature SOA chamber studies, specifically those referenced by the SOA scheme in the GEOS-Chem global model, are simulated using a modified version of the Master Chemical Mechanism. This enables explicit estimation of typically-unconstrained parameters which affect experimental outcomes, including the relative importance of different oxidants, and the relative loss of RO2 to different unimolecular and bimolecular processes. This work demonstrates that reaction conditions are dynamic, changing within and between experiments, and that many experimental conditions involve more than one oxidant or RO2 fate, complicating model parameterizations.

An attractive feature of synthetic fluorophores is their potential to access long wavelength excitation and emission profiles (>650 nm) that are difficult to achieve through genetically encoded methods like fluorescent proteins. Here, we present a new strategy to achieve excitation and emission above 650 nm: bis(trifluoromethyl)carborhodamine dyes, or BF dyes. In BF dyes, the geminal methyl groups of carborhodamines are replaced with trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups. This accomplishes two things. First, CF3 groups substantially red shift in the optical profile by over 90 nm compared to classic, oxygen-bridged rhodamine dyes, resulting in a dye framework with excitation and emission profiles >650 nm and high brightness (extinction coefficient >140,000 M-1cm-1 and fluorescent quantum yield of 33%). Second, CF3 groups render BF dyes fluorogenic, by shifting the position of the open-closed equilibrium of the colorless lactone and colored zwitterion form, resulting in up to 30-fold improvement in fluorogenicity compared to silicon-bridged rhodamines. In this paper, we present the design and computational analysis of BF dyes; synthetic studies to access over a dozen new BF dyes through a unique, late-stage functionalization strategy; spectra characterization; and applications in advanced fluorescence microscopy including no-wash intracellular labeling, functional imaging with chemigenetic indicators, and single molecule tracking in living cells.

In this study, we report the synthesis of a novel class of helical polymer nanotubes constructed via a scalable and highly homogeneous Suzuki-Miyaura cross-cou\u0002pling polymerization. The helical conformation of the nanotube backbone is stabilized by electrostatic repulsion between heteroatoms distributed along the helical axis or intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions.

Our results connect the observed SEI morphologies to specific observed SEI formation mechanisms. We directly detect formation of lithium ethoxide (LiEtO) as a major SEI component at potentials positive of Li plating when ethanol is used as the proton donor, which further reacts to form LiOH and Li2O depending on water availability, and regenerates ethanol. We show that in water-containing electrolytes, the SEI consists of a highly porous outer layer, which we propose is largely LiOH, and a denser inner layer, consisting largely of Li2O. We show that the water concentration relative to the ethanol concentration in the electrolyte can strongly influences the porosity of the SEI and that the porosity of the Li2O-rich layer could favour the transport of N2 over the proton donor thus improving N2 reduction selectivity.

Here a similar device is proposed for sequencing of single-stranded DNA. One end of a homonucleotide header is bound to a fixed surface and the other is attached to the strand; the surface is mounted on a platform in the cis chamber of an electrolytic cell (e-cell). The platform can be moved with a precision of 0.1-0.15 nm; movement times are ~1 \u03bcs. The free end of the DNA strand is threaded through the pore into the trans chamber of the e-cell; a voltage across the pore and hydraulic pressure ensure that the header-strand inside cis and the pore remains stretched at all times. Alternatively the trans end also can be tethered to a second platform through a homonucleotide trailer to allow coordinated stretching and moving of the full header-strand-trailer. The blockade current through the pore is measured over a desired period of time (\u2265 1 ms); the platform is retracted by 3.5 \u00c5; the process is repeated. With such stop-and-go control the measurement bandwidth can be as low as desired. A pore of length L \u00c5 holds M = \u2308L/3.5\u2309 bases, the M-th base can be determined from the measured blockade current and the preceding M-1 bases (obtained from the previous M-1 reads).

However, the sustainability of CAN-based composites has never been assessed, nor has that of thermoset PHUs. Herein, we perform a life cycle assessment of PHU, synergetic hybrid EP-PHU CANs, and epoxy in composite applications with either carbon or natural fibers (NF) in order to address their syntheses, processes, and recycling. We demonstrate that producing cyclic carbonate monomers from epoxy and supercritical CO2 could be advantageous. PHU provides potential environmental benefits to epoxy but is significantly limited by the energy inputs required for curing. Inversely, synergetic EP-PHU demonstrates noticeable environmental gain compared to EP and PHU-based composites and offers ideal recycling pathways. The chemical recovery of carbon fibers by oxidative depolymerization shows substantial benefits compared to virgin material production. When using natural fibers, mechanical recycling of CAN-based matrices is more suited due to the impacts of chemical recycling compared to virgin NF production, highlighting that the viability of a strategy strongly depends on raw material and cannot be generalized easily. Strategies to further enhance the sustainability of composites are also proposed and discussed.\n", "date": "2025-04-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Composites", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our results reveal that under acidic conditions marcasite CoSe2 undergoes slight surface corrosion, producing disordered [CoSe6] motifs with the active Se sites for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In contrast, during the alkaline HER, marcasite CoSe2 undergoes potential-driven restructuring from the initial reconstructed O-rich covered surface into the generation of metallic cobalt species as the true active species.

A holistic understanding of interfacial interactions and electronic structure of 2D materials with electrodes is far from complete, but is necessary for tailored electronic devices, including in memristors for neuromorphic computing. Here, we develop a computational protocol to study the hysteretic behavior and charge carrier transport mechanisms of the MoS2 /Au(111) junction under applied electric fields using first- principles calculations. We show that even in the absence of defects, formation of conducting bridges or significant atomic reconstruction, the pristine MoS2 /Au(111) junction shows hysteresis in the induced polarization, the electron barrier heights, and the carrier transport. A primary finding from our calculations is the modulation of the Schottky barrier and electron tunneling barrier as a mechanism behind the resistive switching mechanism of the pristine MoS2 /Au(111) junction. We also show that changes of interfacial dipole moments with exter- nal electric field contributes to the memory effect by lowering the electron barriers. Our results indicate that in the absence of defects, electric-field induced relaxation of the interlayer spacing and clustering of Mo-atoms provides the means for spontaneous polarization.

In this context, Raman-responsive ratiometric sensors will be key players affording the imaging and quantification of bio-analytes in living cells. A major challenge however is low Raman scattering cross-sections of alkynes/nitriles, leading to either probes with low sensitivity or reliance on stimulated Raman imaging which is not widely-accessible. Raman-responsive ratiometric probes that leverage the narrow peak-widths of Raman tags and can function in the accessible Raman scattering-based imaging platform have therefore remained elusive. To overcome these challenges, we have systematically designed a series of mono-alkyne-based probes that have computed Raman-scattering activities (RSA) 13-34 times that of the benchmark Raman probe 5-Ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine.

Sodium valproate, one of the most effective antiepileptic drugs, was first approved for medical use in 1967. However, the structure of its anhydrous form has remained unresolved. This is because it was difficult to grow crystals of sufficient size for single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD).  Although 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) can be used for studying crystals too small for SCXRD, the crystals of anhydrous sodium valproate are extremely sensitive to both humidity and electron beams. They degrade quickly both in air and under electron beam at room temperature.

Drawing inspiration from the concept of deformable container expansion, this paper presents a computational method for determining the morphology of supramolecular cage cavities based on the \u201cinflating balloon\u201d metaphor (CMCC). First, through experimental examination of supramolecular cages, we take the center of mass as the origin of expansion and create probe vertices via subdivision surfaces.

The Li-ion solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the most researched electrolytes in the field due to its high ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and wide voltage stability window. Despite its potential, the nature of the impurity and surface phases formed during the synthesis of LLZO and their role and influence on LLZO\u2019s performance when used as an electrolyte remains both poorly understood and controlled. In addition, there are limited characterization methods available for detailed studies of these impurity phases, particularly if these phases are buried in, or close to the grain boundaries, of a dense sintered material.  Here we demonstrate a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) approach that exploits both endogenous and exogenous dopants to select for either specific impurities, or separate bulk vs surface/subsurface phases.   Specifically, the location of Al-containing phases within an Al doped LLZO and the impurity phases that form during synthesis are mapped: by doping LLZO with trace amounts of paramagnetic metal ions (Fe3+ and Gd3+), DNP is used to selectively probe Al and La containing impurity phases, respectively, allowing us to enhance the signals arising from the LiAlO2 and LaAlO3 impurities and to confirm their identity. A 17O DNP experiment using Gd3+ doped LLZO is performed to identify further La3+-containing impurities (specifically La2Zr2O7 and La2O3). Finally, a 7Li DNP irradiated 7Li \u2013 27Al dipolar based heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation experiment is performed using the radical TEKPol as the polarization agent. This experiment demonstrates that the poorly crystalline LiAlO2 that is found close to the surfaces of the LLZO composite is coated by a thin Li-containing impurity layer, and thus not directly present at the surface.

This theory has been successfully applied in many fields, but there are some cases where the reactivity is not well described by FMO even if orbitally controlled. In order to consider the participation of the molecular orbitals (MOs) beyond the frontier ones in the reactivity and also to explain the different reactivity possibilities that a same reagent can have (which can be correlated to experimental products), we propose a theory that is based on two fundamental principles: the first one states that the participation/contribution of the MOs in the reactivity is not absolutely defined, therefore there are many possibilities involving just the reagent R1, that are related to many possibilities of reactivity. The second one states that the interaction between R1 and the second reagent R2 reduces these many possibilities of participation/contribution to a final option, which is related to just one type of reactivity, that can be correlated with experimental data. The search for these many possibilities of participation of MOs in the reactivity is based on an extension of the three-state grand canonical ensemble model and then because our theory focuses on non-ionization reactions, nucleophilic and electrophilic probabilities are derived. Electron densities are directly evaluated from the MOs, together with their orbital energies related to a microstate, and at the end an ensemble average electron density (average Fukui function) depending on the respective microstates probabilities at a constant kT_{p} value is calculated. Upon varying kT_{p} three reactivity zones: the FMO zone, the Many-state zone (kT_{p} \u2248 \u2206E_{i j} ) and the No information zone appear in a natural way, each of them linked to their reactivity information content. We study the reactivity in electrophilic aromatic substitutions on toluene, nitrobenzene, phenol, benzotrifluoride, chlorobenzene and benzaldehyde and in the nucleophilic addition reaction on acrolein. With our theory it was possible to describe the reactivity correctly where FMO theory is incomplete or incorrect, and also where FMO is correct according to experiment.", "date": "2025-04-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The CO2 storage is affected by the charging/discharging region. In this work, we applied impedance analysis to estimate the effect of charging/discharging protocols on the CO2 adsorption. Here we considered three regions, only negative (0 V to -1V), only positive (0 V to 1V), and the addition of positive and negative region (1 V to -1 V). The effectiveness of SSA is estimated via the difference in double layer capacitance from high potential to low potential. In negative region, the difference in double layer capacitance from high potential to low potential is lower than that of positive region. It suggests that the SSA in positive region is higher than that of negative region. Though the double layer capacitance is high in negative region, but the difference in double layer capacitance is high in positive region. It is due to the presence of high CO2 at zero potential in negative region, while in positive region very low CO2 is present initially. The low CO2 initially allows large CO2 movement towards the interface from 1 V to 0 V in positive region. On contrary, in negative region, the high CO2 at zero potential allows low CO2 to reach at the interface in negative region. Finally, in the additional (positive and negative) zone, the advantage of low CO2 initially, and high potential for CO2 adsorption enhances the CO2 adsorption.

Although harmonic bond potentials can be replaced with Morse bond potentials to simulate bond dissociation at large deformations, the use of harmonic cross-terms in Class II force fields prevents the complete simulation of bond dissociation.

Unfortunately, the inversion-recovery experiment can last hours if a long T1 is expected.

The principle relies on ion transfer from a thin polymeric film into solution, electrochemically coupled to electron transfer at the back side of the film. Different solution concentrations shift the ion transfer potential, which is visualized by unquenching a fluorophore when the redox probe in the film is oxidized. The maximum fluorescence change of each pixel is captured by a rapid image burst, mapping excitation peak potentials across the image.

However, the formation mechanism of polycatenanes through direct catenation remains poorly understood. Herein we explore the structural diversity and unique chain termination mechanism inherent to polycatenanes. Unlike conventional linear polymers, a linear polycatenane exhibits a variety of topological configurations, with chain growth terminated upon the formation of completely interwoven structures. This intrinsic termination, characterized by the probability q, necessitates a modification of the classical Carothers equation to accurately determine the number-average degree of polymerization (DPn). Using importance sampling-based Monte Carlo algorithm, we have investigated the influence of interaction strength \u03f5 between monomers and cavity size l(\u03c3) of a monomer on the termination probability q.

This review explores the synthesis, properties, and applications of CQDs, with a particular focus on the hydrothermal synthesis technique. Hydrothermal synthesis is a widely used method due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Unlike conventional chemical synthesis routes, hydrothermal techniques use mild reaction conditions and eco-friendly precursors, making them ideal for large-scale CQD production. Additionally, hydrothermal synthesis allows fine control over CQD size, morphology, and surface functionalities, enabling tunable fluorescence properties.  This review compares hydrothermal synthesis with other synthesis techniques, such as chemical oxidation, microwave-assisted, electrochemical, and solvothermal methods. While alternative methods provide advantages in terms of reaction time or specific functionalization, hydrothermal synthesis remains a preferred route due to its versatility and scalability. The role of precursor selection, temperature, pressure, and reaction time in determining the physicochemical properties of CQDs is also discussed. Recent advances in green synthesis approaches, including the use of biomass-derived precursors, are highlighted as an important step toward sustainable nanotechnology.  CQDs have been extensively investigated for their applications in drug delivery, bioimaging, photocatalysis, and environmental remediation. In drug delivery, CQDs serve as excellent nanocarriers due to their high surface area, functionalization capabilities, and biocompatibility. They have been employed in targeted drug delivery systems to improve therapeutic efficiency and reduce systemic toxicity. Their fluorescence properties enable real-time imaging and tracking of drug release within biological systems. In bioimaging, CQDs provide an alternative to traditional organic dyes and semiconductor quantum dots due to their low toxicity, photostability, and tunable emission wavelengths. Their applications extend to fluorescence-guided surgery and real-time cell imaging.  CQDs have also demonstrated significant potential in photocatalysis, where they act as effective electron donors and acceptors in photochemical reactions. Their role in enhancing photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, hydrogen production, and CO\u2082 reduction is discussed. The review further examines recent advancements in modifying CQDs to enhance their catalytic efficiency, including heteroatom doping, surface passivation, and hybrid nanostructure formation. In environmental science, CQDs have been employed in sensors for detecting heavy metal ions, organic pollutants, and biomolecules due to their high sensitivity and selectivity.  Despite these promising applications, challenges remain in optimizing CQD synthesis for large-scale production while maintaining consistent quality and performance. Key challenges include controlling the uniformity of CQD size distribution, improving quantum yield, and enhancing their stability under physiological and environmental conditions. This review identifies future research directions, emphasizing the need for more efficient synthesis routes, better functionalization strategies, and improved understanding of CQD interactions with biological and environmental systems. Advances in these areas will further expand the potential applications of CQDs in nanomedicine, energy storage, and environmental remediation.  In conclusion, hydrothermally synthesized CQDs offer a sustainable and efficient approach for developing next-generation nanomaterials with diverse applications.

Many different strategies are being studied worldwide, one of which consists of trapping the gas into porous materials, either for its short- or long-term capture and storage, or its re-use for the production of value-added compounds. Yet, to further the development of such systems, there is a real need to fully understand their structure and properties, including at the molecular-level following the physisorption and/or chemisorption of CO2 (which can lead to various species, including carbonate and bicarbonate ions). In this context, 17O NMR naturally appears as the analytical tool of choice, because of its exquisite sensitivity to probe subtle differences in oxygen bonding environments. To date, it has scarcely been used, due to the very low natural abundance of 17O (0.04%), and the difficulty in purchasing or obtaining commercial 17O-labeled compounds adapted to such investigations (e.g., 17O-CO2(g), or 17O-enriched Na- and K- (bi)carbonate salts, which can be readily transformed into CO2). Herein, we demonstrate how, using mechanochemistry, it is possible to enrich with 17O a variety of Na- and K- (bi)carbonate salts in a fast, economical, scalable, and user-friendly way. The high enrichment levels enabled recording the first high-resolution 17O ssNMR spectra of these phases at different temperatures and magnetic fields. From these, the typical spectral signatures of (bi)carbonate ions could be obtained, showing their strong sensitivity to local environments and dynamics. Lastly, we show how thanks to the selective 17O-labeling, other aspects of the reactivity of carbonates in materials can be unveiled using in-situ 17O ssNMR.

A peptide is synthesized C-to-N or N-to-C as an extension to a homopeptide header with one end bound to a fixed surface and the other free and enclosed by a nanopore. The surface is mounted on a platform that can be moved with 0.1-0.15 nm precision; the pore acts like a ribosome tunnel to protect amino acid (AA) side-chains from unwanted couplings and also prevents aggregation and cyclization. Synthesis occurs in cycles with the following steps: a coupling agent attaches an end-protected AA to the terminal residue of the growing header at the end of the pore; completion of coupling is detected optically; coupling agent, protector, and excess AAs are washed out; the platform is retracted by 3.5 \u00c5; the newly added AA is deprotected and the protector washed out. Alternatively in N-to-C synthesis unprotected AAs can be used with an ynamide coupling agent. On completion of synthesis the platform is moved toward the pore by the added peptide\u2019s length, the peptide is separated from the header. A combination of electrical potential and hydraulic pressure keeps the peptide fully stretched at all times. The nanopore plays a secondary role, no measurements are made on it. Parallel synthesis can be done with an array of headers and an array of nanopores, with potential capacities of up to a femtomole. Higher capacities may be possible if header-peptides are passed through wider pores in loose bundles. In principle there is no limit to the length of the peptide that can be synthesized. With no side-chain protection, minimal reagent amounts, reduced washing, and almost no post-synthesis cleanup, the method has a potentially high level of greenness. In particular, since the header-peptide is tethered none of the reactants or byproducts needs to be soluble in water (or other solvent of choice), they can all be flushed out under pressure; the need for purification is minimal. Based on their relative sizes (as computed from the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid) some components of the resulting effluent (which contains protected AAs, coupling agents, byproducts, etc.) may be recovered by nanolevel filtration for possible reuse.", "date": "2025-04-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For chiral compounds, cleavage of a bond to a stereocenter produces a radical pair whose recombination can reconstitute the stereocenter in either enantiomeric form. While racemization is typically observed, catalytic conversion of racemic mixtures to single enantiomers is a synthetically desirable direction. However, it poses the challenge of controlling the reactivity of rotationally and translationally free prochiral radicals that can engage in various deleterious processes independently of each other. Here, we report how such control can be achieved by means of asymmetric geminate recasting, which involves a sequence of homolysis and recombination of the radical pair in a solvent cage promoted by a chiral photocatalyst. This approach enabled construction of chiral sulfur stereocenters, addressing an important problem in asymmetric synthesis. A bespoke chiral indium photocatalyst promoted deracemization of sulfinamides that can serve as versatile precursors to valuable chiral sulfur functional groups.

Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and in situ electrolytic electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, it was demonstrated that Ph\u2011H2Q undergoes a concerted two-proton-coupled electron transfer (2PCET) process. The CV profiles show that in the presence of Ph\u2011H2Q the usual reversible dioxygen/ O2\u2022\u2212 redox couple becomes irreversible, indicating that the initial proton transfer (PT) from Ph\u2011H2Q to O2\u2022\u2212 is followed by an electron transfer and a subsequent PT to yield the quinone radical anion (Ph\u2011Q\u2022\u2212). The ESR spectra confirmed the formation of Ph\u2011Q\u2022\u2212 via characteristic hyperfine splitting, with no significant spin delocalization onto the phenyl ring.

Although the phenyl substituent is electronically similar to hydrogen in terms of PCET mechanism, its larger steric bulk slightly diminishes reactivity at higher concentrations.

Accordingly, downcycling (e.g., crumb rubber for asphault or turf) is the major avenue for end-of-life thermoset elastomers. To enable alternative recycling pathways, herein we propose a two-step procedure to crosslink polybutadiene (PBD) as a substitute for vulcanization, resulting in deconstructable soft materials. First, we utilize the established C-H allylic amination of PBD to access thermoplastic elastomer pre-polymers functionalized with electrophilic hexafluoroisopropyl sulfamate (PBD-HFIPS). Then, PBD-HFIPS alcoholysis with diol crosslinkers yields thermoset specimens with tunable thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties dependent on crosslinker identity and density. Finally, treating these thermosets with a nucleophile cleaves sulfamate crosslinks and regenerates the thermoplastic with no characterizable differences from virgin PBD.

This task is of particular interest for the electrocatalytic conversion of biomass and bio-oils into sustainable fuels, which faces challenges due to the low aqueous solubility of the feedstock. First, we predict the miscibility of potential co-solvents in water, and we only consider co-solvents that are miscible. Second, we rank co-solvents based on the predicted solubility of the molecule of interest in them. To achieve this, we train two separate ML models: one using the AqSolDB dataset to predict aqueous solubility, and another using the BigSolDB dataset to predict solubility in organic solvents. We select the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model architecture for aqueous solubility (test R2 = 0.864, RMSE = 0.851 for log(S / (mol/dm3)) and organic solubility (test R2 = 0.805, RMSE = 0.511 for log(x)) predictions based on comparing different ML models and features.

This undesired effect distorts the lineshapes, degrades the resolution, and lowers the signal-to-noise ratio in the collected spectra. As a remedy, numerical techniques have been developed to correct the spectra after acquisition, with reference deconvolution being the most popular example. However, these methods require a precarious parameter guess from the user, making them inconvenient and prone to errors. We propose a post-acquisition shimming tool named ShimNet based on a convolutional neural network with the attention mechanism. The model learns the distortion characteristics of a given spectrometer from a series of calibration measurements. Once trained, it can correct any spectrum from the same machine in a fully automatic way. It achieves slightly better reconstruction quality than the existing methods and is considerably faster. This makes ShimNet an excellent tool for laboratories performing routine and massive NMR measurements for chemists. As an exemplary application, we demonstrate that the model properly corrects liquid-state spectra of small molecules, such as azarone, styrene, Cresol Red, or sodium butyrate.

This route increases defect density and reduces crystallite domain size, lowering the melting temperature from 461\u202f\u00b0C (for larger solution-synthesized microcrystals) to 455\u202f\u00b0C, thereby mitigating thermal decomposition during melting. Crystalline Cd(im)2 adopts a two-fold interpenetrated diamondoid (dia-c) topology, assembled from tetrahedral Cd2+ centers and im\u2013 linkers. Rapid cooling yields a monolithic glass with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 175 \u00b0C.

Investigations of thermal parameters (cooling rates) and partial linker substitution reveal strategies for tuning the phase behavior of both glass and glass-ceramic.

Modelling excited states in organic crystals is challenging due to the need to balance localised and delocalised processes and the competition between intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. Cluster models have proven highly effective for describing weakly interacting organic crystals; however, non-periodic calculations on periodic systems must account for mechanical and electrostatic coupling to the crystal lattice, particularly in cases of extended coordination where covalent bonds are severed, such as in organic polymers and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Point charge embedding is a low-cost method for incorporating long-range electrostatics, enabling the consideration of long-range interactions using Ewald embedding. Small clusters have been effective for modelling excited-state processes in MOFs, yet embedding has rarely been included in such studies. In this work, we examine some of the challenges in describing excited states in covalently connected organic crystals using ONIOM(QM:QM\u2019) embedding techniques across systems with increasing coordination: diC4-BTBT (an organic molecular crystal), polythiophene (an organic polymer), and two MOFs (QMOF-d29cec2 and MOF-5). We analyse the effects of using different electronic structure methods, including TDHF, TDDFT, ADC(2), and CC2. One of the main challenges is that embedded cluster models are susceptible to overpolarisation near the QM:QM\u2019 boundary. To address this, we assess the impact of different charge redistribution schemes (Z-N (N=0,3), RC, and RCD) and implement them in fromage. Additionally, we compare cluster and periodic models. We find that localised models effectively reproduce excited states in both non-connected systems (diC4-BTBT) and fully connected MOFs, whereas polythiophene remains the most challenging due to band conduction. The accuracy of vertical excitations, oscillator strengths, and simulated spectra is strongly influenced by model size, boundary charges, redistribution schemes, and level of theory. We further analyse the effect of vibrational broadening using the nuclear ensemble approach to predict the absorption and emission spectra of MOF-5.

In general, fractions soluble in THF mixtures had high dispersity, syringyl-to-guaiacyl (S/G) subunit ratio and aliphatic OH-groups, whereas EtOH fractions had narrower molecular weight distributions, lower S/G subunit ratio and higher concentration of phenolic OH-groups. A brief description of the solvent effects at the molecular level was given using molecular dynamics simulations which revealed specific solvation between the dissolved lignin and solvent mixture. Protocol presented in this paper enables to purify HL and control the physicochemical properties of the soluble lignin fractions by simply altering the composition of the solvent mixture, and therefore, expanding the possibilities in valorisation of HL.", "date": "2025-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Physical Organic Chemistry; Biopolymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Quantitative structure-property relationship models were developed to predict molecule PK (clearance, volume of distribution and unbound fraction) and affinity for the Adenosine A2AR receptor (A2AR), a drug target in immuno-oncology. These models were used to score compounds in a reinforcement learning framework to generate molecules with a specific PK profile and high affinity for the A2AR. We predicted the expected tumor growth inhibition profiles using the QSP model for selected candidate molecules with varying PK and affinity profiles. We show that optimizing affinity to the A2AR, while minimizing or maximizing a PK property, shifts the type of molecular scaffolds that are generated. The difference in physicochemical properties of the compounds with different predicted PK parameters was found to correspond with the differences observed in the PK dataset. We demonstrated the use of the QSP model by simulating the effect of a broad range of compound properties on the predicted tumor volume.

Voltage settings must be balanced to minimize low m/z cutoffs while also generating effective pseudopotential wells for high m/z ions to maximize transmission of ion populations of interest. The scan range is particularly impactful in glycoproteomics, because glycopeptide identification typically relies on low mass-to-charge (m/z) glycan-derived oxonium ions and higher m/z peptide fragments that retain glycan modifications. Common practice on ion trapping-based instruments suggests a so-called \u201c5-10-15 rule\u201d when setting scan ranges, which defines the upper m/z value to be used for the scan based on a multiple of the first m/z value. While this axiom has very real implications for transmitting diverse ion populations in full MS scans, adhering to this strategy can unnecessarily limit analytical information available in glycopeptide MS/MS spectra. Here, we explore the implications of following or breaking the 5-10-15 rule in MS/MS scans for glycopeptide characterization on a quadrupole-Orbitrap-linear ion trap Tribrid MS system (Orbitrap Ascend). We show that breaking the 5-10-15 rule for MS/MS scans does not lead to a significant loss of fragment ion transmission at either extreme of the m/z range.

A correlation analysis revealed that among the three input parameters, carbon SVP strongly influenced MPL output properties.

Among the three evaluated MPL output properties, the electrical conductivity is consistent with experimental literature.

Recent developments suggest hydride systems can cycle and operate at pressures and temperatures favorable coupling with fuel cells for stationary long-duration energy storage applications. In this study, we present a conceptual design of a metal hydride-based storage system for backup power (0 to 20 MW supplied over 0 to 100 hours), and benchmark system cost and performance. Leveraging experimental hydrogen absorption and desorption data, we determine the uptake/release of hydrogen across likely pressure and temperature conditions, and estimate the equipment power, upfront capital cost, levelized cost of storage, land footprint, and energy density for a select number of metal hydrides and hypothetical operation scenarios. Our findings indicate that hydride-based storage systems hold significant size advantage in physical footprint, requiring up to 65% less land than the 170-bar compressed gas storage options. Metal hydride systems can be cost competitive with 350-bar compressed gas systems, with TiFe0.85Mn0.05 achieving $0.45/kWh and complex MH Mg(NH2)2-2.1LiH-0.1KH achieving $0.38/kWh, compared to $0.40/kWh for 350 bar compressed gas in the base case scenario. However, these advantages are sensitive to charging and discharging rate requirements, operational cycles and material manufacturing prices. Extending charging times and increasing operating cycles significantly reduce LCOS, especially for complex MHs, making them more competitive for applications with slow charging and long duration energy storage needs.

Here, we describe the spontaneous destabilization and reduction of neptunyl(V) in aqueous solution via complexation to the Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) ligand PW11O397-. The POM-mediated reduction of NpO2+ does not require any reducing agent and occurs within minutes, at room temperature, and in aqueous solution. The POM complexation allows for the thermodynamic stabilization of Np4+ by forming the complex [Np(PW11O39)2]10- (Np(PW11)2), which remains soluble, water-stable, and air-stable for weeks. The Np(PW11)2 complex also persists over an extended acidity range. Crystallization of Np(PW11)2 and characterization via single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed a rare case where both the alpha and beta isomers of the Keggin ligand are present in the structure, forming an unprecedented 50:50 mixture of Np(\u03b1-PW11)2 and Np(\u03b1-PW11)(\u03b2-PW11). Comparative crystal structures obtained with other tetravalent cation-PW11 complexes (i.e., Zr4+, Hf4+, Ce4+, and Th4+) indicate that the occurrence of the beta isomer is specific to Np4+ and independent of the cation\u2019s size. The solution-state and solid-state characterization of the Np-PW11 system via UV-vis-NIR absorbance, Raman spectroscopy, 31P NMR, VT NMR, and relaxometry further elucidated the speciation (complex stoichiometry and oxidation state) and the mixed rotational isomerism. Moreover, comparative experiments with uranium revealed that the two actinyl ion types (UO22+ vs. NpO2+) undergo drastically different reactions in the presence of PW11. While NpO2+ reduces to Np4+ and forms a stable complex, UO22+ is not reduced but instead uses PW11 as a phosphate reservoir and precipitates as uranyl phosphate.

Here, we investigate to what extent subtly different conformational states are retained in their solvent-free environment.

RNase A transitions between a closed and an open conformation on the millisecond timescale, with the closed conformation being favored when liganded. Our results indicate that both ligand-bound and unliganded RNase A maintain approximately 80% of their native contacts in a solvent-free environment. This includes crucial interactions between the ligand and the protein scaffold, as well as the ligand's position within the binding pocket. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that when RNase A is ligand-bound, it adopts a more compact structure, as observed in solution. Additionally, significant differences between the open and closed conformations\u2014such as the positioning of Loop 1\u2014are mostly preserved in the solvent-free state, with root mean squared deviations of about 2 \u00c5.

The interaction between Trp-Cu NC and Dox under neutral pH resulted in the formation of  Trp-Cu NC-Dox nanoconjugate of diameter ~ 24.7 \u00b1 1.1 nm meeting the size criterion suitable for good drug delivery performance. Under acidic conditions (pH 5.5), the Trp-Cu NC-Dox nanoconjugate dissociated back to the nanocluster (diameter ~ 2.96 \u00b1 0.1) releasing the drug, translated into a remarkable increase in the Trp-Cu NC (donor) lifetime followed by a decreased EFRET. Such a phenomenon was absent under physiological pH 7.4, making the Trp-Cu NC a suitable nano-carrier for targeted drug delivery in cancer cells. The cytotoxicity studies further corroborate that Trp-Cu NC can selectively deliver Dox to the cancer cells enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the drug by ~3.6-fold, concurrently decreasing its toxicity appreciably towards the normal cells. Overall, these findings substantiate an easy and economical strategy to develop a novel nano-drug carrier that offers selectivity and improved drug-delivery performance, thereby curing the limitation of systemic toxicity imposed by conventional chemotherapy.", "date": "2025-04-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It is crucial to find suitable photoelectrode materials that are photo-catalytically active and exhibit excellent photochemical stability. One of the promising contenders is ZnTe with the ~2.26 eV band gap and prolonged stability under CO\u2082RR PEC conditions. Herein, a new telluride based thin-film ZnGa\u2082Te\u2084 photocathode with lower band gap and stronger visible light absorption compared to ZnTe is synthesized and characterized using a combinatorial sputtering technique. A two-step annealing method with excess Te supply is implemented to synthesize nearly stoichiometric ZnGa\u2082Te\u2084 absorber material with a zincblende-derived tetragonal crystal structure confirmed by synchrotron x-ray and electron diffraction. Theoretical calculations show that ZnGa\u2082Te\u2084 has suitable direct bandgap (~1.86 eV) and high absorption coefficient ~ 10^5 cm/1, in agreement with experimentally prepared films. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the biexponential decay dynamics, with time constants, \u03c41 ~ 0.04, and \u03c42 ~ 0.65 s in microsecond time scales and provides the optical transition pathways for this semiconductor thin film. PEC measurements show that the ZnGa\u2082Te\u2084 photocurrent densities are comparable to the widely investigated ZnTe photocathodes or even surpass it under simulated sunlight condition. The inclusion of diaryliodonium additive substantially increases its CO\u2082RR selectivity to ~ 60%.

Although classical free energy perturbation (FEP) methods provide very accurate lattice free energy estimates, their scalability in large polymorphic landscapes is limited by the need to ergodically sample one chain of overlapping alchemical Boltzmann distributions per polymorph. In contrast, targeted free energy perturbation (TFEP) can converge free energies of the same accuracy directly on the existing physical data sampled in each polymorph. The only major challenge in TFEP is obtaining an accurate bijective mapping between each polymorph and a common reference distribution. To achieve a general mapping strategy, we turn to normalising flow neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of normalising-flow enhanced TFEP in molecular crystals. Specifically, we describe a normalising flow architecture, based on spline-coupling, that can achieve a significant overlap between a Boltzmann distribution of a molecular crystal supercell and the artificial distribution learned by a probabilistic generative model (PGM) trained by example on relatively small amounts of MD data. The accuracy and efficiency of this approach were assessed by comparing PGM-based FE estimates to the reference FE estimates from the Einstein crystal method (ECM). These two methods were applied to three molecules of practical relevance in the pharmaceutical industry: succinic acid, a salt former and starting material, and two drug molecules, Veliparib and Mivebresib. A compelling agreement in accuracy between the PGM and the ECM was observed in the polymorphic landscapes for these three compounds across all supercell sizes that were considered. In addition to showing that normalising flow can provide reliable free energy estimates in systems that are significantly more complex compared to those previously studied at a significantly lower cost than ECM, we also discuss how one can further improve the cost-effectiveness of this approach.", "date": "2025-04-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Statistical Mechanics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Alternative approaches like the electrochemical ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 are attractive, but the sluggish nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) that arises from the high energy input to activate stable N2 remains the significant challenge for NRR electrocatalysts. The Nitrogen-rich surface of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) can deliver one solution to this challenge, through a Mars-van Krevelen-like mechanism in which N vacancies form via hydrogenation steps and ammonia release, followed by vacancy filling through N2 activation. We recently showed that ZrN thin films deposited with metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) are rapidly oxidized when exposed to ambient and showed preliminary results, from ab initio molecular dynamics (aiMD) simulations, indicating surface oxidation is favourable. In this paper, we investigate in detail with aiMD the oxidation of ZrN and VN surfaces by ambient oxygen at various temperatures: 295K, 363K, 873K and 1023K. Results show that ZrN surfaces tend to form oxynitrides at lower temperatures and prefers to form a ZrOx layer interfaced with ZrN at higher temperature. By contrast, VN(111), forms VOx clusters on the surface and there is no significant migration of O species into bulk VN at all studied temperatures. We attribute the different oxidation processes of ZrN and VN to the relative strength of V-N/O bonds and Zr-O/N bonds - the bond dissociation energy of V-N (452 kJ/mol) is larger than Zr-N (339 kJ/mol), while the V-O bond (645 kJ/mol) is weaker than the Zr-O bond (776 kJ/mol). Experimental results on MOCVD nitride films, including Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in combination with nuclear reaction analysis (RBS/NRA), confirms that VN is less oxidized than ZrN at ambient conditions because VN forms a less stable, potentially volatile oxide layer, whereas ZrN has a stronger tendency to form a stable, protective ZrO\u2082 layer, promoting more complete oxidation at higher temperatures. This study defines a new degree of atomic scale understanding of the formation of oxynitride or separated oxide phase in TMNs at ambient oxygen conditions relevant for NRR electrocatalysis.

This work addresses the role of ionic strength on the rheology of CNF suspensions and the ion-specific nature of such rheology. Salt-free CNF suspensions exhibit viscoelastic, shear-thinning behavior. The concentration dependences of the storage modulus and specific viscosity exhibit similar power-law relationships in two regimes, G'~\u03b7_sp~c^a, with exponents of a\u22481 and a\u22485 below and above, respectively, a critical concentration of roughly 0.5 wt.% that delineates \u201cdilute\u201d and \u201csemi-dilute\u201d characteristics. In the semi-dilute regime, salt addition increases the elastic modulus due to increased filament-filament association enabled by electrostatic screening of the repulsive interactions between weakly charged filaments. Notably, the modulus increases exponentially with salt concentration, or nominal ionic strength, I. In the dilute regime, the intrinsic viscosity decreases with ionic strength, reflecting the adoption of more compact conformations at the single-filament level due to screened electrostatics. At a fixed ionic strength, both storage modulus and intrinsic viscosity show a marked dependence on ion identity, for which ion hydration enthalpy, \u3016\u2206H\u3017_h, is used as a proxy. The intrinsic viscosity increases with \u2206H, while the storage modulus decreases with an exponential dependence. Notably, the orderings of both parameters mimic the ion sequence of the Hofmeister series. This highlights a strong correlation between the ability of different ions to modify the hydrogen-bonding-network structure of water and their ability to screen inter- and intra-filament electrostatic interactions. The exponential dependences of modulus on salt concentration and hydration enthalpy suggest that the nominal ionic strength I can be corrected using \u3016\u2206H\u3017_h yield an effective ionic strength, I_eff, that captures the role of salt addition agnostic of ion identity.

These data are then used to fit atom-centered potentials (ACPs) that improve the accuracy of the PES predicted by a density-functional theory method. The end result is an ACP-augmented DFT method capable of describing a region of the PES for the chosen molecule with approximately the same accuracy as the high-level method, but at approximately the same cost as the DFT method. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through its application to the HFCO and uracil molecules.

However, ensuring the secure and cost-effective geological storage of carbon requires a deep understanding of potential well cement degradation, the carbonation process, and wellbore integrity, especially under CO2 injection conditions. In this study, we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore CO2 and H2O interactions at the microscopic level within cement, using simplified models of portlandite and tobermorite under specific aging conditions (66 \u00b0C, 100 bar). This approach helps us better understand the thermodynamic mechanisms at play before any chemical degradation occurs.

Our findings emphasize that surface water content is critical in influencing CO2 adsorption behavior, and modifications in this water content can significantly affect the material's interaction with CO2.

As for the vibrational response of the H2O, HF, H2S, and NH3 monomers, it turns out that dipole derivatives primarily govern geometry relaxation. Perturbation theory including cubic anharmonicity can reproduce CCSD results on the vibrational Stark effect, except for NH3, where deviations arise due to its floppiness. The field-induced modifications in H-bond lengths, vibrational Stark effects, binding energies, and charge-transfer mechanisms in monomers and dimers are elucidated. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis on dimers reveals that electrostatics dominate the stabilization of H-bonds across all field strengths, while induction contributions increase significantly with stronger fields, particularly in systems with more polarizable atoms. Our results reveal a universal strengthening of intermolecular interactions at moderate to strong field intensities, with significant variability among dimers due to inherent differences in molecular polarizability and charge distribution. Notably, a direct correlation is observed between the binding energies and the vibrational Stark effect of the stretching mode of the H-bond donor molecule, both in relation to the charge-transfer energy term, across all the investigated dimers.

In the present study, dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) are employed to investigate the adsorption of 5-FU at a framework-associated octahedral Al site in zeolite FAU. The calculations show that 5-FU remains coordinated to the Al atom at room temperature and in the presence of water.

This study presents the theoretical framework for EOF of power-law fluids in fractal-like branching networks, addressing both volume and surface-area constraints\u2014a domain unexplored in existing literature on flow optimization. Prior EOF analyses have focused on Newtonian fluids in fractal network or numerical analysis of power-law fluid flows in complex geometries; here, we extend the scope to non-Newtonian fluids and complex hierarchies using theory and derived scaling laws. Assuming fully developed, steady, axisymmetric, and incompressible EOF in cylindrical microchannels, the model incorporates the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel approximation to linearize electrokinetic behavior and neglects pressure-driven components. The resulting electroosmotic flow rates $Q$ for power-law fluid enhances for shear-thinning fluids (lower $n$) compared to Newtonian or shear-thickening fluids. Under volume constraints, we show that the optimal branching radius ratio \\(\\beta^*\\) scales as \\(N^{-1/2}\\), yielding uniform mean velocity across all generations. This configuration yields a maximum normalized conductance \\(E_{\\text{vol}} = 1\\), independent of the number of bifurcations \\(N\\), length ratio \\(\\gamma\\), or generation count \\(m\\).

Coacervate droplets have been proposed as compartments in this context, as they share properties with biomolecular condensates, which act as transient compartments in biology. Previous efforts to develop out-of-equilibrium coacervates use exergonic reactions as an energy source, but this leads to the accumulation of the side-products of the driving reaction, preventing operation over long periods of time. Here, we present a novel strategy to drive the transient formation and movement of coacervate compartments, using an electric potential between two electrodes as an energy source. In this system, the electrochemical oxidation of a cysteine-containing peptide increases its multivalency, leading to complexation with a polyanion and coacervate formation at the anode. The electrochemically-formed coacervates then move by electrophoresis over a distance more than three orders of magnitude larger than their diameter. In the proximity of the cathode, an electrocatalytic cycle dissolves the coacervates by reduction, recovering the free peptide and polyanion, which can diffuse back to the anode and react again. The system reaches a steady state, in which coacervates are simultaneously forming, moving, and disappearing in different regions of the cell. Since no side-products are generated, the formation-movement-destruction regime can be sustained for more than 16 hours, almost two orders of magnitude longer than the lifetime of individual droplets.

We have investigated polarization-dependent plasmonic chemistry on chiral gold nanocubes (AuNC) through surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The AuNC exhibit substantial optical activity and a pronounced localized surface plasmon resonance. The hot electron induced dehalogenation of 8-Bromoadenine, adsorbed on chiral AuNC, has been employed as a model reaction to understand the effect of polarized light on plasmon-induced chemical reactions. Our observations reveal a circular dichroism (CD) of the hot electron generation efficiency resulting in asymmetric reaction rates. The photochemical g-factor, determined by the differential reaction rate coefficients with left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, surpasses the optical g-factor by a factor of 2. Moreover, a reversal of photochemical CD is observed on multilayer coverage of particles, which is laser power dependent and allows for a further amplification of g-factor just by increasing the light intensity. Calculations of extinction spectra and hot electron generation maps with different polarization incident on the chiral AuNC confirm a significant influence of the arrangement of particles on the g-factor.

For passive, adsorbent-based AWH, an adsorbent bed is employed to capture water from cold, humid air at nighttime, while during the daytime the bed is then exposed to ambient sunlight to heat it and desorb the water for collection. Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are tunable, nanoporous materials with suitable water adsorption properties for comprising this adsorbent bed. The water delivery by the MOF adsorbent bed in a passive AWH device depends on (1) the nighttime, capture conditions (temperature and humidity) and daytime, release conditions and (2) the structure(s) of the MOF(s) comprising the bed, which dictate MOF-water interactions. We hypothesize that (1) an adsorbent bed comprised of a mixture or portfolio of MOFs, each specialized for different capture and release conditions, may deliver water with robustness to day-to-day weather fluctuations, and (2) the optimal composition of the adsorbent bed depends on the geographic region and time frame. \n\nHerein, we develop a method to optimally design the total mass and composition of a MOF mixture comprising an adsorbent bed for bespoke and robust passive AWH---i.e., tailored to a declared geographic region and time frame and satisfying minimum daily water delivery requirements. We combine historical weather data in the declared region, water adsorption data in the candidate MOFs, and thermodynamic adsorption models to frame a linear program expressing our optimal design principle: adjust the mass of each candidate MOF comprising the mixture to yield the minimal-mass adsorbent bed that satisfies the daily water delivery constraints. Based on our three case studies in the Chihuahuan Desert in June and the Sonoran Desert in June and in August, we find: (1) a mixed-MOF adsorbent bed can be, but is not always, lighter than its optimized single-MOF counterpart; and (2) the optimal composition and mass of the adsorbent bed differs by both geographic region and time frame. Finally, we visualize the linear program for a reduced problem with a two-dimensional design space to gain intuition, conduct a sensitivity analysis, and compare to a AWH field study.

Different from the general understanding that the dimeric or trimeric palladium species are the most stable forms, the calculated results indicate that the dimeric palladium species tend to dissociate into monomers under the assistance of counter-cations, and then form a more stable \u03ba1 coordination palladium species with carboxylic acids rather than \u03ba2 coordination palladium species.

In vitro models lack the complexity of tissue and fail to accurately replicate the dynamic interactions between EVs and human intestinal epithelial cells, while animal infection models have species-specific differences that limit their translational relevance and are associated with ethical concerns. To bridge this gap, we propose a microfluidic platform integrated with an impedimetric sensor to monitor C. jejuni EV interactions with human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. When cultured in this microfluidic device, Caco-2 cells underwent spontaneous 3D morphogenesis and were spatially organised into spheroid-like structures. By combining impedance spectroscopy and microscopic observation, the platform allowed direct monitoring of cellular spatial growth and sensitive detection of their interaction with EVs. Although functional assays revealed that the C. jejuni EVs killed Caco-2 cells cultured on plates, 3D Caco-2 spheroids showed significantly greater resistance to both C. jejuni secretome and EVs.

A one-pot, two-step procedure was used, analogous to that used for ReS corroles, involving rhenium insertion via high-temperature reaction of Re2(CO)10 and free-base corroles in refluxing decalin, followed by exposure to PCl3 (which is thought to deoxygenate ReO corroles formed under the reaction) and elemental selenium.

Application of electric potential to a porous electrode in electrolyte solution stimulates adsorption or desorption of ions on the electrode surface. Electrosorption causes appearance of solvation pressure in the pores and results in electrode deformation. In this work, using molecular dynamics simulations and the continuum theory based on the modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, we studied the structure of the electrical double layer in slit graphitic micropores filled with a NaCl aqueous solution, and solvation  pressure in these pores. We focused on the behavior of the solvation pressure as a function of pore width and surface charge density. Within molecular dynamics simulations, two different water models were used -- an explicit model based on SPC/E water molecules and an implicit model, i.e., structureless background with fixed dielectric permittivity. The latter allows us to relate molecular dynamics simulation to the continuum theory. Simulations with explicit water show a qualitatively different behavior of the solvation pressure in the 1 and 2 nm pores as a function of the surface charge density. We demonstrated that the value of the solvation pressure is defined by a delicate balance between Van der Waals and electrostatic contributions. We demonstrated that the theory predicts the dependence of the solvation pressure on the pore width, which matches the results of simulations using the implicit water model. Finally, we adapted the continuum theory, developed for adsorption-induced deformation to estimate the deformation of a carbon electrode due to electrosorption.

Using Zn electro-crystallization in a series of ZnCl2 electrolytes as a model system, we found that dendritic growth is most severe in both dilute (0.01\u20130.5 m) and highly concentrated (10\u201330 m) systems, as predicted by the dimensionless second Damk\u00f6hler number, D_(a,II)=J_0/J_lim. However, we discovered unexpectedly that in highly concentrated electrolytes, dendrites propagate via Continuous Growth (Dendrite Mode I: CG)\u2014initiating from only a few dominant nuclei and propagating anisotropically in one primary direction, with parallel arms suggesting Zn\u2019s six-fold hexagonal lattice symmetry. Advancing along this preferred direction at rates up to ~0.1 mm s-1 toward the counter electrode, these dendrites pose a critical challenge, making highly concentrated, water-in-salt electrolytes particularly susceptible to fatal diffusion-limited dendrite growth. We hypothesize that Mode I: CG arises from Zn\u2019s high surface anisotropy, dictated by its low-symmetry hexagonal lattice; once nucleated, Zn crystals preferentially propagate in the <100> direction rather than forming new independent nuclei. In stark contrast, Cu\u2014a high-symmetry cubic crystal\u2014exhibits Dendrite Mode II: IN, characterized by Independent Nucleation throughout growth, with no apparent orientational correlation or dominance by a few dendrites. This finding highlights a hidden role of crystal anisotropy in electrochemical dendrite formation, unaccounted for in classical D_(a,II) analyses. We further hypothesize that introducing a polymeric \u201ccapping\u201d agent that lowers the energy barrier for independent nucleation may shift dendrite growth from Mode I: CG to Mode II: IN. Indeed, we found that the capping agent (e.g., PEG-400) disrupts rapid anisotropic dendritic propagation and promotes numerous smaller structures characteristic of Mode II: IN\u2014surprisingly, without significantly affecting key electrochemical properties such as reaction kinetics J_0 and ionic conductivity \u03c3. The transition from Mode I: CG to Mode II: IN enhances the performance of Zn anodes by a factor of 10 in practical coin cells under fast-charging conditions (50 mA cm-2 and 5 mAh cm-2). The results highlight the overlooked role of crystal anisotropy in electrochemical diffusion-limited dendrite growth.

We investigate GUV between 185 and 310 nm by modeling, in search of an optimal wavelength with both high disinfection and safety. For a specific fluence rate, GUV-induced air pollution health risks are at least ~20 times larger below 245 nm than above it. This is mainly due to O3 production through O2 photolysis below 245 nm, with a contribution from particulate matter formation from enhanced volatile organic compound oxidation. When normalized to a constant CDC-recommended disinfection rate of 5 equivalent air changes per hour (eACH), pollution risk below 245 nm is also at least ~20 times that above 245 nm. At very high disinfection rates such as 20 eACH, the difference between the ratios below and above 245 nm is smaller, but still a factor of ~20. Our results show a clear advantage of upper-room GUV vs. Far UVC for indoor air quality. These results appear robust despite substantial uncertainties in absolute disinfection efficiencies, which are a critical limitation for widespread GUV application. Thus, there is no optimal GUV wavelength across all important criteria (exposure limits, disinfection efficiency, indoor air quality, and logistic requirements), and these tradeoffs should be considered in different situations to maximize the overall benefit.

It does this by fixing damaged DNA, managing cell growth, and telling cells to die if they're too damaged to repair. But when TP53 has mutations,these defenses stop working, and cells start growing out of control. One of the big problems in trying to create drugs that target TP53 is that it's very flexible and doesn't have obvious places where drugs can easily attach. This has led to it being called \"undruggable\u201d. However, some recent findings suggest that certain mutations can change the protein's shape, revealing hidden areas where drugs might be able to bind. In this research, I used computer-based methods to study the C238Y mutation in TP53 and see how it changes the protein's structure. The results showed that this mutation causes some reshaping of the protein's surface, exposing a previously hidden pocket that could be a target for drugs. These results suggest that we should take another look at TP53 as a potential target for cancer drugs, which could lead to the development of drugs that work specifically against certain TP53 mutations . \n\nAbstract\n Mutations in the TP53 gene are frequently found in many different types of human cancers These mutations interfere with important functions that normally prevent tumors, like controlling cell growth and causing programmed cell death. When TP53 can't do its job, cells start multiplying without control, and the cell's genetic material becomes unstable. Even though TP53 has long been known to be a key player in cancer it's been very difficult to develop drugs that target it. This is largely because of its flexible structure and the lack of clear binding sites for drugs. But, recent studies indicate that specific mutations can cause structural changes in TP53, creating new potential binding sites that could be useful for drug development. In this study, I used computer modeling and structural biological  analysis to examine the c238y tp53 mutation . The results  showed  that this mutation dramatically reshapes the protein in the vicinity \u2014 it exposes a hidden pocket\u2002that could be a promising target for drugs. These results pave the way to conceptualising and designing therapies that are mutationally specific  with the end\u2002goal being to disrupt or restore the default function of malfunctioning TP53 in cancer.\nThis structural study lays the foundation for a follow-up phase involving virtual screening and drug-binding validation targeting the revealed cryptic pocket.\nThese steps can help translate this structural finding into fruitful  therapeutic strategies. The findings reinforce a growing realization in the field: that druggability in proteins like TP53, often labelled  as too disordered or flexible to target, may in fact be highly dependent on the specific mutations they carry. This flexibility  may offer a unique opportunity for designing mutation-specific treatments\u2014bringing us closer to personalized cancer therapies.\nhis manuscript presents a detailed computational and structural analysis of the  C238Y mutant, revealing a cryptic and druggable pocket specific to this mutation. \nand the study provides the  foundation for  docking ", "date": "2025-04-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To address these problems, we have implemented several optimizations of the ABFE protocol. First, a new algorithm to choose the protein-ligand pose restraints was developed to prevent numerical instabilities. By considering protein-ligand hydrogen bonds, the restraint selection now incorporates data on the key interactions to improve the convergence. Second, an optimization of the annihilation protocol was conducted to minimize the resulting error of the free energy. Third, a rearrangement of the order with which interactions (electrostatics, Lennard-Jones, restraints, intramolecular torsions) are scaled resulted in a systematic improvement of the precision. The results from four protein-ligand benchmark systems (TYK2, P38, JNK1, and CDK2) show significantly lower variances of the free energy results and improvements of up to 0.23 kcal/mol for the root mean square error, compared to the original protocol.

RetroSynFormer was trained on routes extracted from the PaRoutes dataset of patented experimental routes. On targets from the PaRoutes test set, the RetroSynFormer could find routes to commercial starting materials for 92% of the targets, and we show that the produced routes on average are close to the reference patented route and of good quality. Furthermore, we explore alternative model implementations and discuss the robustness of the model with respect to beam width, reward function, and template space size. We also compare RetroSynFormer to AiZynthFinder, a conventional retrosynthesis algorithm, and find that our novel model is competitive and complementary to established methodology, thus forming a valuable addition to the field of computer-aided synthesis planning.

This notwithstanding, the nature of the chemical B\u2012X bonding, which forms the framework where the A atoms can be inserted, is still under debate. Through a joint experimental and theoretical study of AIO3 (A= K, Rb, Cs, Tl, NH4) compounds and in particular in cesium iodate (CsIO3) under compression, we show how the IO3\u2012 polyanions, present in these compounds at room pressure, undergo a gradual pressure-induced polymerization (PIP) process in three dimensions (3D). This results in a pressure-induced symmetrization of the crystalline structure that leads to a tetragonal perovskite structure, with IO5+1 units, in CsIO3 and eventually to a cubic perovskite, with IO6 units, in other AIO3 compounds. We demonstrate that the PIP process induces a change in the chemical bonding from the resonant delocalized I\u2012O bonds in IO3\u2012 polyanions towards the unconventional I\u2012O electron-deficient multicenter bonds (EDMBs) in AIO3 cubic perovskites. The process of EDMB formation in the cubic perovskites agrees with the recently proposed unified theory of multicenter bonding and contradicts previous assumptions that considered these bonds to be impossible in valence electron-rich elements, such as chalcogens and halogens. Interestingly, our results suggest that: i) the formation of the cubic and slightly distorted ABX3 and BX3 perovskites with A, B, and X being main-group elements at high pressure is driven by the formation of 3D EDMBs due to the PIP of BX3 units leading to the cubic skeleton of regular BX6 units; and ii) unconventional EDMBs could be already present at room conditions in the cubic or slightly distorted ABX3 and BX3 perovskites with A, B, and X being main-group elements perovskites. The presence of unconventional EDMBs could explain the extraordinary properties of these perovskites.", "date": "2025-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.); Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Metal electronics, ancillary ligand sterics and metal complex coordination number have been identified as the primary factors which affect the rate of reductive elimination, but their relative importance has not been quantified. We report the development of a new class of palladacycles used to study these factors in depth. Through kinetics, electrochemistry, DFT calculations and tools from causal inference, we reexamine the canonical model which describes the factors affecting the rate of reductive elimination. First, by testing the canonical model against two competing hypotheses, we find that a direct effect of coordination number on rate is unlikely, contrary to what is commonly proposed. To address this contradiction, we propose an updated understanding based on mechanistic considerations, which accounts for our findings, the canonical understanding, and other observations in literature. Our model posits that metal electronics directly affect the rate - coordination number only affects metal electronics and sterics affect all other factors. The influence of sterics on the rate has three components; the first is a direct effect on the rate, which acts through Pauli repulsion and dispersion interactions. The second effect is mediated by metal electronics and arises due to front strain, which attenuates the donating ability of ligands and, by extension, metal electronics. Finally, we propose an effect mediated by coordination number and metal electronics, wherein increasing steric demand enforces a lower coordination number, which leads to fewer donors being present, altering electronics at the metal. Path coefficients calculated using mediation analysis allow the quantification of all these effects. These show that increasing ancillary ligand sterics to the point of enforcing a coordination number change from square-planar to T-shaped accelerates reductive elimination overall, albeit to a lesser extent than decreasing electron density at the metal center. We find that for complexes of the same coordination number, the overall influence of sterics is rate-lowering, contrary to what is described in the literature. The indirect effect of sterics through front strain is the smallest effect. Overall, we find that electronics exerts the greatest influence on the rate, followed by changes in coordination number, which primarily act through altering metal electronics. Finally, using this new-found knowledge, we were able to use the structures of complexes reported in the literature to calculate appropriate DFT descriptors and predict the rate of reductive elimination for C\u2013N, C\u2013S and C\u2013O bond formation with reasonable accuracy.", "date": "2025-04-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Organometallic; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions; Ligands (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Upon excitation, R6G\u2022* can release an electron to a substrate molecule or as a solvated electron, leading back to R6G+. However, a second reduction of R6G\u2022 is irreversible, decreasing the overall concentration of R6G\u2022 and R6G+ with time. R6G+ can also be deprotonated to R6G1 under basic conditions, and even double deprotonation to R6G2\u2013 is possible, though this may undergo irreversible reaction over time. Excitation of R6G1 leads to the formation of a photoproduct stable for seconds which then reforms R6G1. If R6G\u2022 is exposed to basic conditions in the presence of oxygen, it is oxidized to R6G+, which is then quickly deprotonated to yield R6G1 again. Hence, in basic solution R6G1 is the predominant species, so that other light-induced reaction pathways than with R6G+ are accessible. It remains to be determined whether the photoproduct of R6G1 could be beneficial for a photocatalytic application under strongly basic conditions.", "date": "2025-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The deacetylation process is generally incomplete and produces random distributions of acetylated and deacetylated units with significant variability in chain composition, which makes it difficult to understand the relation between polymer structure and properties. In principle, molecular simulations can aid in such task, and illustrate how chain composition and solution conditions influence the solubility, size, flexibility, and aggregation behavior of the polymer. However, atomistic simulations are computationally costly, and therefore generally limited to systems containing few short chains, while real materials often contain hundreds or thousands of repeating units. To extend the scope of simulations and further explore the structural and functional properties of chitosan, we developed a coarse-grained model compatible with the Martini 3 force field. This model accurately captures variations in the degree of acetylation and protonation states, enabling simulations of fully deacetylated chitosan, chitin, and intermediate forms. The model reproduces key structural properties of chitosan chains in solution, as well as their interactions with lipid monolayers and, in particular, their distinct affinities for zwitterionic and anionic monolayers. The latter, upon interaction with chitosan, show an increased tensile strength.

In this work, we demonstrate a strategically performed low-temperature heat treatment of the desodiated electrode for mitigating the pernicious structural changes in layered P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrode. An intergrowth framework forms and consists of a primary layered structure and secondary disordered rock-salt-like nano domains.

These oligomers are models for -conjugated polymers that feature donor-acceptor characteristics, and their study provides insight regarding the primary events involving exciton transfer and charge transfer that occur upon photoexcitation.  This study is focused on a series of diblock -conjugated oligomers comprising two distinct segments consisting of oligo(phenylene ethynylene) (PEn, n = 3 and 5) and tetrathiophene (T4).   The diblock oligomers are end-capped with a strongly coupled naphthalimide (NI) electron acceptor, which introduces a fluorescent intramolecular charge transfer state.  Three oligomers were synthesized and studied, T4PE3-NI, T4PE5-NI and PE5T4-NI, where T4, PEn and NI refer to the individual units and the sequence corresponds to the oligomers\u2019 structures.  We report a detailed photophysical investigation of these diblock oligomers, including the UV-visible absorption, fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.  The remarkable finding is that in a non-polar solvent environment, selective excitation of the T4PEn-NI oligomers at a wavelength corresponding to the PEn segment, leads to rapid exciton migration to the T4 segment.  By contrast, in a more polar solvent photoexcitation T4PEn-NI at the same wavelength gives rise to rapid formation of a PEn to NI charge transfer state, which then evolves into a fully charge separated state where the hole is on the T4 and the electron is on the NI unit.  The dynamics of the charge separation and charge recombination events are slower for T4PE5-NI than T4PE3-NI, indicating that the length of the oligo(phenylene ethynylene) segment plays a role in the electronic coupling across the oligomer.  The results provide new insight concerning the structure and ultrafast excited state dynamics in fully -conjugated electronic systems, and they also demonstrate the ability to control energy and charge transfer in a molecular wire by the medium polarity.", "date": "2025-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Unlike traditional models that requires multiple culture runs per regression, the MCKM extracts a complete set of 13 kinetic parameters from just a single culture run per cell line, regressing upon merely 49 data points. The MCKM thus captures inter-clonal heterogeneity, whilst also mathematically describing the lactate switch of CHO cells. By assigning a distinct kinetic profile to each cell line from a single culture run, the MCKM provides deep insights into metabolic variability, enabling data-driven cell line selection (CLS) and improving the efficiency of cell line development (CLD). This is illustrated in a case study that uses linear discriminant analysis to study the metabolic differences in highly productive and unstable cell lines. The MCKM successfully simulated 656 cell culture runs across 157 unique clonal CHO cell lines, studied across multiple passage generations, each recombinant for one of three distinct mAbs, achieving high accuracy in biomass and mAb titer (R2>0.90). The MCKM serves as a versatile tool for in-silico simulation of Ambr15\u2122 production runs across various CHO cell lines and mAbs.

This approach for synthesizing more complex molecules takes its cues from biochemical networks, where near-unit conversion of even complex carbohydrates is achieved by upgrading chemical precursors via enzymatic cascades. In this computational study we examine a simple cascade involving coupled Ag and Cu catalysts that sequentially converts CO2 to CO and then CO2 and CO to reduced products, generically named CO2Product and COProduct. The system architecture is inspired by the phenomenon of biological substrate channeling, and components are examined to evaluate their effects on conversion efficiency in the cascade. Aside from a substrate channel linking two reaction centers, we find efficient cascades must also incorporate directional substrate diffusion, compartmentalization of the reaction centers, and proper timing of substrate arrival at the active center.

However, replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 switches reactivity from N6 arylation to predominant Cvinyl arylation, as did all other combinations of catalyst, ligand, and bases that were tested. Changing the Pd source from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of chemoselectivity. Two structurally similar catalytic systems that gave selective Cvinyl and N6 arylation reactions were then used to accomplish sequential arylation of the nucleosides at the 8-vinyl and N6 moieties. To demonstrate further applications, products from these reactions were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues.

However, as microscale structures are reduced in dimension, it is possible that a ray-based framework may become inaccurate as contributions from wave-based phenomena, like diffractive effects, are expected to be increasingly important to the observed interference. Here, we employ Fourier plane imaging microscopy to analyze angle-resolved interference spectra from individual microstructures at the 10 \u03bcm scale to reveal how edge diffraction events, synergistically coupled with multibounce total internal reflection, contribute to the observed far field interference. We show that hemicylindrical microstructures on these length scales, particularly those with lower contact angles, exhibit interference signatures that cannot be fully explained by the conventional multibounce ray-based framework but align with full-wave simulations. By selectively illuminating and collecting angularly resolved interference spectra from specific regions within isolated hemicylinders, we identify and separate the contributions from light entering and exiting along different paths to the far field interference. To bridge the gap between ray-based and wave-based interpretations, we develop an extended ray model incorporating edge diffraction and use experimental data to guide our estimation of the relative intensity contributions of diffracted ray trajectories.

While monitoring gas evolution can help understand battery chemistry and predict battery performance, the complex nature of gas dynamics makes conventional mass spectrometry approaches insufficient for real-time detection. Here, we present a radically different methodology for operando analysis of gas evolution in lithium-ion batteries using optical fiber photothermal spectroscopy. By placing an optical hollow-core fiber inside the battery cell, evolved gases can rapidly diffuse into the hollow core of the fiber, enabling photothermal spectroscopy which precisely and selectively quantifies their concentrations without altering the internal operation of the cell. This approach facilitates identification of individual gaseous species, thereby enabling identification (electro-)chemical reaction pathways. Collectively, we show that the evolutions of C2H4 and CO2 are closely associated with the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase, the selection of electrolyte salts, and the inclusion of specific additives. Significantly, we confirm for the first time the spontaneous formation of CO2, which occurs exclusively in the presence of LiPF6 salt.

The performance of the proposed strut is evaluated and compared against conventional fuel injection configurations, including wedge, lobed, and diamond shaped models.

However, PEC water splitting demonstrations to date have been limited to atmospheric pressure. To bridge this gap, we designed, constructed, and tested the first high-pressure flow cell for PEC water splitting. Two different configurations are examined. First, in a back-illuminated BiVO4-based PEC cell, operating at increased pressure largely prevents the photocurrent from saturating when increasing the illumination intensity. Specifically, at a solar concentration of 10, increasing the operating pressure from 1 to 5 bar causes the photocurrent to increase from 3 to almost 7 the photocurrent under 1 sun. Direct operando imaging of the electrode surfaces confirms that this improvement is primarily caused by suppressed gas bubble evolution. Conversely, in a front-illuminated platinized triple-junction (3J) III-V-based PEC cell the photocurrent scales proportionally to the illumination intensity and does not saturate. We attribute this to the combination of the dispersed nature of the nanoparticulate Pt catalyst and the long charge carrier diffusion length in the 3J III-V material. As a result, operation at 8 bar exhibits negligible impact on photocurrent, enabling hydrogen production at elevated pressure without loss of performance.

The system is designed to maximize hydrogen recovery through sequential dark fermentation and photofermentation, leveraging glucose as the primary substrate and water as an additional electron source.\nStoichiometric modelling of the full metabolic cycle predicts a hydrogen yield of 12 mol H\u2082 per mol of glucose, representing the complete recovery of all hydrogen atoms available from the substrate and water. This equates to 13.45% yield by glucose mass, or 8.41% when including water input. The design includes membrane-based gas separation and redirection of CO\u2082 emissions to biological sinks such as sugarcane plantations, bamboo forests, and algae bioreactors to enhance sustainability and carbon offset potential.\nWhile experimental validation is pending, this model establishes an upper-bound theoretical framework for microbial hydrogen recovery and CO\u2082 integration. Emphasis is placed on idealized assumptions regarding enzyme function, microbial conversion efficiency, and gas capture. The results are intended to guide future research into scalable, decentralized biohydrogen platforms aligned with global climate goals.\n(This model defines an idealized performance ceiling and includes realism-adjusted scenarios using expression and membrane correction factors.)\n", "date": "2025-04-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Since both adsorption and absorption increase sorbent mass (vapor uptake), gravimetric and volumetric characterization methods exhibit severe limitations in isotherm interpretation. Thus, distinguishing between vapor adsorption and absorption remains a key challenge for understanding subnanometer-scale processes, which play a crucial role in many emerging applications of PIMs, including gas separation, water purification, organic solvent nanofiltration and electrochemical energy storage/conversion. Herein, we present an in situ ellipsometric approach that distinguishes between adsorption and absorption based on refractive index and thickness changes in thin PIM films.

Thus, understanding how different structural features can influence the stability of chiral axes can be an important consideration for molecular design.  Recent studies have demonstrated that certain tropone-based chiral axes are significantly more stable than those of related benzenoids, likely a result of their relatively smaller external bond angles. The following manuscript explores this phenomenon through computational and experimental studies on a simple, class 3 atropisomeric alpha-naphthyl-substituted tropone (G\u2021 ~ 32 kcal/mol).  Conditions were established for an atropselective Suzuki cross-coupling that enabled its asymmetric synthesis, and the absolute configuration of the compound was determined using vibrational circular dichroism.  Based on computational modeling, we found that the alpha-naphthyl-substituted tropone has a lower rotational energy barrier than the phenol analog, which appears to arise from the puckering ability of the tropone.  Despite the lower rotational energy barrier, the alpha-naphthyl-substituted tropone still displays high configurational stability. Thus, this new atropisomeric scaffold has the potential for incorporation into drug design and should support the development of new classes of ligands and catalysts for use in asymmetric synthesis.", "date": "2025-04-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Stereochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Unexpectedly, the effective glycan-glycan interactions decay logarithmically as the separation between them increases. Strikingly, this finding coincides exactly with the predicted interaction, which is entropic in origin, between two star polymers, consisting of long flexible polymers grafted onto colloidal particles. The weak repulsive interaction, which extends beyond the size of a glycan, is sensitive to the relative orientation of the glycans. The effective long-range repulsive interaction vanishes if the charges on water are turned off, thus establishing that electrostatic interactions, arising in part due to the persistent hydrogen bonds between water and the glycans, are responsible for the inter-glycan repulsion.", "date": "2025-04-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we used microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with MMGBSA energetic and hydrogen bonding (HB) analyses to investigate how MycMax, Omomyc, and MaxMax dimers interact with both canonical E-box and nonspecific homogeneous polyA sequences. Our MD results indicate that protein-DNA van der Waals (VDW) interactions and surface complementarity dominate the binding stability. Per-residue decomposition underscores the central role of conserved Arginine residues at the protein-DNA binding interface, while HB and information propagation or KL divergence analyses reveal a biased DNA strand association that reinforces sequence recognition for specificity. Although MaxMax binds comparatively stably the canonical E-box, it loses stability more than the other two TFs on polyA, suggesting an essential reliance of MaxMax on the E-box motif for DNA interaction coordination. MycMax exhibits moderate stability in both contexts and shows more variable dynamical responses to local DNA sequences. In contrast, Omomyc retains slightly higher binding stability than that of MycMax on Ebox and polyA DNA, suggesting an enhanced ability to sequester Myc in oncogenic settings.

In this work, the role of conserved Asn and Trp residues in catalysing this reaction are interrogated by preparing and characterizing ferryl haem analogues for the hydroxylated ferryl=oxohaem speices in N7A and W67F IsdG.  The ferryl haem form of N7A IsdG had an extremely short lifetime, and could not be detected using scanning UV/Vis absorption (Abs) spectroscopy. In contrast, the ferryl haem form of W67F IsdG could be observed with UV/Vis Abs spectroscopy, but the lifetime of the ferryl haem form of W67F IsdG (110 s) was less than half that reported for wild-type (WT) enzyme (250 s). Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization of the reaction mixture between ferric heme-bound N7A IsdG and meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) did not yield any evidence for a ferryl haem species, further suggesting that the lifetime of the ferryl haem form of N7A IsdG is extremely short.

Application to four functionally diverse IDPs\u2014ChiZ1-64, KRS1-72, Alpha-synuclein, and ICL2\u2014reveals a progressive increase in backbone rigidity and contact formation, extending beyond the conventional random coil model.

For the ionization of weakly polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs), chemical ionization at low pressure (e.g. proton- or charge-transfer) is more suitable. Negative mode ionization at ambient pressure has delivered superior performance for moderately and highly polar acidic compounds. Numerous alternative positive mode ionization techniques have been explored to detect basic and polar neutral compounds, for which negative polarity and low-pressure ionization techniques have shown insufficient performance. Several ion attachment reagents, such as ammonia and amines, have been previously proposed for more sensitive and soft ionization at ambient and reduced pressures. However, these reagents are often reactive, toxic, and difficult to control, impeding their applicability and operability. Inspired by these challenges, we explored uronium as a sensitive and robust reagent cation for ionizing moderately polar, basic, and neutral compounds at ambient pressure. Urea, a solid chemical safe to humans with negligible vapor pressure under normal circumstances, is desorbed by x-ray irradiation, forming the uronium ion. We experimentally determined the calibration factors and behavior under different humidities for several semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), amines, and ammonia, and explored the ionization characteristics using theory. In laboratory measurements of a-pinene and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation systems we characterized how uronium chemical ionization complements other ionization. Beyond excellent sensitivities to several key components (including amines, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), pyridine, N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), verbenone and dimethylformamide (DMF)) allowing detection at the low to mid parts per quadrillion per volume (ppqv) level - achieved due to uronium's tendency to selectively form strong ion-molecular clusters \u2013 and low susceptibility of these cluster formation properties to sample humidity changes, the marked benefit of uronium CIMS lies in the trivial handling of the reagent supply and long-term stability of the ion production system.

Temperature dependence of the thermal rate constants, branching ratios and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for the R1 (methyl-H-abstraction process) and R2 paths (thiol-H-abstraction process) of the OH + CH3SH polyatomic gas-phase hydrogen abstraction reaction were theoretically determined within the 200-1000 K temperature range, except the RPMD values which were only reported at the highest temperature by computational limitations. We found that while the overall thermal rate constants obtained with the VTST theory show a V-shaped temperature dependence, with a pronounced minimum near 600 K, the QCT and RPMD dynamics theories question this abrupt change at high temperatures. At 1000 K, where the RPMD theory is exact, the VTST and QCT methods overestimate the RPMD results, associated with the consideration of recrossing effects.

By comparing the results across almost forty clusters, ranging between Cu3O3 and Cu16O8, we find evidence for strong ferromagnetic coupling that is responsible for increasing the number of unpaired electrons as Cu atoms are in-cremented away from the (Cu2O)n stoichiometry. The closed shell (Cu2O)n clusters are nonmagnetic, whereas all other clusters ex-hibit a varying degree of magnetic susceptibility. The majority of the clusters considered in this manuscript have not been previous-ly evaluated. Natural bonding orbital analysis reveals a nearly linear correlation between the charge transfer between Cu and O at-oms and their local spin magnetic moments. Further, a relationship between the coordination of O atoms composing the cluster and their local magnetic moment is found.

To date, atomically-dispersed TiNx motifs have eluded synthesis due to the strong oxophilicity of Ti. Here, we leverage nitrogen-rich carbon flowers (CF) to overcome synthetic challenges and produce Ti-, N-doped carbon flower (TiCF) catalysts.

Recently, the use of metal-salt solutions has emerged as a promising approach for the VP of ceramics and metals.

Coming from one side of the mirror, we would usually like one of the competing reactions to be much faster than the other and so the question what features of transition state impede or facilitate bond formation in such settings is a matter of great interest. To address this issue, we have proposed in the past that two effects determine relative stability of the alternative transition states in \u03c0-facial selection: Cram\u2019s steric strain, and charge transfer into intrinsically electron deficient incipient bond. Here we model the donor-acceptor interactions of the incipient bond by introducing in common diastereoselection probes a low-lying, vacant NBO orbital that defines two stereogenic parameters, charge-transfer differentials and electron-affinity differentials. To test the model, we examine its explanatory and predictive power vis-\u00e0-vis effects of EWG/EDG substitution on the stereochemistry of (i) alkylation and metal hydride reduction of ketones, (ii) oxygenation of alkane C-H bonds, (iii) oxidations and 1,3dipolar cycloadditions of olefins, and (iv) cycloadditions of dienes. Depending on the extent of electronic perturbation of the probe, variation in the available log[Z]/[E] data is a linear function of charge-transfer differentials, a cubic function of electron-affinity differentials, or a function of system\u2019s electron affinity. Thus, the two transition state effects, charge-transfer stabilization and steric-strain destabilization, are indeed necessary and sufficient to account for \u03c0facial selection results in all examined reactions, including nucleophilic addition to C=O. Accordingly, an interplay of vicinal electron donation and steric strain is expected to underlie 1,2-asymmetric induction in related processes.

Over recent decades, advances in chemoselective modifications have enabled the construction of well-defined peptide scaffolds with uniform and precise molecular architectures. However, beyond chemoselectivity, achieving true site-selectivity by differentiating between identical amino acids at distinct positions within complex peptide scaffolds remains a key challenge. So far, site-selectivity of cysteine labelling has been largely restricted to N-terminal cysteines. Here, we report a programmable strategy for site-selective cysteine modifications, ultimately enabling precise control over the location of cysteine functionalization within peptides. This is accomplished by employing a triazine-thiol exchange, a dynamic covalent reaction with pH-adjustable site-selectivity.  We show that under acidic conditions internal cysteines are modified while preserving the N-terminal cysteine functionality. Conversely, at neutral pH, site-selective modification of N-terminal cysteines is achieved. The modification of N-terminal cysteines using triazine-thiol exchange proceeds via an S-N shift, which converts the dynamic linkage into an irreversible modification. Molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory computations reveal that the site-selectivity originates from modulation of the formed intermediate, providing insights for future mechanism-based designs of site-selective peptide chemistries.

Addressing this issue, we introduce a multivariate data analysis (MVDA) as an automated, data-driven approach that integrates CLD data of all scales and stages, to identify criteria for earlier, more accurate, and efficient selection of high-performing cell lines, as well as providing sophisticated knowledge on the metabolic patterns prevalent in productive, stable cell lines. CLD is a multi-scale screening process from micro-scale single-cell cloning (SSC) and well plates, to minibioreactor (MBR) production runs for screening cell line stability. The MVDA identified which early micro-scale CLD stages and what criteria provide predictive potential for disregarding more cell lines earlier on in CLD, using four historical CLD data of hundreds of CHO clonal cell lines producing three unique target mAbs. Using decision trees, we derived that the SSC and the 6-well scale-up are the most predictive early-CLD stages for cell line performance in the production runs, with generalised thresholds of  VCC_(6-well)>38% and q_(p,Beacon)<40% for safely deselecting poor-performing cell lines across various mAb targets.

Typical catalysts use high loadings of PGM (typically ~2-5 wt%) to achieve high activity. However, decreasing PGM loading to 1 wt% and below, while maintaining high activity and stability, is needed since the materials with lower loadings of Pt are known to be inferior catalysts. We show that at low Pt loadings the size of particles is small, and they are fully oxidized, which inhibits their activity and stability. We further show that we can circumvent this bottleneck and maximize the activity and stability of Pt catalysts via a simple high-temperature thermal pre-treatment that unexpectedly yields 3D metallic Pt particles that are stable and active.  The corresponding catalytic activity of these catalysts with the maximized number of active surface sites, consisting of oxidation-resistant metallic Pt surfaces, rivals the formulations with significantly higher Pt amounts (~6 times) for multiple industrially relevant reactions (H2-SCR, CO oxidation, NO oxidation, AMOX, unsaturated hydrocarbon hydrogenation).

We have recently introduced the operando Raman gradient analysis (ORGA) technique, which follows a similar approach combining operando Raman microspectroscopy with electrochemical measurements to visualise the formation of concentration gradients in the electrolytes.

Theoretical investigations based on density functional theory (DFT) predict that all REY intrinsically prefer the smaller and more ionic Ca2 site. The Ca2 site preference is less pronounced when the excess of positive charge resulting from the REY3+ for Ca2+ substitution is compensated by a coupled Na+ for Ca2+ substitution, instead of the energetically more favorable Si4+ for P5+ coupled substitution. The site preference varies quadratically with the ionic radius of REY and linearly with the sum of their first and second ionization energies. The quadratic shape of the site preference is similar to the shape of Onuma diagrams, which suggests that the local effective elastic constant of the site controls the site preference, rather than the nominal size of the site.

Traditional predictive models for DILI, typically relying on molecular descriptors and pharmacokinetic properties, are insufficient due to the complex and multifactorial nature of liver toxicity. This complexity stems from overlapping biological stress responses activated by both hepatotoxic and non-hepatotoxic compounds, making it difficult to distinguish between them accurately. Additionally, the scarcity of DILI-positive compounds in available datasets results in significant class imbalance, further limiting the efficacy of conventional predictive models. Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches incorporating molecular and bioactivity data to enhance predictive power. In this study, we developed a custom oversampling strategy tailored to handle DILI's biological complexity and class imbalance. We integrated stress pathway activations, particularly focusing on the oxidative, unfolded protein, DNA damage, heat shock, and cytokine signalling stress responses, with molecular descriptors and bioactivity profiles to improve model performance.

As a result, it surpasses state-of-the-art models by over 20% in pre\u0002dicting key computed and experimental molecular optoelectronic properties. OCNet further provides the first transferable model for predicting transfer integrals in thin films, enabling accurate mesoscale carrier mobility estimation via multiscale simula\u0002tions. By integrating tight -binding-level electronic descriptors, OCNet achieves real\u0002time, accurate prediction of device power conversion efficiency. Together, OCNet offers a unified and scalable foundation for virtual characterization of organic materials across multiple scales, with broad applicability in photovoltaics, displays, and sensing", "date": "2025-04-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Photovoltaics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While reagents have traditionally been used to effect organic redox reactions, recent advances in electrochemical methodology have offered an attractive alternative approach. In principle, the electrification of these processes could minimize stoichiometric waste, supply arbitrarily tunable potentials, and leverage sustainable energy. However, the practical realization of these advantages is hampered by the need to use organic solvents, which originates from the insolubility of typical substrates in water. As a result, many electrosynthetic reactions require superstoichiometric organic supporting electrolytes, operate under constant current conditions with limited potential control at each electrode, and function under high Ohmic resistance and therefore low efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate a biphasic aqueous-organic approach to electrosynthesis enables the efficient, metal-free, and\nselective reduction of nitrogen centers. This hybrid format combines the highly optimized performance of aqueous electrochemical platforms with the synthetic versatility of organic media. By integrating reaction and separation into a single process, we minimize byproduct formation, bypass chromatographic purification, and recycle the metal-free redox mediator \u2013 either in sequential batch experiments or in continuous flow \u2013 with minimal loss (<1% per cycle). Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that reduction proceeds through hydrogen atom transfer in a thin zone near the phase boundary, with the overall process achieving near-perfect Faradaic efficiency and high current density.

In this work, we investigate the electrical doping behavior in N2200 cathode and its Fermi level alignment with gold nanoparticles, which is used here as a model for hydrogen evolution metal cocatalyst. Through UV/visible, Raman and attenuated total-reflectance infrared spectroelectrochemistry, we observed the impact of electrical doping on the vibrational frequencies of neutral, polaron and dianion species in N2200, which suggests electron density changes within the corresponding NDI units. Upon one-electron reduction, C=O stretching frequency of the polaron unit shows a red shift by ~ 68 cm-1, indicating an increased electron density in the C=O bond.

In light-sensing cryptochromes, the photoexcitation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor triggers a cascade of electron transfer events via a tryptophan chain, eventually generating a radical pair crucial for signaling. Despite extensive studies, the initial photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from a neighboring tryptophan residue to FAD remains unclear due to the complexity of simulating all-atom dynamics in excited states, particularly regarding the roles of non-adiabatic pathways and protein environment on the reaction kinetics and quantum efficiency of the ET. To address this gap, we performed extensive non-adiabatic and adiabatic dynamics simulations with on-the-fly multireference ab initio electronic structure calculations of Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 1 (AtCRY1). Our results reveal a novel mechanism in which rapid non-radiative decay from higher-lying singlet states leads to charge separation, complementing the slower adiabatic ET on the S1 state hindered by a newly identified low-energy S1 local excitation minimum.

Analogous to extant life, which harnesses proton gradients for CO2 reduction, these vents may have facilitated early carbon fixation through electrochemical processes mediated by Fe(Ni)S minerals. To investigate the potential bottlenecks in such prebiotic scenarios, we electrochemically characterized the electron and ion conductivity of synthetic FeS, Fe(Ni)S, and Green Rust under aqueous conditions mimicking a hydrothermal vent interface, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

In this study, we focus on predicting transformation in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as they are considered to be the main barrier to prevent micropollutants from entering receiving water bodies. STPWIN, the state-of-the-art model to predict removal of organic substances in WWTPs, requires first-order degradation rate constants, which are available for a very limited number of chemicals, representing a major limitation. In this study, we propose a workaround by using data from field-scale monitoring to train structure-activity models that afford predicting removals in conventional treatment directly from chemical structure. This strategy is only possible due to advancements in high resolution mass spectrometry and machine learning, which has allowed us to build and validate over 40 different machine learning models using data for over 1000 chemicals in over 50 WWTPs.  We systematically evaluated the influence of data quality on model performance and concluded that substances, with very high variability in removal across different WWTPs, were detrimental if given high importance during training. The best predictions were achieved using substructure-based fingerprints (i.e., MACCS) and random forests. These predictions proved more reliable than existing process-based models that are widely used in EU and US regulatory contexts, especially for molecules where no experimental biotransformation kinetic data are available. This suggests that our model could be an important and novel contribution to the toolbox of in silico models used for alternatives assessment, when evaluating new molecules in industrial research and development, or even for exposure modeling in a risk assessment context. We have here established a benchmark model, which is publicly available along with the training data and the scripts necessary to reproduce the data curation process (renkulab.io/projects/fenner-labs/projects/pepper).

We propose a biocatalytic cascade to solve these issues. First, an aldolase (Fructose-6-phosphate aldolase: FSAA129S) is used to rapidly consume DHA and funnel the reaction towards another stable, non-inhibiting, and high-value product: L-erythrulose. Second, an optimized cofactor recycling is introduced (based on NADH oxidase coupled with catalase). The four enzymes can be co-immobilized onto a resin to obtain a multifunctional heterogeneous catalyst. L-erythrulose production up to 120 mM is demonstrated, with 100% selectivity.

Here, we present a parametrization of Pt-X (X = H, O, C) density functional tight-binding (DFTB) for addressing this need. We firstly constructed Pt-H, Pt-O, and Pt-C repulsive potential splines. These pair-wise parameters were then augmented to include many-body interactions using the Chebyshev Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES).  We compare the geometrical and energetic performances of both DFTB and DFTB/ChIMES methods to DFT reference data across a variety of organic molecules at platinum surface from nanoparticles to single-crystal surfaces.   DFTB shows limited transferability between extended crystal surfaces to small nanoparticles. This transferability is significantly improved through the introduction of three-body interactions with Pt in DFTB/ChIMES, which provides consistent results across the various systems, with reductions in the RMSD from around 30 kcal/mol in DFTB to around 10 kcal/mol.   We demonstrate the stability and reliability of the obtained parameters by performing metadynamics simulations for the adsorption of phenol on Pt(111). We observe that DFTB itself is undersolvating the surface, leading to only one or two chemisorbed water molecule in a c(4x6) unit cell. In contrast, DFTB/ChIMES leads to a coverage of about 0.5 ML and successfully captures the chemisorbed mode of phenol both at the solid/liquid and the solid/gas interface. Furthermore, in agreement with experimental measurements, the adsorption energy at the solid/liquid interface is significantly smaller compared to the solid/gas interface. Furthermore, we highlight that even with DFTB, where we can accumulate dynamics for more than 1 ns for a given system, the simulations are not fully converged.", "date": "2025-04-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Driven by electric fields and resisted by viscous forces, EOF is especially relevant for microfluidic applications. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for EOF of power-law fluids in fractal-like rectangular branching microchannel networks, considering both volume and surface-area constraints. Extending beyond single-channel analyses and previous numerical studies, we derive scaling laws and optimal branching strategies that integrate fluid rheology with hierarchical network geometry. The flow is modeled under the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel approximation for fully developed, steady, incompressible, and pressure-gradient free conditions. Our results reveal that shear-thinning fluids enhance electroosmotic flow rate compared to Newtonian or shear-thickening fluids, consistent with prior numerical studies. Under volume constraints, the optimal height ratio scales as \\( \\beta^* \\sim N^{-1} \\alpha^{-1} \\), where $N$ and $\\alpha$ are the branch splitting at each junction and the width ratio, respectively. We also find uniform velocity across generations at optimal volume-constraint condition. Further, the maximum normalized conductance \\( E_{\\text{vol}} \\) reaches unity, independent of geometric or rheological parameters at optimal conditions. Furthermore, under surface-area constraints, \\( \\beta^* \\sim N^{-1} \\alpha^{-n/(n+1)} \\), where \\(n\\) is the power-law index. Also, optimal \\( E_{\\text{surf}} \\) decreases with increasing \\( n \\), \\( m \\), or \\( N \\), and with increasing $\\alpha$. Notably, the voltage drop remains uniform across generations under both constraints at optimality, and the volume or surface area distribution are also uniform per generation is conserved at respective constraints. These novel scaling laws, reported for the first time for electroosmotic flow of power-law fluids in rectangular cross-section branching networks, underscore the fundamental differences between electroosmotic and pressure-driven flows. The framework offers predictive insights for designing efficient electrokinetic systems, including lab-on-a-chip platforms, biomimetic transport devices, and electroosmotic micropumps.

Heme-based enzymes like myoglobins, cytochrome P450s are known for their regio- and stereo-selective cyclopropanation reactions in aqueous media.

To address these limitations, we developed a stable, enzyme-mimicking heterogeneous catalyst using porous SBA-15 material. The inner core of SBA-15 was functionalized with an alkyl chain and protoporphyrin IX iron (III) (hemin), resulting in alkyl-SBA15-amideHemin. Characterization through TEM, UV-Vis, and FT-IR confirmed the successful immobilization of hemin within the hydrophobic pores of functionalized SBA-15. The catalytic performance of alkyl-SBA15-amideHemin was evaluated in the cyclopropanation reaction of styrene with ethyl diazoacetate (EDA), achieving a turnover number (TON) of 144\u2014nearly double that of free hemin (TON 75). The catalyst exhibited high trans diastereoselectivity (~70%) for 2-(cyclopropyl benzene) esters in aqueous media, outperforming other known heterogeneous catalysts. Its catalytic activity and selectivity were maintained over four recycling cycles, highlighting its stability and reusability. Steady-state emission studies of the iron-carbene complex provided insights into the catalytic mechanism.

Bimolecular reactions offer a challenge to quantum control, which is not encountered in the unimolecular case, due to their complex scattering dynamics and the averaging of their observables over a thermal distribution of reactant states. Our approach bypasses these hurdles; it involves the interaction of a nonresonant, polarized field with the molecular coordinate-dependent polarizability tensor to generate spatially nonuniform Stark shifts of the potential energy surfaces. We focus on the commonly encountered case, where the reaction dynamics involves complicating features such as several coupled electronic states, deep potential wells, high density of vibronic states and several transition states en route from reactants to products. We consider highly averaged observables including the canonical and microcanonical rate constants. It is shown that the complexities of polyatomic bimolecular reactions introduce new opportunities for reaction enhancement and control. In particular, the occurrence of one or more potential wells combine with the spatial structure of the polarizability tensor to introduce a vast enhancement that is subject to control by choice of the field parameters. Our results are based on a quantum mechanical theory and ab-initio calculations of the potential energy and polarizability tensor.

In this review, we firstly discuss the basic concepts behind Pickering emulsions, and summarize the strategies for tailoring Pickering emulsion catalytic systems by modifying either the solid particles or the emulsion. Next, we discuss recovery and reuse of \u201csmart\u201d Pickering emulsion catalysts. Subsequently, we review the current progress on microreactors for biomimetic catalysis.

Unlocking these hidden data through automated extraction offers an opportunity to expand enzyme dataset diversity and size, critical for building accurate, generalizable models that drive predictive enzyme engineering. To address this limitation, we built EnzyExtract, a large language model-powered pipeline that automates the extraction, verification, and structuring of enzyme kinetics data from scientific literature. By processing 137,892 full-text publications (PDF/XML), EnzyExtract curated more than 218,810 enzyme\u2013substrate\u2013kinetics entries, including 218,770 kcat and 169,459 KM values. EnzyExtract identified 94,576 unique kinetic entries (kcat and KM combined) absent from BRENDA, significantly expanding the known enzymology dataset. The newly curated dataset was compiled into a database named EnzyExtractDB. EnzyExtract demonstrates high accuracy when benchmarked against manually curated datasets and strong consistency with BRENDA-derived data. To create model-ready datasets, enzyme and substrate sequences were aligned to UniProt and PubChem, yielding 85,980 high-confidence, sequence-mapped kinetic entries. To assess the practical utility of our dataset, we retrained several state-of-the-art kcat predictors (including MESI, DLKcat, and TurnUp) using EnzyExtractDB.

While DMD looks like a promising approach, it has rarely been applied within chemistry, and neither its limits nor practical performance are well understood. In this work we evaluated the performance of DMD, based on non-eigenstates of ab initio Hamiltonians, for several realistic chemical systems: benzene, naphthalene, FeSe, and a prototypical Fe(IV)=O complex found in the active sites of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.

An important choice in optimizing RCF is the selection of solvent; however, detailed insights into solvent effects on lignin behaviors and interactions remain limited. In this work, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the solvation of lignin, solvent-mediated conformational changes, and the interaction of solvated lignin oligomers with model surfaces. We focus on the behavior of an oligomeric lignin model compound in methanol, ethanol, a binary mixture of ethanol and water, and water at both the RCF reaction temperature (473 K) and room temperature. Analysis of structural features of lignin suggests that these three organic solvent systems favorably solvate lignin, resulting in a more extended conformation suitable for catalytic conversion to valuable chemicals. We further introduce model palladium (Pd) and carbon (C) surfaces to understand how solvent choice impacts adsorption onto a representative catalytic surface and support, and to quantify the competition among the reactant and solvent molecules for the surface. Unbiased simulations suggest strong adsorption of lignin on both Pd and C surfaces at 473 K, with notable solvent-mediated differences in adsorption energies.

This challenge is widely observed across various inorganic material synthesis processes. Automating decision-making hinges on the challenge to reduce data to machine-readable metrics that accurately represent the material quality. Here we develop a machine learning (ML)-guided closed-loop platform (AutoBot) with a multimodal data fusion approach combining results from three characterization techniques to predict synthesis - property relations for the optical quality of MHP thin films in relative humidities (RHs) ranging from 5 - 55%. The efficiency of this approach is confirmed by the fast-dropping learning rate to 2% after experimentally sampling less than 1% of the possible 5,000+ combinations. The validation of predicted synthesis - property relations was done by in situ photoluminescence characterization and revealed an avenue for controlling the MHP crystallization by fine-tuning the synthesis, MACl additive, and RH. Doing so decreases the energetic barrier to form heterogeneously nucleating photo-active MHP. By adjusting the antisolvent drop time, comparable MHP film quality can be obtained in a relative humidity window between 5 - 25% lifting the need for stringent atmosphere control.

The Arrhenius equation is typically used to describe the temperature dependence of reaction rates, yet it often falls short in capturing the behavior of liquid phase reaction rates near critical points of solvents. To address this limitation, we propose a new modified Arrhenius equation that can correctly describe the temperature trends of liquid phase rate constants from room temperature up to the critical temperature of a solvent. The proposed scheme uses four kinetic parameters with physical implications, two accounting for the gas phase contribution and the other two accounting for the solvation effect on reactions. The new functional form can accurately reproduce the anomalous temperature dependence of liquid phase rate constants in subcritical and near-critical regimes that the original Arrhenius equation fails to capture. Furthermore, our preliminary finding suggests that the kinetic parameters associated with the solvation terms can be computed with ab initio approaches to estimate the temperature-dependent rate constants of liquid phase reactions based on their corresponding rate constants in gas phase.

The investigated ether PFAS include mono- and dichlorinated ones such as 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (F53-B) and 6,7-dichloroperfluoro-5-oxaheptanoic acid, as well as unsaturated ones such as sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS) and the Nafion Byproduct 1 (NBP1). The presence of chlorine-substitution and unsaturated carbon facilitated the biotransformation and defluorination of ether PFAS under anaerobic or aerobic conditions. For fully halogenated ether PFAS, biotransformation only occurred in anaerobic conditions via dechlorination (reductive, eliminative, and hydrolytic), hydrolytic O-dealkylation, and reductive defluorination, forming less fluorinated and shorter chain products. Strong evidence was obtained from community and pure culture experiments for the involvement of cobalt-enzyme-dependent microorganisms, such as Sporomusa sphaeroides, in the initial dechlorination step during the biotransformation of chlorinated ether PFAS. Meanwhile, microorganisms independent of cobalt-enzymes, such as Desulfovibrio aminophilus, were responsible for the biotransformation of non-chlorinated unsaturated ether PFAS (e.g., NBP1), especially for the hydrolytic O-dealkylation reaction. The findings provide significant insights of the fate of ether PFAS in anaerobic environments and underscore the cooperation of different microbial groups in a community to achieve further transformation and higher defluorination.

Understanding solubility at the initial stages of drug discovery is essential for reducing resource consumption and improving the probability of clinical success via prioritizing compounds with optimal solubility. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool for modeling a range of physicochemical properties, particularly solubility. MD simulations provide a detailed view of molecular interactions and dynamics, thus revealing insights into the factors influencing solubility. This research aims to statistically examine the importance of ten MD-derived properties along with LogP, one of the most influential experimental properties, on drug aqueous solubility through Machine Learning (ML) techniques. For this purpose, a dataset of 199 drugs from diverse classes were compiled from literatures and studied on MD simulation, and relevant properties extracted and selected as features. Additionally, corresponding octanol-water partition coefficients (Log P) from former studies were also imported and considered in this research. By explicit analysis, properties with the highest influence on solubility were identified. They used as input features for four machine learning ensemble algorithms, namely, Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoostRF, and Gradient Boosting. The results show that seven properties (Log P, SASA, Columbic_t, DGSolv, RMSD, AVG shell, and LJ) are highly effective in predicting solubility.

These features are critical to addressing the water-energy nexus and are foundational to a wide range of technologies involving biological or energy storage applications. However basic metrics for assessment of the features of confined water are currently absent from fundamental analyses. Proposed herein are novel metrics that are demonstrably capable of relating hydrophobic and hydrophilic isotherm types beyond the problematic classic definition of hydrophobicity. They are coherently coupled with characterization methodology which not only circumvents difficulties inherent in other analyses but also partitions surface from structural hydrophobicity and is uniquely delivered in a simple, rigorous, analytic form. Moreover, a continuous transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic behavior is uniquely captured by simplification of unified isotherm analysis which also explicitly links nine distinct adsorption equilibrium models. Subsequent application for characterization of water adsorption in 26 ostensibly hydrophobic, microporous, Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) materials demonstrates the utility of Ising-Model-Modified-Kelvin-Analysis (IMMKA). Embedded in the analysis are concepts of nanocapillarity and nanowetting which directly deliver estimates of contact angle and isosteric heat that are consistent with independent assessments. The analysis proves capable of verifying some widely accepted protocols for nominally stepwise isotherms and \u201crules of thumb\u201d involving inflection point locations which are predominantly determined by the angstrofluidic properties of water.

Steel", "abstract": "Background: Leishmania parasites cause neglected tropical diseases such as cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, which have limited treatment options and rising drug resistance. Protein kinases are pivotal in Leishmania biology and attractive drug targets, but their functional status in the parasite remains largely unexplored. Methods: We applied activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) with custom in-house cell-permeable ATP-site directed probes to map the \u201cactive kinome\u201d of Leishmania mexicana. Three related covalent probes featuring an ATP-mimetic scaffold, electrophilic warhead (targeting catalytic lysines or cysteines), and alkyne tag were synthesised to broadly capture active kinases. Live parasites were labelled with probes, followed by click-chemistry tagging, in-gel fluorescence, and tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics for kinase identification and quantification. Comparative profiling was performed across Leishmania species and life stages. Key findings were validated by competition experiments with ibrutinib and parasite viability assays. Results: We uncovered 16 metabolic kinases and 32 protein kinases spanning all major kinase families (CMGC, AGC, STE, CAMK, CK1, and NEK), including 9 protein kinase enzymes encoded by essential genes and several kinases lacking human orthologs. Notable hits included CRK1, MPK4, CK1.2, and an atypical kinase, underscoring their potential as drug targets. Conclusion: This study provides the first ABPP survey of the Leishmania kinome, revealing multiple active kinases that drive parasite survival and virulence. Our chemoproteomic approach highlights both essential protein kinases and unique metabolic kinases as a rich source of potential drug targets. These findings demonstrate that ABPP can unveil the biochemically active kinases in Leishmania, offering a new strategy for prioritizing kinase targets and accelerating kinase inhibitor development against leishmaniasis. The work lays a foundation for next-generation antileishmanial therapies directed at the parasite kinome, particularly those kinases indispensable for the parasite yet sufficiently divergent from the human host.", "date": "2025-04-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Sulfuric acid was added to a solution of ethanol in a glass flask that was heated to approximately 145 \u00b0C, promoting the formation of diethyl ether and water.

The exponential operators are also used in the coupled cluster theory (CC) and can be used to act the BCH transformation on the Hamiltonian. However, when the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian by the CC amplitude is used with multi- reference electronic structure theory, it is not known well though some researches have been conducted how it affects prediction of the electronic spectra which is experimentally important for atoms and molecules. In this study, focusing on the electronic spectra of noble-gas atoms, we investigate how an electronic structure is affected by the similarity- transformed Hamiltonian with the CC amplitude combined with multi-reference electronic structure theory.

BC in the urban atmosphere, largely emitted by diesel vehicles, is initially highly branched and fractal, but it can be restructured upon coating. Urban BC aggregates can be exposed to the components of BBOA when wildfire plumes cross the wildland-urban interface (WUI), which may partition to coat the BC. Here, we investigate the effects of laboratory-generated BBOA from pine on BC from an inverted diffusion burner. Initially 200 nm BC aggregates were selected using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and exposed to different volatility fractions of BBOA. These fractions were prepared by evaporative aging in the laboratory, which mimics evaporative aging with transport in the atmosphere, to give fresh, moderately aged, and most aged BBOA. The resulting mobility diameters with and without removal of the coating were determined using a second DMA. We find that an exceedingly small coating volume of fresh (i.e., higher volatility) BBOA causes complete restructuring while a significantly higher coating volume of most aged (i.e., lower volatility) BBOA is necessary for this same extent of restructuring. Our results highlight the importance of evaporative age of BBOA as wildfire plumes are transported across the WUI into urban environments.", "date": "2025-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Combining finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations with a newly developed phenomenological plasmon oscillation model, we elucidate how surface nanostructuring affects the wavelength of localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPPs) and the coupling between nearby donor and acceptor molecules. Surface nanocorrugation induces transverse electron oscillations along with longitudinal electron oscillations, with high- and low-intensity electric fields located near the neck and the bulb regions of the corrugated nanorods, respectively. Increasing the nanocorrugation height leads to nonlinear redshifts of LSPPs, while variations in periodicity cause anomalous shifts. The maximum redshift is observed at the periodicity where the spatial pattern of the plasmonic peak is fully in phase with the surface morphology. Additionally, the selectivity in the redshift of even- or odd-order LSPP multipoles depends on matching between the local electric field energy and the surface capacitance. Theoretical predictions show strong agreement with experimental data reported in literature. This study presents a method based on local curvature for achieving precise control in the selectivity and broad tunability of LSPPs wavelength for enhanced RET.

We observe that experimental data in public repositories like ChEMBL naturally clusters by assay origin, while retaining significant overlap between training and test sets even when using common splitting strategies. This clustering effect is notable as simply predicting the mean activity value from a training assay yields surprisingly strong performance on test compounds from the same assay. To address these observations, we propose a paradigm for ML in drug discovery that respects the inherent structure of aggregated experimental data. We implement this approach through: (1) data splitting that allocates entire assays to either training or test sets, (2) evaluation metrics that assess ranking performance within individual assays rather than absolute prediction accuracy across heterogeneous experiments, and (3) set-based ranking models trained specifically on compound sets drawn from the same assay rather than random sets. Evaluating our approach on three datasets derived from ChEMBL, we demonstrate that ranking models trained on intra-assay sets consistently outperform both traditional IC50 prediction and ranking models trained on arbitrary compound sets. This performance advantage is most pronounced when data is curated minimally, suggesting that our approach effectively mitigates inconsistencies between experiments. Our findings indicate that ML methods for drug discovery should prioritize intra-assay ranking capability over absolute value prediction when working with aggregated experimental data.

The control of the self-similar branch layer structure in HBPMAs thus synthesized was examined by measuring their linear viscoelastic moduli (G* = G' + iG\"). For all Gns having MBL = 0.25 Me, the storage modulus G' was lower than the loss modulus G\" at all \u03c9 examined. This unentangled feature was observed even when the portion of the chain spanning the two outmost ends of the branches had the molecular weight of 2.0Me, possibly because of a lack of deep penetration among those Gn chains. In contrast, for MBL \u2265 Me, G' was higher than G\" in a given range of \u03c9, and this range became wider and the relaxation mode distribution therein became broader on an increase of MBL, which is characteristic of entangled branch polymers. For the entangled HBPMA chains having the same MBL but different Gn, hierarchically self-similar relaxation based on the branch retraction mechanism was confirmed for the G' and G\" data: The data for higher Gn agreed with the data for lower Gn shifted according to this self-similarity.

Therefore, we present a tailored mixed precision (MP) scheme to leverage much of the FP32 performance of these GPUs without sacrificing the numerical accuracy in the self-consistent field (SCF) calculations. We demonstrate that our MP implementation is faster than LAPACK (intel oneMKL DSYGVD) and cuSOLVER DSYGVD diagonalization-based density matrix builds for molecules with more than 1000 basis functions in combination with the semi-empirical GFN2-xTB method. At the same time, the numerical precision of the energies and gradients is not significantly impacted by the MP scheme compared to a full double precision (FP64) treatment. This gives access to significant accelerations of semi-empirical calculations on commodity computing hardware. Going further, we show that our asynchronous GPU implementation enables running multiple SCFs in parallel on a single GPU, which enables leveraging our implementation for accelerating state-of-the-art conformational sampling procedures that are based on molecular dynamics and metadynamic simulations.", "date": "2025-04-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the physical properties of MXene thin films, consisting of stacked delaminated flakes, have been extensively studied, the intrinsic MXene properties can only be derived from individual flakes. Indeed, flake interconnectivity, intercalated species, and film morphology introduce extrinsic factors that affect charge transport and optical properties. In this work, we quantitatively characterize the intrinsic optical, structural, and transport properties of micrometer-sized Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes by employing our non-invasive, advanced spectroscopic micro-ellipsometry (SME) technique in the visible\u2013near-infrared spectral range. SME exploits back-focal-plane imaging in a reflection microscopy geometry to simultaneously capture the spectral and incidence-angle-dependent optical response of individual flakes with up to diffraction-limited lateral resolution.

Traditional antibiotic discovery methods have not kept pace with the rapidly evolving resistance mechanisms of pathogens, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a promising class of therapeutics due to their selectivity towards bacteria and slower induction of resistance compared to classical, small molecule antibiotics. However, designing effective AMPs remains challenging because of the vast combinatorial sequence space and the necessity to balance efficacy with low toxicity. Addressing this issue is of paramount importance for chemists and researchers dedicated to developing next-generation antimicrobial agents.  Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a powerful tool to revolutionize AMP discovery. By leveraging AI, we can navigate the immense sequence space more efficiently, identifying peptides with optimal therapeutic properties. This Account explores the emerging application of AI in AMP discovery, focusing on two primary strategies: AMP mining, and AMP generation, as well as the use of discriminative methods as a valuable toolbox.   AMP mining involves scanning biological sequences to identify potential AMPs. Discriminative models are then used to predict the activity and toxicity of these peptides. This approach has successfully identified numerous promising candidates, which were subsequently validated experimentally, demonstrating the potential of AI in AMP design and discovery.  AMP generation, on the other hand, creates novel peptide sequences by learning from existing data through generative modeling. This class of models optimizes for desired properties, such as increased activity and reduced toxicity, potentially producing synthetic peptides that surpass naturally occurring ones. Despite the risk of generating unrealistic sequences, generative models hold the promise of accelerating the discovery of highly effective and highly novel and diverse AMPs.  In this Account, we describe the technical challenges and advancements in these AI-based approaches. We discuss the importance of integrating various data sources and the role of advanced algorithms in refining peptide predictions. Additionally, we highlight the future potential of AI to not only expedite the discovery process but also to uncover peptides with unprecedented properties, paving the way for next-generation antimicrobial therapies.  In conclusion, the synergy between AI and AMP discovery opens new frontiers in the fight against AMR. By harnessing the power of AI, we can design novel peptides that are both highly effective and safe, offering hope for a future where AMR is no longer a looming threat.

After synthesis, IMP orientation is thought to be fixed due to the thermodynamic barrier for \u201cflipping\u201d protein loops or helices across the hydrophobic core of the membrane in a process analogous to lipid flip-flop. A notable exception is EmrE, a homodimeric IMP with an N-terminal transmembrane helix that can flip across the membrane until flipping is arrested upon dimerization. Understanding the features of the EmrE sequence that permit this unusual flipping behavior would be valuable for guiding the design of synthetic materials capable of translocating or flipping charged groups across lipid membranes. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying flipping in EmrE and derive bioinspired design rules, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques to systematically investigate the flipping of truncated segments of EmrE. Our results demonstrate that a membrane-exposed charged glutamate residue at the center of the N-terminal helix lowers the energetic barrier for flipping (from ~12.1 kcal mol-1 to ~5.4 kcal mol-1) by stabilizing water defects and minimizing membrane perturbation. Comparative analysis reveals that the marginal hydrophobicity of this helix, rather than the marginal hydrophilicity of its loop, is the key determinant of flipping propensity. Our results further indicate that interhelical hydrogen bonding upon dimerization inhibits flipping. These findings establish several bioinspired design principles to govern flipping in related materials: (1) marginally hydrophobic helices with membrane-exposed charged groups promote flipping, (2) modulating protonation states of membrane-exposed groups tunes flipping efficiency, and (3) interhelical hydrogen bonding can be leveraged to arrest flipping.

As NNPs are beginning to be used to simulate more complex systems, such as solute-solvent simulations, the question arises whether the current generation of transferable NNPs is accurate enough to reproduce condensed phase properties, which in most cases are outside the training domain of the models.

In addition, we look at selected pair correlation functions and the mean square displacement. Currently, each of the models has specific weaknesses, and seemingly small flaws lead to poor performance when applied to condensed phase simulations.

Four commercials C. vulgaris samples whose colors were dark green, light green, yellow and white, resulting from their autotroph and heterotroph cultures, were studied. The photosynthesis process was found to have significant impacts on the lipid composition and nutritional values of C. vulgaris. The dark green C. vulgaris biomass contained the highest content of lipids (10.3 % dry weight, DW) as well as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), 8.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5g/mg DW and n-3 PUFAs, 14.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5g/mg DW, principally under glycolipid forms. The light green and the yellow ones contained about one third of the quantity of ALA of the dark green one, i.e. 2.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5g/mg DW and about 2.5-2.6 times less of n-3 PUFAs compared to the dark green one. In contrast, the white one contained insignificant amounts of ALA and n-3 PUFAs, 0.2 \u00b1 0.0 and 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5g/mg DW, respectively. The LA/ALA ratio of the dark green, light green and yellow C. vulgaris were nutritionally much more interesting than the white C. vulgaris, 1.0, 4.1 and 2.9 respectively compared to 28.5.

The practical implementation of LSBs faces significant hindrances due to the shuttle effect and sluggish redox reactions. To address these challenges, single-atom catalysts (SACs) from d-block elements can offer increased active catalytic sites, rapid charge transfer, accelerated electron migration, and fast sulfur redox conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In this study, we fabricated three different LSB cathodes: pure S, S@MoS2/SnS2, and S@Fe-MoS2/SnS2.  These cathodes were then used to explore the cycle life, capacity, rate capability, and redox kinetic reactions of LiPSs, while assessing the influence of Fe-SACs on their performance. As a result, LSBs with S@Fe-MoS2/SnS2 cathodes demonstrate an extended cycle life of 1000 cycles at a C-rate of 0.2 C, maintaining a capacity close to 500 mA h g\u20131, a highest initial discharge capacity of 1622 mA h g\u20131 and 1066 mA h g\u20131 at 0.05 C and 0.2 C, and excellent rate capabilities of 708 mA h g\u20131 and 558 mA h g\u20131 at 1 C and 2 C, respectively. The synergistic effect of the Fe-SAC-based cathode (S@Fe-MoS2/SnS2) creates plentiful adsorptive and highly active catalytic sites resulting in substantially enhanced capacity for adsorbing soluble long-chain LiPSs. This facilitates ultra-fast redox kinetics, surpassing the performance of the S@MoS2/SnS2 and pure S cathodes. In the ex situ analysis, results from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) to observe the new phase, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the electronic structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with different energies (900 eV, 2000 eV, and 6000 eV) to track the chemical-state evolution of Fe-SACs cathodes displayed a notable electrochemical reversibility involving S8 \u21c4 LiPSs \u21c4 Li2S conversion even after 1000 cycles.

A key aspect of these methods is their parameterization, which not only governs the reliability of the results but also provides an opportunity to enhance their overall performance. In our previous work [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 16 (2021)], we improved the accuracy of the semi-empirical density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method for computing multiple properties of small molecules by developing the machine learning (ML) potential NN$_{\\rm rep}$ to bridge the gap between electronic DFTB components and those of the hybrid DFT-PBE0 functional.

This advancement extends the applicability of our ML-corrected DFTB approach to larger molecules and non-covalent systems, going beyond the chemical space represented in the training quantum-mechanical datasets. Indeed, the enhanced performance of EquiDTB over the standard TB methods (DFTB and GFN2-xTB) is demonstrated by the accurate computation of the atomic forces of equilibrium and non-equilibrium small molecular dimers, as well as their interaction energies. Moreover, EquiDTB can be effectively employed to explore the potential energy surfaces of large and flexible drug-like molecules---for example, to determine the minimum energy path between isomers, analyze structural transitions during dynamical simulations, compute vibrational modes, and investigate energetic rankings. Therefore, our work highlights that an optimal integration of an equivariant NN with QM datasets can advance the DFTB method to achieve DFT-PBE0 level accuracy with high computational efficiency, paving the way for more reliable (bio)molecular simulations.", "date": "2025-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative, particularly through recursive models that predict system evolution based on the past history. While these models have shown success in predicting single observables, their effectiveness in more complex tasks, such as forecasting the full reduced density matrix (RDM), remains unclear.  In this work, we extend history-based recursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four physics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting PINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii) multi-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation parameters (PMR-PINN). We apply these models to two representative open quantum systems: the spin-boson (SB) model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our results demonstrate that single-RDM-predicting models (SR-PINN and PSR-PINN) are limited by a narrow history window, failing to capture the full complexity of quantum evolution and resulting in unstable long-term predictions, especially in nonlinear and highly correlated dynamics. In contrast, multi-RDMs-predicting models (MR-PINN and PMR-PINN) provide more accurate predictions by extending the forecast horizon, incorporating long-range temporal correlations, and mitigating error propagation. Surprisingly, including  simulation parameters explicitly, such as temperature and reorganization energy, in PSR-PINN and PMR-PINN does not consistently improve accuracy and, in some cases, even reduces performance. This suggests that these parameters are already implicitly encoded in the RDM evolution, making their inclusion redundant and adding unnecessary complexity. These findings highlight the limitations of short-sighted recursive forecasting in complex quantum systems and demonstrate the superior stability and accuracy of far-sighted approaches for long-term predictions.", "date": "2025-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Their interfacial nature leads to accumulation in humans and animals via direct and indirect exposure routesAs a result, PFAS exhibit toxicity at very low levels, typically parts per billion, prompting recent legally enforceable limits by the U.S. EPA as low as 4.0 parts per trillion (ppt, ng L-1) in drinking water. The inherent stability of the carbon-fluorine bond classifies PFAS as persistent pollutants, presenting a fundamental challenge for remediation methods, which must be highly selective and efficient in the presence of other chemical species often found in relative excess. Current degradation techniques require high concentrations, necessitating a pre-concentration step for removal from sources like groundwater and enrichment for subsequent degradation reactors. Structurally, the amphiphilic nature of PFAS, with a hydrophobic fluorinated tail and a polar, hydrophilic head, leads to complex environmental distribution and challenges selective sorbent development. Adsorption can occur via weak physical interactions or stronger chemical binding (e.g., hydrogen or ionic bonds). Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), porous materials constructed from inorganic nodes and organic linkers, offer tunable internal surface chemistry potentially tailored for specific guest molecules. While several studies report efficient PFAS adsorption capacities in MOFs, most investigations focus on high concentrations (> mg L-1 range), making extrapolation to environmentally relevant, low-concentration conditions difficult due to factors like competition from dissolved species and weak interactions, especially for short-chain PFAS. More work is needed to establish structure-selectivity relationships for trace-level removal. We hypothesised that constructing multi-variate MOFs (MV-MOFs), integrating different linkers within the same framework, could enhance adsorption selectivity through potential synergistic effects. Specifically, we targeted the simultaneous interaction of the framework with the PFAS head and tail by combining hydrophobic and polar/ionisable functional groups.

This study investigates the impact of fluid motion of 5 different RPM motion modes (0 g, 0.4 g, Clinostat of different frame rates) on dispersed droplets (d32 = 0.1-70 \u03bcm) applying scaling analysis. These computations are based on well-established fluid-dynamic laws and correlations, thereby giving microgravity researchers easier tool to evaluate potential deficiencies in their study design compared to CFD. We found that the Clinostat modes (80 deg/sec; 100 deg/sec; 120 deg/sec) induce a transitional flow regime in the continuous phase, and considerate shear rates acting on the dispersed droplets. Under certain conditions, the shear rates might even impact the average particle size, representing a major corruption in study design, which must not be mistaken as an effect of simulated microgravity. On the other hand, the 0 g and 0.4 g motion modes lead to a laminar flow in the continuous phase, low shear forces, Stokes flow surrounding the dispersed droplets, little relative droplet movement, as well as neglectable forced convection and gravitational force, thus resembling a state similar to true microgravity (0 g motion mode) and partial gravity (0.4 g motion mode).", "date": "2025-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Fluid Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work we present an alternative approach to solving these problems that is based in generative machine learning models. The idea is these models either estimate a joint probability distribution of input and output variables, or are able to transform a distribution of inputs to a distribution of outputs (or vice versa). Then, by suitable conditioning (specifying desired properties of some variables), the solutions to these problems can be obtained by sampling the distribution, or by transformation of a distribution sample to the solution space. We illustrate the approach with Gaussian mixture models, which approximate the joint probability distribution. We show examples in root \ufb01nding, unconstrained and constrained optimization, parameter estimation and mapping input and output spaces.

Machine learning has emerged as a potential solution for automating structure prediction from chemical spectra, however current approaches generally fo- cus on single sensor modalities, neglecting to leverage the complementary information contained within differing spectra.

This study systematically investigates the addition of molecular modifiers in the synthesis of crystalline carbon nitride, primarily in the form of poly(triazine imide) lithium chloride (PTI-LiCl), to assess their effects on the materials\u2019 structure, optical bandgap, and photocatalytic activity for hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. Melamine and five pyrimidine-centered analogs were employed as building blocks to modify various heteroatoms within its polymeric framework. The new, modified materials were characterized with attention to the differences introduced by the monomeric modifiers and their influence on the resulting structures and compositions. Findings indicate that these modifications significantly broaden the visible-light absorption range, albeit with the gradual loss of the bulk crystalline structure. As the loading of modifiers increased beyond 50%, a predominantly amorphous form of carbon nitride emerges. XPS and SEM analyses corroborated the changes, which were attributed to modifications of the elemental composition, specifically a reduced amount of Li cations and charge-balancing Cl anions due to fewer binding sites in the intralayer cavities. In photocatalytic measurements under an ultraviolet 390 nm LED, the unmodified PTI-LiCl framework demonstrated the highest H2 evolution rate (HER; 3.44 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7h-1) at an apparent quantum yield of 5.4%, along with total water splitting at rates of 163 \u00b5mol of H2\u00b7g-1\u00b7h-1 and 75.6 \u00b5mol\u00b7O2 g-1\u00b7h-1. While PTI-LiCl showed trace activity under a visible-light 440 nm LED, all modified materials exhibited enhanced reactivity with as low as 5% molecular modifier.

Upon the formation of the hydrogen bond, electronic density is transferred from the acceptor moiety of the complex to the hydrogen atom donor, causing an elongation of the D\u2212H bond and a reduction of the force constant. Within the orbital paradigm of chemistry, the redshift of the D\u2212H stretch frequency is caused by the donation of electrons from the base lone pair to the anti-bonding, \u03c3\u2217, orbital of the D\u2212H bond. The increased electronic population of the anti-bonding orbital is, therefore, responsible for the decrease in the force constant and, consequently, for the redshift. In this work, we present a description of the H-bond redshift in terms of the electronic density, substituting the molecular orbital theory interpretation by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules with the Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) energy decomposition scheme. The results herein suggest that the energetic origin of the redshift depends on the acid structure. When H2O acts as a H donor, the redshift is mostly determined by the Intratomic and exchange-correlation, whereas the redshift of the HF stretch is caused primarily by the Coulomb contribution. The H acceptor molecule modulates 1 the amount of variation in the above-mentioned cases.

Traditional in vivo/in vitro approaches are often expensive. Moreover, during lead optimization, these methods rely heavily on the expertise of specialists, leading to efficiency challenges. Consequently, in silico methods for ADME prediction are attracting increasing attention. However, existing in silico methods face two major issues: a decline in predictive performance caused by limited ADME data and a lack of clarity regarding the rationale for lead optimization to improve ADME properties. In this study, we built an AI model capable of predicting ten different ADME parameters to overcome these challenges. Our training approach was based on a graph neural network combining multitask learning, which shares information across multiple tasks to increase the number of usable samples with fine-tuning that adapts to each task. In addition, we applied the integrated gradients method to compound data collected before and after lead optimization to quantify and interpret each input feature\u2019s contribution to the predicted ADME values. Our proposed model achieved the highest performance for seven of the ten ADME parameters compared with conventional methods. Furthermore, visualization of the changes in chemical structures before and after lead optimization revealed that the model\u2019s explanations aligned well with established chemical insights.

Recently, hemilabile STAMs experimentally demonstrate much stronger water stability, as well as improved adsorption performance under humid conditions, than the compositionally similar HKUST-1. Yet, the fundamental properties of STAMs remain largely unexplored. Herein, we apply the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine-learned potentials (MLP) based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate the physical and hydrolytic properties of STAMs functionalized with various hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups. Encouragingly, STAMs are predicted to have high mechanical strength and low heat capacity, which are desirable attributes in adsorption processes. Using MLP-MD simulations, we reveal that the Cu-paddlewheels in STAMs are generally stable even at a high water loading, despite certain defects. Moreover, we elucidate the effect of tuning the hydrophobicity of functional groups on water stability and dynamics. Particularly, hydrophobic groups impede the formation of energetically stable water pentamer and water diffusion in the hexagonal pores of STAMs. This indicates that the adsorption selectivity of polar (hydrophilic) or nonpolar (hydrophobic) solvents in the hexagonal pores can be tailored by modifying the hydrophobicity of functional groups, while adsorption in the triangular pores remains unaffected. More generally, beyond evidencing that STAMs are promising adsorbents in carbon capture and water-harvesting applications, we provide microscopic insights into hydrolytic properties, water stability and dynamics in STAMs that can potentially facilitate the design of new water-stable MOFs.

While homogeneous nucleation of crystals from solution often proceeds through non-classical pathways involving amorphous intermediates, it is unclear how seeds that promote heterogeneous nucleation reshape these mechanisms and govern polymorph selection. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that crystalline seeds can bypass the need for amorphous intermediates as nucleation sites, converting non-classical nucleation mechanisms into classical, monomer-by-monomer crystallization pathways. Using molecular dynamics simulations of zeolite synthesis, we uncover a complex reaction network of competing nucleation processes mediated by intermediate interfacial polymorphs. The interplay between thermodynamic stability and kinetic favorability of these interfacial polymorphs dictates nucleation outcomes, creating a dynamic tension between interfacial polymorph stability and crystallization rates. Furthermore, we show that the synthesis environment\u2014whether monomers or aggregates serve as reactants\u2014profoundly impacts these pathways. At moderate supersaturation, seeds eliminate amorphous intermediates and promote classical nucleation, whereas high supersaturation or aggregate-based reactants favor non-classical pathways, even in the presence of seeds. These findings establish a general framework for understanding how seeds govern crystallization mechanisms, with broad implications for controlling nucleation kinetics, polymorph selection, and material properties. While focused on zeolites, this work reveals insights that may be applicable to biominerals, pharmaceuticals, functional materials, and catalysts, providing a basis for engineering crystallization pathways in diverse applications.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Processes; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This enhancement in chemistry is often due to the elevated importance of surfaces as reaction vessels are reduced to picoliter volumes. While most studies have focused on the air-water interface of droplets, there are comparably fewer studies of reactions in micron-scale aqueous solutions encapsulated by oil. Here we investigate the condensation reaction of pyruvic acid (PA) to form zymonic acid (ZA) and water. Using microfluidics and optical trapping, chemical kinetics are measured in monodisperse micron-sized emulsions in-situ via Raman spectroscopy. Relative to a macroscopic bulk solution, which exhibits little to no reaction over many days, we find efficient production of ZA over the same time period.  A kinetic model is developed to elucidate the role of the interface in accelerating the microdroplet reaction kinetics. After quantifying the surface partitioning of PA from interfacial tension measurements, the rate coefficient for the condensation reaction at the oil-water interface is determined to be 1.8 x 10-2 M-1 s-1.  This rate coefficient is estimated to be 105 larger than the reaction rate in bulk aqueous solutions. Compared to previous studies of accelerated ZA formation at the air-water interface on nanodroplets, we find that the reaction at the oil-water interface is 20 times more efficient. Despite this difference, the overall ZA formation rate in emulsions is significantly slower than in the same-sized aerosols, which arises from the weaker partitioning of PA to the oil-aqueous relative to air-water interface. These results highlight the interplay between interfacial partitioning and reactivity in accelerating chemistry in microcompartments and provides new insights into how interfacial composition influences condensation reactions.

While two possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain its activity, the role of its topological surface states in HER remains unclear. It is indeed in question if the topological surface of this alloy is catalytically consequential. In this study, we investigate the surface termination that sustains topological surface states on PtSn4, and track their evolution during HER catalysis. We show that a reconstructed surface with a Sn-poor termination reproduces both the topological character and the scanning tunneling microscopy pattern observed in experiments. Through phase diagram and surface structure analysis, we outline the HER profile following the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. As hydrogen atoms adsorb onto the surface, the structure undergoes further reconstruction to an equilibrium phase with a coverage of two hydrides per unit cell. Meanwhile, the surface electronic bands evolve in response to interactions with the adsorbed hydrogen atoms. We propose a hybridization diagram for understanding the surface state evolution based on wavefunction and chemical bonding analyses. While the Pt atoms serve as conventional sites for hydrogen binding, the surface states of PtSn4 are essential for stabilizing the hydrogen antibonding states via in-phase electronic interactions with the Sn components. This stabilization results in frontier surface bands that are responsible for driving the HER catalysis.

However, other MS-based strategies for bacteria identifications that are based on lipids and small molecules have shown promise towards species-level identifications and detection of specific phenotypes, including those related to antibiotic resistance. While the concept of using multi-omics in diagnostic situations is not new, the issues of time and efficiency remain major hurdles to implementing multi-omics into situations that demand rapid and high-throughput analyses like clinical microbiology. We are addressing this gap by leveraging rapid, gas-phase ion mobility (IM) separations coupled to MS to simultaneously detect the lipids and metabolites in bacterial pathogens. Using flow-injection (FI) rather than liquid chromatography (LC), we instead rely more directly on the structural separations of the IM dimension to resolve features from different biochemical classes and aid in identifications. A head-to-head comparison demonstrates that the FI-IM-MS multi-omic strategy performs similarly to LC-IM-MS in its ability to distinguish 24 strains of the high-concern ESKAPE pathogens, while shortening overall analysis time from 17 min to 2 min per injection. We demonstrate that the IM dimension has excellent stability and reproducibility, which enables extracted IM peak areas to be used in lieu of chromatographic peak areas. Although the total number of features detected in the FI-IM-MS dataset is lower than the HILIC-IM-MS dataset, the overlap between the two datasets includes the features that are most heavily weighted in the PCA separation of the 24 strains. These results showcase the capabilities of mobility-enabled rapid multi-omics and open the possibility to detect subtle strain-level differences and resistance phenotypes in bacteria pathogens by including additional classes of biomolecules.", "date": "2025-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, infrared (IR) measurements, and theoretical calculations revealed the strained nature of the carbonyl group in 4. For example, the C=O stretching vibration bands of 4 observed by IR spectroscopy appeared at wavenumbers 20\u201350 cm-1 higher than that of benzophenone, with larger shifts observed for smaller ring sizes. Moreover, a M\u00f6bius topology of 4a with N = 6 in the solid state was clarified. The CPP units in 4 significantly alter the electronic properties, particularly the relative orbital energies. Due to the elevation of the occupied pi-orbitals of CPP units, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in 4 is the conjugated -system, in contrast to benzophenone, where the HOMO is the non-bonding n-orbital. Consequently, the pi-pi* transition becomes the main excited-state transition, and intersystem crossing from the S1 state to the T1 state, which is a characteristic process for typical aromatic ketones, does not occur efficiently. As a result, 4 exhibits unique photophysical properties opposite to those of typical aromatic ketones, such as fluorescing but not phosphorescing. Furthermore, the S1 state of 4 was quenched by molecular oxygen, most likely by the energy exchange mechanism. As for the electrochemical properties, 4 was found to be susceptible to oxidation despite the incorporation of an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

MrDMD uses an adapted form of singular value decomposition to identify slow and fast fluctuation modes by recursively subdividing the data. The Bergman cyclization reaction is used as a model reaction that demonstrates the chemical intuitiveness of the OT plan.

While much attention has been given to the physical impact of MPs, their molecular interactions, particularly with genetic material, remain largely unexplored. This study examines how PS and PE MPs influence the structure and stability of human alternative i-motif (iM) DNA, which plays a key role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic integrity. Using biophysical techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), FT-IR spectroscopy, and thermal melting analysis, our results have demonstrated the effects of PS-MPs and PE-MPs of different sizes on HRAS2 iM DNA. Our results reveal that PS-MPs, particularly those with a 100 nm diameter, strongly interact with HRAS2 iM DNA, causing hypochromism and shifts in the UV-Vis spectra, along with changes in secondary structure observed by CD. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed alterations in DNA conformation, and thermal melting data showed increased stability of the HRAS2 iM DNA in the presence of PS-MPs. In contrast, PE-MPs exhibited weaker interactions, likely due to differences in size and surface properties. These findings suggest that PS-MPs, due to their small size, may disrupt the structural integrity of iM DNA, potentially affecting gene regulation. This work highlights the need to consider both the physical and biochemical properties of MPs in assessing their environmental and health risks.

While n-type TCOs, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and tin dioxide (SnO2), have been extensively studied and widely adopted, the development of p-type TCOs remains an important challenge due to several factors, including their low carrier mobilities which arise from the flat valence bands of metal oxides. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the transport properties of the binary Sn(II) oxide SnO and four promising ternary Sn(II) oxides: TiSnO3, K2Sn2O3 (in both cubic and rhombo- hedral phases), and Rb2Sn2O3. Our results show that the studied ternary Sn(II) oxides exhibit carrier mobilities comparable to state-of-the-art n-type TCOs, with band gaps ranging between 2 and 3 eV. The computational methodology, which provides an exact treatment of the Boltzmann transport equation, yields excellent agreement with experimental mobility values for SnO, suggesting that experimental measurements for the ternary compounds may also follow closely our predictions. In addition, we highlight the importance of effective masses for carrier lifetimes and the number of scattering channels involved, using a new decoupling approach for the scattering rates. Finally, we reveal that in SnO, high- frequency phonon modes involving oxygen motion dominate electron-phonon interactions, while in ternary compounds, vibrational modes involving the third atomic species are also of crucial importance. These findings could offer new perspectives on mitigating these specific vibrations to reduce electron-phonon scattering and enhance transport properties in oxide semiconductors.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, previous studies have solely focused on steady-state modeling of electrochemical kinetics. Here, we perform unsteady-state MKM (USS-MKM) with and without potential sweeping to capture transient dynamics and realistically model reaction kinetics. Our analysis demonstrates that sweeping leads to accurate description of the dynamics of current-potential relationships that arise during experimental linear sweep voltammetry or staircase voltammetry measurements. The proposed approach is validated using CO reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, where good agreement is observed between our long-time USS-MKM results and previously reported steady-state MKM data. We also show that our approach leads to excellent agreement with experimental CO reduction current density data. Moreover, our proposed approach is automated, scaling to large reaction mechanisms, and enables a graphical representation of electrochemical reaction networks. Overall, by enabling USS-MKM with potential sweeping, our framework simplifies the study of complex electrocatalytic mechanisms and offers valuable insights into their operation under dynamic conditions.

In this study, we focus on the chemical mechanism used by the E2 enzyme, Ubc13, which forms polyubiquitin chains by linking a substrate Ub to Lys63 on a target ubiquitin (Ub*). Initially, Ubc13 is covalently linked to the substrate Ub. Next, Lys63 in the Ub* is deprotonated, becomes an active nucleophile, and attacks the thioester bond in the Ubc13~Ub conjugate. The deprotonation mechanism is not well understood. There are two, conserved nearby residues that may act as conjugate bases (Asp119 on Ubc13 and Glu64 on Ub*.) It is also hypothesized that the active site environment suppresses the lysine's pKa, favoring deprotonated lysine. We test these hypotheses by simulating both WT and mutant Ubc13 with constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD), which allows titratable residues to change their protonation states. We use these simulations to monitor the protonation states and to generate titration curves of lysine 63. We found that the pKa of the lysine is highly dependent on its distance from the active site. Also, mutating Asp119 or Glu64 to Ala has little effect on the lysine pKa, indicating that neither residue acts as a generalized base. Finally, we note that mutating a structural residue (Asn79 to Ala) increases the lysine pKa, suggesting that alterations to the active site hydrogen bonding network can affect nucleophile activation.", "date": "2025-04-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With this purpose, we developed a novel physics-based computational model that unravels the sodiation mechanism of HC electrodes. This model considers the explicitly 3D- resolved HC electrode microstructure at the mesoscale, operating in a half cell versus sodium metal. We have parameterized and validated this model with experimental data of the HC material (particle shape and size, skeletal density, and textural properties) and electrochemical data of the HC electrode (applied current and galvanostatic discharge profiles). Then, we used the model to investigate how manufacturing parameters (such as formulation and porosity) affect the 3D- resolved sodiation heterogeneities, impacting the electrochemical performance (e.g. capacity, potential). The influence of the C-rate was also studied with these performance descriptors. Overall, our model represents the first approach to create a flexible computational tool for researchers or engineers to assess the kinetic and transport limitations of their specific HC. Furthermore, it can help them understand the underlying sodiation phenomena taking place in their material via a direct comparison with their own galvanostatic profiles, and by considering the sodiation heterogeneities arising from the electrode\u2019s three-dimensional microstructure, supporting the ramp-up in the production of sodium-ion batteries.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we compare the performance of the RPBE-D3 and vdW-DF-cx functionals using replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) driven by machine-learned force fields. Our simulations reveal that vdW-DF-cx predicts the water density more accurately than RPBE-D3 and reproduces the isobar closely between 307-340 K. In contrast, RPBE-D3 underestimates the density across the entire temperature range. However, vdW-DF-cx predicts the maximum density temperatures to be approximately 30 K higher than experiment. Using the local structure index, we attribute this shift to an onset of low-density, ice-like structures in the vdW-DF-cx-based MD at too high temperatures. Static DFT calculations on water dimers and representative high- and low-density water structures, reveal that key features of the density isobars are reflected in the static energy-volume curves. Specifically, the equilibrium intermolecular distance and curvature correlate with the maximum density and curvature around the maximum of the density isobar. Likewise, the early onset of the low-density structure is connected to the energetic preference for more structured, low-density water over a less ordered, high-density water structure.

Furthermore, the protocol was integrated into standard solid-phase phosphoramidite oligonucleotide synthesis using riboflavin (vitamin B2) as photocatalyst in water, representing a sustainable means for the synthesis of DNA and RNA phosphorothioates.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To overcome these issues, we developed a modular autonomous platform integrating Bayesian optimization and on-line analysis. This flow electrochemical system leveraged a slug-based approach to minimize the material consumption while ensuring a fast workflow. The versatility of the platform was demonstrated in three different case studies, including a nickel-catalyzed C\u2013N cross-coupling, an anodic modification of an amino acid, and a decarboxylative alkylation of a natural product. These reactions were optimized by considering a broad range of chemical inputs, translated into different continuous and categorical variables. Furthermore, the automation of anodic reactions was achieved by implementing a gas release module. Finally, the isolation of the desired products was achieved by translating the slug conditions into continuous flow.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Being able to dissolve the network and reclaim PDMS is important, allowing us both to retrieve expensive metal ions at material's end-of-life and change properties by inserting different ions. Yet methods to realize metal removal without chemical change are unclear. We present a decantation-like method to measure the dissolution kinetics of metal-ligand coordinating network while preserving the PDMS chemical integrity. We find a similar dissolution rate regardless of dramatic mechanical response changes caused by different counterions. Compared to our reference zinc coordinated polymer, copper and higher molecular weight are shown to slow down dissolution process, while cobalt completely prevents it. The novel experimental method and results can lead to guidelines for design of dynamically adaptable metal-ligand coordination networks and specifically, for reclaimable PDMS.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Coordination polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Their mechanisms are often investigated using DFT or approximate quantum chemical methods, whose accuracy directly impacts the reliability of the simulations. Here, a comprehensive set of semiempirical molecular-orbital and tight-binding DFT approaches, along with recently developed machine learning (ML) potentials, are benchmarked against high-level MP2 reference data for a curated set of proton transfer reactions representative of biochemical systems. Relative energies, geometries and dipole moments are evaluated for isolated reactions.  Microsolvated reactions are also simulated using a hybrid QM/MM partition. Traditional DFT methods offer high accuracy in general but show markedly larger deviations for proton transfers involving nitrogen-containing groups. Among approximate models, RM1, PM6, PM7, DFTB2-NH, DFTB3 and GFN2-xTB show reasonable accuracy across properties, though their performance varies by chemical group. Strikingly, the ML-corrected ($\\Delta$-learning) model PM6-ML improves accuracy for all properties and chemical groups, and transfers well to QM/MM simulations. Conversely, standalone ML potentials perform poorly for most reactions. These results provide a basis for evaluating approximate methods and selecting potentials for proton transfer simulations in complex environments.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

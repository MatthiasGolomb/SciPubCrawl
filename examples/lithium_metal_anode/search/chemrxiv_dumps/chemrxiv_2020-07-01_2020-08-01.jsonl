Research is still ongoing to develop effective antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, to address the current outbreak, development of natural inhibitors as a prophylactic measure is an attractive strategy due to their natural diversity and safety. Phytochemicals that target viral entry (Spike glycoprotein) and replication (3CLPro) are lucrative in terms of both economy and health for the treatment of the deadly virus. In this context, this work explored natural compounds from Indian medicinal plants as potential inhibitors for containing the spread SARS-CoV-2. The phytochemicals were rationally screened from 55 Indian medicinal plants in our previous work. All atom 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed using high performance computing for 8 top scoring rationally screened phytochemicals from <i>Withania somnifera</i> and <i>Azadirachta indica </i>and two repurposed drugs against the spike glycoprotein and the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. MM/PBSA, Principal component analysis and hydrogen bond occupancy were analysed to characterize protein\u2013ligand interactions and to find the binding free energy. Biological pathway enrichment analysis was also carried out to observe the therapeutic efficacy of these phytochemicals. The results revealed that Withanolide R (-141.96 KJ/Mol) and 2,3-Dihydrowithaferin A (-87.60 KJ/Mol) were with the lowest relative free energy of binding for main protease and the spike proteins respectively. It was also observed that the phytochemicals exhibit a remarkable multipotency with the ability to modulate various human biological pathways especially pathways in cancer. Conclusively we suggest that these compounds need further detailed <i>in vivo</i> experimental evaluation and clinical validation for implementation as potent therapeutic agent for combating SARS-CoV-2.</p>", "date": "2020-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Environmental biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Next, the effect of key physical parameters on rectification performance under tunneling and hopping, like asymmetric factor, energy barrier, temperature and molecule-electrode coupling et al, were extensively evaluated, which provided a theoretical baseline for molecular diode design and performance modulation.

Our group recently determined that UiO-66 is not as inert in aqueous dispersions as previously reported in the literature.

High pressure liquid chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were used to monitor degradation of the MOF. In each buffer, the terephthalate linker was released to some extent, with a more pronounced leaching effect in the saline forms of these buffers. The HEPES buffer was found to be the most benign, whereas NEM and PB should be avoided at any concentration as they were shown to rapidly degrade the UiO-66 framework. Low concentration TRIS buffers are also recommended, although these offer minimal buffer capacity to adjust pH. Regardless of the buffer used, rapid terephthalate release was observed, indicating that the UiO-66 was attacked immediately after mixing with the buffer. In addition, the dissolution of zirconium, observed in some cases, intensified the UiO-66 decomposition process. These results demonstrate that sensitive analytical techniques have to be used to monitor the release of MOF components so as to quantify the stabilities of these materials in liquid environments.</p></div>", "date": "2020-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Organometallic Compounds", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, chemo-mechanical transformations within the bulk solid electrolyte and at solidjsolid interfaces can lead to lithium filament formation and fracture-induced failure. The interdependent role of kinetically stable interphases and electrolyte microstructures on the onset and propagation of fracture is not clearly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of interphase chemistry and microstructure on the chemo-mechanical performance of LPS electrolytes. Kinetically metastable interphases are engineered with iodine doping and microstructural control is achieved using milling and annealing processing techniques. In situ transmission electron microscopy reveals how iodine diffuses to the interphase and upon electrochemical cycling pores are formed in the interphase region. Pores/voids formed in the interphase are chemo-mechanically driven via directed ion transport. In situ synchrotron tomography reveals that interphase pore formation drives edge fracture events which are the origin of through-plane fracture failure. Active Li metal has a tendency to fill the fracture region. Cycling lithium in fracture sites leads to localized stress within the solid electrolyte which accumulates and ultimately leads to catastrophic failure. Fractures in thiophosphate electrolytes actively grow toward regions of higher porosity and are impacted by heterogenity in solid electrolyte microstructure (e.g. porosity factor).</p>", "date": "2020-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Dipolar heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (D-HMQC) is a powerful technique that can be potentially utilized to obtain <sup>1</sup>H detected 2D HETCOR solid-state NMR spectra of any NMR active nucleus. A long-standing problem in <sup>1</sup>H detected D-HMQC solid-state NMR experiments is the presence of <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>-noise which reduces sensitivity and impedes spectral interpretation. In this contribution, we describe novel pulse sequences, termed <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>-noise eliminated (TONE) D-HMQC, that suppress <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>-noise and can provide higher sensitivity and resolution than conventional D-HMQC. Monte-Carlo and numerical simulations confirm that <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>-noise in conventional D-HMQC primarily occurs because random MAS frequency fluctuations cause variations in the NMR signal amplitude from scan to scan, leading to imperfect cancellation of uncorrelated signals by phase cycling. The TONE D-HMQC sequence uses <sup>1</sup>H p-pulses to refocus the evolution of <sup>1</sup>H CSA across each  recoupling block, improving the stability of the pulse sequence to random MAS frequency fluctuations. The <sup>1</sup>H refocusing pulses also restore the orthogonality of in-phase and anti-phase magnetization for all crystallite orientations, enabling the use of  90\u00b0 flip-back or LG spin-lock trim pulses to reduce the intensity of uncorrelated signals.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce a semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approach with virtual adversarial training (VAT) of an MR classifier using 15 WFT and DFT MR diagnostics as inputs. In semi-supervised learning, only the most extreme SR or MR points are labeled, and the remaining point labels are learned.

The explosive spread of the virus and the rapid increase in the number of cases require the immediate development of effective therapies and vaccines as well as accurate diagnosis tools. The pathogenesis of the disease is triggered by the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein into ACE2-bearing host cells, particularly pneumocytes, resulting in overactivation of the immune system, which attacks the infected cells and damages the lung tissue. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with host cells is primarily mediated by the N-terminal helix of the ACE2; thus, inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for blocking the entry of the virus into host cells. In this paper, we used an in-silico approach to explore small-molecule \u03b1-helix mimetics as inhibitors that may disrupt the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. First, the RBD-ACE2 interface in the 6M0J structure was studied by the MM-GBSA decomposition module of the HawkDock server, which led to the identification of two critical target regions in the RBD. Next, two virtual screening experiments of 7236 \u03b1-helix mimetics from ASINEX were conducted on the above regions using the iDock tool, which resulted in 10 candidates with favorable binding affinities.

As demonstrated,\nthe developed sensor was employed for colorimetric detection of glucose in artificial saliva in the linear scope of 0-1 mM with\na calculated detection limit of 29.65 \u00b5M. In addition, experimental results show that quantitative analysis of glucose with the\nproposed smartphone platform could be completed in less than one minute. The app developed for the smartphone platform is\ncapable of extracting the color changing area with an embedded image processing tool which could address the problem of color\nuniformity in detection zones of \u00b5PAD. The total cost of a \u00b5PAD is less than $0.2. By integrating \u00b5PAD with a smartphone and\nuser-friendly app together, the proposed smartphone-based platform could be used for the quantitative analysis of glucose with\nadvantages such as portability, simple operation, rapid response, ultra-low cost, field-deployable, selectivity and sensitivity. The\nresults show that the integrated platform has great potential to be used for non-invasive measurement of glucose in body fluids\nlike a tear, sweat and saliva.", "date": "2020-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Photoswitches are a versatile class of molecule for medical and renewable energy applications where a molecule's efficacy is governed by its electronic transition wavelengths. We demonstrate superior performance in predicting these wavelengths compared to both time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), the incumbent first principles quantum mechanical approach, as well as a panel of human experts.

Identification of the potential targets\nand development of a vaccine or antiviral drugs is an urgent demand. The 5\u2019-capping\nmechanism of eukaryotic mRNA and some viruses such as coronaviruses (CoVs) are essential\nfor maintaining the RNA stability, protein translation, and for viral immune escape.

The present article\nhighlights the binding mechanisms of nsp16 and nsp10 to identify the role of nsp10 in MTase\nactivity. Furthermore, the conformational dynamics and energetic behind the SAM binding to\nnsp16 in its monomer and dimer form was analyzed by using an extensive molecular dynamics\nsimulation along with the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area\n(MM/PBSA). Our results show that the presence of nsp10 increases the favorable van der Waal\nand electrostatic interactions between the SAM and nsp16, thus nsp10 acts as a stimulator for\nits strong binding. The interaction profile suggests that hydrophobic interactions were\npredominately identified for protein-protein interactions. Also, the stable hydrogen bond\nbetween Ala83 (nsp16) and Tyr96 (nsp10), and between Gln87 (nsp16) and Leu45 (nsp10)\nplays a vital role in the nsp16-nsp10 interface.

Most commonly, alginate gelation occurs via calcium mediated\nelectrostatic crosslinks between the linear polyuronic acid polymers. A recent\nbreakthrough to form crosslinked alginate microcapsules (CLAMs) by in situ\ngelation during spray drying (\u201cCLAMs process\u201d) has demonstrated applications in\nprotection and controlled delivery of bioactives in food, cosmetics, and\nagriculture. The extent of crosslinking of alginates in CLAMs impacts the\neffectiveness of its barrier properties.

Crosslinking in CLAMs can be controlled by varying the calcium to\nalginate ratio; however, the choice of alginates used in the process also influences\nthe ultimate extent of crosslinking. To understand how to select alginates to\ntarget crosslinking in CLAMs, we examined the roles of alginate molecular properties.\nA surprise finding was the formation of alginic acid in the CLAMs that is a\nconsequence of simultaneous and rapid pH reduction and moisture removal that occurs\nduring spray drying. Thus, spray dried CLAMs gelation is due to calcium\ncrosslinking and alginic acid formation, and unlike external gelation methods, is\ninsensitive to the molecular composition of the alginates. The \u2018extent of\ngelation\u2019 of spray dried CLAMs is influenced by the molecular weights of the\nalginates at saturating calcium concentrations.

For example, 19 of 20 natural amino acids are L-chiral but deoxyribose sugars in DNA are always D-chiral. Meanwhile, right-handed helices are ubiquitous in nature. Are these two phenomena intrinsically correlated? Here, we propose that homochirality of amino acids and nucleotide sugars is originated from the handedness of helices. We show that right-handed 3<sub>10-</sub>helix and alpha-helix favor the L-chiral form for amino acids, but for deoxyribose sugars right-handed helices prefer the D-chiral form instead. Our analyses unveil that there exist strong cooperativity effects dominated by electrostatic interactions. This work not only resolves the mystery of homochirality by providing a unified explanation for the origin of homochirality in proteins and DNA using helical secondary structures as the root cause, but also ratifies the Principle of Chirality Hierarchy, where chirality of a higher hierarchy dictates that of lower ones.

Despite extensive literature on cyanine dye aggregates, design principles that drive the solution self-assembly to a preferred H- or J-aggregated state are unknown. We present a general approach to tune the thermodynamics of self-assembly, selectively stabilizing H- or J-aggregates and thereby achieving supramolecular control over aggregate photophysics.

Cryptochrome photoactivation is achieved through a cascade of electron transfer events leading to formation of a long-lived spin-correlated radical pair. The electron transfer cascade is initiated by photoexcitation of the FAD cofactor and subsequent electron transfer through three conserved tryptophan residues, the so-called tryptophan triad. Presence of ATP was shown to increase the yield of the semireduced form of FAD. While electron transfer through the tryptophan triad is well characterized by both theoretical and experimental methods, the effects of ATP binding are still not well understood. The present work aims to unravel the mechanism of ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer in a cryptochrome protein with a focus on effects of ATP on the FAD photoreduction process. Photoinduced electron transfer is described by means of state-of-the-art theoretical methods: a hybrid quantum-classical polarizable embedding scheme is utilized to accurately parameterize a generalized local excited/charge transfer state system-bath model Hamiltonian and the photoinduced electron transfer process is described by a semiclassical path integral-based dynamics method.

This is particularly true if multiple levels of theory have to be tested to establish their relative accuracy, if highly expensive quantum mechanical approximations are of interest, and also if several different temperatures have to be considered. We present an ab initio approach that effectively couples perturbation theory and machine learning to make ab initio free energy calculations more affordable. Starting from results based on a certain production ab initio theory, perturbation theory is applied to obtain free energies. The large number of single point calculations required by a brute force application of this approach are here significantly decreased by applying machine learning techniques. Importantly, the training of the machine learning model requires only a small amount of data and does not need to be performed again when the temperature is decreased. The accuracy and efficiency of this method is demonstrated by computing the free energy of activation of the proton exchange reaction in the zeolite chabazite. Starting from an ab initio calculation based on a semilocal approximation of density functional theory, free energies based on significantly more expensive non-local van der Waals and hybrid functionals are obtained with only a few tens of additional single point calculations. In this way this work paves the route to quick free energy calculations using different levels of theory or approximations that would be too computationally expensive to be directly employed in molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations.</div>", "date": "2020-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Quantum Computing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Stimulated by host-guest interactions, these  so-called soft porous crystals can display counterintuitive adsorption phenomena such as negative gas adsorption (NGA). NGA materials are bistable frameworks where the occurrence of a metastable overloaded state leads to pressure amplification upon a sudden framework contraction. How can we control activation  barriers and energetics via functionalization of the molecular building blocks that dictate the frameworks\u2019\n30 mechanical response? In this work we tune the elastic and inelastic properties of building blocks at the\n31 molecular level and analyze the mechanical response of the resulting frameworks. From a set of 11 frameworks, we demonstrate that widening of the backbone increases elasticity, while elongation of the building blocks results in a decrease in critical yield stress of buckling. We further functionalize the backbone\nby incorporation of sp3  hybridized carbon atoms to soften the molecular building blocks, or stiffen them with\nsp2 and sp carbons. Computational modeling shows how these modifications of the building blocks tune the\n36 activation barriers within the energy landscape of the guest-free bistable frameworks. Only frameworks with\nfree energy barriers in the range of 800 to 1100 kJ mol\u20131 37 per unit cell, and moderate yield stress of 0.6 to\n38 1.2 nN for single ligand buckling, exhibit adsorption-induced contraction and negative gas adsorption. Advanced experimental in situ methodologies give detailed insights into the structural transitions and the adsorption behavior. The new framework DUT-160 shows the highest magnitude of NGA ever observed for nitrogen adsorption at 77 K.

In such calculations, when the simulation cell has non-zero charge, electrical neutrality has to be imposed and this is often done via a uniform background charge of opposite sign (`jellium'). This artificial neutralization does not occur in reality, where a different mechanism is followed as in the example of a charged electrode in electrolyte solution, where surrounding electrolyte screens the local charge at the interface. The neutralizing effect of surrounding electrolyte can be incorporated within a hybrid quantum-continuum model based on a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, where the concentrations of electrolyte ions are modified to achieve electroneutrality. Among the infinite possible ways of modifying the electrolyte charge, we propose here a physically optimal solution which minimizes the deviation of concentrations of electrolyte ions from those in open boundary conditions (OBCs). This principle of correspondence of PBCs with OBCs leads to the correct concentration profiles of electrolyte ions and electroneutrality within the simulation cell and in the bulk electrolyte is maintained simultaneously, as observed in experiments. This approach, which we call the Neutralization by Electrolyte Concentration Shift (NECS), is implemented in our electrolyte model in the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT code which makes use of a bespoke highly parallel Poisson-Boltzmann solver, DL_MG. We further propose another neutralization scheme (`accessible jellium') which is a simplification of NECS.

However, the ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (UHR-MS)-based non-target identification of the organohalogens remains challenging due to the presence of vast number of halogenated and non-halogenated organic molecules in the same aqueous sample. In this study, a new  algorithm, namely NOMDBP Code, was developed, based on natural organic matter (NOM)  chemistry, to simultaneously identify organohalogens and non-organohalogens from the UHR-MS spectra of natural and engineered waters. In addition to isotopic pattern extraction, for the first time, three optional filter rules (namely selection of minimum non oxygen heteroatoms, inspection of newly formed halogenated disinfection byproducts [X23 DBPs] and precursors) were incorporated in our code, which can accurately identify DBPs associated peaks and further elucidate the X-DBPs generation and transformation mechanisms. The formulae assignment rate against previously reported 2,815 unique organohalogens and their 11,583 isotopologues was determined to be >97%. Application of our algorithm to disinfected NOM indicated that oxygen-containing X-DBPs species accounted for a majority of X-DBPs. Further, brominated X-DBPs (Br-DBPs) during disinfection process were characterized by higher degree of unsaturation compared to chlorinated X-DBPs (Cl-DBPs). Our algorithm also suggested that, in addition to electrophilic substitution and electrophilic addition reactions, the decomposition/transformation is another important mechanism in Br-DBPs formation. Results of this study highlight the superior potential of this code to efficiently detect yet- unknown organohalogens (including organohalogens with non-oxygen heteroatoms) in a non-target manner and identify their generation mechanism during the disinfection process", "date": "2020-07-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Harmful algae blooms (HABs) are a common ecosystem-level response to such pollution that is detrimental to both aquatic life and human health and that generates economic losses (e.g., property values and lost tourism). Waste treatment and management technologies are not well established practices due, in part, to the difficulty to attribute economic value to associated social and environmental impacts of nutrient pollution. In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify the economic impacts of HABs. We demonstrate the advantage of quantifying these impacts through a case study on livestock waste management in the Upper Yahara watershed region (in the state of Wisconsin, USA). Our analysis reveals that every excess kilogram of phosphorus runoff from livestock waste results in total economic losses of 74.5 USD. Furthermore, we use a coordinated market analysis to demonstrate that this economic impact provides a strong enough incentive to activate a nutrient management and valorization market that can help balance phosphorus within the study area.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the potential of using trace elemental profiling coupled with chemometric and other statistical techniques to link a variety of different sparklers to their origin. Inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the concentration of 50 elements in 48 pre-blast sparkler samples from eight sparkler brands/classes available in Australia. Extracting ground-up sparkler residue in 10% nitric acid for 24 hours was found to give the most reliable quantification. The collected data were analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualise the distribution of the sample data and explore whether the sparkler samples could be classified into their respective brands. ANOVA based feature selection was used to remove elements that did not significantly contribute to the separation between classes. This resulted in the development of a 7-elemental profile, consisting of V, Co, Ni, Sr, Sn, Sb, W, which could be used to correctly classify the samples into eight distinct groups. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was subsequently used to construct a discriminant model using four out of six samples from each class.

In low-polarity solvents, the former molecule forms a folded 7-membered ring conformation with an intramolecular hydrogen bond, while the latter molecule forms a 14-membered ring through double intramolecular hydrogen bonds between two diamide units. Spectroscopic studies revealed that both folded states are thermodynamically unstable and eventually transform into more energetically stable supramolecular polymers. Importantly, compared to the alanine-based diamide, the cystine-based dimeric diamide exhibits a superior kinetic stability in the metastable folded state, as well asan increased thermodynamic stability in the aggregated state. Consequently, spontaneous transformation from the folded state into the aggregated state is retarded even under the conditions of rapid molecular diffusion. Accordingly, the initiation of supramolecular polymerization can be regulated via a seeding approach under microfluidic mixing conditions. Furthermore, the supramolecular polymer composed of the cystine-based dimeric diamide has a helical structure with an enhanced chiral excitonic coupling between the transition dipoles of the pyrene units.

Hemoproteins have recently emerged as promising biocatalysts for the formation of C\u2014N bonds via carbene transfer, but asymmetric N\u2014H carbene insertion reactions using these or other enzymes have so far been elusive. Here, we report the successful development of a biocatalytic strategy for the asymmetric N\u2014H carbene insertion of aromatic amines with 2-diazopropanoate esters using engineered variants of myoglobin. High activity and stereoinduction in this reaction could be achieved by tuning the chiral environment around the heme cofactor in the metalloprotein in combination with catalyst-matching and tailoring of the diazo reagent. Using this approach, an efficient biocatalytic protocol for the synthesis of a broad range of substituted aryl amines with up to 82% ee was obtained. In addition, a stereocomplementary catalyst useful to access the mirrorimage form of the N\u2014H insertion products was identified.

However, conventional rt-TDDFT Ehrenfest dynamics for nuclear movement lacks a few critical features to describe many problems: the detail balance between state transition, decoherence for the wave function evolution, and stochastic branching of the nuclear trajectory. There are many-body formalisms to describe such nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, especially the ones based on mixed quantum/classical simulations, like the surface hopping and wave function collapsing schemes. However, there are still challenges to implement such many-body formalisms to the rt-TDDFT simulations, especially for large systems where the excited state electronic structure configuration space is large. Here we introduce two new algorithm for nonadiabatic rt-TDDFT simulations: the first is a Boltzmann factor algorithm which introduces decoherence and detailed balance in the carrier dynamics, but uses mean field theory for nuclear trajectory. The second is a natural orbital branching (NOB) formalism, which use time dependent density matrix for electron evolution, and natural orbital to collapse the wave function upon. It provides decoherence, detailed balance and trajectory branching properties. We have tested these methods for a molecule radiolysis decay problem. We found these methods can be used to study such radiolysis problem in which the molecule is broken into many fragments following complex electronic structure transition paths.

Tcholakova", "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of lipid excipients in both academic research and oral formulation development, rational selection guidelines are still missing. In the current study, we aimed to establish a link between the molecular structure of commonly used polar lipids and drug solubilization in biorelevant media. We studied the effect of 26 polar lipids of the fatty acid, phospholipid or monoglyceride type on the solubilization of fenofibrate in a two-stage <i>in vitro</i> GI tract model. The main trends were checked also with progesterone and danazol.<br />Based on their fenofibrate solubilization efficiency, the polar lipids can be grouped in 3 main classes. Class 1 substances (n = 5) provide biggest enhancement of drug solubilization (>10-fold) and are composed only by unsaturated compounds. Class 2 materials (n = 10) have an intermediate effect (3-10 fold increase) and are composed primarily (80 %) of saturated compounds. Class 3 materials (n = 11) have very low or no effect on drug solubilization and are entirely composed of saturated compounds.<br />The observed behaviour of the polar lipids was rationalized by using two classical physicochemical parameters: the acyl chain phase transition temperature (<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) and the critical micellar concentration (CMC). Hence, the superior performance of class 1 polar lipids was explained by the double bonds in their acyl chains, which: (1) significantly decrease <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>, allowing these C18 lipids to form colloidal aggregates and (2) prevent tight packing of the molecules in the aggregates, resulting in bigger volume available for drug solubilization. Long-chain (C18) saturated polar lipids had no significant effect on drug solubilization because their <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> was much higher than the temperature of the experiment (<i>T</i> = 37 C) and, therefore, their association in colloidal aggregates was limited. On the other end of the spectrum, the short chain octanoic acid manifested a high CMC (50 mM), which had to be exceeded in order to enhance drug solubilization. When these two parameters were satisfied (C > CMC, <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> < <i>T</i><sub>exp</sub>), the increase of the polar lipid chain length increased the drug solubilization capacity (similarly to classical surfactants), due to the decreased CMC and bigger volume available for solubilization.<br />The hydrophilic head group also has a dramatic impact on the drug solubilization enhancement, with polar lipids performance decreasing in the order: choline phospholipids > monoglycerides > fatty acids.<br />As both the acyl chain length and the head group type are structural features of the polar lipids, and not of the solubilized drugs, the impact of <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> and CMC on solubilization by polar lipids should hold true for a wide variety of hydrophobic molecules. The obtained mechanistic insights can guide rational drug formulation development and thus support modern drug discovery pipelines.<br />", "date": "2020-07-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Biophysical Chemistry; Self-Assembly; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Indeed, copper redox activity is essential to maintaining normal physiological responses spanning neural signaling to metabolism, but at the same time copper misregulation is associat-ed with inflammation and neurodegeneration. As such, chemical probes that can track dynamic changes in copper with spatial resolution, espe-cially in loosely-bound, labile forms, are valuable tools to identify and characterize its contributions to healthy and disease states. In this report, we present an activity-based sensing (ABS) strategy for copper detection in live cells that preserves spatial information by a copper-dependent bioconjugation reaction. Specifically, we designed copper-directed acyl imidazole (CD) dyes that operate through copper-mediated activation of acyl imidazole electrophiles for subsequent labeling of proximal proteins at sites of elevated labile copper to provide a permanent stain that resists washing and fixation. To showcase the utility of this new ABS platform, we sought to characterize labile copper pools in the three main cell types in the brain: neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Exposure of each of these cell types to physiologically relevant stimuli shows distinct changes in labile copper pools. Neurons display translocation of labile copper from somatic cell bodies to peripheral processes upon activation, whereas astrocytes and microglia exhibit global decreases and increases in intracellular labile copper pools, respectively, after exposure to inflam-matory stimuli. This work provides foundational information on cell type-dependent homeostasis of copper, an essential metal in the brain, as well as a starting point for the design of new activity-based probes for metals and other dynamic signaling and stress analytes in biology.", "date": "2020-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Imaging; Biochemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report a palladium-catalyzed [3+2] reaction that utilizes C(sp<sup>3</sup>)\u2013H activation to generate the three-carbon unit for formal cycloaddition with maleimides. We implemented a strategy where the initial C(sp<sup>3</sup>)\u2013H activation/olefin insertion would trigger a relayed, second remote C(sp<sup>3</sup>)\u2013H activation to complete a formal [3+2] cycloaddition.

It is, therefore, crucial to be able to\nroutinely characterise the atomic structure in nanomaterials, and a\npromising method for this task is Pair Distribution Function (PDF)\nanalysis. The PDF can be obtained through Fourier transformation of x-ray total scattering data, and represents a histogram of\nall interatomic distances in the sample. Going from the distance\ninformation in the PDF to a chemical structure is an unassigned\ndistance geometry problem (uDGP), and solving this is often the bottleneck in nanostructure analysis. In this work, we propose to\nuse a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to automatically\nsolve the uDGP to obtain valid chemical structures from PDFs.

Here, we present the BioMetAll predictor that is based on a different postulate: the formation of a potential metal-binding site is related to the geometric organization of the protein backbone. We first report the set of convenient geometric descriptors of the backbone needed for the algorithm and their parametrization from a statistical analysis. Then, the successful benchmark of BioMetAll on a set of more than 50 metal-binding X-Ray structures is presented. Because BioMetAll allows structural predictions regardless of the exact geometry of the side chains, it appears extremely valuable for systems which structures (either experimental or theoretical) are not optimal for metal binding sites. We report here its application on three different challenging cases i) the modulation of metal-binding sites during conformational transition in human serum albumin, ii) the identification of possible routes of metal migration in hemocyanins, and iii) the prediction of mutations to generate convenient metal-binding sites for de novo biocatalysts.

By combining static and femtosecond infrared, Raman, and hyper-Raman\nspectroscopy with<i> ab initio </i>molecular\ndynamics simulations, we find the vibrational coupling of the bending mode\ndiffers significantly from the stretch mode: the intramode intermolecular\ncoupling of the bending mode is very weak, in stark contrast to the stretch\nmode. Our results elucidate the vibrational energy transfer pathways of water.\nSpecifically, the librational motion is essential for the vibrational energy\nrelaxation and orientational dynamics of H-O-H bending mode.</p>", "date": "2020-07-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Gilson", "abstract": "Rigorous binding free energy methods in drug discovery are growing in popularity due to a combination of methodological advances, improvements in computer hardware, and workflow automation. These calculations typically use molecular dynamics (MD) to sample from the Boltzmann distribution of conformational states. However, when part or all the binding site is inaccessible to bulk solvent, the time needed for water molecules to equilibrate between bulk solvent and the binding site can be well beyond what is practical with standard MD. This sampling limitation is problematic in relative binding free energy calculations, which compute the reversible work of converting Ligand 1 to Ligand 2 within the binding site. Thus, if Ligand 1 is smaller and/or more polar than Ligand 2, the perturbation may allow additional water molecules to occupy a region of the binding site. However, this change in hydration may not be captured by standard MD simulations and may therefore lead to errors in the computed free energy. We recently developed a hybrid Monte Carlo/MD (MC/MD) method, which speeds the equilibration of water between bulk solvent and buried cavities, while sampling from the intended distribution of states. Here, we report on the use of this approach in the context of alchemical binding free energy calculations. We find that using MC/MD markedly improves the accuracy of the calculations and also reduces hysteresis between the forward and reverse perturbations, relative to matched calculations using only MD with or without the crystallographic water molecules.

The strength of the sophisticated descriptors lies in their ability to linearize structure-property relationships, to the point that a simple linear ridge regression performs just as well as the kernel-based machine-learning model for our small dicopper data set.

However, predictions of the exact nature of the amorphous phase and its effect on material properties are still elusive. Thorough structure-property investigations of well-known model systems are thus necessary before predictive control of useful material properties is obtained. In this work, we fabricate a series of photodeposited nickel (oxy)hydroxide (NiO<sub>x</sub>) thin films and anneal them at  temperatures up to 1000 <sup>o</sup>C. EXAFS, XRD and XPS are used to determine the local structure, allowing us to correlate it to measured electrochemical properties.

Above 400 <sup>o</sup>C a cubic NiO XRD diffraction pattern is detected. Electrochemically, we find a stepwise increase of the onset overpotential at this transition, indicating a change in potential-determining step and possibly OER reaction mechanism. The Tafel slope decreases linearly with annealing temperature, which we attribute to a decrease in (Ni)OOH reaction intermediary coverage, supported by <i>in-operando</i> UV-Vis electrochromism. Furthermore, we find that the (Ni)OOH coordination is increasingly strained with annealing temperature, which manifests in higher electrochromic coloring rates and lower binding energies. We identify this as the root cause of the lowered intermediary coverage. Thus, nano-crystalline NiO should kinetically be a superior catalyst to amorphous Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

Preclinical experiments reveal 4 (PF-00835231) as a potent inhibitor of CoV-2 3CLpro with suitable pharmaceutical properties to warrant further development as an intravenous treatment for COVID-19.", "date": "2020-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The general intermolecular mechanism for the autocatalytic activation of zymogens is governed by the single-enzyme, single-substrate catalyzed reaction following the Michaelis-Menten mechanism of enzyme action, where the substrate is the zymogen and the product is the same enzyme that is catalyzing the reaction. In this article we investigate the nonlinear chemical dynamics of the intermolecular autocatalytic zymogen activation reaction mechanism. In so doing, we develop a general strategy for obtaining dimensionless parameters that, when sufficiently small, legitimize the application of the quasi-steady-state approximation. Our methodology combines energy methods and exploits the phase-plane geometry of the mathematical model, and we obtain sufficient conditions that support the validity of the standard, reverse and total quasi-steady-state approximations for the intermolecular autocatalytic zymogen activation reaction mechanism. The utility of the procedure we develop is that it circumnavigates the direct need for a priori timescale estimation, scaling, and non-dimensionalization. At the same time, a novel result emerges from our analysis: the discovery of a dynamic transcritical bifurcation that exists in the singular limit of the model equations. Moreover, associated with the dynamic transcritical bifurcation is an imperfect term. We prove that when the imperfect term vanishes and the singular vector field is perturbed, there exists a canard that follows a repulsive slow invariant manifold over timescales of <i>O</i>(1). This is the first report of such a solution for the intermolecular and autocatalytic zymogen activation reaction. By extension, our results illustrate that canards also exist in the classic single enzyme, single-substrate reversible Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism.</td></tr></table>", "date": "2020-07-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Biocatalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis; Biophysical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The S-protein, a trimer made up of several\nsubdomains, develops the crucial function of recognizing the ACE2 receptors on the surface of human cells, and sub-\nsequent fusioning of the virus membrane with the host cell membrane.

The use of identical experimental conditions allowed at studying the role of the fuel on the DLFC performance, providing thus reference values for future investigations. Under regular, non-oscillatory regime, we observed for all cases that the overpotential decreases as the temperature increases mainly because water activation on the catalyst surface is facilitated at high temperatures. By mapping the conditions where oscillatory kinetics manifest itself under galvanostatic mode, only the electro-oxidation of dimethyl ether did not exhibit potential oscillations. The relationship between oscillatory frequency and temperature during the methanol and formic acid electro-oxidation followed a conventional Arrhenius dependence, whereas with ethanol there was no straightforward trend, and temperature compensation prevails. The atypical behavior found for ethanol was addressed in terms of its main electrocatalytic poisons: adsorbed CO and acetate.

Their unique pore structures of molecular dimensions and tunable compositions make them ideal for shape selective catalysis and separation. However, targeted synthesis of zeolites with new pore structures and compositions remains a key challenge. Here, we propose a novel approach based on a unique 3D-3D topotactic transformation, which takes advantage of weak bonding in zeolites. This is inspired by the structure transformation of PST-5, a new aluminophosphate molecular sieve, to PST-6 by calcination at 500 \u00b0C. The structure of PST-5 was determined from micrometer-sized crystals by 3D electron diffraction (3DED, also known as MicroED). We found that the 3D-3D topotactic transformation involves two types of building units where penta- or hexa-coordinated Al is present. We applied this approach to several other zeolite systems and predicted a series of new zeolite structures that would be synthetically feasible. This method provides a new concept for the synthesis of targeted zeolites, especially those which may not be feasible by conventional methods.", "date": "2020-07-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Solid State Chemistry; Structure; Crystallography; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Notably, electrode wettability will increase as lower surface tension products (e.g., formic acid, alcohols) are introduced into electrolyte streams potentially leading to flooding. To understand the hydraulically stable operating envelopes in mixed aqueous-organic liquid domains, we connect intrinsic electrode wettability descriptors to operating parameters such as electrolyte flow rate and current. We first measure contact angles of water-organic dilutions on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and graphite surfaces as planar analogues for GDE components. We then use material balances around the reactive gas-liquid interface to calculate product mass fractions as functions of water sweep rate and current. Product composition maps visualize the extent to which changes in cell performance influence capillary pressure, a determinant of GDE saturation. Analyses suggest that formic acid mixtures pose little risk for GDE flooding across a wide range of conditions, but effluents enriched with less than 30% alcohol by mass may cause flooding. This study reveals opportunities to integrate microstructural features and oleophobic surface treatments into GDEs to repel aqueous-organic mixtures and expand the window of stable operating conditions.<br />", "date": "2020-07-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Fluid Mechanics; Reaction Engineering; Electrocatalysis; Fuels - Energy Science; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As of July 7th, 2020, almost seven months into the outbreak, there are no approved vaccines and few treatments available. Developing drugs that target multiple points in the viral life cycle could serve as a strategy to tackle the current as well as future coronavirus pandemics. Here we leverage the power of our recently developed <i>in silico</i> screening platform, VirtualFlow, to identify inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2. VirtualFlow is able to efficiently harness the power of computing clusters and cloud-based computing platforms to carry out ultra-large scale virtual screens.  In this unprecedented structure-based multi-target virtual screening campaign, we have used VirtualFlow to screen an average of approximately 1 billion molecules against each of 40 different target sites on 17 different potential viral and host targets in the cloud. In addition to targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, we also target critical auxiliary sites such as functionally important protein-protein interaction interfaces. This multi-target approach not only increases the likelihood of finding a potent inhibitor, but could also help identify a collection of anti-coronavirus drugs that would retain efficacy in the face of viral mutation. Drugs belonging to different regimen classes could be combined to develop possible combination therapies, and top hits that bind at highly conserved sites would be potential candidates for further development as coronavirus drugs. Here, we present the top 200 <i>in silico</i> hits for each target site. While in-house experimental validation of some of these compounds is currently underway, we want to make this array of potential inhibitor candidates available to researchers worldwide in consideration of the pressing need for fast-tracked drug development.</p>", "date": "2020-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Mulliken population analysis is historically the most important method to calculate atomic charges and is still widely used. One basic hypothesis of this method is the half-and-half partition of the overlap populations, Q(\u03bc, <i>v</i>), into equal charges in orbitals \u03bc and <i>v</i>. This partition preserves the monopole moment of the overlap density but, other than that, is arbitrary. In this work we derive a new population analysis (which we designate Mulliken-Dipole population analysis) based on the conservation of both the monopole moment and the dipole moment along the bond direction. Test calculations show that the Mulliken-Dipole atomic charges are in accord to the chemical intuition; also they are very different from the Mulliken ones, being quite similar to the Hirshfeld atomic charges. Mulliken-Dipole atomic charges are conceptually appealing and very easy to calculate. In a further step, we also show how this Mulliken-Dipole population analysis can be used to derive atomic charges for atomistic simulations that reproduce the total dipole moment of the molecule, yielding at the same time a good description of the local charges and dipole moments for the molecular fragments.<br />", "date": "2020-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Few recent studies, addressing the interaction behavior at the heterojunction, consider charge transfer between the constituents (SWNT and SLG) to be responsible for changes in the electronic and vibrational properties in their hybrid system. We report the effect of various factors, arising due to the interactions between atoms of SWNT and SLG, on the structural and vibrational roperties of hybrid nanostructures investigated computationally within the framework of tight-binding DFT. These factors such as the van der Waal\u2019s (vdW) forces, structural deformation and the charge transfer, are seen to affect the Raman active phonon frequencies of SWNT and SLG in the hybrid nanostructure. These factors are already known to affect the vibrational properties on SWNT and SLG separately and in this work, we have explored their role and interplay between these factors in hybrid systems. The contribution of different factors to the total shift observed in phonon frequencies are estimated and it is perceived from our findings that not only the charge transfer but the structural deformations and the vdW forces also affect the vibrational properties of components within the hybrid, with structural deformation being the leading factor. With decreasing separation between SWNT and SLG, the charge transfer and the vdW forces, both increase. However, the increase in vdW forces is relatively much higher and likely to be the main cause for larger Raman shifts observed at smaller separations.", "date": "2020-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Carbon-based Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Yet the methodology has seen limited adoption in the field of ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS), as traditional approaches typically require large, target-specific training sets, which limits their value in most prospective applications. Here, we report the development of a neural network architecture, and a learning framework designed to yield a generally applicable tool for LBVS. Our approach uses the molecular graph as input, and involves learning a representation that places compounds of similar biological profiles in close proximity within a hyperdimensional feature space; this is achieved by simultaneously leveraging historical screening data against a multitude of targets during training. Cosine distance between molecules in this space becomes a general similarity metric, and can readily be used to rank order database compounds in LBVS workflows. We demonstrate the resulting model generalizes exceptionally well to compounds and targets not used in its training. In three commonly employed LBVS benchmarks, our method outperforms popular fingerprinting algorithms without the need for any target-specific training. Moreover, we show the learned representation yields superior performance in scaffold hopping tasks, and is largely orthogonal to existing fingerprints. Summarily, we have developed and validated a framework for learning a molecular representation that is applicable to LBVS in a target-agnostic fashion, with as few as one query compound.

However, if the ab initio QM/MM level of accuracy is required for the PMF, it can be formidably expensive even with the most advanced enhanced sampling methods, such as umbrella sampling. To ameliorate this difficulty, we developed a novel method for the computation of free energy profile based on the reference-potential method recently, in which a low-level reference Hamiltonian is employed for phase space sampling and the free energy profile can be corrected to the level of interest (the target Hamiltonian) by energy reweighting in a nonparametric way. However, when the reference Hamiltonian is very different from the target Hamiltonian, the calculated ensemble averages, including the PMF, often suffer from numerical instability, which mainly comes from the overestimation of the density-of-states (DoS) in the low-energy region. Stochastic samplings of these low-energy configurations are rare events. If a low-energy configuration has been sampled with a small sample size N, the probability of visiting this energy region is ~ 1/N (shall be exactly 1/N for a single ensemble), which can be orders-of-magnitude larger than the actual DoS. In this work, an assumption of Gaussian distribution is applied to the DoS in each CV bin, and the weight of each configuration is rescaled according to the accumulated DoS. The results show that this smoothing process can remarkably reduce the ruggedness of the PMF and increase the reliability of the reference-potential method.", "date": "2020-07-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Quantum Mechanics; Statistical Mechanics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we developed LYTACs that engage the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), a liver-specific lysosomal targeting receptor, to degrade membrane proteins in a tissue-specific manner.

To address this problem, efficient implementations of linear-scaling coupled-cluster methods, which employ the systematic molecular fragmentation (SMF) approach, are reported. In this study: (1) to achieve exact linear-scaling and to obtain a pure ab inito approach, we revise the handling of nonbonded interactions in the SMF approach (2) a new fragmentation algorithm, which yields smaller sized fragments; hence, better fits high-level CC methods is introduced (3) the new SMF approach is integrated with the high-level CC methods, denoted by LSSMF-CC, for the first time.

Our results demonstrate that the LSSMF approach introduces negligible errors compared with the canonical methods, mean absolute errors (MAEs) are between 0.20\u20130.59 kcal mol-1 for LSSMF-CCSD(T). To further assess the accuracy of the LSSMF-CCSD(T) approach, we also consider several polyethylene (PE) models.

Overall, we conclude that (1) the LSSMF-CCSD(T) method can be reliably used for large scale chemical systems, where the canonical methods are not computationally affordable (2) the LSSMF-CCSD(T) method is very promising for accurate computation of energies in macromolecular systems (3) we believe that our study is a significant milestone in developing CC methods for large-scale chemical systems.</p>", "date": "2020-07-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Efficient computations can minimize the efforts by identifying a subset of drugs that can potentially bind to the COVID-19 main protease or target protein (M<sup>PRO</sup>). The results of computations are accompanied by an evaluation of their accuracy, which depends on the details described by the model used. Neural network models trained on millions of points and with unmatched accuracies are the best approach to employ in this process. In this work, I first identified and described the interaction sites of the M<sup>PRO</sup> protein using a geometric deep learning model. Second, I conducted virtual screening (at one of the sites identified) on FDA-approved drugs and selected 91 drugs with the highest binding affinities (below -8.0 kcal/mol). Then, I conducted 10 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using classical force fields and classified 37 drugs to be binding (including Lopinavir, Saquinavir, and Indinavir) based on the RMSD between MD-binding trajectories. To drastically improve the dynamics profile of the 37 selected drugs, I used the highly accurate neural network force field (ANI) method trained on coupled-cluster method (CCSD(T)/CBS) data points and performed 1 ns of binding dynamics for each drug with the protein. Using this approach, 19 drugs were qualified based on their RMSD cutoffs, and based on free energy (ANI/MM/PBSA) computations, 7 of the drugs were rejected. The final selection of 12 drugs was validated based on an MD trajectory clustering approach where 11 of the 12 drugs (Targretin, Eltrombopag, Rifaximin, Deflazacort, Ergotamine, Doxazosin, Lastacaft, Rifampicin, Victrelis, Trajenta, Toposar, and Indinavir) were confirmed to exhibit binding. Further investigations were performed to study their interactions with the protein and an accurate 2D-interaction map was generated.

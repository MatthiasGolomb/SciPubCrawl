Pyroptosis is an immunomodulatory form of regulated cell death that is mediated by the pore-forming action of the gasdermin protein family, and has been linked to various diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infection. Targeting pyroptosis therefore could have potential therapeutic benefit, for instance, via the inhibition of its execution. In this regard, marine-derived compounds can offer possible novel structures and scaffolds by which potential pyroptosis inhibitors can be designed. In this study 153 mareine-derived compounds were investigated for their in silico interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome NACHT domain through molecular docking, ADMET profiling, and key interaction analysis. Docking of the compounds on the target protein based on a previously solved co-crystal structure yielded binding free energy (BFE) values between\u201310.8 to 82 kcal/mol. Interactions of the top-performing compounds with critical protein residues were predominantly non-covalent in nature and displayed a great degree of similarity to the co-crystalized inhibitor. The top performing compounds also displayed drug-likeness with varying levels of toxicity risks based on ADMET analysis, and (S)-6\u2019-debromohamacanthin was determined to have the most potential having zero Lipinski violations and exhibiting no toxicity risks.", "date": "2023-06-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Extending the methodology to fully unbiased straight chain aliphatic substrates, in which all the available positions are sterically and statistically equally probable for functionalization and in which the Thorpe-Ingold effect loses its significance, has been a long-standing problem. To this aim, we developed a ligand enabled orthogonal selectivity between the proximal \u03b3 and distal \u03b4 positions of such fully unbiased straight chain aliphatic amines in a regioselective fashion. These straight chain alkyl amines, though both \u03b4 and \u03b3 positions are equally probable for functionalization, can be orthogonally functionalized between these two positions just by changing the ligand, all other reaction parameters remaining constant; signifying the immense importance of ligand in controlling the selectivity between the aforementioned positions of such inert aliphatic C(sp3)\u2012H bonds. Experimental as well as DFT studies have been carried out to generalize the nature of ligand that would be promoting the orthogonal selectivity between these positons, with electron-rich pyridone ligands favoring selective distal \u03b4 functionalization while electron-deficient pyridone ligands tuning the selectivity favorably towards the \u03b3 position.

However, obtaining SSEs with high ionic conductivity is challenging due to the complex structural information and the less-explored structure-performance relationship. To provide a solution to these challenges, developing a database containing typical SSEs from available experimental reports would be a new avenue to understand the structure-performance relationships and find out new design guidelines for reasonable SSEs. Herein, a dynamic experimental database containing >600 materials was developed in a wide range of temperatures (132.40 to 1261.60 K), including mono- and divalent cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+, Ag+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) and various types of anions (e.g., halide, hydride, sulfide, and oxide). Data-mining was conducted to explore the relationships among different variates (e.g., transport ion, composition, activation energy, and conductivity). Overall, we expect that this database can provide guidelines for the design and development of high-performance SSEs in ASSB applications.

Blue-moon ensemble and deep potential molecular dynamics simulations reveal that epoxide-functionalization leads to stronger hydrogen bonding involving hydroxyl groups. Synthesized branched PEI samples with and without propylene-oxide (PO) functionalization are characterized using DSC, NMR relaxometry, and fluorescent probes, demonstrating that PO-functionalization significantly reduces BPEI mobility. These findings suggest that the enhanced oxidative stability of epoxide-functionalized PEI can be attributed to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups, which restrict the mobility of PEI and decelerate mobility-dependent radical propagation reactions responsible for polymer degradation.

Hence, developing set-ups enabling to combine heating and milling is an important target, which has been looked into in both academic and industrial laboratories. Here, we report a new approach for heating up reaction media during ball-milling reactions, using induction heating (referred to as i-BM). Our set-up is attractive not only because it enables a very fast heating of the milling medium (reaching \u224880 \u00b0C in just 15 s), and that it is directly adaptable to commercially-available milling equipment, but also because it enables heating either the walls of the milling jars or the beads themselves, depending on the choice of the materials which compose them. Importantly, the possibility to heat a milling medium \u201cfrom the inside\u201d (when using for example a PMMA jar and stainless steel beads) is a unique feature compared to previously proposed systems. Through numerical simulations, we then show that it is possible to finely tune the properties of this heating system (e.g. heating rate and maximum temperature reached), by playing with the characteristics of the milling system and/or the induction heating conditions used. Lastly, examples of applications of i-BM are given, showing how it can be used to help elucidate reaction mechanisms in ball-milling, to synthesize new molecules, and to control the physical nature of milling media.", "date": "2023-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Protons associated with paired Al sites were exclusively exchanged with divalent cobalt, while isolated protons remained intact and readily quantified through Hofmann elimination of adsorbed alkylammonium species. Through a combination of temperature-programmed methods and spectroscopic characterization, the stability of the adsorbed alkylammonium was found to be crucial to the accurate estimation of isolated protons. Only alkylammonium species undergoing Hofmann elimination through a primary carbocation were found to exclusively probe isolated protons on the surface of cobalt-exchanged ZSM-5. More stable secondary and tertiary carbocations typically used in the characterization of acid sites, resulted in significant overestimates of protonic site densities. The result is contrary to purely protonic zeolites, where alkylammonium stability is inconsequential to the quantification of the acid sites they are coordinated with. Consequently, n-propylamine was found to be a suitable reactive probe molecule for the quantification of isolated protonic sites on divalent metal-cation zeolite surfaces, forming n-propylammonium upon adsorption. Ensuring accurate probing of isolated protons on the surface of metal cation exchanged zeolites was also demonstrated to require control of ion-exchange conditions and sufficient extent of zeolite exposure to the adsorbing n-propylamine. The fraction of paired Al sites in ZSM-5 was measured to systematically increase with Al content, ranging between 6 and 63 % across a Si/Al of 140 and 11.5, respectively.

Hundreds of NIR-emissive AgN-DNAs have been recently discovered, but their structure-property relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate 19 different far-red and NIR emissive AgN-DNA species stabilized by 10-base DNA templates, including several well-studied emitters whose compositions and chiroptical properties have never been reported before. The molecular formula of each purified species is determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry and correlated to its optical absorbance, emission, and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. We find that AgN-DNAs emissive at the far red/NIR spectral border are either 6-electron clusters or 8-electron clusters. 8-electron AgN-DNAs are stabilized by two DNA oligomer copies, while three different ligand compositions are observed for 6-electron AgN-DNAs: two oligomer copies, three oligomer copies, or two oligomer copies with additional chlorido ligands. Distinct optical and chiroptical signatures correlate with ligand composition of 6-electron AgN-DNAs. AgN-DNAs with three oligomer ligands exhibit shorter Stokes shifts than AgN-DNAs with two oligomers, and the presence of chlorido ligands is correlated with increased Stokes shifts and significantly suppressed visible CD transitions. Nanocluster electron count also significantly influences electronic structure and optical properties, with 6-electron and 8-electron AgN-DNAs exhibiting distinct absorbance and CD spectral features.

However, our knowledge on the mechanism of photocatalysis enhancement at SAC-modified photocatalysts is still rather limited, which makes the rational design of high-performance photocatalysts based on SACs challenging. Herein, a series of photocatalysts for aerobic degradation of pollutants based on anatase TiO2 modified with various low-cost, non-noble SACs (vanadate, Cu and Fe ions) is reported. The most active SAC-modified photocatalysts outperform not only TiO2 modified with corresponding metal oxide nanoparticles, but also the state-of-the-art benchmark photocatalysts, such as platinized TiO2 or commercial P25 powders. A combination of in-situ EPR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the best-performing photocatalysts modified with Cu(II) and vanadate SACs exhibit significant differences in the mechanism of activity enhancement, in particular with respect to the rate of catalysis of oxygen reduction. The superior performance of vanadate SAC-modified TiO2 is found to be related to the shallow character of the SAC-induced intragap states, which allows for both effective extraction of photogenerated electrons and fast catalytic turnover in reduction of dioxygen, and translates directly into diminished recombination.

Here, we show that simply mixing unmodified ATP with AzoDiGua, an azobenzene-guanidium compound with photodependent nucleotide binding affinity, results in the spontaneous self-assembly of the two non-fluorescent compounds into photoreversible, micrometer-sized and fluorescent aggregates. Obtained in water at room temperature and physiological pH, these supramolecular structures are dynamic and respond to several chemical, physical and biological stimuli, resulting in a multi-stimuli control of the suspension turbidity and aggregate fluorescence. The presence of azobenzene allows a fast and photoreversible control of their assembly upon cycles of UV (395/25 nm) and blue (480/30 nm) irradiation of moderate power. ATP chelating properties to metal dications enable ion-triggered disassembly and fluorescence control with valence-selectivity. Finally, the supramolecular aggregates are disassembled by alkaline phosphatase in a few minutes at room temperature, resulting in enzymatic control of fluorescence through ATP hydrolysis.

We consider negatively-charged virgin and bleached hair surface models with different grafting densities of neutral octadecyl and anionic sulfonate groups. The adsorption of cationic cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactants from water are studied above the critical micelle concentration. The simulated adsorption isotherms suggest that cationic surfactants adsorb to the surfaces via a two-stage process, initially forming monolayers and then bilayers at high concentrations, which is consistent with previous experiments. Anionic surfactants weakly adsorb via hydrophobic interactions, forming only monolayers on both virgin and medium bleached hair surfaces. We also conduct non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, which show that applying cationic surfactant solutions to bleached hair successfully restores the low friction seen with virgin hair. Friction is controlled by the combined surface coverage of the grafted lipids and the adsorbed CTAB molecules. Treated surfaces containing monolayers and bilayers both show similar friction, since the latter are easily removed by compression and shear. Further wetting MD simulations show that bleached hair treated with CTAB increases the hydrophobicity to similar levels seen for virgin hair. Treated surfaces containing CTAB monolayers with the tailgroups pointing predominantly away from the surface are more hyrophobic than bilayers due to the electrostatic interactions between water molecules and the exposed cationic headgroups.", "date": "2023-06-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Fibers; Surfactants; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we apply the latter to both covalent and non-covalent ligands in complex with Mpro. Strikingly, our experiments show that occupation of both active sites of the dimer originates from an excess of ligands. Indeed, co-crystals obtained using a 1:1 ligand/protomer stoichiometry leads to single occupation only. The empty binding site exhibits a catalytic-inactive geometry in solution, as suggested by molecular dynamics simulations.

Perhaps most important among the changes that can made to a peptide to allow its use in a biological setting is macrocyclisation, which has beneficial impacts on target affinity, selectivity, stability, and cell permeability. However, introducing macrocyclisation into a linear sequence is unlikely to be successful unless the sequence is already primed to adpot an appropriate conformation. As a result it is important to include cyclisation already at the discovery stage, meaning there is a need for more diverse cyclisation options that can be deployed in the context of peptide display techniques such as mRNA display. In this work we show that meta-cyanopyridylalanine can be ribosomally incorporated into peptides, forming a macrocycle in a spontaneous and selective reaction with an N-terminal cysteine generated from bypassing the initiation codon in translation. This reactive amino acid can also be easily incorporated into peptides during standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis, which can otherwise be a bottleneck in transfering from peptide discovery to peptide testing and application. We demonstrate the potential of this new method by discovery of macrocyclic peptides targeting influenza haemagglutinin, and molecular dynamics simulation indicates the mCNP cross-link stabilises a beta sheet structure in a representative of the most abundant cluster of active hits.

Solid-state 31P NMR revealed that the addition of Aquivion\u00ae eliminated or significantly reduced phosphate ester formation in phosphoric acid ionomers and this plays a vital role in enhancing ionomer blend conductivity.

The extended \u03c0- conjugation causes a dramatic red-shift in the absorption spectra: the absorption maxima of the fused dimer and trimer appear at 1188 nm and 1642 nm, respectively (for the nickel complexes dissolved in toluene). The coordinated metal in the dimer was changed from Ni to Mg, using p-tolylmagnesium bromide, providing access to free-base and Zn complexes. These results open a versatile avenue to longer \u03c0-conjugated nanoribbons with integrated metalloporphyrin units.

Coarse-graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of loosing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates.  Here, we address this issue by systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1 while performing systematic measurements on a PEG-H2O mixture at two different  levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when  compared to AA calculations, but with a systematic offset.  This offset is due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intra-monomer component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers.

As the efficacy is often impaired by harsh dynamic oral environments, e.g., continuous flow of saliva and friction of moving maxillofacial muscles, a rapid remineralization is expected to avoid or diminish these influences. But there has been a great dilemma to address this expectation, as the stabilizers used for preparation and storage of these materials, in turn, could resist their transformation during remineralization. Here, by dissolving the ions of calcium and phosphate in mixed solvents of glycerol and water, we found a stable species with ultrasmall size (1-2 nm), termed glycerol stabilized calcium phosphate cluster (GCPC), which can perform a fast enamel repair via the water-triggered transformation in both static or dynamic environments. The high permeability and water-responsive character allow GCPC to easily enter the nano-/micro-sized enamel defect sites and transform into HAP nanorods immediately, going through a special intermediate\u2014amorphous calcium phosphate nanowire, whose subsequent crystallization product (the nanorods) stands vertically to them and enamel surface. Both in vitro and in vivo studies display that, GCPC forms a compact HAP repair layer within a short time (30 min), which is much faster than the conventional materials (hours or days), and recovers mechanical properties to the values close to those of sound enamel. Moreover, a double-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial based on in situ model further demonstrates an excellent remineralization efficiency of GCPC in the real human oral environment. Given its rapid repair capacity, simple preparation process, low cost and remarkable biocompatibility, GCPC is promising for large-scale preparation and clinical applications in dental remineralization.", "date": "2023-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

There is a need for more sensitive techniques to measure intracellular copper levels to have a better understanding of the role of copper homeostasis in neuronal disorders. Here we report a reaction-based near-infrared (NIR) ratiometric fluorescent probe CyCu1 for imaging Cu2+ in biological samples. High stability and selectivity of CyCu1 enabled the probe to be deployed as a sensor in a range of systems, including SH-SY5Y and neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, it can be used in plant cells, reporting copper added to Arabidopsis roots. We also used CyCu1 to explore Cu2+ levels and distribution in postmortem brain tissues from patients with the Lewy body disorder, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We found significant decreases in Cu2+ content in the nuclei, cytoplasm, neurons and extraneuronal space in the degenerating substantia nigra (SN) in DLB compared with healthy age-matched control tissues. These findings enhance our understanding of Cu2+ dysregulation in Lewy body disorders. Our probe also shows promise as a photoacoustic imaging agent, with potential for applications in bimodal imaging.", "date": "2023-06-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This abstract provides a summary of the properties affected by Al, Nd, and Sm doping in TiO2 and their impact on DSSCs and PSCs. Al, Nd, and Sm doping in TiO2 have shown improvements in various properties critical to solar cell performance. The reduction of non-stoichiometric oxygen-induced defects through doping results in the removal of deep electronic traps and sub-bandgap states, leading to an increase in the conduction band. This modification contributes to enhanced charge transport and reduced recombination rates within solar cell devices. Furthermore, the doping process facilitates the passivation of oxygen defects, which plays a crucial role in improving the stability of PSCs. Nd doping has shown promising results in enhancing device stability without compromising short-circuit current. The simple and scalable processing techniques employed for doping TiO2 with these elements make them viable for large-scale production. The achieved efficiencies in DSSCs and PSCs vary depending on the specific calculation methods used, including preconditioning bias, voltage scan speed, and direction. Nevertheless, studies have reported significant efficiency improvements with optimal doping concentrations. For instance, a maximum efficiency of 18.2% was recorded in PSCs with 0.3% Nd doping in TiO2, where maximum values for current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were obtained.", "date": "2023-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Unfortunately, 1, was stable in the gut of antibiotic-treated animals but was rapidly degraded by gastrointestinal micoflora in the normal gut preventing its use to prevent CDI. We hypothesized that the source of the instability was the amide group. To explore this hypothesis, we removed the amide by either converting it to an amine or to 5,6-fused heterocycles. We found that reduction of the amide to an amine resulted in a significant loss of activity, but conversion to benzimidazole (6a), benzothiazole (6b), or benzoxazole (6c) gave compounds with good antigermination activity.  Exploration of other sterane groups such as chenodeoxycholate and deoxycholate gave active compounds only for the benzimidazole series. Examination of 6b showed that it was stable for 24 hours in the presence of feces taken from healthy mice validating the hypothesis that an amide bioisostere would increase the stability of the compound. Mice treated with 6a and 6b also showed no signs of toxicity up to 300 mg/kg daily for 7 days. Each compound was tested for its ability to prevent CDI in a murine model.

It is well known that the insertion of protons thermodynamically stabilises \u03b3-MnO2 with respect to \u03b2-MnO2. Protons can enter the structure either by forming groups of 4 hydroxyls around a Mn4+ vacancy, called a Ruetschi defect, or by forming a hydroxyl group near a Mn3+ ion, called a Coleman defect. These defects differently affect the electrochemistry of manganese oxide, and tailoring their amount in the structure can be used to tune the material properties. Previous studies have addressed the proton insertion process, but the role of the synthesis pathway on the amount of defects created is not well understood. We here investigate how the parameters in a hydrothermal synthesis of \u03b3-MnO2 nanoparticles influence the amount and type of H-related defects.

Due to their complexity, analysis with untargeted approaches is favorable, which typically use high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) rather than low-resolution  mass spectrometry (LRMS). The advantages of HRMS were evaluated here by thoroughly testing untargeted techniques and available online resources. By applying data-dependent acquisition on real-life urine samples, 27 features were annotated with spectral libraries, 88 with in silico fragmentation, and 113 by MS1 using PhytoHub, an  online database containing >2000 polyphenols. Moreover, other exogenous and endogenous molecules were  screened to measure chemical exposure and a potential metabolic effect using the Exposome-Explorer database,  yielding an additional 144 annotated features. Additional polyphenol-related features were explored using various non-targeted analysis techniques including MassQL for glucuronide and sulfate neutral losses, and MetaboAnalyst for statistical analysis. As HRMS typically suffers a sensitivity loss compared to state-of-the-art LRMS used  in targeted workflows, this gap between the two instrumental approaches was quantified in three spiked human  matrices (urine, serum, plasma) as well as real-life urine samples. Both instruments showed feasible sensitivity, with median limits of detection in the spiked samples being 10 - 18 ng/mL for HRMS and 4.8 - 5.8 ng/mL for LRMS.  The results demonstrate that despite its intrinsic limitations, HRMS can readily be used for comprehensively investigating human exposure. In the future, this work is expected to allow for linking human health effects with  polyphenol exposure, and toxicological mixture effects with other xenobiotics.

In this work we reveal, for the first time, the direct effect of the replisome enzymes on proton transfer, rectifying the shortcomings of existing models. Multi-scale quantum mechanical/molecular dynamics (QM/MM) simulations reveal the effect of the bacterial PcrA Helicase on the double proton transfer in the GC base pair. It is shown that the local protein environment drastically increases the activation and reaction energies for the double proton transfer, modifying the tautomeric equilibrium.

Jones", "abstract": "Aminopolymer-based sorbents are preferred materials for extraction of CO2 from ambient air (direct air capture of CO2, or DAC) owing to their high CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity at ultra dilute conditions. While those adsorptive properties are important, the stability of a sorbent is a key element in developing high-performing, cost-effective, and long-lasting sorbents that can be deployed at scale. Along with process upsets, environmental components such as CO2, O2, and H2O may contribute to long-term sorbent instability. As such, unraveling the complex effects of such atmospheric components on sorbent lifetime as they appear in the environment is a critical step to understanding sorbent deactivation mechanisms and designing more effective sorbents and processes. Here, PEI/Al2O3 sorbent is assessed over continuous and cyclic dry and humid conditions to determine the effect of the co-presence of CO2 and O2 on stability at an intermediate temperature of 70 \u00b0C. Thermogravimetric and elemental analysis in combination with in situ HATR-IR spectroscopy are performed to measure the extent of deactivation, elemental content, and molecular level changes in the sorbent due to deactivation. The thermal/thermogravimetric analysis results reveal that incorporating CO2 with O2 accelerates sorbent deactivation using these sorbents in dry and humid conditions compared to CO2-free air in similar conditions. In situ HATR-IR spectroscopy results of PEI deactivation under a CO2-air environment show the formation of primary amine species in higher quantity (compared to conditions without O2 or CO2), which arise due to C-N bond cleavage at the primary and secondary amine due to oxidative degradation. We hypothesize the formation of bound CO2 species such as carbamic acids catalyze C-N cleavage reactions in the oxidative degradation pathway by shuttling protons, resulting in a lower activation energy barrier for degradation, as probed by metadynamics simulations. In the cyclic experiment after 30 cycles, results show a gradual loss in stability (dry: 29%, humid: 52%) under CO\u00ac2 containing air (0.04% CO2/21% O2 balance N2). However, the loss in capacity during cyclic studies is significantly less than continuous deactivation as expected.

There are many examples of successful rebridging cases providing homogeneous conjugates due to the use of symmetrical reagents, such as dibromomaleimides.

The identity of the chemisorbed species varies upon experimental conditions like amine chemistry, support material, CO2 loading, and humidity, forming a variety of carbonyl-type sites. 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is often used to help elucidate the identity of the chemisorbed species however the chemical shift range for carbonyl sites is small and comparable to observed chemisorbed 13C peak widths. Herein, application of a 2D chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) recoupling pulse sequence (ROCSA) is used to obtain CSA tensor values at each isotropic chemical shift, overcoming the isotropic peak resolution limitation. CSA tensor values describe the local chemical environment and can readily differentiate between chemisorbed products. To aid this experimental technique, we also developed a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classification model to distinguish chemisorbed compounds via their CSA tensor parameters. The combination of 2D CSA measurements coupled with a KNN classification model enhances the ability to accurately identify chemisorbed products especially in the case of mixtures.

However, machine learning models with uncertainty quantification have recently emerged as attractive tools to accelerate the navigation of these spaces in a data-efficient manner, typically through active learning-based workflows. In this work, we combine such an active learning scheme with a dropout graph convolutional network (dGCN) as a surrogate model to explore the complex materials space of high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Specifically, we train the dGCN on the formation energies of disordered binary alloy structures in the Pd-Pt-Sn ternary alloy system and utilize the model to make and improve predictions on ternary structures. To do so, we perform reduced optimization over ensembles of ternary structures constructed based on two coordinate systems: (a) a physics-informed ternary composition space, and (b) data-driven coordinates discovered by the manifold learning scheme known as Diffusion Maps. Inspired by statistical mechanics, we derive and apply a dropout-informed acquisition function to select ensembles from which to sample additional structures. During each iteration of our active learning scheme, a representative number of crystals that minimize the acquisition function is selected, their energies are computed with DFT, and our dGCN model is retrained. We demonstrate that both of our reduced optimization techniques can be used to improve predictions of the formation free energy, the target property that determines HEA stability, in the ternary alloy space with a significantly reduced number of costly DFT calculations compared to a high-fidelity model. However, the manner in which these two disparate schemes converge to the target property differs: the physics-based scheme appears akin to a depth-first strategy, whereas the data-driven scheme appears more akin to a breadth-first approach. Both active learning schemes can be extended further to incorporate greater number of elements, surface structures, and adsorbate motifs.

However, these process development problems are often carried out independently and consecutively, which can exacerbate the already significant consumption of time and resources involved in the process. In this work, we present a versatile, all-in-one robotic platform for the autonomous optimization, intensification, and scaling up of photocatalytic reactions in flow. This platform overcomes associated challenges through the integration of readily available hardware and custom software, offering a hands-off solution. Our open source platform combines a liquid-handler, syringe pumps, a tunable high-powered photoreactor, cheap IoT devices and an in-line NMR to enable automated, data-rich optimization using a Closed-Loop Bayesian Optimization strategy. The use of a high-power continuous-flow capillary photoreactor enables highly reproducible data to be obtained, as it mitigates issues related to mass, heat, and photon transport that are often the main sources of irreproducibility in photocatalytic transformations. A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily optimize, monitor, and analyze photocatalytic reactions for chemical spaces of both continuous and discrete variables. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated by testing it on challenging photocatalytic transformations, which resulted in increased overall reaction yields and an impressive up to 550-fold improvement in space-time yields compared to batch processes. Additional tests on literature-reported reactions previously optimized in flow yielded substantial increases in both yield and space-time yield. Overall, our studies demonstrate that combining flow-based reactor technology with Bayesian optimization yields superior and unbiased results compared to human effort and intuition in terms of pace, precision, and outcomes for the optimization of photocatalytic reactions. Finally, due to its ability to autonomously generate datasets that include both optimal and suboptimal conditions, our RoboChem platform also contributes to advancing the field towards a digitally-driven era in synthetic chemistry.", "date": "2023-06-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Process Chemistry; Homogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C within the next century, the level of CO2 mitigation needs to increase drastically. Current capture technology, i.e., amine scrubbing, provides several challenges that limit widespread deployment: high regeneration energy, high operational costs and degradation issues. An emerging energy-efficient technology that can address some of the limitations of amines is electrochemically driven carbon dioxide capture. For example, redox-active quinone molecules are capable of capturing carbon dioxide following electrochemical reduction, and can then be regenerated upon electrochemical oxidation. Despite great advances in the chemistry of quinones for electrochemical CO2 capture, however, the integration of quinones in carbon capture devices remains an ongoing challenge. Here we present a new class of quinone-functionalized electrodes for electrochemical CO2 capture, using the diazonium radical reaction to graft quinone molecules to a porous carbon surface. By grafting redox-active molecules to this conductive surface,  not only is carbon dioxide capture significantly enhanced when the bound quinone species are electrochemically reduced, but the functionalization process also improves the energy storage of the carbon material. Through constant current experiments in the presence of CO2, reversible carbon capture was observed with initial uptake capacities at 0.4 mmol g\u20131 which stabilizes to 0.2 mmol g\u20131 over 100 cycles with an energy consumption of 254 kJ mol\u20131 per cycle. Our facile low-cost synthesis of quinone-functionalised carbons is highly tunable since both the carbon and redox-active molecule can be modified, and our work therefore paves the way for the design and discovery of improved electrode materials for electrochemical CO2 capture.", "date": "2023-06-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Carbon-based Materials; Electrochemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The advancement of force field (FF) parameterization methods has been accelerated by differentiable programming. Automatic differentiation (AD) has facilitated energy and force matching by differentiating these quantities with respect to the FF parameters, which we mention as force differentiation and matching (FDM). Nevertheless, crystal structure matching with AD remains difficult due to the converged structures optimized by the iterative algorithm being non-differentiable with respect to the FF parameters. To overcome this limitation, we introduce structure differentiation and matching (SDM) technique for generating FFs of small organic molecules using reference data, including stable monomer structures, crystal structures, lattice energies, and potential energy surfaces (PESs) of dihedral angles. SDM employs implicit function differentiation (IFD) and differentiable Ewald techniques to optimize FF parameters and atomic charges correspondingly. Our case study of eight exemplified molecules demonstrates that SDM substantially outperforms the conventional FDM, with error factors reduced to less than one-quarter with the charge optimization method called SDM(q-opt). This strategy achieves remarkable precision in reproducing lattice constants, atomic configurations, lattice energies, and PESs. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations confirm the stability of the generated crystal structures. This method can be adapted to other FF categories, such as polarized FFs and those with explicit hydrogen bonding interactions.

While the design of machine learning architectures that respect chemical principles has continued to advance, the final atom pooling operation that is necessary to convert from atomic to molecular representations in most models remains relatively undeveloped. The most common choices, sum and average pooling, compute molecular representations that are naturally a good fit for many physical properties, while satisfying properties such as permutation invariance which are desirable from a geometric deep learning perspective. However, there are growing concerns that such simplistic functions might have limited representational power, while also being suboptimal for physical properties that are highly localised or intensive. Based on recent advances in graph representation learning, we investigate the use of a learnable pooling function that leverages an attention mechanism to model interactions between atom representations. The proposed pooling operation is a drop-in replacement requiring no changes to any of the other architectural components. Using SchNet and DimeNet++ as starting models, we demonstrate consistent uplifts in performance compared to sum pooling and a recent physics-aware pooling operation designed specifically for orbital energies, on several datasets, properties, and levels of theory, with up to 85% improvements depending on the specific task.", "date": "2023-06-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Stable structures that can be reproducibly fabricated are essential for this, and the mechanism leading to the optical properties can thus be well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the photoluminescence (PL) of 1L-MoS2 can be modulated by photochemically functionalized graphene (F-G), which is covalently modified by phenyl-groups. The materials and molecules, respectively, combined in a heterostructure are graphene, phenyl-groups, and 1L-MoS2. Here we show that the layer-sequence results in a significant difference in PL enhancement. MoS2 supported by F-G (F-G/MoS2) has a 5-fold PL enhancement. More importantly, MoS2 shows only a 1.8 times PL enhancement if stacked underneath F-G (MoS2/F-G). Accordingly, the results indicate that the Schottky barrier and van der Waals interaction between the graphene basal plane and MoS2 interface are dramatically weakened with the enlarged interlayer distance in F-G/MoS2. Consequently, the PL enhancement becomes reduced with the thermal de- functionalization of F-G. Due to the different PL properties induced by layer sequence, we conclude that the phenyl-groups must be considered as a separate molecular component.

Collisional activation leads to the formation of a series of previously unknown smaller ring products and we characterise their geometry using ion mobility. Specifically, the disassembly of both {CrxCu2} hourglass structures (x = 10, 12) and of a {Cr12Gd4} cluster shows the formation of rare closed, heptametallic species namely {Cr6Cu}, {Cr5Cu2} and {Cr5Gd2} as dominant products, as well as other closed ions like {Cr5Cu}, {Cr10Cu}, {Cr12Cu}, {Cr10}, {Cr12}, and {Cr6Gd2}.

Here, atomistic carbon fiber surface models that feature intrinsic topographical complexity are interfaced with a typical epoxy resin to capture the influence of surface roughness at the composite interface.

CSP using the force field was found to provide good results for  some molecules, whose known crystal structures are reproduced by one of the lowest energy predictions, but are more variable than for other small organic molecules. Re-optimization of predicted crystal structures using solid state DFT leads to reliable predictions, demonstrating CSP as a approach that can be applied in the area of energetic materials discovery and development.", "date": "2023-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

DFT studies show that the two isomers of 4-Azido-N-Phenylmalemide have the same energetics. Furthermore, the rotational barrier between the isomers is 0.17 eV in N, N-dimethylacetamide (NNDMA) and 0.15 eV in tetrahydrofuran (THF). These indicate that the isomers are present in the solvents and can be easily converted between them. The azido asymmetric stretch differs by about 1 cm-1 between the isomers in NNDMA and less than 1 cm-1 in THF. The most significant effect of rotational conformers is in the coupling strength of fermi resonances with the most impact in THF environment. Therefore, the current DFT results show that isomers of 4-Azido-N-Phenylmalemide can be mostly detected in THF by 2D IR technique. Furthermore, the results from seven basis set provide consistent conclusion on the isomers, dependence of the basis sets may be useful information to the development of functionals in DFT method and may be served as a useful tool to understand coupling of vibrational modes of complex molecules and their isomers.", "date": "2023-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) is a possible strategy to reduce brine rejection while increasing resource recovery from desalination plants. However, treatment of high-salinity brine through ZLD substantially increases the energy consumption and carbon footprint of a desalination plant. The predominant strategy to reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint of ZLD is through the use of a hybrid desalination technology that integrates with renewable energy. Here, we built a thermodynamic model of the most mature electrified hybrid technology for ZLD powered by photovoltaics (PV). The PV-ZLD system is comprised of a reverse osmosis system coupled with mechanical vapor compression and crystallization. By coupling the thermodynamic model with a computational model, we are able to examine the potential size and geographic distribution of ZLD plants in Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas (e.g., the top four states that produce desalination brine). A multi-objective optimization framework determines the potential plant size considering the location and a number of operational variables. The objective function aims to maximize the thermodynamic performance of the ZLD system and minimize the cost of water and environmental impacts. Texas has the lowest levelized cost of water (1.2 to 1.7 $/m3 ) which is largely attributed to the state having available backup power. California is the most effective at using solar energy to power ZLD plants (above 90%), but the state also has the largest projected land area requirements. The massive adoption of large-scale PV-ZLD systems depends on the inclusion of efficient preconcentration subsystems that decrease the energy requirements of the brine concentration process, the reduction in CAPEX for PV systems, and the development of a low-cost and low-carbon intensity electric grid.

The objective of this paper was to optimize the diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic substrate to enhance the performance of Prussian Blue nanozymes in immunostaining applications. We elucidated that enhancers (such as imidazole), which are typically added to commercial DAB substrate solutions to boost the color signal generated by peroxidase, can suppress the activity of nanozymes. This issue can be resolved by optimizing a nanozyme-specific substrate buffer composition. More specifically, we demonstrated that buffers such as citrate, MES, HEPES, and TRIS containing 1.5-2 M NaCl or NH4Cl substantially increase DAB oxidation by Prussian Blue and provide a higher signal than commercial DAB formulations. Moreover, the composition of the substrate solution (type of buffer, ionic strength, additives) affects signal intensity to the same degree as buffer pH. Tuning the substrate buffer composition is, therefore, a simple and efficient way of signal amplification in nanozyme-based assays.

Such 3D data acquisition strategies commonly involve sub-optimal temporal sampling for in situ and operando studies (4D imaging). Herein, we introduce a sparse-imaging approach, Tomo-NeRF, which is capable of reconstructing high-fidelity 3D images from <10 two-dimensional radiographic images. Experimental 2D and 3D X-ray images were used to test the reconstruction capability in two-view, four-view, and six-view scenarios. Tomo-NeRF is capable of reconstructing 3D images with a structural similarity of 0.9971-0.9975 and voxel-wide accuracy of 81.83\u201389.59% from 2-D experimentally obtained images. The reconstruction accuracy for the experimentally obtained images is less than the synthetic structures which demonstrated a similarity of 0.9973-0.9984 and voxel-wise accuracy of 84.31-95.77%", "date": "2023-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Optimising the structures with increasing multipolar ranks indicates that the lattice parameters of the \u03b1-phase differ by less than 5% to the experimental structure when multipole moments up to the quadrupole moment are used.

Owing to its universality and transferability, the building block coarse-grained approach has gained a tremendous popularity over the last decade. The parameterization of molecules can be highly complex and often involves the selection and fine tuning of a large number of parameters (e.g., bead types and bond lengths) to optimally match multiple relevant targets simultaneously. The parameterization of a molecule within the building block CG approach is a mixed-variable optimization problem: The non-bonded interactions are discrete variables whereas the bonded interactions are continuous variables. Here, we pioneer the utility of mixed-variable particle swarm optimization in automatically parameterizing molecules within the Martini 3 coarse-grained force-field by matching both structural (e.g., RDFs) as well as thermodynamic data (phase-transition temperatures). For sake of demonstration, we parameterize the linker of the lipid sphingomyelin. The important advantage of our approach is that both bonded- and non-bonded interactions are simultaneously optimized while conserving the search efficiency of vector guided particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods over other metaheuristic search methods such as genetic algorithms. In addition, we explore noise-mitigation strategies in matching the phase transition temperatures of lipid membranes, where nucleation and concomitant hysteresis introduces a dominant noise term within the objective function. We propose that noise-resistant mixed-variable PSO methods can both improve as well as automate parameterization of molecules within building block CG FFs, such as Martini.", "date": "2023-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this work, we assessed F4_MIL-140A(Ce), a recently discovered phase-change MOF adsorbent for CO2 capture in two scenarios using a pressure-vacuum swing adsorption process, namely a coal-fired power plant flue gas (12.5 %mol CO2), and a steel plant flue gas (25.5 %mol CO2). Four CO2 and three N2 adsorption isotherms were collected on F4_MIL-140A(Ce) over a range of temperatures and modelled using a bespoke equation for step-shaped isotherms. We accurately measured the heat capacity of F4_MIL-140A(Ce), a key thermodynamic property for a sorbent, using a method based on differential scanning calorimetry that overcomes the issues associated with the poor thermal conductivity of MOF powders.

Increasing both the selectivity and permeability is a difficult multi-task constrained design problem for polymer membranes due to the trade-off between these two properties. The complexity of chemical composition and morphology of polymers makes this problem especially hard to attack with trial-and-error or intuition-based strategies. In this work, we instead present a machine learning (ML)-driven genetic algorithm to tackle the design problem of polymer membranes for CO2 separation from N2 and O2. Using literature data of permeability for three gases, CO2, N2, and O2, we constructed multiple ML models using different fingerprinting featurization schemes to predict all three gas permeabilities as well as the CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivity values. Then, we employed a genetic algorithm to design new polymers and evaluated their performance with respect to the Robeson upper bounds using our machine learning models. We were able to identify new polymer membranes that are promising for both CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 separations. The top discovered polymers are predicted to have high glass transition temperatures, Tg. Similarly, the pyridine functionality was found in ~ 20% of the predicted polymers. Both of these facts are well in line with currently accepted experimental wisdom for CO2 based separations. The framework developed here can be used to design polymers for any application involving constrained optimization.

Patients presenting MGMT\u2013 GBM are treated with surgery followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide (TMZ), an imidazotetrazine prodrug that produces O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) lesions.

We recently reported that the novel N3-(2-fluoroethyl)imidazotetrazine \u201cKL-50\u201d is efficacious and well-tolerated in murine models of TMZ-resistant GBM (Lin et al. Science 2022, 377, 502).

However, DNA ICLs form >10-fold more slowly from O6FEtG than O6ClEtG, and this slower rate of cross-linking allows MGMT to reverse the initial O6FEtG in healthy tissue while also reducing MGMT\u2013DNA cross-links arising from addition of MGMT to the N1,O6EtG intermediate.

The activation energies for self-diffusion and Li vacancy formation decrease by a similar proportion across the superionic phase transition. This result suggests that the superionic transition may be driven by a change in defect formation behaviour, rather than changes in Li transport mechanism. This insight may hold implications for other type-II superionic materials.", "date": "2023-06-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The feasibility of these approaches, including thermal stripping, pressure swing desorption, and electrochemical switching, can only be justified by the availability of affordable, storable, and widely distributable renewable energy. A photochemically driven system that demonstrates efficient passive capture and on-demand CO2 release triggered by sunlight as the sole external stimulus would provide an attractive alternative.

Efficient computational protocols are next proposed. Specifically, different flavors of DFT functionals were benchmarked against DLPNO-CCSD(T) for the phosphorescence energies. Transition density matrix and decomposition analysis of the emitting triplet excited state enables to categorize the studied complexes into different cases, from e.g., predominant triplet ligand-centered (3LC) character to predominant charge-transfer (3CT) character, either of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT), ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (3LLCT) or a combination of the two.

In these scenarios, it is necessary to perform geometry optimizations of higher-lying triplet excited states (i.e., Tn). We demonstrate that in the latter scenarios all the close-lying triplet species must be considered to recover the shape of the experimental emission spectra. The global analysis of computed emission energies, shape of the computed emission spectra, computed rates, etc. enable us to unambiguously pinpoint for the first time the triplet states involved in the emission process and to provide a general classification of Ir (III) complexes with regards to their phosphorescent properties.

These nanomaterials possess unique properties such as high surface area, short charge transfer pathways, and tunable band gaps, enabling efficient absorption of solar energy and generation of electron-hole pairs.

These modifications include surface functionalization, co-catalyst deposition, and incorporation of carbon-based materials. Size-dependent effects have been observed, where nanoparticles of optimal sizes exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Despite the promise of such large-scale screenings,  they remain inaccessible to most research groups due to their cost and complexity. In this work, we demonstrate how to uncover similar results under much lower experimental budgets using Bayesian optimisation empowered methodology.  We consider a unique reaction screening setting with 720 additives, forcing us to go beyond simple one-hot encoding of the reaction components. By investigating a range of molecular and reaction representations, we demonstrate convincing improvements over random search-inspired baselines. Importantly, our approach is generalisable and not limited to Ni-catalysed reactions, but can be applied to achieve yield improvements in diverse cross-couplings or other reactions, potentially unlocking access to new chemical spaces that are of interest to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

Alegre-Requena; Robert S. Paton", "abstract": "Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) is a heterodimeric class-I glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) that hydrolyzes glutamine. Ammonia is produced and transferred to a second active site where it reacts with N1-(5'- phosphoribosyl)-formimino-5-aminoimidazole-4 carboxamide ribonucleotide (PrFAR) to form precursors to purine and histidine biosynthesis. Binding of PrFAR over 25 \u00c5 away from the active site increases glutaminase efficiency by ~4500-fold, primarily altering the glutamine turnover number. IGPS has been the focus of many studies on allosteric communication; however, atomic details for how the glutamine hydrolysis rate increases in the presence of PrFAR are lacking. We present a density functional theory study on 237-atom active site cluster models of IGPS based on crystallized structures representing the inactive and allosterically-active conformations and investigate the multistep reaction leading to thioester formation and ammonia production. The proposed mechanism is supported by similar, well-studied enzyme mechanisms, and the corresponding energy profile is consistent with steady-state kinetic studies of PrFAR+IGPS. Additional active site models are constructed to examine the relationship between active site structural change and transition state stabilization via energy decomposition schemes. The results reveal that the inactive IGPS conformation does not provide an adequately formed oxyanion hole structure and that repositioning of the oxyanion strand relative to the substrate is vital for a catalysis-competent oxyanion hole, with or without the hVal51 dihedral flip. These findings are valuable for future endeavors in modeling the IGPS allosteric mechanism by providing insight into the atomistic changes required for rate enhancement that can inform suitable reaction coordinates for subsequent investigations.", "date": "2023-06-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Although easily neglected, identifying such limitations is increasingly important as the field rapidly progresses towards simulations of complex membranes mimicking the in vivo conditions: Pertinent multi-component simulations must capture accurately the interactions between their fundamental building blocks, such as phospholipids and cholesterol.

Specifically, we investigate why a bipyridyl (bpy) ligand leads to H2 generation but diphenylphosphino-based (dpp) ligands do not. We compare the full ligands to simplified models and systematically vary structural features to ascertain their effect on the reaction energy of each catalytic step. The calculations, based on density functional theory, show that the main effect on reactivity is the choice of linker atom, followed by its coordination. In particular, P stabilizes the intermediate Rh-hydride species by donating electron density to the Rh, thus inhibiting the reaction towards H2 generation. Conversely N, a more electron withdrawing center, favors H2 generation at the price of destabilizing the hydride intermediate, which cannot be isolated experimentally and makes determining the mechanism for this reaction more difficult. We also find that steric effects of bulky substituents on the main ligand scaffold can lead to large effects on the reactivity, which may be challenging to fine-tune. On the other hand, structural features like the bite angle of the bidentate ligand have a much smaller impact on reactivity. Therefore, we propose that the choice of linker atom is key for the catalytic activity of this species, which can be further fine-tuned by a proper choice of electron-directing groups on the ligand scaffold.", "date": "2023-06-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Acid Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This review explores the design and utilization of fluorine-containing materials in advanced batteries, focusing on the significance of controlling their chemical structure and understanding their impact on battery performance. A key aspect is the role of fluorinated materials in facilitating the formation of a thin, protective film of corrosion products at the metal-electrolyte interface, which serves as a barrier against further chemical reactions with the electrolyte.

For example, aberrant biological LLPS can lead to the emergence and progression of various diseases and disorders, and many significant advances have been made in the biological phase separation field. However, while these discoveries in biology are recent, the field of origins of life has been investigating LLPS for nearly 100 years, ever since the first suggestions by Oparin and Haldane that primitive LLPS could have been precursors to the first cells on Earth. Since then, a significant amount of work has been done to elucidate different primitive LLPS systems that could have been relevant as protocellular models. Given the structural similarities between primitive LLPS and modern membraneless organelles, there may even be an evolutionary link between the two, although this remains a question to be answered. Nevertheless, in order to answer this, a source that compares aspects of modern and primitive LLPS is necessary. Here, we first focus on the assembly of membraneless organelles from intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and nucleic acids, and discuss an example by which aberrant LLPS can result in progression of a disease (tumorigenesis). Then, as a parallel, we explore assembly of primitive membraneless compartments from simple biopolymers such as short peptides and nucleic acids. This is followed by a discussion of how the first biomolecules on Earth may have originated, analyzing the environmental and chemical conditions that could have favored primitive LLPS processes. Finally, we directly compare various aspects of LLPS assembly from both a primitive and a modern perspective, further discussing the potential of primitive IDPs on early Earth, but also the evolution from membraneless to membrane-bound cells. This review aims to provide a comparison of modern and primitive phase separation, including assembly and function, in order to help researchers in both fields understand the current state of knowledge, how this knowledge evolved, and the current gaps that need to be further addressed.

Using this framework, we propose a method in which (i) we construct different active space orbitals through diagonalization of a parameterized operator, and (ii) we choose the state with the lowest tPBE absolute energy from multiconfigurational pair density functional theory (MC-PDFT) averaged over the targeted states of interest. We test the method using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) wave functions with 40 active orbitals and bond index of 700, with no further orbital optimization following the active space selection. We find that with only four values of the parameter (i.e., with only four trial wave functions), we can obtain a mean unsigned error of only 0.19 eV for 199 vertical excitation energies in the QUESTDB database. Furthermore, the tPBE absolute energy proves robust in selecting between active spaces of very different sizes, over and above the wave function (CASCI/DMRG-CASCI) absolute energy. We believe this new framework is promising for the application of active space methods to chemical problems in a high-throughput fashion.", "date": "2023-06-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To meet the Department of Energy's ambitious goals of achieving 50 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric and 6.5 wt \\% gravimetric uptake targets, materials-based approaches are essential. Designing materials that can efficiently store hydrogen gas requires careful tuning of the interactions between the gaseous \\ce{H2} and the surface of the material. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials due to their exceptionally high surface areas and tunable structures that can improve gas-framework interactions. However, weak binding enthalpies have limited the success of many current candidates, which fail to achieve even 10 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric uptake at ambient temperatures. To overcome this challenge, We utilized quantum mechanical (QM) based force fields (FF) to investigate the uptake and binding enthalpies of 3 linkers chelated with 7 different transition metals (TM), including both precious metals (Pd and Pt) and first row TM (Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn), to design 24 different COFs in-silico. By applying QM-based FF with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) from 0-700 bar and 298 K, We demonstrated that Co-, Ni-, Mn-, Fe-, Pd-, and Pt-based MSUCOFs can already achieve the Department of Energy's hydrogen storage targets for 2025. Surprisingly, the COFs that incorporated the more affordable and abundant first-row TM often outperformed the precious metals.

While 6PPD-Q exerted strong toxicity (96 h LC50 = 0.64 \u00b5g/L), toxicity was not observed for six other PPD-quinones despite their similar structures. The fish tissue concentrations of 6PPD-Q after exposure (0.8 \u00b5g/L) were comparable to the other PPD-quinones, which indicated that bioaccumulation levels were not the reason for the selective toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Hydroxylated PPD-quinones were detected as the predominant metabolites in fish tissue. Interestingly, a single major aromatic hydroxylation metabolite was detected for nontoxic PPD-quinones, but two abundant OH-6PPD-Q isomers were detected. MS2 spectra confirmed that hydroxylation occurred on the alkyl side chain for one isomer.

In this contribution, the one-electron oxidation potential and the charge delocalization of the hole formed after oxidation is computationally investigated for different heterogeneous single-stranded DNA strands. We have established a two-steps protocol: (i) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the frame of quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) were performed to sample the conformational space; (ii) energetic properties were then obtained within a QM1/QM2/continuum approach in combination with the Marcus theory over an ensemble of selected geometries. The results reveal that the one-electron oxidation potential in the heterogeneous strands can be seen as a linear combination of that property within homogeneous strands. In addition, the hole delocalization between different nucleobases is, in general, small, supporting the conclusion of a hopping mechanism for the charge transport along the strands. However, charge delocalization becomes more important, and so the tunneling mechanism contribution, when the reducing power of the nucleobases forming the strand is similar. Moreover, an important charge delocalization is also obtained when there is correlation between pairs of some of the interbase coordinates of the strand: twist/shift, shift/slide and rise/tilt.", "date": "2023-06-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Real-time simulations enable broadband  x-ray spectra calculations without the need to invoke frozen occupied orbitals or \"core/valence separation\", but  we find that the spectra are frequently contaminated by transitions to the continuum originating  from lower-energy core and semi-core orbitals.   This problem becomes acute in triple-zeta basis sets although it is sometimes  bypassed serendipitously in lower-quality basis sets.  Transitions to the continuum  acquire surprisingly large dipole oscillator strengths, leading to spectra that are difficult or impossible to interpret. Meaningful spectra can be recovered by means of a filtering technique that decomposes the spectrum  into contributions from individual occupied orbitals, and the same procedure can be used to separate L- and K-edge spectra. Nevertheless, the conventional linear-response approach is significantly more efficient even when hundreds of individual  states are needed to reproduce near-edge absorption features,  and even when Pade approximants are used to reduce the real-time simulations to less than 2 fs of time propagation.

The injected charges form both singlet and triplet excitons, and for high efficiency it is important to enable dark triplets to emit light. Currently materials that harvest triplets by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are a very active field of research as an alternative to phosphorescent emitters which frequently employ heavy metal atoms. Whilst excellent progress has been made, there is a severe decrease of efficiency as the drive current is increased, i.e. efficiency roll-off, in most TADF OLEDs. At present much of the literature suggests that efficiency roll-off should be reduced by minimising the energy difference between singlet and triplet excited states in order to maximise the rate of conversion of triplets to singlets via reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC). We analyse the efficiency roll-off in a wide range of TADF OLEDs and find that neither of these parameters fully accounts for the reported  efficiency roll-off. By considering the dynamic equilibrium between singlets and triplets in TADF materials, we propose new figures of merit (FOMs) for efficiency roll-off and discuss their correlation with reported data of TADF OLEDs. Our new FOMs will guide the design and development of TADF-OLEDs with lower efficiency roll-off. This will also lead to improved efficiency of TADF OLEDs at realistic display operating conditions and help expand the use of TADF materials to applications that require high brightness, such as lighting, augmented reality, and lasing.", "date": "2023-06-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While ion-mobility coupled to mass spectrometry has provided an additional dimension of lipid isomer resolution, some isomers require resolving power beyond the capabilities of conventional platforms. Here we present the application of high-resolution travelling-wave ion mobility for the separation of lipid isomers that differ in (i) the location of a single car-bon-carbon double bond, (ii) the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis or trans) or, for glycerolipids, (iii) the rela-tive substitution of acyl chains on the glycerol backbone (sn-position).

To demonstrate the applicability of this method, double bond and sn-position isomers of an abundant phosphatidylcholine composition were resolved in extracts from a prostate cancer cell line and identified by comparison to pure isomer reference standards, revealing the presence of six isomers. These findings suggest that ultra-high resolution ion-mobility has broad potential for isomer-resolved lipidomics and is attractive to consider for future integration with other modes of ion-activation, thereby bringing together advanced orthogonal separations and structure elucidation to provide a more complete picture of the lipidome.

Thus, catalytic turnover can generate non-equilibrium local pH environments at the surface that differ substantially from that of the bulk. Quantitative insight into the magnitude of this interfacial pH swing is a prerequisite for understanding and designing efficient systems for energy conversion, but is difficult to measure, particularly under high current density operation; with complex gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs); and with membrane-decorated surfaces employed in functional devices. Herein, we develop and validate a general methodology for experimentally quantifying interfacial pH swings using open circuit potential (OCP) decay transients. Using this method, we quantify the impact of buffer strength, supporting electrolyte composition, and the presence of cation exchange polymer overlayers on the polarization-induced pH swing on Pt GDEs. We find that modest current densities of \u221230 mA cm\u22122 are sufficient to sustain pH swings of > 2 pH units, even for strongly buffered solutions. Meanwhile, the addition of alkali supporting electrolyte to unbuffered, acidic electrolyte can induce pH swings so large that the polarized electrode environment becomes strongly alkaline. The presence of a Nafion polymer overlayer containing fixed anionic charges serves to further augment the interfacial pH swing, resulting in a similar pH swing at half the applied current density. The transport characteristics of these systems were analytically modelled, enabling direct calculation of boundary layer thickness and quantitative prediction of the OCP decay transient.

Here we describe a new method of geometry optimization acceleration which generates adaptive gradient-based restraints for QM/MM optimizations, leading to faster optimizations and generally lower energies which signify a \"better\" optimized geometry. The restraints are de- termined by an algorithm rather than a user, and can adapt to directional optimizations as well as differences in starting geometry. This algorithm was implemented as an external python tool for use alongside TeraChem, with a modular interface that can be straightforwardly applied to other QM/MM packages. We tested on a green fluorescent protein (rsEGFP2) in water and a proton-swapping aspartic acid pair in explicit water. We are able to produce a nearly 50% reduction of computational time with a corresponding decrease in optimized energies of \u223c-0.4 a.u. with optimal parameters.", "date": "2023-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Costa", "abstract": "Halogen bonds (XBs) have become increasingly popular over the past few years with numerous applications in catalysis, material design, anion recognition, and medicinal chemistry. To avoid a \\textit{post factum} rationalization of XB trends, descriptors can be tentatively employed to predict the interaction energy of potential halogen bonds. These typically comprise the electrostatic potential maximum at the tip of the halogen, ${V_{S, max}}$, or properties based on the topological analysis of the electronic density. However, such descriptors either can only be used with confidence for specific families of halogen bonds or require intense computations and, therefore, are not particularly attractive for large datasets with diverse compounds or biochemical systems. Therefore, the development of a simple, widely applicable, and computationally cheap descriptor remains a challenge as it would facilitate the discovery of new XB applications while also improving the existing ones. Recently, the Intrinsic Bond Strength Index (IBSI) has been proposed as a new tool to evaluate any bond strength, however, it has not been extensively explored in the context of halogen bonding. In this work, we show that IBSI values linearly correlate with the interaction energy of diverse sets of closed-shell halogen-bonded in the ground state, and therefore, can be used to quantitatively predict this property. Although the linear fit models that use quantum-mechanics-based electron density provided MAEs typically below 1~kcal~mol$^{-1}$, this type of calculation might still be computationally heavy in large sets or systems. Therefore, we also explored the exciting possibility to use a promolecular density approach (\\pro{}), which only requires the geometry of the complex as an input, being computationally cheap. Surprisingly, the performance was comparable to the QM-based methods, thus opening the door for the usage of \\pro{} as a fast, yet accurate, XB energy descriptor in large datasets but also in biomolecular systems such as protein--ligand complexes. We also show that $\\delta g^{pair}$ descriptor emerging from the Independent Gradient Model that leads to IBSI can be seen as a term proportional to the overlapping van der Waals volume of the atoms at a given interaction distance. Overall ISBI can be thought of as a complementary descriptor to  ${V_{S, max}}$ for situations when the geometry of the complex is available and QM calculations are not feasible whereas the latter still remains a hallmark of XB descriptors", "date": "2023-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we present an in-field calibration of a network of 20 low-cost ambient particulate matter sensors (LCS) in greater Kolkata, India, operating between October 2018-April 2019. In order to understand LCS performance in relation to local reference-grade PM2.5 monitors (RGMs), three of these LCS were co-located with RGMs operated by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU), Victoria Memorial (VICTORIA), and Padmapukur (Howrah, PDM). Data from the co-locations were used to calibrate the LCS network using random forest regression and multiple linear regression approaches. Measured relative humidity and temperature were significant model features. Agreement between the LCS and RGM for 24-h averaged PM2.5 measurements was strongest at RBU, with an uncalibrated root mean squared error (RMSE) of 27.1 \u03bcg m-3, followed by PDM (32.6 \u03bcg m-3) and VICTORIA (50.7 \u03bcg m-3). Multiple linear regression was used to derive calibration models. Cross-calibration between co-located LCS-RGM pairs was tested. The LCS data after cross-calibration correctly identified days as being in or out of attainment with the 24h National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 60 \u03bcg m-3 91% of the time. The corrected data accurately identifies days with an India scale Air Quality Index of \u201cpoor\u201d or worse 94% of the time. This suggests that LCS can be a useful supplement to RGM networks for air quality management. Diurnal trends and a high level of correlation across the hybrid LCS-RGM network suggest regional and secondary sources of PM2.5 are important in Kolkata.

To this end, plasma-assisted catalysis is emerging as a \u201cgreen\u201d alternative to synthesize NH3. However, insufficient mechanistic understanding of this process has hindered significant improvements in its cost-effectiveness. Here we leverage \u201cminimal plasma\u201d microkinetic models and select experiments in a dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor to look for missing mechanistic insights. Relatively robust to model assumptions, we find that our modeling supports the thesis that plasma N and H radicals are the kinetics controlling plasma species for reactions involving the catalyst. This support stems from the realization that only the inclusion of N and H radicals in our models can readily explain key experimental observations for plasma assisted NH3 synthesis such as: i) similar catalytic activity for Fe and Ag (two metals at the opposite ends of N2 dissociation capabilities), ii) activity increase in Fe (a metal that readily dissociates N2) relative to thermal catalysis, and iii) detection of catalyst bound N2HY species. We also find the N radicals (a source of surface bound N*) to be more important in nitrophobic metals and H radicals (a hydrogenating agent via Eley-Rideal reactions) to be more important in nitrophilic metals. On the other hand, other mechanistic aspects such as the kinetic relevance of N2HY-forming pathways and dissolution reactions are discussed as a function of model assumptions. Our modeling suggests that some of these assumptions could be potentially clarified through in situ compositional analysis of catalyst adlayers (e.g., the fraction of radicals from the plasma bulk that reach the catalyst surface), as the adlayer composition seems to be rather sensitive to the plasma environment assumed to be \u201cseen\u201d by the catalyst.", "date": "2023-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we show that tetraalkylphosphonium ILs (TAPILs) on their own can annihilate pathogens by interfering with their cell membranes; however, the nature of the alkyl substituents on the central P atom and the nature of the anion play decisive roles in determining their antimicrobial activities. Con-comitantly, TAPILs can stabilize copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) generated directly within the IL matrices without the addition of any second-ary stabilizers. The composites thus generated were thoroughly characterized and shown to be far more lethal to E. coli than just the TAPILs. The antibacterial effect demonstrated by the composite created from P[6,6,6,8]Cl (TAPIL-2) was orders of magnitude more lethal to microbes in comparison with P[6,6,6,8]Cl or copper nanoparticles alone. Neither the parent TAPIL-2 nor composite-2 were compromised by ambient storage conditions over a period of months with regards to their bactericidal effects. The composite with the best performance (composite-2) also proved to be effective against a panel of selected microbes. SEM studies were conducted to image E. coli after exposure to the TAPILs or composite-2; with the latter, only bacterial debris were noticed post-exposure, indicating total bacterial annihilation. The  killing kinetic assay and regression analyses for  time-dependent bactericidal activity of composite-2 against E. coli and S. aureus demonstrated increase in log re-duction values over time, indicating the effectiveness of composite-2 in reducing the viable cell counts for both bacterial strains. Finally, Cu K-edge XANES was used to investigate the fate of Cu NPs within the composites, revealing oxidative disintegration of the Cu NPs within the TAPIL matrices over time, releasing charged copper ions and/or small copper clusters which interfere with the integrity and the permeability of E. coli cell membranes, inducing cell death. This was confirmed by SEM of bacterial preparations before and after exposure to both the TAPILs themselves as well as to the composites.

In com-parison with the parent NU-1008, the diffusivity of the probe molecules within SALI-n declined by 2 to 7-fold depending on chain length and loading, presumably due to steric effects or adsorptive interactions with per-fluoroalkyl chains. Atomistic simulations were performed to uncover the microscopic behavior of BODIPY dif-fusion in SALI-n. BODIPY molecules, which preferably interact with linkers, were pushed to the interior of the channels as chain length increased, resulting in solvated diffusion and minor differences in the short-time mobility of BODIPY in SALI-n. This suggested that the observed decline of transport diffusivity in SALI-n mainly stemmed from the steric effect from these flexible chains. We anticipate that this proof-of-concept will assist in understanding how pore functionalization can physically and chemically affect mass transport in MOFs and will be useful in further guiding the design of PSM to realize the optimal performance of MOFs for various applications.", "date": "2023-06-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Notably, filaments suitable for 3D printing with 1.75mm in diameter were fabricated directly from the reactor after the synthesis of copolymers through extruding polymer melt into a water bath thus overcoming the post-processing. Two series of copolymers containing 60 wt% and 70 wt% of hard PBS content were synthesized using magnesium-titanium butoxide as heterometallic catalyst.

Crystallized copolymers exhibited distinct spherulitic morphology, but presence of crystallites has no adverse effect on warping or delamination of subsequent layers during 3D printing. Furthermore, these copolymers demonstrated also easy processability through electrospinning, yielding uniform nanofibers with diameters ranging from 400 to 600 nm. The addition of 5 wt% PEG to copolymers with higher hard segments content (70 wt%) increased the elasticity up to 830% and improved hydrophilicity of the copolymers.

The overwhelming majority of the studies is focused on propylene/propane separation. Nevertheless, as the ultimate goal is to obtain propylene as the end product, propylene-selective MOFs necessitate a demanding and complex desorption process, which consumes a substantial amount of energy and involves intricate operations. Consequently, having an adsorbent that preferentially adsorbs propane instead would be more advantageous. This approach would enable the production of high-purity propylene in a single step and lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and the quantity of adsorbent required. The Computation-Ready Experimental Metal-Organic Framework (CoRE MOF) 2019 database is utilized for the computational screening of flexible MOFs using molecular dynamics simulations to identify materials with strong potential for separating propane/propylene via self-diffusion. This screening process is the first to fully consider the impact of framework flexibility on the discovery of guest self-diffusion coefficients. The study underscores the significance of accounting for framework flexibility in investigations of gas molecules transport in MOFs, showcases the potential of using data-driven approaches to identify high-performance materials, and suggests methods for enhancing the predictive capabilities of screening workflows.  The top 5 MOFs from the CoRE MOF database for propane and propylene separation at a temperature of 298 K are identified. It is observed that the presence of carbonyl groups greatly enhances the separation properties between propane and propylene. Subsequently, a machine learning approach is utilized to develop a model and uncover important features. The machine learning model's predicted values for self-diffusion are reasonably consistent with the data obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.", "date": "2023-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is commonly applied in untargeted exposome-wide analyses of xenobiotics in biological samples; however, human biomonitoring approaches usually utilize targeted low-resolution triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometry tailored to a small number of chemicals. HRMS can identify novel contaminants over a broad mass range but the detection of molecules from low-level exposure amidst a background of highly-abundant endogenous molecules has proven to be difficult. In this study, a triple quadrupole (QQQ) and a high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) with identical chromatography were utilized to determine the limits of quantitation (LOQ) of >100 xenobiotics and estrogenic hormones in pure solvent and human urine. Both instruments are currently used in exposure assessment studies and were operated in their most frequently used acquisition mode (full scan for HRMS and multiple reaction monitoring for QQQ) to mimic typical applications. For HRMS analyses, the median LOQ was 0.9 and 1.2 ng/mL in solvent and urine, respectively and for low-resolution QQQ measurements, the median LOQ was 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL in solvent and urine, respectively. To evaluate the calculated LOQs in complex biological samples, spot urine samples from 24 Nigerian females were measured. The higher LOQ values for HRMS resulted in less quantified low-abundance analytes and decreased the number of compounds detected below the LOQ. Even at chronic low-dose exposure, such compounds might be relevant for human health because of high individual toxicity or potential mixture effects. Nevertheless, HRMS enabled the additional screening for exposure to unexpected/unknown analytes, including emerging compounds and biotransformation products. Therefore, a synergy between high- and low-resolution mass spectrometry may currently be the best option to elucidate and quantify xenobiotics in exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS).

Depending\non the temperature and water availability in the system, D and U assemble in thermodynamically stable hydrated and anhydrated D-U base-paired cocrystals.

In the anhydrate cocrystal form, D and U molecules exhibit advantageous homomeric stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding. Under UV irradiation, an aqueous solution of D-U base-pair undergoes photochemical degradation, while a pure aqueous solution of U does not, thus demonstrating that base-pairing alters the photostability of U.

However, forward models based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to simulate structure factors and x-ray scattering from interatomic distributions such as radial distribution functions (RDFs) face limitations imposed by simulations, particularly at low values of the scattering vector q. In this work, we show how the value of the structure factor at q = 0 calculated from RDFs sampled from finite MD simulations is effectively dependent on the size of the simulation cell. To eliminate this error, we derive a new scheme to renormalize the sampled RDFs based on a model of the excluded volume of the particle-pairs they were sampled from, to emulate sampling from an infinite system. We compare this new correction method to two previous RDF- correction methods, developed for Kirkwood-Buff theory applications. We present a quantitative test to assess the reliability of the simulated low-q scattering signal, and show that our RDF-correction successfully recovers the correct q = 0 limit for neat water. We investigate the effect of MD-sampling time on the RDF-corrections, before advancing to a molecular example system, comprised of a transition metal complex solvated in a series of water cells with varying densities. We show that our correction recovers the correct q = 0 behaviour for all densities. Furthermore, we employ a simple continuum scattering model to dissect the total scattering signal from the solvent-solvent structural correlations in a solute-solvent model system to find two distinct contributions: a non-local density-contribution from the finite, fixed cell size in NVT simulations, and a local contribution from the solvent shell. We show how the second contribution can be approximated without also including the finite-size contribution. Finally, we provide a \u2019best-practices\u2019-checklist for experimentalists planning to incorporate explicit solvation MD simulations in future work, offering guidance for improving the accuracy and reliability of structural studies using x-ray scattering methods in solution.", "date": "2023-06-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Radiation; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Chiral supramolecular polymers emerge as excellent candidates for exploring the CISS effect due to their ability to modulate their helical structure through noncovalent interactions. Chiral supramolecular polymers capable of responding to external stimuli are particularly intriguing, sometimes even displaying chirality inversion. This study unveils spin selectivity in chiral supramolecular polymers, derived from single enantiomers, through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) conducted in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) mode.

The paucity of publicly accessible, high-quality measurements needed for the development of retention models and simulation tools has largely been due to the high cost in time and resources associated with traditional retention measurement approaches. Recently we described an approach to improve the throughput of such measurements by using very short columns (typically 5 mm), while maintaining measurement accuracy. In this paper we present a perspective on the characteristics of a dataset containing about 13,000 retention measurements obtained using this approach, and describe a different sample introduction method that is better suited to this application than the approach we used in prior work. The dataset comprises results for 35 different small molecules, nine different stationary phases, and several mobile phase compositions for each analyte/phase combination. During the acquisition of these data, we have interspersed repeated measurements of a small number of compounds for quality control purposes. The data from these measurements not only enable detection of outliers but also assessment of the repeatability and reproducibility of retention measurements over time. For retention factors greater than 1, the mean relative standard deviation (RSD) of replicate (typically n=5) measurements is 0.4%, and the standard deviation of RSDs is 0.4%. Most differences between selectivity values measured six months apart for 15 non-ionogenic compounds were in the range of +/- 1%, indicating good reproducibility. A critically important observation from these analyses is that selectivity defined as retention of a given analyte relative to the retention of a reference compound (kx/kref) is a much more consistent measure of retention over a time span of months compared to the retention factor alone. While this work and dataset also highlight the importance of stationary phase stability over time for achieving reliable retention measurements, we are nevertheless optimistic that this approach will enable the compilation of large databases (>> 10,000 measurements) of retention values over long time periods (years), which can in turn be leveraged to address some of the most important contemporary challenges in liquid chromatography.

NO, however, is inherently unstable, and there is considerable interest in stable radicals with analogous behaviour, such as (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO), and their potential as biologically active surface coatings. Here we show that it is possible to grow stable TEMPO monolayers with an ordered arrangement and specific orientation of the nitroxide group. A combination of high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that strong dipole-dipole interactions between neighbouring TEMPO molecules determine their orientation, resulting in an anti-parallel arrangement with upwards and downwards facing nitroxide groups. Surface coating is made possible using plasma polymerisation, a surface molecular engineering technique suitable for growing functional coatings of highly stable organic molecules. Typically, plasma polymerisation is considered a surface-independent process, with the plasma power and pressure dominating the deposited film's properties. We therefore test this assumption and its impact on TEMPO layers by studying initial stage growth on multiple material surfaces. We show that whilst plasma polymer growth creates ordered layers on gold and graphite surfaces, there is substantial substrate-dependence with less ordered growth on other materials up to a film thickness of 30 nm, suggesting variation in molecular packing and retention. Beyond that thickness, films convergence to a flat, uniform, surface-agnostic structure.

Antibodies themselves are also important as biomarkers, since they are produced in bodily fluids at the onset of a disease, often in low amounts. In this work, by using antigen-DNA conjugates, we targeted an ECPA method for antibody sensing and showed that the assay performance can be greatly enhanced using flexible spacers in the DNA conjugates. After adding flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacers at two distinct positions, the spacers ultimately increased the antibody-dependent current by a factor of 4.0 without significant background increases, similar to our recent work using thermofluorimetric analysis (TFA).

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the potential of flavonoids as antidiabetic agents through their ability to inhibit \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase, two key starch digestive enzymes. Six scientific databases were queried up until August 21, 2022, for in vitro studies reporting the IC50 results of purified flavonoids on \u03b1-amylase or \u03b1-glucosidase, along with the respective data of acarbose control. A total of 339 articles were assessed as eligible and subjected to the data extraction process, resulting in 1643 retrieved flavonoid structures. Chemical structures were then rigorously standardized and curated to 974 unique compounds, in which 177 flavonoids showed both inhibitions against \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase. Quality assessment was conducted following a modified CONSORT checklist.

The hydroxyl group at C3 is favourable for \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition but detrimental to the effect against \u03b1-amylase. Further notable features which affect \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibition were also discussed.

Incorporating this special ability into novel transition metal-free catalysts requires careful tuning of the molecular properties.

In this work, we combine DFT and machine learning methods to predict the energy and activation barrier for the activation of dihydrogen by silylenes and germylenes, to thus facilitate the selection of candidates for small molecule activation in the future. We demonstrate that - based on the analysis of approx. 600 acyclic silylenes generated from 40 different substituents - the energy profiles can be reliably predicted by a simple model using the sum of energy increments of the substituents of the silylene. Furthermore, quantitative structure-activity relationships between the energies and the electronic and steric properties of the silylenes could be established, which enabled the prediction of the activation barrier with a mean average error of less than 9 kJ/mol. The model even enabled an extrapolation to silylenes with substituents not included in the original data set, and thus could predict new silylene structures for small molecule activation. Moreover, the reported procedure can also be applied to germylenes, and their energy profile quantitatively expressed as a function of the energies values of their silicon analogues. Overall, the presented protocol allows for a fast screening and prediction of possible candidates for H2 activation, which will accelerate the development of main group element catalysts in the future.

Our study examines the pristine monolayers\u2019 energetical, dynamical, and thermal stability. The electronic structures of the pristine nanosheets exhibit wide-gap semiconductors. After single metalation on the monolayers, the composite systems become metallic. Charge density difference (CDD) analysis indicates that charge transfer occurs from the alkali metal atoms to the P3S and C3S monolayers, and Bader charge analysis quantifies the amount of charge transfer.

While fast charging capabilities have been demonstrated for lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO) anode materials, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Recently the interdiffusion of mobile lithium ions between a liquid electrolyte and LTO, facilitated by unpinning of polarons from surface defects, has been suggested as a potential factor influencing fast charging. This effect is explored further by systematically varying the concentration of the electrolyte salt in an aprotic electrolyte in contact with LTO, and acquiring Li-7 T1 NMR relaxation time constants as a measure for the bulk concentration of paramagnetic polarons. A systematic relation between electrolyte concentration and Li-7 T1 was found, with a qualitatively different behavior above and below about 5\\;mM. In the high concentration region, the observed relation was consistent with the law of mass action for a biphasic equilibrium exchange of lithium ions between LTO and electrolyte. Upon contact of the two phases, there was a redistribution of lithium ions between anode and electrolyte, which can be understood analogously to osmotic pressure of mobile lithium ions. This is the first demonstration of such an equilibrium for a non-faradaic lithium exchange at a solid\u2013-electrolyte interface, substantiating our previous hypothesis of a polaron-supported fast-charging mechanism.

We sought to find an alternative plasticizer that lowered the glass transition temperature (Tg) and softened PVC, but was not as harmful to the environment and for our health as the currently employed phthalate plasticizers. We recently discovered that urea (U) could complex with amorphous polymers, such as atactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc). Compared to neat samples, the Tgs of the PMMA-U and PVAc-U complexes were increased and decreased, respectively. However, when complexed with dimethylurea (DMU), the Tg of the PMMA-DMU complex was lowered. Since Tgs of PMMA and PVAc were lowered by either U or one of its derivatives, this prompted us to investigate whether they could interact and complex with another largely amorphous polymer PVC, that is often plasticized, to soften and lower its Tg. Shifts in the vibrational frequencies observed by Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry thermograms indicated that U, its derivative tetramethylurea (TMU)], and the related compound Acetamide (AC) were complexing with PVC. All three complexes (PVC-U, -TMU, and \u2013AC) showed significantly lowered Tgs.

By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2-aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapid synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.", "date": "2023-06-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

It can decompose the interaction energy into different physical components to understand the factors that play key roles in the interaction. This work proposes an energy decomposition analysis strategy based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT), called sobEDA. This method is fairly easy to implement and very universal. It can be used to study weak interactions, chemical bond interactions, open-shell systems, and interactions between multiple fragments. The total time consumption of sobEDA is only about twice that of conventional DFT calculation for the entire system. This work also proposes a variant of the sobEDA method named sobEDAw, which is designed specifically for decomposing weak interaction energies. Through a proper combination of DFT correlation energy and dispersion correction term, sobEDAw gives a ratio between dispersion energy and electrostatic energy that is highly consistent with the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), which is quite popular and robust in studying weak interactions but expensive. We present a shell script sobEDA.sh to implement the methods proposed in this work based on the very popular Gaussian quantum chemistry program and Multiwfn wavefunction analysis code. Via the script, theoretical chemists can use the sobEDA and sobEDAw methods very conveniently in their study.

Cationic, amphiphilic antibacterial surface coatings can delay the onset of biofilm formation by killing microbes on-contact, but they lose effectiveness over time due to non-specific binding of biomass and subsequent biofilm formation atop the fouled surface. Harsh physical or mechanical treatment methods are then required to forcibly expel the accumulated biomass and regenerate a clean surface. Here, we develop a simple, dynamically reversible method of polymer surface coating that enables both chemical killing on-contact, as well as on-demand mechanical delamination of surface-bound biofilms by triggered depolymerization of the underlying antimicrobial coating layer. Specifically, we synthesized antimicrobial polymer derivatives based on the cyclic dithiolane, \u03b1-lipoic acid, which can undergo dynamic and reversible polymerization into polydisulfides functionalized with biocidal quaternary ammonium salt groups.  These coatings kill >99.9% of S. aureus cells, repeatedly for 15 cycles without loss of activity, for moderate microbial challenge (~10^5 CFU/mL, 1 hr) but they ultimately foul under more intense challenges (~10^7 CFU/mL, 5 days). The attached biofilms are then ultimately exfoliated from the polymer surface by UV-triggered degradation of the poly(disulfide) coating in an aqueous solution at neutral pH. This work provides a new and simple strategy for antimicrobial coatings that can both kill bacteria on-contact for extended timescales, followed by triggered biofilm removal under mild conditions.", "date": "2023-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Coating Materials; Thin Films; Polymerization (Polymers); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Electrostatic interactions between the positive charges in PDADMAC and the negative charges in pectin are the main factors for coacervation to assemble. Encapsulation of the trypsin enzyme within complex coacervates made of PDADMAC and pectin was examined as a function of mixing order of these polyelectrolytes and at various salt concentrations to learn more about protein encapsulation within complex coacervates. There were three different mixing orders used. We examined the effect of ionic strength on pectin-PDADMAC system by  turbidimetric titrations at six different salt concentrations. Light microscopy allowed us to observe the formation of coacervate microdroplets at these salt concentrations. In order to determine the degree of ionization of pectin at the optimal pH for trypsin, which is 7.5, potentiometric titration studies were carried out on pectin. The most efficient mixing order is chosen for the subsequent experiments. The impact on enzyme encapsulation was also investigated by varying the amounts of trypsin and polyelectrolytes.

Here we report a \u201clow-tech\u201d, easy-to-use and sensitive, multiplexing activity-based protein profiling platform to characterize the xyloglucan-degrading GH system excreted by the soil saprophyte, Cellvibrio japonicus when grown on xyloglucan. A suite of activity-based probes bearing orthogonal fluorophores allows for the visualization of accessory exo-acting glycosidases, which are then identified using biotin-bearing probes. Substrate specificity of xyloglucanases is directly revealed by imbuing xyloglucan structural elements into bespoke activity-based probes. Our ABPP platform provides a highly useful tool to dissect xyloglucan-degrading systems from various sources and to rapidly select potentially useful ones. The observed specificity of the probes moreover bodes well for the study of other biomass polysaccharide degrading systems, by modelling probe structures to those of desired substrates.", "date": "2023-06-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Chemical Biology; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Ligand binding to the protein cavity is driven by non-bonded interactions, followed by the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the protein through a chemical reaction. To test the performance of this method, we developed a diverse, high-quality, openly accessible re-docking benchmark set of 95 covalent complexes bound by 8 chemical reactions to 5 different reactive amino acids. Combination with structures from previous studies resulted in a set of 304 complexes, on which AC obtained a success rate (RMSD \u2264 2 \u00c5) of 79%, outperforming two state-of-the-art covalent docking codes, AutoDock (35%) and GOLD (68%). We additionally assessed the cross-docking performance of AC on a set of 76 covalent complexes of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

Both two AIEgens exhibited excitation wavelength-dependence defying the Kasha\u2019s rule. The invariant near-infrared emission was originated from S1 of AIEgens to S0. However, its anti-Kasha luminescence at a short wavelength from the S2 state can be tuned by changing the excitation wavelength. Given the two-color emission of AIEgens, QT-1 and QF-2 could stain lipid droplets (LDs) and mitochondria in a blue and red fluorescence, respectively.

Upon light irradiation, obvious decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and serious change of mitochondrial shape in cells were observed, which corresponded to the efficient inhibi-tion of tumor growth in vivo.

This direct synthesis model enables the prediction that if the conditions of the ancient earth are sufficiently constrained, chemists will discover the synthetic pathways that produced RNA. In a fundamentally different model, which is more recent and less mature, RNA in concert with other biopolymers arose from prolonged, selection-based changes that occurred during chemical evolution, which transitioned smoothly into biological evolution. This evolutionary model predicts common chemistry of linkage and amazing structures, assemblies and co-assemblies, as represented by double stranded DNA, tRNA, cellulose, collagen, globular proteins, ATP synthase, and the ribosome. This evolutionary model predicts profound integration of biological subsystems as represented by ATP, which is central to and inextricable from biopolymer structure and biosynthesis and metabolic systems. In the evolutionary model, inherent chemical reactivities of biological building blocks are not necessarily relevant to the origins of life and do not predict biosynthesis.

In this implementation, machine learning is used to predict\nthe critical temperatures of chemically unique compounds in an attempt to identify new chemically novel, high-temperature superconductors. The training data set (SuperCon) consists of known superconductors and their critical temperatures, and the testing data set (NOMAD) consists of around 700,000 novel chemical formulae.

Different environmental structures have been studied and demonstrated to be able to enhance the RET rate between a nearby donor-acceptor pair. In particular, cylindrical silver nanorods and nanowires have shown extraordinary ability to transfer energy along its longitudinal axis over large distances. However, the mechanism of such transfer and the exact effects on molecular RET process are yet elusive. In this study, we use the recently developed computational tool based on the plasmon-coupled resonance energy transfer (PC-RET) method to systematically study the effects of nanorods with different dimensions on RET rates. We find that highly frequency-dependent coupling factor (CF) spectra, whose amplitudes determine RET rates, can be obtained due to the localized surface plasmon polariton (LSPP) modes of the rods with nanoscale dimensions. Simple phenomenological models can be derived for the wavelengths of CF peaks in relation to the length and width of the nanorods, providing easy tunability for enhancing RET rate in specific wavelength ranges. When coupled to longer rods with mesoscale lengths, exponential decay of the CF over long donor-acceptor distances with a small decay constant is observed, leading to the possibility of long-range RET processes. Furthermore, drumhead resonance modes emerge on the flat ends of the rod when the rod's diameter reaches 300~nm, resulting in extra enhancement to RET rate compared to certain thinner rods. These findings shed new light on the mechanism of plasmonic enhancement with silver nanorods and establish design principles for how to optimally utilize these structures to manipulate RET processes for various applications.", "date": "2023-06-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We report in-depth kinetic details for electrocatalytic H2 production using Fe complexes [CpFe(CO)2(NCMe)]+ with amine-rich cyclopentadienyl ligands (Cp = enCpN; en = ethylenediamine, N = NHiPr, Pyrrolidinyl), which generate H2 with a maximum turnover frequency of 266 s-1 via \u03b74-CpH intermediates. Under reducing conditions, state-of-the-art DFT calculations reveal that coordinated solvent plays a crucial role in mediating stereo- and regioselective proton transfer to generate (endo-CpH)Fe(CO)2(NCMe), followed by rapid solvent release and ligand-to-metal proton transfer to generate CpFeH(CO)2. The isoelectronic model complex (endo-CpH)Fe(CO)3 is prepared and structurally characterized, and the replacement of CO with NCMe dramatically increases the ligand dissociation barrier from \u0394G\u2021 \u2245 5 kcal/mol to \u0394G\u2021 \u2245 34 kcal/mol. The on-cycle intermediate CpFeH(CO)2 was prepared and cleanly reacts to release H2 and regenerate [CpFe(CO)2(NCMe)]+, which is rate-limiting during electrocatalysis. The solvent-free complex CpFe(CO)2 was found to be catalytically inactive and reversibly dimerizes in solution to form the crystallographically characterized dimer [CpFe(CO)2]2, further supporting the important role of coordinated solvent during H2 production electrocatalysis. Collectively, these experimental and computational results underscore the emerging importance of Cp ring activation, inner-sphere solvation, and metal-ligand cooperativity to perform proton-coupled electron transfer catalysis for chemical fuel synthesis.", "date": "2023-06-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Ligand Design", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Monotropically related crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties, with BZB crystals being considerably softer than BZN crystals. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties of the crystals. Excitation of these crystals using a 532 nm laser confirmed the propagation of elastically scattered photons (green) and the subsequent generation of inelastically scattered (orange) photons by the crystals.

Currently, lateral flow tests dominate in this area and show good analytical performance. However, studies to improve the effectiveness of such tests remain important. In comparison with lateral flow tests, vertical flow immunoassays allow for a reduction in assay duration and the influence of the hook effect. Additionally, the use of carbon black nanoparticles (CNP) as a color label can provide a lower detection limit (LOD) compared to conventional colloidal gold. Therefore, we have developed a vertical flow immunoassay for the detection of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein in human serum samples by applying a conjugate of CNP with anti-human IgG mouse monoclonal antibodies (CNP@MAb). The vertical flow assay device consists of a plastic cassette with a hole on its top containing a nitrocellulose membrane coated with Spike-protein and an absorbent pad. The serum sample, washing buffer, and CNP@MAb flow vertically through the nitrocellulose membrane and absorbent pads, reducing the assay time and simplifying the procedure. In positive samples, the interaction of CNP@MAb with anti-spike antibodies leads to the appearance of black spots, which can be visually detected. The developed method allows for rapid visual detection (5-7 minutes) of IgG vs Spike-protein with a LOD of 7.81 BAU/mL. It has been shown that an untrained operator can perform the assay and visually evaluate its results. Thus, the presented assay can be used in the further development of test systems for the serological diagnostics of COVID-19 or post-vaccination immunity monitoring.", "date": "2023-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Several IL based electrolytes with an imidazolium cation (EMI) have been investigated trying to find beneficial effect of mixing [FSI]- with [TFSI]- anions. However, a compromise would exist between thermal stability and electrochemical performance at elevated temperatures. To further advance the development of the hybrid electrolytes with improved electrochemical performance by decreasing the viscosity, it is important to understand, at a molecular level, the underlying molecular and electronic interactions which influence the viscosity and transport properties of such hybrid ILs. With this in mind, the purpose of the current study is to present detailed structural and electronic insights of imidazolium [EMI] bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide [TFSI]/bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide [FSI] hybrid electrolytic systems, and their mixtures with ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which are potential candidates for next generation LIB electrolytes.The nature of molecular interactions in a series of ion pair conformers have been thoroughly discussed by analyzing the interaction energies, stabilization energies and natural orbital analysis of the ion pair conformers.The [FSI]- anions, unlike the [TFSI]- anions, exist on top position with respect to the imidazolium rings. On the basis of a distance criteria, the [EMI]+ and [FSI]- ions show distances of rather weak hydrogen bonds. Charge transfer occurs via the lone pairs of oxygen and nitrogen atom to the \u03c3-type anti-bonding orbital of the C\u2013H bonds (Ylp\u2192\u03c3*C\u2013H),  \u03c0-type anti-bonding orbitals of C=C bonds (Ylp\u2192\u03c0*C=C) and \u03c0-type anti-bonding orbitals of N \u0336 C bonds (Ylp\u2192\u03c0*C\u2013N), where Y = N, O, or F. The values of the stabilization energy E(2) for [EMI][FSI] ion pair conformers are generally small (E(2)n\u2192\u03c3* < 2 kcal/mol) for the individual E(2)n\u2192\u03c3*, E(2)n\u2192\u03c0*C=C and/or E(2)n\u2192\u03c0*N-C interactions. The [EMI]+ cation and [FSI]- anions tend to form multiple \u03c3* and \u03c0* interactions, but reducing the strength of the individual contributions from a potential (linear) maximum.By comparison, from the SDF study, the coordination of the N1 atom of [TFSI]\u2212 anion to the atom H1 was enhanced upon the addition of carbonate into the mixture. In sharp contrast to this, the coordination of the N1 atom of [FSI]\u2212 anion to the atom H1 was decreased upon the addition of carbonate into the mixture, suggesting that H1 has a stronger interaction with N1 of the [TFSI]- anion than [FSI]- anion. Furthermore, in the pure ionic liquid, the [TFSI]- anions occupy both the on top position and in plane position in the [EMI]+ ring. With lower carbonate contenet, the [FSI]- anions occupy regions that are not occupied by [TFSI] anions which mainly occupy the on top and in plane positions. For higher carbonate content, however, adjacent [FSI]- anions are almost exclusively located on top and below the [EMI]+ ring.\n\n\n", "date": "2023-06-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

When subjected to light irradiation, nanoreactors with catalysts loaded in the core demonstrated improved catalytic performance compared to direct heating, while the nanoreactors with catalysts in the shell exhibited relatively similar activity.

These have been recorded for field-free cVSSI as well as field-enabled cVSSI and compared to results obtained from standard ESI.  In general, the strongest correlating factors include the logarithm of the octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) and the compound proton affinity (PA) in both positive and negative ion mode.  This is contrasted with results for the polar, protic solvents water and methanol where the log of the base dissociation constant (pKb) often produced the strongest correlation.

Here we present a complete determination of the standard free energies for all 16 individual kink sites for the significant case of the calcite (10-14)--water interface using both alchemical and pathway-based simulation techniques. The results reveal the importance of distinguishing between real and ideal ion-binding free energies at surfaces, especially for calcite-water where the interfacial potential can alter values by more than 100 kJ/mol per site. Individual kink site stabilities are found to show variations in excess of 60 kJ/mol, which can help explain observed differences in growth rates between the two distinct steps of calcite.", "date": "2023-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Geochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The MB-nrg PEF is shown to accurately describe the energetics and structural properties of an isolated NMA molecule, including the normal modes of both cis and trans isomers and the energy variation along the isomerization path, as well as the multidimensional potential energy landscape of the NMA-H2O dimer in the gas phase.

Comparisons with results obtained with a popular pairwise- additive force field for biomolecules and a classical polarizable PEF demonstrate the ability of the MB-nrg PEF to accurately represent many-body effects in NMAH2O interactions at both short and long distances, which is key to guaranteeing full transferability from the gas to the liquid phase.", "date": "2023-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The penetration of Li metal occurs along the propagating crack until a short circuit takes place. We hypothesise that ion implantation can be used to introduce stress states into Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 which enable an effective deflection and arrest of dendrites. The compositional and microstructural changes are studied via atom probe tomography, FIB-SEM with correlative TOF-SIMS, STEM and nano XRD indicating that Ag-ions can be implanted up to 1 \u00b5m deep and amorphization takes place down to 650-700 nm, in good agreement with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Based on nano XRD results pronounced stress states up to -700 MPa are generated in the near-surface region. Such a stress zone and the associated microstructural alterations exhibit the ability to not only deflect mechanically introduced cracks but also dendrites, as demonstrated by nano-indentation and galvanostatic cycling experiments with subsequent FIB-SEM observations.

The technique has been combined to operando multi crystal X-ray diffraction (MCXD) to differentiate between inter- and intra-particle heterogeneity in the sample. Operando SXDM revealed three distinct domains within the crystal that displayed metastable angular rotations of the lattice during both of the phase transitions. These rotations, reaching up to 0.4\u00b0, likely arise due to a dynamic lattice mismatch between phases with different unit cell parameters coexisting within the particle. The persistent location of tilt boundaries implies the presence of inherent structural defects locally facilitating the defect formation. Residual misorientations were observed in the particle even after the full discharge suggesting an irreversible change of the lattice structure. Tilt boundaries, affecting ionic conductivity, may impede the rate capability and lead to localized strain, stress, and potential capacity fade due to cracking.

We then focus on the utilisation of MOFs in advanced energy storage systems with a particular focus on supercapacitors. MOFs can be employed as electrode materials, separators, and catalysts, offering enhanced electrochemical performance, improved charge/discharge rates, and prolonged cycling stability. The unique tunability of MOFs allows for the rational design of tailored materials with desired properties, such as high specific capacity, excellent conductivity, and superior cycling stability. We will further discuss in detail the recent developments in MOF-based electrochemical capacitors, highlighting the significant progress made in achieving high energy and power densities. The exceptional charge storage capacity of MOFs combined with their facile synthesis and scalability make them promising candidates for next-generation energy storage technologies. The review further sheds light on the challenges and opportunities in the practical implementation of MOFs in energy storage devices with an eye on future research and development in the MOFs for energy applications.

Here, we combine the size-sensitivity of such diffusion-based methods with the structure-sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy by performing Raman diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (Raman-DOSY). The core of the Raman-DOSY setup is a flow cell with a Y-shaped channel containing two inlets, one for the sample solution and one for the pure solvent. The two liquids are injected at the same flow rate, giving rise to two parallel laminar flows in the channel. After the flow stops, the solute molecules diffuse from the solution-filled half of the channel into the solvent-filled half, at a rate determined by their hydrodynamic radius. The arrival of the solute molecules in the solvent-filled half of the channel is recorded in a spectrally resolved manner by Raman micro-spectroscopy. From the time series of Raman spectra, a two-dimensional Raman-DOSY spectrum is obtained, which has Raman frequency on one axis and diffusion coefficient (or equivalently, hydrodynamic radius) on the other. In this way, Raman-DOSY spectrally resolves overlapping Raman peaks arising from molecules  with different sizes. We demonstrate Raman-DOSY on samples containing up to three compounds and derive the diffusion coefficients of small molecules, proteins, and supramolecules (micelles), illustrating the versatility of Raman-DOSY.

Portela; Valeria Garbin", "abstract": "Emulsions stabilized by nanoparticles, known as Pickering emulsions, exhibit remarkable stability which enables many applications, from encapsulation, to advanced materials, to chemical conversion. The layer of nanoparticles at the interface of Pickering droplets forms a semi-permeable barrier between the two liquid phases, which can affect the rate of release of encapsulates, and the interfacial transfer of reactants and products in biphasic chemical conversion. The current lack of understanding of diffusion in multi-phase systems with particle-laden interfaces limits the optimal development of these applications. To address this gap, we developed an experimental approach for in-situ, real-time quantification of concentration fields in Pickering droplets in a Hele-Shaw geometry and investigated the effect of the layer of nanoparticles on diffusion of solute across a liquid-liquid interface. The experiments did not reveal a significant hindrance on the diffusion of solute across an interface densely covered by nanoparticles. We interpret this result using an unsteady diffusion model to predict the spatio-temporal effect of particles on diffusion across a particle- laden interface. We find that the concentration field of solute is only affected in the immediate vicinity of the layer of particles, where the area available for diffusion is affected by the particles. This defines a characteristic time scale for the problem, which is the time for diffusion across the layer of particles. The far-field concentration profile evolves towards that of a bare interface. This localized effect of the particle hindrance is not measurable in our experiments, which take place over a much longer time scale. Our model also predicts that the hindrance by particles can be more pronounced depending on the particle size and physicochemical properties of the liquids and can ultimately affect performance in applications.", "date": "2023-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Herein, we report a new methodology for the methylation of various phenols as tosylates as well as aryl halides via a hydrazone-mediated Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling by introducing a new bench-stable methylating reagent in the form of formaldehyde hydrazone. The reaction produces moderate to good yields on a structurally diverse set of aryl and heteroaryl electrophiles. Experimental and computational investigations were carried out to support the proposed mechanism for this reaction.

Conventional methods based on microbial screening and functional metagenomics require long verification periods and incur high experimental costs; recent data-driven methods are only applicable to a few common substrates. To enable rapid and high-throughput identification of enzymes for complex and less-studied substrates, we propose a robust enzyme promiscuity prediction model based on positive unlabeled learning, which shortens the time needed for new enzyme discovery from several years to 29 days. Using this model, we identified 15 new degrading enzymes specific for the mycotoxins ochratoxin A and zearalenone, of which six could degrade > 90% mycotoxin content within 3 h. We anticipate that this model will become indispensable for the identification of new functional enzymes, thereby advancing the fields of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and pollutant biodegradation.", "date": "2023-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Carr; Seung Eun Lee; Ahmet Uysal", "abstract": "Rare earths are important materials in various technologies such as catalysis and optoelectronics. Graphene oxide (GO) is a promising material for separation applications, including the isolation of lanthanides from complex mixtures. Previous works using fatty acid monolayers have demonstrated preferential heavy versus light lanthanide adsorption, which has been attributed to differences in lanthanide ion size. In this work, we used interfacial X-ray fluorescence measurements to reveal that GO thin films at the air/water interface have no lanthanide selectivity for dilute subphases. However, at high subphase concentrations ~8x more Lu adsorb than La. By comparing GO results with an ideal monolayer with a carboxylic acid headgroup, arachidic acid (AA), we demonstrate that the number of Lu ions adsorbed to GO is significantly higher than the number expected to compensate the surface charge. Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy results on both GO thin films and AA monolayers reveal a red-shifted SFG signal in the OH region, which we attribute to partial dehydration of the adsorbed ions and carboxylic acid headgroups. Liquid surface X-ray reflectivity data show that the GO thin film structure does not significantly change between the very dilute and concentrated subphases. We speculate that the functional groups of both GO and AA facilitate cation dehydration, which is essential for ion adsorption. Heavy lanthanide Lu has stronger ion-ion correlations that can overcome electrostatic repulsion between cations at higher concentrations compared to light lanthanide La, meaning GO and AA can exhibit apparent overcharge with Lu. Lastly, the layered structure of the GO films and reactive chemical nature of GO itself can accommodate ion adsorption.", "date": "2023-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Interfaces; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The MSXP has been designed to replace conventional solvent extraction (SX) apparatus and aims to reduce start-up time, time to reach equilibrium, and overall test time. Two copper solvent extraction (Cu-SX) research campaigns were conducted to test the functionality, ease of operation, modularity, and reproducibility of the MSXP. The first campaign quantified the extraction efficiency and net copper transfer, while the second campaign operated the MSXP in a semi-continuous countercurrent flow configuration with three extraction and two stripping stages. The main variables studied in the first campaign are the number of stages (1\u25003), volumetric flow rates (O/A, 1\u25003), and organic phase residence time in the micro-contactor (0.7\u25002.4). The results demonstrate that the MSXP can work with very low stage efficiencies (48%), while achieving high copper recoveries (>90%). At the stripping circuit level, we show that the MSXP can operate at superior stage efficiencies (> 100%), with low copper recoveries (30\u250055%). The reproducibility evaluation also demonstrates high statistical confidence (<6% CV) in the obtained process values. The MSXP offers great flexibility in net copper transfer and can be used to benchmark and emulate a wide range of Cu-SX systems. Experimental Cu-SX campaigns can be run in about 60 minutes, while investing roughly US$1.4/h on reagents, which is significantly lower compared to typical campaigns that can last from days to weeks to reach reliable research outcomes and require about US$62/h for reagents. The potential of MSXP extends to more elaborate solvent extraction systems, specifically those designed to purify energy-critical elements like lithium, nickel, cobalt, or rare-earth elements. This study demonstrates the promise of process intensification approaches for improving the efficiency of laboratory and pilot-scale SX studies, which can help in reducing time, reagent, and energy consumption while improving the reproducibility of results.", "date": "2023-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Reaction Engineering; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, TDPP units easily decomposed even under mildly acidic conditions in the biodegradation of electronic devices. Herein, we have designed and synthesized two chemically recyclable thienoisoindigo (TII)-based polymers bearing an imine bond at the depolymerized position, in which these polymers were prepared from polycondensation reactions of dialdehyde-functionalized monomer TII-(CHO)2 with p-phenylenediamine (PPD) to produce p(TII-PD) and 2,6-naphtalenediamine (2,6ND) to produce p(TII-2,6ND), respectively. Especially, we have examined the recyclability of both polymers. In the degradation process under mildly acidic conditions, our polymers showed excellent degradability within one day, and the TII-(CHO)2 monomer was retrieved with over 90% yield and exhibited remarkable chemical stability over 6 months under the degradation conditions. We prepared the same recycled polymers as p(TII-PD) and p(TII-2,6ND) by utilizing the recovered TII-(CHO)2 monomer. The recycled polymers displayed almost the same physicochemical properties and field-effect mobilities in the order of 10-2-10-3 cm2/Vs as the pristine polymers. These reproducible results suggest that the TII-based monomer unit is an excellent building block for developing fully recyclable semiconducting polymers.

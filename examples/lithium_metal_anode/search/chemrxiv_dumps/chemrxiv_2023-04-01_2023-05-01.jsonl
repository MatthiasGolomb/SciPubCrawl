It comprises approximately one third of all woody plant matter, making it an attractive candidate as an alternative, renewable feedstock to petrochemicals to produce fine chemicals. However, the inherent complexity of lignin makes it difficult to analyse and characterise using common analytical techniques, proving a hindrance to the utilisation of lignin as a green chemical feedstock. Herein we outline the comprehensive tracking of lignin degradation by an alkaliphilic laccase in a semi-quantitative manner using a combined chemical analysis approach utilising Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) to characterise shifts in chemical diversity and relative abundance of ions, and NMR to highlight changes in the structure of lignin. Specifically, an alkaliphilic laccase was used to degrade an industrially relevant lignin, with compounds such as syringaresinol being almost wholly removed (95%) after 24 hours of treatment. Additionally, structural analyses reinforced these findings, indicating a >50% loss of signal relating to \u03b2-\u03b2 linkages, of which syringaresinol is representative. Ultimately, this work underlines a combined analytical approach that can be used to gain a broader semi-quantitative understanding of the enzymatic activity of laccases within a complex, non-model mixture.", "date": "2023-04-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Measuring and characterizing these structures is therefore of great interest and an important part of quality control. Here, we show the extent to which DNA nanostructures can be characterized by a solid-state nanopore; a non-destructive, label-free, single-molecule sensor capable of electrically detecting and characterizing charged biomolecules. We demonstrate that in addition to geometrical dimensions, nanopore sensing can provide information on the mechanical properties, assembly yield, and stability of DNA nanostructures. For this work, we use a model structure consisting of a 3 helix-bundle (3HB), i.e. three interconnected DNA double helices using a M13 scaffold folded twice on itself by short DNA staple strands, and translocate it through solid-state nanopores fabricated by controlled breakdown. We present detailed analysis of the passage characteristics of 3HB structures through nanopores under different experimental conditions which suggest that segments of locally higher flexibility are present along the nanostructure contour that allow for the otherwise rigid 3HB to fold inside nanopores. By characterizing partially melted 3HB structures, we find that locally flexible segments are likely due to short staple oligomers missing from the fully assembled structure. The 3HB used herein is a prototypical example to establish nanopores as a sensitive, non-destructive, and label-free alternative to conventional techniques such as gel electrophoresis with which to characterize DNA nanostructures.

A recent surge of interest in coacervation between polyelectrolytes has been driven by both fundamental advances in experimental characterization of these systems, along with recognition of their relevance for both biological systems such as biomolecular condensates as well as industrially-relevant consumer products. Concomitantly, there have been several theories capable of predicting complex coacervation that are used to explain these experimental observations. While there has been a general conceptual consensus on the underlying physics of coacervation, these theoretical approaches have so far remained distinct. Polymer field theory, liquid state theory, ion pairing theories, and scaling theories all provide useful insights, but how the assumptions of each candidate theory are interrelated remains largely unexplored. In this manuscript, we attempt to show how two such classes of models can be derived from a single starting point, using cluster expansions as the basis for discussing which interactions are included in both field theory and ion pairing theory.

Boosting the energy efficiency of hot carrier-based photoelectrochemical cells requires maximizing the hot carrier extraction rate relative to the cooling rate. One could expect to tune the hot carrier extraction rate constant (k_ET) via a Marcus-Gerischer relationship, where k_ET depends exponentially on \u0394G0\u00b4 (the standard driving force for interfacial electron transfer). \u0394G0\u00b4 is defined as the energy level difference between a semiconductor\u2019s conduction/valence band (CB/VB) minima/maxima and the redox potential of reactant molecules in solution. A major challenge in the electrochemistry community is that conventional approaches to quantify \u0394G0\u00b4 for bulk semiconductors (e.g., Mott-Schottky measurements) cannot be directly applied to ultrathin 2D electrodes. The specific problem is that enormous electronic bandgap changes (>0.5 eV) and CB/VB edge movement take place upon illuminating or applying a potential to a 2D semiconductor electrode. Here, we develop an in situ absorbance spectroscopy approach to quantify interfacial energetics of 2D semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces using a minimal many-body model.

The combination of K48 and K63 biased E2 conjugating enzymes and two new carbamate protecting groups \u2013 pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) cleavable aminobutanamide carbamate (Abac group) and periodate cleavable aminobutanol carbamate (Aboc group) \u2013 provides a strategy for the synthesis of heterotypic and branched Ub trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. The Abac- and Aboc-protected lysines are readily prepared and incorporated into synthetic ubiquitin monomers. As these masking groups contain a basic amine, they preserve the overall charge and properties of the Ub structure, facilitating folding and enzymatic conjugations. These protecting groups can be chemoselectively removed from folded Ub chains and monomers with buffered solutions of PLP or NaIO4. Through the incorporation of a cleavable C-terminal His tag on the Ub acceptor, the entire process of chain building, iterative Abac deprotections, and global Aboc cleavage can be conducted on a resin-support, obviating the need for handling and purification of the intermediate oligomers.

It is catalysed by viral hemagglutinin protein, whose fragments called fusion peptides become inserted into the target bilayer and initiate its merging with the viral membrane. Isolated fusion peptides are already capable of inducing lipid mixing between liposomes. Years of studies indicate that upon membrane binding they form bend helical structure whose degree of opening fluctuates between tightly closed hairpin and an extended boomerang. The actual way in which they initiate fusion remains elusive. In this work we employ atomistic simulations of wild type and fusion inactive W14A mutant of influenza fusion peptides confined between two closely apposed lipid bilayers. We characterise peptide induced membrane perturbation and determine the potential of mean force for the formation of the first fusion intermediate, an interbilayer lipid bridge called stalk. Our results demonstrate two routes through which the peptides can lower free energy barrier towards fusion. The first one assumes peptides capability to adopt transmembrane configuration which subsequently promotes the creation of a stalk-hole complex. The second involves surface bound peptide configuration and proceeds owing to its ability to stabilise stalk by fitting into the region of extreme negative membrane curvature resulting from its formation. In both cases, the active peptide conformation corresponds to tight helical hairpin, whereas extended boomerang geometry appears to be unable to provide favourable thermodynamic effect.

This process requires an electron transport pathway that spans from the inner membrane, across the periplasm, through the outer membrane, and to an external surface. Multiheme cytochromes are the primary machinery for moving electrons through this pathway. Recent studies show that the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is observable in some of these proteins extracted from the model metal-reducing bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. It was hypothesized that the CISS effect facilitates efficient electron transport in these proteins by coupling electron velocity to spin, therefore reducing the probability of backscattering. However, these studies focused exclusively on the cell surface electron conduits, and thus CISS has not been investigated in upstream electron transfer components such as the membrane-associated MtrA, or periplasmic proteins such as STC. Using conductive probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of protein monolayers adsorbed onto ferromagnetic substrates, we show that electron transport is spin selective in both MtrA and STC. Moreover, we have determined the spin polarization of MtrA to be ~75% and STC to be ~35%. This disparity in spin polarizations could indicate that spin selectivity is length dependent in heme proteins, given that MtrA is approximately 2 times longer than STC. Most significantly, our study indicates that spin-dependent interactions affect the entire extracellular electron transport pathway.", "date": "2023-04-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Biophysics; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among the properties, binding affinity to a target is one of the prerequisites and usually evaluated by molecular docking or quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models.\nMethods: In this study, we developed Simplified molecular input line entry system Generative Pretrained Transformer with Reinforcement Learning (SGPT-RL), which uses a transformer decoder as the policy network of the reinforcement learning agent to optimize the binding affinity to a target. SGPT-RL was evaluated on the Moses distribution learning benchmark and two goal-directed generation tasks, with Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the targets. Both QSAR model and molecular docking were implemented as the optimization goals in the tasks. The popular Reinvent method was used as the baseline for comparison.\nResults: The results on Moses benchmark showed that SGPT-RL learned good property distributions and generated molecules with high validity and novelty. On the two goal-directed generation tasks, both SGPT-RL and Reinvent were able to generate valid molecules with improved target scores. The SGPT-RL method achieved better results than Reinvent on the ACE2 task, where molecular docking was used as the optimization goal. Further analysis shows that SGPT-RL learned conserved scaffold patterns during exploration.\nConclusions: The superior performance of SGPT-RL in the ACE2 task indicates that it can be applied to the virtual screening process where molecular docking is widely used as the criteria. Besides, the scaffold patterns learned by SGPT-RL during the exploration process can assist chemists to better design and discover novel lead candidates.\n", "date": "2023-04-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this work, we evaluate this widespread assumption by developing a new high-throughput single-particle electrochemistry platform using the multi-electrode array from neuroscience. By measuring the reaction and diffusion times for 21 individual particles in liquid electrolytes, we find no correlation between the particle size and either the reaction or diffusion times, which is in stark contrast to the prevailing lithium transport model.

Herein, we discovered that multistep desolva-tion is fundamental to the formation and evolution of peptide-rich droplets. The first step is partial desolvation of peptides to form peptide clusters, and the second step is selective desolvation of hydrophobic groups within clusters to trigger LLPS and the formation of peptide-rich droplets, followed by the complete desolvation of droplets, initiating the nucleation of peptide self-assembly. Manipulation of the degree of desolvation at different stages is an effective strategy to control the self-assembly pathways and polymorphisms.

Now sequence-based peptide design opens up new possibilities to develop peptidic molecular entities. However, its methodological limitations (e.g., its inefficiency in designing large peptides and that do not allow the analysis of post-traductional modification) limit their applicability domain. In contrast, ligand-based molecular design approaches have demonstrated their extensive applicability domain, although the peptide design-based in this method continues been not exploited. The main limitation has been the complex molecular structure of peptides, which has not been studied using classical fingerprints tuned for small organic compounds. Towards this end, MAP4 is a recently developed universal fingerprint that allows quantifying the sequence/structure diversity of natural products or peptides. As part of the peptide design, there is a current trend to develop predictive models which are founded on the available structure-activity data available. Before developing such models, it is essential to characterize in detail the structure-activity relationship and identify if any activity cliffs: subtle structural modifications that have a large and unexpected effect on the biological activity. In this study, we map the structure-activity landscape of an exemplary dataset with 165 peptides (anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus peptides) using a similarity metric based on MAP4 fingerprint. Specifically, we characterized the activity landscape of this data set, and we identified key amino acids (AAs) and structural motifs that play a key role in the activity of the anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus peptides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first chemoinformatics approach to systematically explore the activity landscape of peptides emphasizing the quantification of the structural similarity. The approach is general and can be extended to analyze the presence of activity cliffs in any set of peptides.

The concept of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) provides a reliable strategy to afford solid-state emissive luminogens with the guidance of restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM) mechanism. Traditional AIE luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit enhanced emission intensity under increased viscosity or decreased temperature, attributed to the RIM mechanism. However, some luminogens were found without the classic viscosity or temperature effect, but still display AIE feature. In this work, we synthesized a series of cross-shaped and closed-form rhodamine-based unorthodox AIEgens. Their abnormal emission behavior in increased viscosity and cooling experiments suggested that their strong solid-state luminescence (up to 72.7%) was not ascribed to the conventional RIM working mechanism. Through a systematical investigation including single-crystal structural analysis, optical property study and theoretical calculations, we proposed that aggregation-induced symmetry breaking (AISB) may induce intramolecular charge transfer and act as a general principle to dominate the unique aggregate-state emission behavior of the nonconjugated rhodamine derivatives.

The approach involves using permutationally invariant polynomials to fit two- and three-body interactions derived from potential of mean force (PMF) calculations. This potential developed here reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude, thereby allowing us to explore assembly behavior over large length and time scales. We show that the potential not only reproduces previously known assembled phases, such as 1D strings and 2D hexagonal sheets, which cannot be achieved using two-body potentials, but can also help discover interesting new phases, such as networks, clusters, and gels. We demonstrate how each of these assembly morphologies intrinsically arises from a competition between two- and three-body interactions. Our approach for deriving many- body effective potentials can be readily extended to other colloidal systems, enabling researchers to make accurate predictions of their behavior and dissect the role of individual interaction energy terms in the overall potential in the observed behavior.", "date": "2023-04-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Polymer brushes; Machine Learning; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, it is challenging to model the interactions between metal surfaces, adsorbates and the solvent water molecules at the interface. Herein, we use ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study the adsorption of furfural, a platform biomass chemical on several catalytically relevant metal|water interfaces (Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu and Au) at low coverages. We find that furfural adsorption is destabilized on all the metal|water interfaces compared to the metal|vacuum interfaces considered in this work. This destabilization is a result of the energetic penalty associated with the displacement of water molecules near the surface upon adsorption of furfural. This is evidenced by a linear correlation between solvation energy and the change in surface water coverage. To predict solvation energies without the need for computationally expensive AIMD simulations, we demonstrate OH binding energy in vacuum to be a good descriptor to estimate the solvation energies of furfural on different metal|water interfaces. Using microkinetic modeling, we further explain the origin of the activity for furfural hydrogenation on intrinsically strong-binding metals, such as Rh and Pt, under aqueous conditions, i.e., the endothermic solvation energies for furfural adsorption helps prevent surface poisoning.

Here, we investigate the effects of phosphorylation, the most prevalent carbonic anhydrase PTM, on the activities and drug-binding affinities of human CA1 and CA2, two heavily modified active isozymes.

Cycloisomeriza-tion reactions occupy a significant portion of the gold-catalyzed reaction space, while they represent a diverse family of reactions which are frequently utilized in synthesis. Herein, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) is shown to be a uniquely simple tool for gold-catalyzed cycloisomerizations, rendering the use of external activators obsolete, and leading to high-ly active catalytic systems with ppm levels of catalyst loading in certain cases. HFIP assumes a dual role as solvent and activator, operating via the dynamic activation of the Au-Cl bond through hydrogen bonding, which initiates the catalytic cycle. This special mode of catalysis can enable efficient and scalable cyclization reactions of propargylamides and ynoic acids with simple [AuCl(L)] complexes. A thorough screening of ancillary ligands and counter anions has been per-formed, establishing this methodology as an alternative to elaborate ligand/catalyst design and to the use of activators. Additionally, this concept is applied in C-C bond forming cycloisomerization reactions leading to 2H-chromenes and to the design of catalytic systems for sequential or one-pot transformations leading to activated ketoesters, a functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor salt, and a compound bearing the bioactive indole core, among others.

As an important component of the reaction microenvironment, the interfacial electrolyte substantially influences NO3RR but remains underexplored. Mass transport modifies the interfacial electrolyte properties (e.g., pH, solute concentrations) and thus regulates NO3RR activity and selectivity. In a representative flow-cell configuration with a titanium NO3RR electrode, we systematically controlled mass transport conditions and demonstrated their impacts on NO3RR performance. With continuum model simulation and in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy, we characterized the interfacial electrolyte environment under varied mass transport conditions. Furthermore, we strategically tuned the interfacial electrolyte properties and experimentally deconvoluted their impacts on NO3RR activity and selectivity. We found that diffusion layer thickness and background electrolyte concentration govern NO3RR activity, while interfacial pH steers NO3RR selectivity. Inspired by these findings, we applied pulsed potential to periodically refresh the interfacial electrolyte environment and lower the local pH, successfully tripling the relative ammonia-to-nitrite selectivity. Distinct from NO3RR studies that focus on reaction kinetics, this study was conducted under commonly observed mass transport limitations to advance mechanistic understanding behind mass transport effects and to help identify engineering opportunities that optimize ammonia production.", "date": "2023-04-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Water Purification; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The aim of this work was to fully understand the mechanism of this fundamental reaction, and to rationalize the influence of the substrate electronic properties on the reaction outcome. Furthermore, the structure of the active indium(III) catalyst interacting with the per-oxide substrate was investigated, showing the superiority of a coordinated monomeric form of the Lewis acid as the active catalytic species, compared to dimeric species.

The chemical structure of each dichalcogenide was confirmed by X-ray crystallography and solution state 1H, 13C, and 77Se NMR spectroscopy.

Furthermore, 1-4 reacts with CN\u2013 to produce ECN\u2013, which is consistent with the detoxifying effects of dichalcogenide intermediates in the Rhodanese enzyme.

However, applications of these coatings on such moving parts are limited due to their poor tribological properties; tendencies to generate high friction and susceptibility to degradative wear. In this study, we have fabricated a fluorinated graphene oxide-copper metal matrix composite (FGO-CMMC) on an AISI52100 bearing steel substrate by a simple electrodeposition process in water. The FGO-CMMC coatings exhibited excellent lubrication performance under pin-on-disk (PoD) tribological sliding at 1N load, which reduced CoF by 63 and 69%, compared to the GO-CMMC and pure copper coatings that were also prepared. Furthermore, FGO-CMMC achieved low friction and low wear at higher sliding loads. The lubrication enhancement of the FGO-CMMCs is attributed to the tribochemical reaction of FGO with the AISI 52100 steel counterface initiated by sliding load. The formation of an asymmetric tribofilm structure on the sliding track is critical; the performance of the FGO/Cu tribofilm formed in the track is boosted by the continued fluorination of the counterface surface during PoD sliding, passivating the tribosystem from adhesion-driven breakdown. The FGO-CMMC and GO-CMMC coatings also provide increased corrosion protection reaching 94.2 and 91.6 % compared to the bare steel substrate, allowing for the preservation of the long-term low friction performance of the coating. Other influences include the improved interlaminar shear strength of the FGO-containing composite. The excellent lubrication performance of copper coatings by FGO incorporation makes the CMMC a promising solid lubricant candidate for use in mechanical engineering applications.", "date": "2023-04-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Coating Materials; Composites; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we develop DeepDelta, a pairwise deep learning approach that processes two molecules simultaneously and learns to predict property differences between two molecules from small datasets. On 10 pharmacokinetic benchmark tasks, our DeepDelta approach outperforms two established molecular machine learning algorithms, the message passing neural network (MPNN) ChemProp and Random Forest using radial fingerprints. We further analyze our performance and find that DeepDelta is particularly outperforming established approaches at predicting large differences in molecular properties and can perform scaffold hopping. Furthermore, we derive simple computational tests of our models based on mathematical invariants and show that compliance to these tests correlate with overall model performance \u2013 providing an innovative, unsupervised, and easily computable measure of expected model performance and applicability.

Inversely, if the crystal lattice vol-ume was modulated post-synthetically, the spin state of the compound could be tunable, resulting in the inverse effect for SCO. Herein, we demonstrate such a spin-state tuning in a breathing cyanido-bridged porous coordination polymer (PCP), where the volume change resulting from guest-induced gate-opening and -closing directly affects its spin state. We report a synthesis of the three-dimensional coordination framework {[FeII(4 CNpy)4]2[WIV(CN)8]\u00b74H2O}n (1\u00b74H2O; 4-CNpy = 4 cyanopyridine), which demonstrates a SCO phenomenon characterized by strong elastic frustration. This leads to the 48 K wide hysteresis loop above 140 K, but below this temperature results in a very gradual and incomplete SCO transition. 1\u00b74H2O was activated under mild conditions, producing the nonporous {[FeII(4-CNpy)4]2[WIV(CN)8]}n (1) via a single-crystal-to-single-crystal process involving a 7.3% volume decrease, which shows complete and nonhysteretic SCO at T1/2 = 93 K. The low-temperature photoswitching behavior in 1 and 1\u00b74H2O manifested the characteristic elasticity of the frameworks; 1 can be quantitatively converted into a metastable HS state after 638 nm light irradiation, while the photoactivation of 1\u00b74H2O is only partial. Furthermore, nonporous 1 adsorbed CO2 molecules in a gated process, leading to {[FeII(4 CNpy)4]2[WIV(CN)8]\u00b74CO2}n (1\u00b74CO2), which resulted in a 15% volume increase and stabilization of the HS state in the whole temperature range down to 2 K.

In vitro and in vivo tests for therapeutic agents have traditionally been run in sterile environments, but many target areas for drug delivery such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and skin are home to thousands of microbial species. Here, we examine the behaviour of lipidic nanomaterials after exposure to representative strains of four bacterial species found in several human microbiomes. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements show that the nanostructure of monoolein cubic and inverse hexagonal phases are transformed, respectively, into inverse hexagonal and inverse micellar cubic phase upon exposure to a strain of live Staphylococcus aureus often present on skin. Further investigations support that these transitions are due to enzymatic hydrolysis of constituent lipids. The structural transformations induced by S. aureus are shown to take place within a timeframe relevant to the therapeutic application of these materials, and significantly reduced the rate of drug release from monoolein-based nanomaterials. Interestingly, the representative strains of bacteria investigated from the GI tract (E. coli, L. rhamnosus) and in disease states (P. aeruginosa) had no effect on liquid crystal structure. These findings are the first to demonstrate how the live human microbiome can trigger changes in the structure and consequent drug release properties of lipidic nanomaterials. The effect appears to be strain specific, and varies from patient to patient, body region to body region, and is anticipated to affect the bioapplication of monoglyceride-based formulations.

Automatic approaches are increasingly used in the development of accurate molecular models, but they typically make use of specifically-designed interaction potentials that transfer poorly to molecular systems or conditions different than those used for model calibration. As a proof of concept here we employ SwarmCG, an automatic multi-objective optimization approach facilitating the development of lipid force fields, to refine specifically the bonded interaction parameters in building blocks of lipid models within the framework of the general Martini CG FF. As targets of the optimization procedure, we employ both experimental observables (top-down references: area per lipid & bilayer thickness) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (bottom-up reference), respectively informing on the supra-molecular structure of the lipid bilayer systems and on their sub-molecular dynamics. In our training sets we simulate at different temperatures in the liquid and gel phases up to 11 homogeneous lamellar bilayers, composed of phosphatidylcholine lipids spanning various tail lengths and degrees of (un)saturation. We explore different CG representations of the molecules and evaluate improvements a posteriori using additional simulation temperatures and a portion of the phase diagram of a DOPC/DPPC mixture. Successfully optimizing up to ~80 model parameters within still limited computational budgets, we show that this protocol allows to obtain improved transferable Martini lipid models. In particular, the results of this study demonstrate how a fine tuning of the representation and parameters of the models may improve their accuracy, and how automatic approaches such as SwarmCG may be very useful to this end.", "date": "2023-04-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The main limitations to commonly used methods for protein sample preparation are time- and labor-intensiveness. Here we report a fast online method for post-injection acid cleavage of proteins directly in the mobile phase typically used for LC-MS analyses in proteomics. The chemical cleavage is achieved in 0.1% formic acid within 35 s in a capillary heated to 195 \u00b0C installed upstream of the analytical column, enabling the generated peptides to be separated. The peptides generated by the optimized method covered the entire sequence except for one amino acid of trastuzumab used for the method development. The qualitative results are extraordinarily stable, even over a long period of time. Moreover, the method is also suitable for accurate and repeatable quantification. The procedure requires only one manual step, significantly decreasing sample transfer losses. To demonstrate its practical utility, we tested the method for the fast detection of ricin. Ricin can be unambiguously identified from an injection of 10 ng, and the results can be obtained within 7-8 min after receiving a suspicious sample.

Although there have been many studies, the ability to design nanomaterials with optimal physicochemical properties for in vivo efficacy remains a significant challenge. In particular, it is difficult to quantify the detailed effects of cancer drug delivery systems in vivo as tumour volume reduction, a commonly reported marker of efficacy, does not always correlate with cytotoxicity in tumour tissue. Here, we studied the behaviour in vivo of two specific poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide) (pHPMA) pro-drugs, with the same chemical compositions of redox-responsive backbone components and pH-sensitive linkers to the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin but with varying architectures, in this case hyperbranched and star-shaped. Evaluation of the biodistribution of these polymers following systemic injection indicated differences in the circulation time and organ distribution of the two polymers, despite their very similar hydrodynamic radii (~ 10 and 15 nm) and underlying chemistry of backbone, side-chain and pro-drug linkers. In addition, both polymers showed improved tumour accumulation in orthotopic triple-negative breast cancers in mice, and decreased accumulation in healthy tissue, as compared to free doxorubicin. Importantly, there was a significant increase in tumour accumulation for the hyper-branched polymer compared to the star polymer, suggesting a possible role for solution conformations of these materials, rather than the chemistries, in mediating their performance. The results of haematoxylin and eosin assays, and TUNEL staining indicated a higher population of apoptotic cells in the tumours for both polymer pro-drug treatments, and in turn a lower population of apoptotic cells in the heart, liver and spleen, as compared to free doxorubicin. In particular, the hyperbranched polymer demonstrated significantly higher tumour deposition and apoptosis levels than its star shaped counterpart. Taken together, these data suggest that the penetration of both of these polymer pro-drugs was enhanced in tumour tissue relative to free doxorubicin, and that the combination of size, architecture, bioresponsive backbone and drug linker degradation yielded greater efficacy for the polymers as measured by biomarkers other than that of tumour volume.

Electrostatic repulsion is tuned by al-tering the peptide\u2019s net charge and intermolecular attractions are controlled through the degree of hydrogen bonding between specific amino acid residues. We find that an overall net peptide charge of +/-2 is optimal to facilitate the assembly of self-supporting hydrogels. If the net peptide charge is too low then dense aggregates form, while a high molecular charge inhibits the for-mation of larger structures. At constant charge, altering the terminal amino acids from glutamine to serine decreases the degree of hydrogen bonding within the assembling network. This tunes the viscoelastic properties of the gel, reducing the elastic modulus by two to three orders of magnitude. Finally, hydrogels could be formed from glutamine-rich, highly charged peptides by mixing the peptides in combinations with a resultant net charge of +/-2.

Nanometer-thick polyelectrolyte layers served as the substrate for PYP adsorption, with 6.5-pair layers providing the most homogeneous surfaces. When the topmost material was PGA, it acquired a random coil structure with a small number of \u00df2-fibrils. Upon adsorption on oppositely charged surfaces, PYP yielded similar achiral spectra. However, the VSFG signal intensity increased for PGA surfaces with a concomitant redshift of the chiral C-H and N-H stretching bands suggesting increased adsorption for PGA compared to PEI. At low wavenumbers, both the backbone and the side chains of PYP induced drastic changes to all measured chiral and achiral VSFG spectra. Decreasing ambient humidity led to the loss of tertiary structure with a re-orientation of a-helixes, evidenced by a strongly blue-shifted chiral amide I band of the \u00df-sheet structure with a shoulder at 1654 cm-1.

Goo\u00dfen; Mario P. Wiesenfeldt", "abstract": "The instrumental analysis of reaction mixtures is usually the rate-determining step in the optimization of chemical processes. Traditionally, reactions are analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy on high-field spectrometers. However, chromatographic methods require elaborate work-up and calibration protocols, while high-field NMR spectrometers are expensive to purchase and operate. We herein disclose an inexpensive and highly effective analysis method based on low-field benchtop-NMR spectroscopy. Its key feature is the use of fluorine-labeled model substrates which, due to the wide chemical shift range and high sensitivity of 19F, enables separate, quantitative detection of product and by-product signals even on low-field, permanent magnet spectrometers. An external lock / shim device obviates the need for deuterated solvents, permitting the direct, non-invasive measurement of crude reaction mixtures with minimal work-up. The low field-strength allows a homogeneous excitation over a wide chemical shift range, minimizing systematic integration errors. The addition of the correct amount of the non-shifting relaxation agent Fe(acac)3 minimizes relaxation delays at full resolution, reducing the analysis time to 32 seconds per sample. The correct choice of processing parameters is also crucial. A step-by-step guideline is provided, the influence of all parameters is discussed, and potential pitfalls are highlighted.

It is a natural polymeric composite that is primarily composed of tight macro-bundles of keratin proteins, which are highly responsive to external stimuli, including pH, temperature, and ionic solvent content. The external responsive behavior displayed by hair is similar to the behavior displayed by hydrogels and other natural fibrous gel systems like collagen and fibrin. Hair and its appearance play a significant role in human society. It is a highly complex biocomposite system, which has been traditionally challenging to characterize and thus develop functional personal care products for consumers. Over the last few decades, a significant societal paradigm shift occurred among those with curly hair. They began to accept the natural morphological shape of their curls and style their hair according to its innate, distinct, and unique material properties. These societal and cultural shifts have given rise the development of new hair classification systems, beyond the traditional and highly limited ethnicity-based distinction between Caucasian, Mongolian, and African. L\u2019Or\u00e9al developed a hair typing taxonomy based on quantitative geometric parameters displayed among the four key curl patterns \u2013 straight, wavy, curly, and coily (kinky). However, the system fails to capture the complex diversity of curly and kinky/coily hair. Acclaimed celebrity hair stylist, Andre Walker, developed a classification system that is the existing gold standard for classifying curly and kinky/coily hair, however the system relies upon qualitative classification measures, making the system vague and ambiguous to the full diversity of phenotypic differences. The goal of this research is to use quantitative methods to identify new geometric parameters, which will be more representative of curly and kinky/coily hair curl patterns. These new parameters will therefore provide more information on the kinds of personal care product ingredients that will resonate best with these curl patterns, and thus maximize desired appearance and overall hair health. The goal is also to correlate these new parameters with its mechanical properties. This was accomplished by identifying new geometric and mechanical parameters from several types of human hair samples. Geometric properties were measured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photogrammetry, and optical microscopy. Mechanical properties were measured under tensile extension using a texture analyzer (TA) and a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), which bears similarity to the common act of brushing or combing. Both instruments measure force as a function of applied displacement, thus allowing the relationship between stress and applied stretch ratio to be measured as a hair strand uncurls and stretches to the point of fracture. From the resulting data, correlations were made between fiber geometry and mechanical performance. This data will be used to draw more conclusions on the contribution that fiber morphology has on hair fiber mechanics and will promote cultural inclusion among researchers and consumers possessing curly and kinky/coily hair.", "date": "2023-04-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Biological Materials; Elastic Materials; Fibers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Yet, no fully validated analytical method is available for microplastic (MP) quantification, thereby preventing the reliable estimation of the level of exposure and, ultimately, the assessment of the food safety risks associated with MP contamination. In this study, a novel approach is presented that exploits interactive artificial intelligence tools to enable the automation of MP analysis. An integrated method for the analysis of MPs in bottled water based on Nile Red staining and fluorescent microscopy was developed and validated, featuring a partial interrogation of the filter and a fully automated image processing workflow based on a Random Forest classifier, thereby boosting the analysis speed. The image analysis provided particle count, size and size distribution of the MPs. From these data, a rough estimation of the mass of the individual MPs, and consequently of the MP mass concentration in the sample, could be obtained as well. Critical materials, method performance characteristics, and final applicability were studied in detail. The method showed to be highly sensitive in sizing MPs down to 10 \u00b5m, with a particle count limit of detection and quantification of 28 and 85 items/500 mL, respectively. Linearity of mass concentration determined between 10 ppb and 1.5 ppm showed a regression coefficient of (R2) of 0.99. Method precision was demonstrated by repeatability of 9 - 16% RSD (n = 7) and within-laboratory reproducibility of 15 - 27 % RSD (n = 21). Accuracy based on recovery was  92 \u00b1 15 %  and 98 \u00b1 23 % at a level of 0.1 and 1.0 ppm, respectively. The quantitative performance characteristics thus obtained complied with regulatory requirements. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the analysis of twenty commercial samples of bottled water, with and without gas and flavor additives, yielding results ranging from values below the limit of detection to 7237 (95% CI [6456, 8088]) items/500 mL.", "date": "2023-04-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Peripheral alterations to the vancomycin scaffold have enabled the development of new GPAs. However, modifying the core remains challenging due to the size and complexity of this compound family. The recent successful chemoenzymatic synthesis of vancomycin suggests that such an approach can be broadly applied. Herein, we describe the expansion of chemoenzymatic strategies to encompass type II GPAs bearing all aromatic amino acids through the production of the aglycone analogue of keratinimicin A, a GPA that is five-fold more potent than vancomycin against Clostridioides difficile.

Merging the novel three-step domino reaction and a dehydrogenation step in one pot leads to atom-economical, expeditious, and high-yielding (up to 92%) organic synthesis of unprecedented quinazoline-thiohydantoin fused frameworks. This new class of fused heterocycles features high in vitro activities and selectivities against multidrug-resistant P glycoprotein-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells (IC50 down to 0.127 \u00b5M). It exceeds the potency of the clinical reference drug doxorubicin (IC50 23.27 \u00b5M). Furthermore, nuclear localization of Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A, a.k.a. Megakaryoblastic Leukemia MKL1) as a tumor biomarker and driver of tumor resistance was decreased upon administration of quinazoline-thiohydantoin fused heterocycles. The developed straightforward synthetic approach enables the easy and direct formation of model drugs to overcome multidrug resistance in leukemia cells.", "date": "2023-04-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

While classic mixed-valence (MV) systems are highly tunable, e.g., via the modular organic bridges connecting the redox sites, metal-bridged MV systems are difficult to control because the electronics of the metal cannot usually be altered independently of redox-active moieties embedded in its ligands. Herein, we overcome this limitation by varying the donor strengths of ancillary ligands in a series of cobalt complexes without directly perturbing the electronics of viologen-like redox sites bridged by the cobalt ions. The cobaltoviologens [1X-Co]n+ feature four 4-X-pyridyl donor groups (X = CO2Me, Cl, H, Me, OMe, NMe2) that provide gradual tuning of the electronics of the bridging CoII centers, while a related complex [2-Co]n+ with NHC donors supports exclusively CoIII states even upon reduction of the viologen ligands. Electrochemistry and IVCT band analysis reveal that the MV states of these complexes have electronic structures ranging from fully localized ([2-Co]4+; Robin-Day Class I) to fully delocalized ([1CO2Me-Co]3+; Class III) descriptions, demonstrating unprecedented control over electronic coupling without changing the identity of the redox sites or bridging metal. Additionally, single-crystal XRD characterization of the homovalent complexes [1H-Co]2+ and [1H-Zn]2+ revealed radical-pairing interactions between the viologen ligands of adjacent complexes, representing a type of through-space electronic coupling commonly observed for organic viologen radicals but never before seen in metalloviologens.

Largely, these impacts are dictated by how the composition of the emissions changes once emitted into the atmosphere. Recently, anhydrides have been identified as a significant fraction of biomass burning emissions, however, little is known about their atmospheric evolution, or their interactions within the burn plume. Without this understanding, it is challenging to predict the impact of anhydrides on biomass burning emissions, and by extension, their influence on climate and health. In this study, we investigate anhydrides as potentially unrecognized electrophiles in the atmosphere. Firstly, by exploring their reactivity towards important biomass burning emitted nucleophiles, and secondly, by measuring their uptake on the emissions themselves. Our results show that phthalic and maleic anhydride can react with a wide range of nucleophiles, including hydroxy and amino-containing compounds, such as levoglucosan or aniline. Additionally, using a coated-wall flow tube setup, we demonstrate that anhydrides reactively uptake to biomass burning films and influence their composition. The anhydride nucleophile reaction was found to be irreversible, proceeding without sunlight or free radicals and indicating it may occur during the day or night time. Furthermore, the reaction products were found to be water-stable and contain functional groups which enhance their mass and likely contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosol, with knock-on climate effects. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental chemistry of anhydrides and their potential impacts in the atmosphere.", "date": "2023-04-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, we currently have little knowledge of the influence of the precursor solution structure on the formation pathway of materials. We here use in situ total scattering to show how the precursor solution structure influences which crystal structure is formed during the hydrothermal synthesis of tungsten oxides. We investigate the synthesis of tungsten oxide from the two polyoxometalate salts, ammonium metatungstate and ammonium paratungstate. In both cases, a hexagonal ammonium tungsten bronze (NH4)0.25WO3, is formed as the final product. If the precursor solution contains metatungstate clusters, this phase forms directly in the hydrothermal synthesis. However, if the paratungstate B cluster is present at the time of crystallization, a metastable intermediate phase in the form of a pyrochlore-type tungsten oxide, WO30*5H2O, initially forms. The pyrochlore structure then undergoes a phase transformation into the tungsten bronze phase. Our studies thus experimentally show that the precursor cluster structure present at the moment of crystallization directly influences the formed crystalline phase and suggest that the precursor structure just prior to crystallization can be used as a tool for targeting specific crystalline phases of interest.", "date": "2023-04-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Given that experimental studies on polycrystalline materials are notoriously difficult to perform and interpret, computational techniques are invaluable for providing insight at the atomic scale. Here, we carry out first-principles calculations on representative grain boundaries in three important Li-based solid electrolyte families, namely, an anti-perovskite oxide, Li3OCl, a thiophosphate, Li3PS4, and a halide, Li3InCl6, to demonstrate the significantly different impacts that grain boundaries have on their electronic structure, ion conductivity and correlated ion transport. Our results show that even when grain boundaries do not significantly impact ionic conductivity, they can still strongly perturb the electronic structure and contribute to undesirable electrical conductivity and potential lithium dendrite propagation. We also illustrate, for the first time, how cor- related motion, including the so-called paddle-wheel mechanism, which has so far only been considered for the bulk, can vary substantially at grain boundaries. Our findings reveal the dramatically different behaviour of solid electrolytes at the grain boundary compared to the bulk and its potential consequences and benefits for the design of solid-state batteries.", "date": "2023-04-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Energy; Ceramics; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, unlike MLM where the vocabulary is large, the AttrMask pre-training does not learn informative molecular representations due to small and unbalanced atom `vocabulary'. To amend this problem, we propose a variant of VQ-VAE~\\citep{van2017neural} as a context-aware tokenizer to encode atom attributes into chemically meaningful discrete codes. This can enlarge the atom vocabulary size and mitigate the quantitative divergence between dominant (e.g., carbons) and rare atoms (e.g., phosphorus). With the enlarged atom `vocabulary', we propose a novel node-level pre-training task, dubbed Masked Atoms Modeling (MAM), to mask some discrete codes randomly and then pre-train GNNs to predict them. MAM also mitigates another issue of AttrMask, namely the negative transfer. It can be easily combined with various pre-training tasks to improve their performance. Furthermore, we propose triplet masked contrastive learning (TMCL) for graph-level pre-training to model the heterogeneous semantic similarity between molecules for effective molecule retrieval. MAM and TMCL constitute a novel pre-training framework, Mole-BERT, which can match or outperform state-of-the-art methods in a fully data-driven manner.

Genetic algorithms provide a useful framework to incrementally generate molecules by applying mutations to known chemical structures. Recently, masked language models have been applied to automate the mutation process by leveraging large compound libraries to learn commonly occurring chemical sequences (i.e., using tokenization) and predict rearrangements (i.e., using mask prediction). Here, we consider how language models can be adapted to improve molecule generation for different optimization tasks. We use two different generation strategies for comparison, fixed and adaptive. The fixed strategy uses a pre-trained model to generate mutations; the adaptive strategy trains the language model on each new generation of molecules selected for target properties during optimization. Our results show that the adaptive strategy allows the language model to more closely fit the distribution of molecules in the population. Therefore, for enhanced fitness optimization, we suggest the use of the fixed strategy during an initial phase followed by the use of the adaptive strategy. We demonstrate the impact of adaptive training by searching for molecules that optimize both heuristic metrics, drug-likeness and synthesizability, as well as predicted protein binding affinity from a surrogate model.

Depending on the preparation procedure, the porosity, thickness, and homogeneity of the NPG films can be tuned. To modify the structure of NPG films in a targeted manner and thus adapt them to specific applications, a fundamental understanding of the structure formation is essential. In this work, we focus on NPG prepared from Au oxide formed during high voltage electrolysis in an alkaline electrolyte on a poly-oriented Au single crystal electrode. These poly-oriented single crystals consist of a single crystalline metal bead, with faces with different crystallographic orientations. Consequently, these POSCs allow screening of the influence of the crystallographic orientation on the structure formation of the Au oxide formed during high voltage electrolysis and the NPG film formed via electrochemical reduction of the Au oxide for different facets in a single experiment. The high voltage electrolysis is performed at current densities between 2.70 and 3.76 A / cm\u00b2 (300 V) and between 0.24 and 6.39 A / cm\u00b2 (540 V) with electrolysis times ranging from 100 ms to 30 s. The amount of Au oxide formed is determined by electrochemical measurements and the structural properties are investigated by scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy.  We show that the Au oxide formation is mostly independent of the crystallographic orientation except for thick Au oxide layers. In turn, the macroscopic structure of the NPG films depend on the experimental parameters, the thickness of the Au oxide precursor thickness, and the crystallographic orientation of the substrate.

Lawrence", "abstract": "The stereoselective synthesis of chiral molecules in enantioenriched form \u2013 i.e., asymmetric synthesis \u2013 underpins many fields of pure and applied science. Enantioconvergent reactions are preeminent in contemporary asymmetric synthesis as they convert both enantiomers of a racemic starting material into a single enantioenriched product, thus avoiding the maximum 50% yield associated with resolutions. All currently known enantioconvergent processes necessitate the loss or partial-loss of the racemic substrate\u2019s configuration, thus limiting the potential substrate scope to molecules that contain labile stereogenic units. Here we present a new approach to enantioconvergent reactions that can proceed with full retention of the racemic substrate\u2019s configuration. This uniquely stereo-economic approach is possible if the two enantiomers of a racemic starting material are joined together to form one enantiomer of a non-meso product. Experimental validation of this concept is presented using two distinct strategies; (1) a direct unsymmetrical coupling approach and (2) a multi-component approach, which exhibits statistical-amplification of enantiopurity. Our results demonstrate that stereoretentive-enantioconvergent reactions can be achieved using a wide variety of synthetic tactics, including stoichiometric chiral reagents, chiral auxiliaries, and chiral catalysts. Thus, the established dogma that enantioconvergent reactions require substrates that contain labile stereogenic units is shown to be incorrect. We anticipate the concept of stereoretention in enantioconvergent reactions will lead to the development of novel methodologies that can utilize a hitherto unexplored range of racemic substrates.", "date": "2023-04-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Stereochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Polarized spins are conventionally detected via high-field chemical shift-resolved NMR (above 0.1 T), however, of particular importance are CIDNP processes occurring at relatively low fields (<50 mT). In this paper, we demonstrate in situ low-field photo-CIDNP measurements using shielded fast-field-cycling NMR combined with audio-frequency detection of Larmor precession via atomic magnetometers. A model system is used comprising tetraphenyl porphyrin as a photosensitizer, and 1,4-benzoquinone as a quencher. For solutions comprising sub-mM concentrations of the photosensitizer and mM concentrations of the quencher, hyperpolarized 1H magnetization is detected by pulse-acquire NMR spectroscopy at 170 nT and 2 \u03bcT fields. The observed NMR linewidths are about 5 times narrower than normally anticipated in high-field NMR and are systematically affected by light irradiation during the acquisition period, reflecting a reduction of the transverse relaxation time constant, T_{2}*. Magnetometer-detected photo-CIDNP spectroscopy enables straightforward observation of spin-chemistry processes in the ambient field range of a few nT to tens of mT and may help resolve open questions regarding the nature of avian magneto sensing.", "date": "2023-04-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In the past years, the close relationship between the two approaches has fostered developments on how to systematically derive unbiased auxiliary basis sets -- the atomic CD (aCD) and atomic compact CD (acCD) auxiliary basis sets, different to the precomputed auxiliary basis sets -- the Karlsruhe type of auxiliary basis sets. The accuracy of these approximations in the RI approach can be further improved via an explicit correction of the one-centered two-electron integrals, which is the main object of this research.  Correcting the one-centered two-electron integrals directly, which scales linear with system size, is expected to provide a new degree of freedom to the design of auxiliary basis sets.  This can either be used to gain faster convergence towards the conventional treatment of the two-electron integrals, or as a mean to design lighter auxiliary basis sets while maintaining the same errors as of the uncorrected approach.

Therefore, current interfacial assembly methods typically focus on isotropic spheres, which have minimal capillary attraction and no dependence on orientation in the plane of the interface. In order to create long-range ordered structures with complex configurations via interfacially trapped anisotropic particles, control over the interparticle interaction energy via external fields and/or particle engineering is necessary. Here, we synthesize colloidal ellipsoids with nanoscale porosity and show that their interparticle capillary attraction at a water-air interface is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to their smooth counterparts.  This is accomplished by comparing the behavior of smooth, rough, and porous ellipsoids at a water-air interface.  By monitoring the dynamics of two particles approaching one another, we show that the porous particles exhibit a much shorter-range capillary interaction potential, with scaling intriguingly different than theory describing the behavior of smooth ellipsoids.  Further, interferometry measurements of the fluid deformation surrounding a single particle shows that the interface around porous ellipsoids does not possess the characteristic quadrupolar symmetry of smooth ellipsoids, and quantitatively confirms the decrease in capillary interaction energy.  By engineering nanostructured surface features in this fashion, the interfacial capillary interactions between particles may be controlled, informing a new approach for the self-assembly of complex two-dimensional microstructures composed of anisotropic particles.", "date": "2023-04-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Aggregates and Assemblies; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

For further materials and cell development towards competitive energy and power densities, a deeper understanding of electron transport and conductivity in organic radical polymer cathodes is required. Such electron transport is characterised by electron hopping processes, which depend on the presence of closely spaced hopping sites. Using a combination of electrochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic, and theoretical molecular dynamics (MD) as well as density functional theory (DFT) modelling techniques, we explored how compositional characteristics of cross-linked poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) polymers govern electron hopping and rationalise their impact on ORB performance. Electrochemistry and EPR spectroscopy not only show a correlation between capacity and the total number of radicals in an ORB using a PTMA cathode, but also indicates that the state-of-health degrades about twice as fast if the amount of radical is reduced by 15%. The presence of up to 3% free monomer radicals did not improve fast charging capabilities. Pulsed EPR indicated that these radicals readily dissolve into the electrolyte but a direct effect on battery degradation could not be shown. However, a qualitative impact cannot be excluded either. The work further illustrates that nitroxide units have a high affinity to the carbon black conductive additive, indicating the possibility of its participation in electron hopping.

In addition, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C-terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye. This later reaction was also successful in an intramolecular way, leading to macrocyclic peptides of an unprecedented shape.

The above was achieved by determining the energy barrier of the ESPT processes, qualitatively analysing the quantum tunnelling rates and evaluating the kinetic isotope effect. The 1:1 complexes of 2,2\u2019-pyridylbenzimidazole (PBI) with H2O, D2O and NH3, produced in a supersonic jet-cooled molecular beam, were characterised spectroscopically. The vibrational frequencies of the complexes in the S1 electronic state were recorded using a resonant two-colour two-photon ionization method coupled to a Time-ofFlight mass spectrometer set-up. In the PBI-H2O, the ESPT energy barrier of 431\uf0b110 cm-1 was measured using UV-UV hole-burning spectroscopy. The exact reaction pathway was experimentally determined by isotopic substitution of the tunnelling proton (in PBI-D2O) and increasing the width of the proton transfer barrier (in PBI-NH3). In both cases, the energy barrier was significantly increased to > 1030 cm-1 in the PBI-D2O and to > 868 cm-1 in PBI-NH3. The heavy atom in PBI-D2O decreased\nthe zero-point energy in the S1 state significantly, resulting in the elevation of the energy barrier. Secondly, the solvent-to-chromophore proton tunnelling was found to decrease drastically upon deuterium substitution. In the PBI-NH3 complex, the solvent molecule formed a preferential hydrogen bonding with the acidic (PBI)N-H group. This led to the formation of a weak hydrogen bonding between the ammonia and the pyridyl-N atom, thus, increasing the proton transfer barrier width (H2NH\u2027\u2027\u2027Npyridyl(PBI)). The above resulted in increased barrier height and decreased quantum tunnelling rate in the excited state. The experimental investigation, aided by computational investigations, demonstrated conclusive evidence of a novel\ndeactivation channel of an electronically excited biologically relevant system. The variation observed for the energy barrier and the quantum tunnelling rate by substituting NH3 in place of H2O can be directly correlated to the drastically different photochemical and photo-physical reactions of biomolecules under various microenvironments.", "date": "2023-04-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Its function is to convert hypoxanthine to xanthine and subsequently to urate, which are the final steps in purine elimination in humans. Elevated uric acid levels in the human body can cause gout and hyperuricemia. Therefore, drug development efforts targeting this enzyme are a primary focus not only to treat these conditions but also for other diseases. Oxipurinol, an analog of xanthine, was the drug that emerged as a \u201cgold standard\u201d inhibitor of XO in the late sixties. Crystallographic studies have shown direct coordination of oxipurinol to the molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). The proposed inhibition mechanism based on available crystal structures posits that the oxipurinol\u2019s nitrogen replaces a water-exchangeable OH ligand of the Mo atom. However, the detailed steps involved in the inhibition mechanism remain undefined, which would provide important insights for designing more efficacious drugs with similar inhibition functions. In this study, the inhibition mechanism of XOR by oxipurinol is investigated via molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. The structural and dynamical effects of oxipurinol on the pre-catalytic structure of the metabolite-bound system are presented, as well as the modeled reaction mechanism catalyzed by the MoCo center in the active site. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the proposed reaction mechanism as well as the non-covalent interactions with the binding cavity align with experimental findings. Our results also suggest the suitability of the inhibition reaction via another tautomer of oxipurinol other than the experimentally predominant tautomer.

In this work, we studied the ability of electrostatic interactions to modulate the chromatic phases afforded by charged, amphiphilic peptide-PDA nanostructures and their coassembly under pH-neutral, aqueous environments. Two oppositely charged, diacetylene-bearing peptide sequences were used as model monomers in this study. Based on solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) analyses, the positively charged, trilysine-containing sequence (K3GV) forms a \u03b2-sheet-like assembly with higher structural order than the disordered, negatively charged triaspartic acid-containing sequence (D3GV). The equimolar mixture of the two charged monomers results in a more ordered coassembly structure than D3GV, as evidenced by ssNMR, which still fulfills the geometric requirement to topochemically polymerize diacetylenes. At various temperatures tested, single component assemblies and coassembled peptide-PDAs all demonstrate a thermochromic response, with the hysteresis of the blue phase (planar conformation) spectral features being much larger than that of the red phase (twisted conformation). Resonance Raman spectroscopy of thin films revealed that the coexistence of blue and red phase chains is more stabilized in coassemblies that have electrostatic complementarity compared to their single component counterparts. Both the characterization of the solution and film samples at 20\u201380\u00b0C suggest that the red phase PDA with twisted conformation is more favored by the charge-coassembled material. In summary, this work shows the important role of the attractive electrostatic interactions arising from the peptidic side chains in controlling the adaptive properties of amphiphilic PDAs. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the nature of structural changes responsible for the thermally responsive chromatic transitions of a biomolecule-functionalized polymeric material and how this process can be directed by design-tunable electrostatic interactions.", "date": "2023-04-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we provide computational insights into the adsorption of water in UiO-66 and its functionalized derivatives to reveal the role played by different adsorption sites and functional groups in the adsorption mechanism. We started by developing molecular models for UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66-OH, and UiO-66-(OH)2 compatible with the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential of water. We then benchmarked these models against ab initio data. We used these models to perform molecular dynamics simulations and calculate radial distribution functions, IR spectra, and two-dimensional density distribution maps for water in the MOFs. These results consistently show that the \u03bc3-OH sites are the preferential interaction sites for water in UiO-66 and all its variants, and the formation of localised water clusters inside the octahedral pores is responsible for the abrupt step in the experimental adsorption isotherms. Furthermore, the presence of functional groups in the framework allows water to cluster in the octahedral pores at lower RH, thus making the MOF a more efficient water harvester. Overall, this study provides molecular-level insights into the pore filling process of UiO-66 and its functionalized derivatives, which are needed for the design of efficient water harvesting materials based on MOFs.", "date": "2023-04-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

THz conductivity in nano-crystalline PTI is up to eight orders of magnitude higher than the macroscopic conductivity of PTI films. We find that the charge carrier density of PTI nano-crystals is among the highest of all known intrinsic semiconductors, however, macroscopic charge transport in films of PTI is limited by disorder at crystal-crystal interfaces.

Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are an attractive class of hybrid perovskites that have additional optoelectronic tunability due to their accommodation of relatively large organic ligands. Nevertheless, contemporary ligand design depends on either expensive trial-and-error testing of whether a ligand can be integrated within the lattice or conservative heuristics that unduly limit the scope of ligand chemistries. Here, the structural determinants of ligand incorporation and perovskite stability are established by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of over ten thousand perovskites, including an algorithmically generated set of prospective ligand chemistries and all previously reported experimental primary ammonium ligands based on C, H, O, S, and N. The simulation results show near-perfect predictions of positive and negative literature examples, predict trade-offs between several ligand features and perovskite stability, and ultimately predict an inexhaustibly large 2D-compatible ligand design space. This dataset is used to train machine learning classifiers capable of predicting the geometric stability of perovskite structures based solely on generalizable ligand features, thus providing an inexpensive tool for screening putative ligands. As a demonstration, the model was used to down-select five new ligands that were successfully synthesized and incorporated into 2D perovskites.

It is still incredibly challenging to realize one-pot DMTM using dioxygen. So far, hydrogen peroxide is still the most frequently reported green oxidant for DMTM with a high selectivity for methanol. To achieve insights into the influence of oxidants on the DMTM performance, we computationally investigated the reaction mechanisms of DMTM using hydrogen peroxide at mono-copper sites in three kinds of Cu-exchanged zeolites with different sizes of the micropores. We identified the common advantages and limitations of hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. In contrast to dioxygen, the O-O bond of hydrogen peroxide could be easily broken to produce reactive surface oxygen species, which enables the facile C-H bond activation of methane at a lower temperature. However, because of the radical-like process for C-H bond activation at mono-copper sites, it is kinetically challenging to actualize the preferential C-H bond activation of methane as compared to that of methanol. Moreover, the lower O-H bonding energy of hydrogen peroxide would result in the self-decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Despite the bottlenecks, the kinetic analysis shows that it is still promising to improve catalysts to boost the performance of DMTM using hydrogen peroxide.

We propose a method called \"Flexible Topology\", where a ligand is comprised of a set of shapeshifting \"ghost\" atoms, whose atomic identities and connectivity can dynamically change over the course of a simulation. Ghost atoms are guided toward their target positions using a translation-, rotation-, and index-invariant restraint potential. When implemented with a large set possible targets, this can simulate trajectories in a coupled chemical-conformational space that allows solutions to molecular design problems to simply emerge over the course of a trajectory. It also provides a mechanism for observing ligand-induced conformational change, by allowing for the surrounding environment and the ghost atoms to respond to each other during the design process. This builds on a substantial history of alchemy in the field of molecular dynamics simulation, including the Lambda dynamics method developed by Brooks and coworkers [X. Kong and C.L. Brooks III, J. Chem. Phys. 105, 2414 (1996)], but takes it to an extreme by associating a set of four dynamical attributes with each shapeshifting atom that control not only its presence but its atomic identity. Here we outline the theoretical details of this method, its implementation using the OpenMM simulation package, and some preliminary studies of ghost particle assembly simulations in vaccum.   We examine a set of 10 small molecules, ranging in size from 6 to 50 atoms, and show that Flexible Topology is able to consistently assemble all of these molecules to high accuracy, beginning from randomly initialized positions and attributes.", "date": "2023-04-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Remarkable improvement in PL intensity in sulfur-based compounds, such as MoS2 and WS2, has almost been established by chemical treatment methods, such as p-type dopants and superacids; in contrast, selenium-based compounds of MoSe2, especially WSe2, have a very limited strategy. One potential strategy for improving PL intensity in all compounds would be to remove the substrate effect by mechanical floating of the monolayers from the underneath substrate material. However, floating the monolayer is difficult; it is possible if the monolayer does transfer to the trenches of substrates, and a post-preparation method has not been established. In this paper, we developed a universal post-preparation method for removing the substrate effect by a spontaneous fluctuation of monolayer TMDCs via coating with a simple hydrocarbon, paraffin. Because of the large thermal coefficient of paraffin, the stain is effectively applied to the TMDCs in the coating process. The paraffin-coated monolayer TMDCs show spontaneous fluctuation; and in an extreme case, the fluctuation forms the shape of a bundle. During the fluctuation and deformation, the substrate effect was removed; as a result, PL intensity improved remarkably in both sulfur- and selenium-based compounds of MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2. This work suggests a universal strategy for improving the optical property of monolayer TMDCs by removing the substrate effect.

Using non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we investigate the impact of methylation on S2(pp*) internal conversion in acrolein \u2013 the simplest linear alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Consistent with time constants reported in a previous time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy study, S2/S1-deactivation occurs on an ultrafast timescale (~50 fs). However, our simulations do not corroborate the sequential decay model used to fit the experiment. Instead, upon reaching the S1 state, the wavepacket bifurcates: a portion undergoes ballistic S1/S0-deactivation (~80 fs) mediated by fast bond-length alternation motion, while the remaining decays on the ps-timescale in a more statistical regime. Our analysis reveals that methyl substitution, generally assumed to mainly exert inertial influence, also manifests in important electronic effects due to its weak electron-donating ability. While methylation at the beta C-atom gives rise to effects principally of inertial nature, such as retarding the twisting motion of the terminal -CHCH3 group and increasing its coupling with pyramidalization, methylation at the alpha or carbonyl C-atom modifies the potential energy surfaces in a way that also contributes to alterating the late S1-decay behavior. Specifically, our results suggest that the factor-of-two slowing of the ps-component upon alpha-methylation is a consequence of a tighter surface and reduced amplitude along the central pyramidalization, effectively restricting the access to the S1/S0-intersection seam.

One solution could be to employ novel 2D semiconductor nanomaterials like MoS2, which have shown good room-temperature performance for gases such as NO2 and NH3. However, they have also shown limited response to other gases, which on the other hand, can be improved by substitutional doping. Consequently, this work investigates, employing density functional theory, the doping of MoS2 with Si, P, Cl, Ge, and Se to improve its SO2 sensing capability. The results show that P doping facilitates all desired effects with the electronic bandgap of MoS2 preserved at 0.72 nm\u20132 doping concentration, molecule-sheet charge transfers enhanced by 300%, and moderate binding energies that enable effective surface diffusion of SO2 at 300 K.", "date": "2023-04-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Our results demonstrate that the presence of Zn sites at the interface improves CO2 binding. However, the adsorption and activation energies are  insensitive to Zn concentration.  The calculations also show that the hydrogenation of adsorbate oxygen atoms at the interface is kinetically more favourable and requires hydrogen spillover from the metal to the zirconia.

While DFT calculations alone are unable to identify which one of the competing pathways is more favourable, the ESM model predicts that the carboxyl pathway has a higher turnover frequency than the formate route.

Hard carbon (HC), which is low cost, exhibits a low redox potential, and a high capacity, is integral to achieve a practical large-scale sodium-ion battery. However, the energy density of the battery utilizing this anode material is hampered by its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, two strategies, namely (i) thermal treatment and (ii) presodiation by thermal decomposition of NaBH4, are explored to improve the ICE of pristine HC. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical characterizations elucidate that the thermal treatment increases the Csp2 content in the HC structure, while the presodiation supplies the sodium to occupy the intrinsic irreversible sites. Consequently, presodiated HC exhibits an outstanding ICE (>99%) compared to the thermally treated (90%) or pristine HC (83%) in half-cell configurations.

Although energy offset between the optical bandgap and the charge transfer (CT) states should be maintained as small as possible to improve VOC, a very small energy offset typically leads to degradation of JSC, even when novel nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), such as Y6, are used. Therefore, understanding the limit to what extent the energy offset can be minimized and the underlying physics behind the trade-off relationship is important to optimize the design of new materials and further improve the PCEs. This study provides a threshold energy that can ensure high charge photogeneration quantum efficiencies for Y-series NFA-based OSCs and discusses the role of the energy offset in device performances. We found that an insufficient energy offset led to not only slow hole transfer at the donor:acceptor interfaces, but also inefficient long-range spatial dissociation of the CT states and degradation of the fill factor (FF). This study also discusses the interplay of the energy levels of two NFAs that constitute ternary blend OSCs. We found that combining two NFAs enables to reduce the voltage loss, while maintaining a high charge photogeneration quantum efficiency.

The ESPT process in the PBI-CH3OH complex was confirmed by the disappearance of the Franck-Condon active vibrational transitions above 0_0^0+390 cm-1. In the PBI-CH3OD complex, the reappearance of the Franck-Condon till 0_0^0+800 cm-1 confirmed the elevation of the ESPT barrier upon isotopic substitution due to the lowering of the zero-point vibrational energy. The ESPT energy barrier in PBI-CH3OH was bracketed as 410\u00b120 cm-1 (4.91\u00b10.23 kJ mol-1) by comparing the spectra of PBI-CH3OH and PBI-CH3OD. The solvent-to-chromophore proton transfer was confirmed based on the significantly decreased quantum tunnelling of the solvent proton in the PBI-CH3OD complex. The computational investigation resulted in an energy barrier of 6.0 kJ mol-1 for the ESPT reaction in the PBI-CH3OH complex, showing excellent agreement with the experimental value.

Two XRD-coupled square-wave accelerated stress tests (0.6 to 0.95) V and (0.7 to 0.95) V (where V is the cell voltage) confirm that, when fixing the upper limit, the dissolution and overall degradation strongly depend on the lower potential limit. By directly observing the extent of metal oxidation during potential cycling, we link the alloy redox dynamics to the stability. The studied catalysts' stability is proportional to both the extent of metal oxidation and, more interestingly, the degree of reduction. Comparing a benchmark Pt catalyst with oh-PtNiIr allows for associating the differences between oxidation and reduction potentials and the optimal usage window for each class of catalysts. This relatively simple method can be employed to find the operation boundaries of the PEMFC to minimize the degradation of a large class of Pt-based catalysts without time-consuming stress tests.", "date": "2023-04-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms; Fuel Cells; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Yet, the understanding of important practical problems depends on monitoring ice growth inside solid materials. For example, how rapid ice growth leads to structural damage of food, or how the final structure of cementitious materials is affect-ed by ice during curing. Imaging crystal growth inside solid materials cannot be done with visi-ble light and is intrinsically more challenging than visible light imaging. Thermography is a technique that uses thermal (Infra-red) cameras to monitor temperature changes in a material, and it has been used to provide qualitative description of ice propagation and nucleation with a low spatial resolution. Here, we describe a method that uses a novel micro-thermography system to image ice nucleation, growth and melting inside non-transparent samples. This method relies on two major components: a cold stage with accurate temperature control (\u00b10.001 \u00baC) and a thermal camera with high spatial and temperature resolution. Our experiments include imaging of ice formation and growth in pure water first, and inside plant leaves used as a model for a non-transparent material. Ice growth rate of 2.2 mm/s was measured inside a plant leaf at -12 \u00baC and ice nucleation in single plant cells was observed as a hot spot having a diameter of 160 \u00b5m.

PAI is a light-in, sound-out technique which uses pulsed laser excitation with near-infrared (NIR) light to elicit local temperature increases through non-radiative relaxation events, ultimately leading to the production of ultrasound waves. The classical xanthene dye scaffold has found numerous applications in fluorescence imaging, however, xanthenes are rarely utilized for PAI since they do not typically display NIR absorbance. Herein, we report the ability of Nebraska Red (NR) dyes to produce photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide a rational design approach to reduce the hydrolysis rate of ester containing dyes. By converting a relatively hydrolytically labile phosphinate ester to a more stable thiophosphinate ester, we were able to reduce the rate of ester hydrolysis 3.6-fold within a new dye, termed SNR700. Leveraging the stabilized NIR absorbance of this dye, we were able to construct the first rhodamine-based, turn-on PAI imaging probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that is compatible with commercial PA instrumentation. This probe, termed SNR700-HOCl, has a limit of detection of 500 nM for HOCl and is capable of producing contrast up to 2.9 cm deep in tissues using PAI. This work provides a new set of rhodamine-based PAI agents as well as a rational design approach to stabilize esterified versions of NR dyes with desirable properties for PAI.

Drawing inspiration from enzymes, protic functional groups in the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) work in conjunction with an exogenous acid to relay proton equivalents to the active site of CO2 reduction. However, it is not well understood how the acidity of the SCS and exogenous acid together determine the kinetics of catalytic turnover. To gain insight into the relative contributions of proton transfer driving forces, we synthesized a series of iron tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts bearing SCS amide groups of tunable pKa (17.6\u201320.0 in DMSO) and employed phenols of variable acidity (15.3\u201319.1) as exogenous acids. The modularity of this system allowed us to (1) evaluate contributions from proton transfer driving forces associated with either the SCS or exogenous acid, and (2) obtain mechanistic insights into CO2 reduction as a function of pKa. Plots of catalytic rate constants as a function of the various acidities reveal a series of linear free energy relationships: kinetics become increasingly sensitive to variations in SCS pKa when more acidic exogenous acids are used (0.82 \u2265 Br\u00f8nsted \u03b1 \u2265 0.13), as well as to variations in exogenous acid pKa when acidity of the SCS is increased (0.62 \u2265 Br\u00f8nsted \u03b1 \u2265 0.32).

These results are consistent with the proposal that SCS acidity modulates the degree of charge accumulation and solvation at the rate-limiting transition state. Together, this system provides key insights that enable optimization of catalytic activation barriers as a function of the acidity of all participants in a proton relay.

Validation of the developed force field showed good agreement with the experimental crystalline structure and the ab initio data.

Currently there are three FDA-approved chemotherapeutic Pt(II) compounds: cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. Until recently, it was believed that all three compounds induced cellular apoptosis through the DNA damage response pathway. Studies within the last decade, however, suggest that oxaliplatin may instead induce cell death through a unique nucleolar stress pathway. Pt(II)-induced nucleolar stress is not well understood and further investigation of this pathway may provide both basic knowledge about nucleolar stress as well as insight for more tunable Pt(II) chemotherapeutics. Through a previous structure-function analysis, it was determined that nucleolar stress induction is highly sensitive to modifications at the 4- position of the 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ring of oxaliplatin. Specifically, more flexible and less rigid substituents (methyl, ethyl, propyl) induce nucleolar stress, while more rigid and bulkier substituents (isopropyl, acetamide) do not. These findings suggest that a click-capable functional group could be installed at the 4- position of the DACH ring while still inducing nucleolar stress. Herein, we report novel click-capable azide-modified oxaliplatin mimics that cause nucleolar stress. Through NPM1 relocalization, fibrillarin redistribution, and \u03b3H2AX phosphorylation studies, key differences have been identified between previously studied click-capable cisplatin mimics and these novel click-capable oxaliplatin mimics. These compounds provide new tools to identify cellular targets and localization through post-treatment Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition and may help to better understand Pt(II)-induced nucleolar stress. To our knowledge, these are the first reported oxaliplatin mimics to include an azide handle, and cis-[(1R, 2R, 4S) 4-methylazido-1,2-cyclohexanediamine]dichlorido platinum(II) is the first azide-functionalized oxaliplatin azide derivative to induce nucleolar stress.", "date": "2023-04-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Understanding the key molecular features that enable interactions with lipids and lead to membrane disruption is therefore crucial. Here we employ a library of lipid-like compounds (lipidoids) comprising modular structures with tunable hydrophobic and hydrophilic architecture, to shed light on how the chemical functionality and molecular shape of synthetic amphiphilic compounds determine their activity against bacterial membranes. Synthesized from combinations of 8 different polyamines as headgroups and 13 acrylates as tails, 104 different lipidoids are tested for activity against a model Gram-positive bacterial strain (Bacillus subtilis). Results from the high-throughput antimicrobial screening assay show that lipidoids with the most potent antimicrobial properties (down to 2 \u03bcM) have intermediate tail hydrophobicity (i.e. logP values between 3 and 4), and lower headgroup charge density (i.e. longer spacer groups between charged amines). However, the most important factor appeared to be the ability of a lipidoid to self-assemble into an inverse hexagonal liquid crystalline phase, as observed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. The lipidoids active at lowest concentrations, and which induced the most significant membrane damage during propidium iodide (PI) permeabilization assays, were those that aggregated into highly-curved inverse hexagonal liquid crystal phases. These observations suggest that the introduction of strong curvature stress into the membrane is one way to maximize membrane disruption and lipidoid antimicrobial activity. Lipidoids that demonstrated the ability to furnish this phase consisted of either i) branched or linear headgroups with shorter linear tails, or ii) cyclic headgroups with 4 bulky non-linear tails. On the contrary, lipidoids previously observed to adopt disc-like conformations that pack into bicontinuous cubic phases were significantly less effective against B. subtilis. The discovery of these structure-property relationships demonstrates that it is not simply a balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties that governs membrane-active antibacterial activity, but also their intrinsic curvature and collective behavior.

In this work, we investigated the effect of 20 distinct substituent groups on the optoelectronic properties of DPP-based derivatives as the donor (D)-material in an organic photovoltaics (OPV) device. For this purpose, we employed Hammett\u2019s theory, which quantifies the electron-donating or -withdrawing properties of a given substituent group. Machine-Learning (ML)-based \u03c3_m, \u03c3_p, \u03c3_m^0, \u03c3_p^0, \u03c3_p^+, \u03c3_p^-, \u03c3_I, and \u03c3_R Hammett\u2019s constants previously determined were used. Mono- (DPP-X1) and di-functionalized (DPP-X2) DPPs, where X is a substituent group, were investigated using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), and ab initio methods. Several properties were computed using CAM-B3LYP and the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), ab initio wave function method, including the adiabatic ionization potential (IP_A), the electro affinity (EA_A), the HOMO-LUMO gaps (E_g), the maximum absorption wavelengths (\u03bb_max), the first excited state transition 1S0 1S1 energies (\u2206E) (the optical gap), and exciton binding energies. From the optoelectronic properties and employing typical acceptor systems, the power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (V_OC), and fill factor (FF) were predicted for a DPP-based OPV device. These photovoltaic properties were also correlated with the ML-based Hammett\u2019s constants. Overall, good correlations between all properties and the different types of \u03c3 constants were obtained, except for the \u03c3_I constants, which are related to inductive effects. This scenario suggests that resonance is the main factor controlling electron donation and withdrawal effects. We found that substituent groups with large \u03c3 values can produce higher photovoltaic efficiencies. It was also found that electron-withdrawing groups reduced E_g and \u2206E considerably compared to the unsubstituted DPP-H. Moreover, for every decrease (increase) in the values of a given optoelectronic property of DPP-X1 systems, a more significant decrease (increase) in the same values was observed for the DPP-X2, thus showing that the addition of second substituent results in a more extensive influence on all electronic properties. For the exciton binding energies, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm identified groups of substituents characterized by average values (centroids) of Hammett\u2019s constants that can drive the search for new DDP-derived materials.

HDMAPAN-(BF4)2, consisting of one dibenzotropylium and one anilinium moiety connected together by a biaryl C-C bond, shows an exceptionally low computed Delta_pKa(hv) (-12.3), which is within the range of superphotoacids. Surprisingly, despite the electronic S0 to S1 transition being located in the dibenzotropylium unit, the photoexcitation affects the acidity of the proton on the anilinium unit. Our computational investigations using TD-DFT reveal that the photoacid is functioning by a new mechanism, in which the excited state antiaromatic character of the dibenzotropylium unit in the S1 state unleashes a local reorganization of the charge distribution, alleviating the destabilizing antiaromatic character. Upon excitation, the positive charge within the dibenzotropylium system is localized on the carbons closest to the anilinium ring, creating an increased electrostatic repulsion against the acidic proton. Placing spacers between the dibenzotropylium and the anilinium moieties gradually reduced the computed Delta_pKa, supporting the electrostatic repulsion between the two ring systems as the main source to the strong photoacidity in HDMAPAN-(BF4)2.

Knowledge of these parameters is a key piece in fully understanding the mechanism of chorismite mutases. Within this study, we utilize EVB/MD free energy perturbations at a range of temperatures, allowing us to extract activation enthalpies and entropies from an Arrhenius plot of reaction free energies of the reaction catalyzed by a monofunctional Bacillus subtilis chorismate mutase and the promiscuous enzyme isochorismate pyruvate lyase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In comparison to the uncatalyzed reaction, our results show that both enzyme-catalyzed reactions exhibit a substantial reduction in activation enthalpy, while the effect on activation entropy is relatively minor, demonstrating that enzyme-catalyzed chorismate mutase reactions are enthalpically-driven. Furthermore, we observe that the monofunctional chorismate mutase from B. subtilis more efficiently catalyzes this reaction than its promiscuous counterpart. This is supported by a structural analysis of the reaction pathway at the transition state, from which we identified key residues explaining the enthalpically-driven nature of the reactions, and also the difference in efficiencies between the two enzymes.", "date": "2023-04-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Software packages providing MP2 energies are commonly based on atom-centered bases with innate issues related to possible basis set superposition errors (BSSE), especially in the case of weakly-bonded systems. Here, we present non-covalent interaction energies in the CBS limit, free of BSSE, for 20 dimer systems of the S22 dataset obtained via a highly-parallelized MP2 implementation in the plane-wave pseudopotential molecular dynamics package CPMD. The specificities related to plane waves for accurate and efficient calculations of gas-phase energies are discussed, and results compared to the localized (aug-)cc-pV[D,T,Q,5]Z correlation-consistent bases as well as their extrapolated CBS estimates. We find that the BSSE-corrected aug-cc-pV5Z basis can provide MP2 energies highly consistent with the CBS plane wave values with a minimum mean absolute deviation of ~0.05 kcal/mol without the application of any extrapolation scheme. In addition, we tested the performance of 13 different extrapolation schemes and found that the $X^{-3}$ expression applied to the (aug-)cc-pVXZ bases provides the smallest deviations against CBS plane wave values if the extrapolation sequence is composed of points D and T, while $(X + \\frac{1}{2})^{-4}$ performs slightly better for TQ and Q5 extrapolations. Also, we propose $A (X-\\frac{1}{2})^{-3} + B (X+\\frac{1}{2})^{-4}$ as a reliable alternative to extrapolate total energies from the DTQ, TQ5 or DTQ5 data points.

There are more than 350,000 chemicals registered for production or use that can potentially end up in the environment. Quantification of emerging contaminants by target analysis has been extensively applied however, these methods are often limited by the availability of analytical standards and resources. The total organic halogen (TOX) method is a comprehensive evaluation of the total halogen content in water including emerging halogenated contaminants and disinfection by-products. In this study, an analytical method was developed to simultaneously quantify TOX as total organic fluorine (TOF), total organic chlorine (TOCl), total organic bromine (TOBr), and total organic iodine (TOI). Halophenol recovery experiments were performed in secondary wastewater effluents for TOF, TOCl, TOBr, and TOI with recoveries between 61-105%. Also, nine halogenated contaminants were spiked into ultrapure water with recoveries between 19-107%. The TOX method was used to evaluate four secondary wastewater effluents prior to disinfection across 2 cities in Alberta, Canada.  It was observed that TOF, TOCl, and TOBr ranged from 4.9 - 10.5 \u00b5g/L, 67.5 - 80.0 \u00b5g/L, and 5.0 \u2013 9.0 \u00b5g/L, respectively whereas TOI was only detected in two samples at 1.8 and 6.1 \u00b5g/L. A sample was analyzed for 196 emerging contaminants to characterize and identify TOX in wastewater for the first time. Target analysis with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry only identified 1.5% of TOX which underlines the severe limitations of target analysis in wastewater samples.

To this end, 1D and quasi-1D (q-1D) vdW crystals comprised of weakly-bound chains with sub-nanometer thicknesses have been discovered and demonstrated to exhibit nascent physics in the bulk. Although established micromechanical and liquid phase exfoliation methods have been applied to access single isolated chains from bulk 1D and q-1D vdW crystals, the existence of interchain vdW interactions with non-equivalent strengths has greatly hindered the ability to achieve uniform single isolated chains. Here, we report that encapsulation of the model q-1D vdW crystal, Sb2Se3, within single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) circumvents the relatively stronger vdW interactions between the chains and allows for the isolation of single chains with structural integrity. Comprehensive high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction studies of the Sb2Se3@CNT heterostructure revealed that the structure of the [Sb4Se6]n chain is preserved, enabling us to systematically probe the size-dependent properties of Sb2Se3 from the bulk down to a single chain. We then show that ensembles of the [Sb4Se6]n chains within CNTs display Raman confinement effects and an emergent band-like absorption onset around 600 nm, suggesting a strong blue shift of the near-infrared band gap of Sb2Se3 into the visible range upon encapsulation. First-principles density functional theory calculations further provided a qualitative insight on the structures and interactions that could manifest in the Sb2Se3@CNT heterostructure. From these calculations, spatial visualization of the electron density difference map of the heterostructure indicated the possibility of electron donation from the host CNT to the guest [Sb4Se6]n chain. Altogether, this model system demonstrates that 1D and q-1D vdW crystals with strongly anisotropic vdW interactions can be precisely studied by encapsulation within carbon nanotubes with suitable diameters, thereby opening opportunities in understanding dimension-dependent properties of a plethora of emergent vdW solids at or approaching the sub-nanometer regime.", "date": "2023-04-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Solid State Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Interest in NHC SAMs is mainly driven by their assumingly higher thermal stability compared to thiolate SAMs most broadly used at the moment. Most of the NHC SAMs utilize imidazolium as an anchoring group for linking molecules to the metal substrate via carbene C atom. It is well established in the literature that standing up and stable NHC SAMs are built only when using bulky side groups attached to nitrogen heteroatoms in imidazolium moiety, which, however, leads to monolayers exhibiting much lower packing density compared to thiolate SAMs. Here, by combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrate that using NHCs with small methyl side groups in combination with simple solution-based preparation leads to the formation of aromatic monolayers exhibiting at least double surface density, upright molecular orientation, and ultra-high thermal stability compared to the NHC SAMs reported before. These parameters are crucial for most applications, including, in particular, molecular and organic electronics, where aromatic SAMs serve either as a passive element for electrode engineering or as an active part of organic field effect transistors and novel molecular electronics devices.", "date": "2023-04-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Self-Assembly; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The traditional broken-symmetry (BS)-DFT computed energy gaps are reported to be somewhat overestimated in comparison to the experimentally observed values. In this work, we have employed different ab initio methods on this prototypical system to obtain more accurate doublet-quartet energy gaps for this triradical. The spin constraint broken symmetry (CBS)-DFT method has been used to reduce the overestimation of energy gaps from BS-DFT. To address the issues of spin-contamination and multi-reference nature of low-spin states affecting the DFT methods, we have computed the energy gaps using appropriately state-averaged CASSCF and NEVPT2 computations. Using a series of active spaces, our calculations are shown to provide quite accurate values in concordance with the experimentally observed results.

The binding pose is reminiscent of an umbrella-shape, where the C-terminus represents the \u2018pole\u2019 and protrudes into the water phase, while the N-terminus and the NAC region span the canopy at the interface. In this binding pose, aS is prone to aggregate, which could explain the catalytic effect of hydrophobic interfaces and air bubbles on aS fibrillation.

Crotonyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (Ccr's) are the most efficient biocatalysts for CO2 fixation because of their oxygen tolerance, their high catalytic rate constants and their high fidelity. The reaction mechanism involving hydride transfer from the NADPH cofactor and addition of CO2 to the reactive enolate, however, is not completely understood. In this study, we use computer simulations in combination with high-level ab initio calculations to trace the free energy landscape along two possible reaction paths: In the direct mechanism hydride transfer is immediately followed by CO2 addition whereas in the C2 mechanism a thermodynamically stable covalent adduct between the substrate and the NADPH cofactor is formed. This C2 adduct, which has been previously characterized experimentally, serves as a stable intermediate avoiding the reduction side reaction of the reactive enolate species and it is able to react with CO2 with similar kinetics as the direct reaction mechanism as confirmed by measured kinetic isotope effects. Thus, our results show that nature's most efficient CO2-fixing enzyme uses the formation of a covalent adduct as a strategy to store the reactive enolate species. The emerging microscopic picture of the CO2-fixing mechanism confirms previous experimental observations and provides new insights into how nature handles highly reactive intermediates to fix this inert greenhouse gas.", "date": "2023-04-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previous studies have indicated that D4R-targeted ligands could be promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). There are currently no FDA-approved medications that selectively target D4Rs. New ligands may facilitate better understanding of the role of D4R-mediated signaling in drug-taking and drug-seeking behaviors. The present study focuses on the synthesis and evaluation of a novel series of benzothiazole analogues designed to target D4R. We identified several compounds with high D4R binding affinity (Ki \u2264 6.87 nM) and >91-fold selectivity over other D2-like receptors (D2R, D3R) with diverse partial agonist and antagonist profiles. Based on receptor affinity and functional analyses, 5f was identified as a potent low-efficacy partial agonist of the D4R and selected for further investigation. 5f was metabolically stable in rat and human liver microsome assays and displayed excellent brain penetration in rats. Using a within-session multidosing procedure, 5f (5, 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased i.v. infusions of three-unit doses of cocaine under a fixed-ratio (FR) FR3 schedule of reinforcement. These results are consistent with previous results produced by D4R-selective antagonists in SUD models, however off-target antagonism of 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors may also contribute to these effects. Results with compound 5f support further efforts to target D4R in the treatment of SUDs.

BBOA influences the climate by scattering and absorbing solar radiation or acting as nuclei for cloud formation. The viscosity and the phase behavior (i.e. the number and type of phases present in a particle) are properties of BBOA that are expected to impact several climate-relevant processes but remain highly uncertain. We studied the phase behavior of BBOA using fluorescence microscopy, and showed that BBOA particles comprise two organic phases (a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic phase) across a wide range of atmospheric relative humidity (RH). We determined the viscosity of the two phases using a photobleaching method, and showed that the two phases possess different RH-dependent viscosities. The viscosity of the hydrophobic phase is largely independent of the RH from 0 to 95%. For temperatures less than 230 K, the hydrophobic phase is glassy (viscosity > 1012 Pa s) at RHs below 95%, with possible implications for heterogeneous reaction kinetics and cloud formation in the atmosphere. Using a kinetic multi-layer model (KM-GAP), we investigated the effect of two phases on the atmospheric lifetime of brown carbon within BBOA, which is a climate-warming agent. We showed that the presence of two phases can increase the lifetime of brown carbon in the planetary boundary layer and polar regions compared to previous modelling studies. Hence, liquid-liquid phase separation can lead to an increase in the predicted warming effect of BBOA on climate.", "date": "2023-04-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The Heck-type mechanism for \u03b1-arylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones is proved to be less feasible due to the high energy barrier for the insertion step.

Distortion/interaction analysis, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, and bur-ied volume calculations indicate that the regioselectivity is primarily controlled by the steric hindrance at the region of the ligand close to the enone. The indole ring of the phosphine ligand lay upward or downward, varying the space crowding in the region, thus leading to different protonation products followed by corresponding reductive elimination.

To further optimize the anode, electrolytes and interfacial chemistry are critical in improving cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), a weakly solvating and a wide temperature solvent, is used as an alternative co-solvent to ethylene carbonate (EC) to deliver a high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) up to 75%. The larger interlayer spacing, low surface area, and slit-shaped micro and mesoporous presence in the WPET-HC structure enhance the low potential plateau capacity to 68%, showing a more battery-type anode material from plastic trash. The WPET-HC delivered the excellent reversible capacity of 356 mAh g-1 at the current density of 30 mA g-1 with superior cycling of 91% after 100 cycles using CPME-PC-based electrolyte. The reduction of CPME co-solvent forms a more inorganic SEI than EC-generated SEI, providing a stable and thin SEI layer boosting the ICE and cycling stability of the anode. The low-temperature battery metric for CPME-PC-based electrolytes showed ~30% added capacity and improved ICE  value compared to EC-PC-based electrolytes.

The workflow capabilities includes: (1) setting up user-defined combinatorial chemical spaces of charge neutral mixtures of arbitrary molten mixtures spanning 11 cations (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and two heavy species, Nd and Th) and 4 anions (F, Cl, Br and I), (2) configurational sampling using low-cost empirical parameterizations, (3) ensemble active learning for down-selecting configurational samples for single point density functional theory calculations at the level of strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional, and (4) Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning of two-body and many-body GAP models.

In this tutorial mini-review, we highlight major limitations in the methodologies, and showcase important achievements towards developing more sustainable synthetic strategies. Compared to multi-step hard-templating/nano-casting procedures, soft-templating techniques can provide more efficient, benign, and direct ways to produce these nanostructures.

The formaldehyde crosslinker has been replaced with more benign, less toxic alternatives (e.g., glyoxal), and catalyst-free crosslinking approaches have been developed. Furthermore, the use of biobased building-blocks for the carbon precursor, such as lignin, plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., tannins), and various saccharides (e.g., D-glucose, D-fructose), has also been explored.

As requirements and contaminants vary on a local level, adjustable filter devices and their evaluation with contaminants are required. Within this work we design modular filter devices featuring an adjustable surface functionalization. For this purpose, we create 3D-printed structures fabricated of bio-based poly(lactic acid) (PLA) that are manufactured by extrusion printing. The surface of PLA is activated with amino groups that are used to install xanthates as chain transfer agents (CTA)s. Subsequently, photo-iniferter (PI)-RAFT polymerization is used to create cationic polymer brushes on the surface of PLA substrates. The polymerization is first optimized in solution and then transferred to the interface of 3D-printed devices. Multiple surface characterization techniques are employed to prove successful growth of polymer brushes on PLA. The degree of polymerization of cationic polymers is varied and found to influence the interaction of the interface with planktonic bacteria. After initial optimization studies on flat surfaces, filter devices are printed, functionalized, and used to remove bacteria from contaminated water. Significant reduction of microorganisms is detected after filtration (single filtration or cycling) and contaminating organism could also be removed from freshwater samples by simple incubation with a 3D-printed filter. The herein developed setup for producing functional filter devices and probing their performance in affinity filtration is a useful platform technology, enabling the implementation of polymer brushes for such applications.

The current paper focuses on particle-based surfactants and reports about numerous unexpected properties. The main goal is the creation of an amphiphilic system with responsiveness in surface activity and associated self-organization phenomena depending on the application of an external trigger, preferably a physical field. A key step is the creation of a Janus-type particle characterized by two types of dipoles (electric and magnetic) which geometrically stand orthogonal to each other.

Developing new catalysts for the ethanol dehydrogenation process, which could sustainably substitute current acetaldehyde production methods, is highly desired.

Unfortunately, the Cu-based catalysts suffer from sintering and coking, which lead to rapid deactivation with time-on-stream (TOS). Phosphorus doping has been demonstrated to diminish coking in methanol dehydrogenation, fluid catalytic cracking, and ethanol-to-olefin reactions. This work reports a pioneering application of the well-characterized copper phosphinate complexes as molecular precursors for copper-based ethanol dehydrogenation catalysts enriched with phosphate groups (Cu-phosphate/SiO2).

The unusual behavior could be explained by the presence of the phosphate phase, which prevented the Cu2+ reduction. The phosphorus content gradually decreased during time-on-stream, copper was reduced, and the activity increased. The deactivation of the catalyst could be related to the copper diffusion processes.

The design of supramolecular structures involving carbon-rich molecules, such as arenes, has almost exclusively been limited to \u03c0-stacking of aromatic systems, or derivatization with heteroatoms as sites for molecular recognition. Here, we demonstrate that C-I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C\u03c0 halogen bonds to carbon-based \u03c0-systems can be reliably used as direction-al interactions for the creation of extended structures based on planar, as well as curved aromatic systems, without any need for derivatization or \u03c0-stacking. Specifically, we describe the first systematic study of a series of cocrystals containing non-derivatized carbon-only aromatic systems of different sizes and shapes, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fullerene C60, which are held together by directional halogen bonds to aromatic carbon atoms. In a large majority (~90%) of structures, the C-I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C\u03c0 halogen bonding with PAHs leads to a supramolecular ladder-like motif, in which the PAHs act as the rungs and halogen bond donors as rails, demonstrating this motif as the first example of a supramolecular synthon based on carbon. These results, supported by novel cocrystal structures, theoretical calculations, and a systematic analysis of the Cambridge Structural Database, offer a new, previously overlooked paradigm for the assembly of carbon-only aromatic systems, not based on \u03c0-stacking, but via specific, directional halogen bonding. This new ability to use a car-bon-based supramolecular synthon to direct the assembly aromatic systems provides an exciting opportunity to create materials with new and modified properties based on non-derivatized aromatic systems, as seen from large red and blue shifts in solid-state luminescence for cocrystals of pyrene, coronene and perylene, as well as the appearance of room-temperature phosphorescence upon cocrystal formation.", "date": "2023-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Physical and Chemical Properties; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the Barbier variant of the Grignard synthesis, the generation of air- and moisture-sensitive Grignard reagents occurs concurrently with their reaction with an electrophile. Although operationally simpler, the classic Barbier approach suffers from low yields due to multiple side reactions, thereby limiting the scope of its application. Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg-mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, O-benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C\u2013C, C\u2013N, C\u2013Si, and C\u2013B bonds. In contrast to the classic two-step Grignard synthesis, the mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent-free, single step, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and other proton donors. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating that the reaction predominantly proceeds via the generation of transient organometallics, which occurs rapidly due to improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal", "date": "2023-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

There is currently no small molecule probe capable of fluorescently labeling AGPs. The Yariv reagents are the only small molecules that bind AGP, and have been used to study AGP function and isolate AGPs via precipitation of an AGP-Yariv complex.

A fluorescent version of a Yariv reagent that is capable of both binding as well as imaging AGPs would provide a powerful tool for studying AGPs in planta.

For screening a large number of materials we also increasingly rely on isotherms predicted from molecular simulations. In particular, for such screening studies, it is important that the procedures to generate the data are accurate, reliable, and robust. In this work, we develop an efficient and automated workflow for a meticulous sampling of pure component isotherms. The workflow was tested on a set of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and proved to be reliable given different guest molecules. We show that the coupling of our workflow with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation saves CPU time, yet enables us to accurately predict pure component isotherms at the temperatures of interest, starting from a reference isotherm at a given temperature. We also show that one can accurately predict the CO2 and N2 mixture isotherms using Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST). In particular, we show that IAST is a more reliable numerical tool to predict binary adsorption uptakes for a range of pressures, temperatures, and compositions, as it does not rely on the fitting of experimental data, which typically needs to be done with analytical models such as dual-site Langmuir (DSL). This makes IAST a more suitable and general technique to bridge the gap between adsorption (raw) data and process modelling. To demonstrate this point, we show that the ranking of materials, for a standard 3-step Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) process, can be significantly different depending on the thermodynamic method used to predict binary adsorption data. We show that for the design of processes that capture CO2 from low concentration (0.4%) streams, the commonly used methodology to predict mixture isotherms incorrectly assigns up to 33% of the materials as top-performing.", "date": "2023-04-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Thermodynamics (Chem.

This is due to the high degree of disorder, which poses significant challenges for structural analysis using conventional crystallographic approaches. Herein, we study the structure of gamma-Al2O3 with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and ab-initio calculations to provide a complete structural description. We show that the microstructure can be understood in terms of two key structural features of nanoscale spinel domains and finite thickness segments termed as complex antiphase boundaries (cAPB) that provide the domain interconnectivity. The spinel domains have a distinctive preference for vacancy ordering, which can be rationalized in terms of a structure with a stacking disorder. Tetragonal P41212 or monoclinic P21 models, all based on the identical motif, can be considered as representative ordered forms. Individual spinel domains are interconnected via cAPBs, which adopt a distinct non-spinel bonding environment of gamma-Al2O3. The most common cAPB consists of a single delta motif with thickness of just 0.6 nm on (001), with the resulting displacement a/4 [101]. Remarkably, the cAPBs are shown to energetically stabilize the spinel domains of gamma-Al2O3 explaining their high abundance. We demonstrate how the tetragonal distortions naturally arise in this intricate microstructure and place the proposed model in the context of phase transformations to high temperature transition aluminas.

One promising approach to inhibit SACS demetalation is the use of metallic particles to interact with SACS. However, the mechanism underlying this stabilization remains unclear. In this study, we propose and validate a unified mechanism by which metal particles can inhibit the demetalation of Fe SACS. Metal particles act as electron donors, decreasing the Fe valence by increasing the electron density at the FeN4 position, thereby strengthening the Fe-N bond, and inhibiting electrochemical Fe dissolution. Different types, forms, and contents of metal particles increase the Fe-N bond strength to varying extents. A linear correlation between Fe valence, Fe-N bond strength, and electrochemical Fe dissolution amount supports this mechanism. Our screening of a particle-assisted Fe SAC led to a 78% reduction in Fe dissolution, enabling continuous operation for up to 430 hours in a fuel cell.

In many prospective applications, such as catalysis, the utility of a single-chain nanoparticle will intricately depend on the formation of a mostly specific structure or morphology. However, it is not generally well understood how to reliably control the morphology of single-chain nanoparticles. To address this knowledge gap, we simulate the formation of 7,680 distinct single-chain nanoparticles from precursor chains that span a wide range of, in principle, tunable patterning characteristics of cross-linking moieties. Using a combination of molecular simulation and machine learning analyses, we show how the overall fraction of functionalization and blockiness of cross-linking moieties biases the formation of certain local and global morphological characteristics.  Importantly, using the total volume of simulation data, we illustrate and quantify the dispersity of morphologies that arise due to both the stochastic nature of collapse from a well-defined sequence as well as from the ensemble of sequences that correspond to a given specification of precursor parameters.  Moreover, we also examine the efficacy of precise sequence control in achieving morphological outcomes in different regimes of precursor parameters. Overall, this work critically assesses how precursor chains might be feasibly tailored to achieve given SCNP morphologies and provides a platform to pursue future sequence-based design.", "date": "2023-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Polymer chains; Polymer morphology; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this paper, we solve this problem by using organic acids (acetic, citric and oxalic) and nanoscale graphene-like carbon. The organic acid solution significantly increases the yield and rate of H2 generation due to its acidic nature. The hydrogen yield approaches 100% with a fast hydrolysis rate when the molar ratio Acid/MgH2 exceeds 0.9, 2.0 and 2.7 for the citric, oxalic and acetic acid, respectively.

N. Catherine Lam; Edouard Asselin", "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of water and CO2 exposure on the performance of epoxy-based coatings under conditions commonly found in pipeline applications. The permeability of fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) decreases as CO2 pressure increases and the presence of water facilitates gas transport through the coating. The latter is in conflict with theories of membrane selectivity and competitive transport in gas/vapor systems, in which water is the predominant permeant for its lower kinetic diameter and higher condensability. Our results show that this anomaly was due to the dynamic transformation of permeable channels in the coating structure. Microstructural characterization of FBE after exposure to CO2/H2O mixtures showed that carbonation of wollastonite filler particles results in a change in shape, volume, and chemical composition of these filler particles. The chemical reaction between wollastonite and CO2 in the presence of water led to a degradation that caused changes in porosity, permeability, and filler volume. To verify these findings for the coating in the presence of adhesion forces, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used. The tests conducted showed that exposure to a CO2/H2O mixture causes filler particles within the coating to undergo carbonation, leading to the formation of new microchannels within the epoxy network. Initially, the carbonation of fillers led to an increase in the pore resistance of the coating, which was attributed to the plugging of micropore channels on the coating surface. However, the subsequent decreasing trend of this parameter suggested that water infiltration into the coating had increased due to this degradation. The carbonation of wollastonite within the FBE coating leads to a volume change in the fillers, resulting in the creation of small voids or gaps in the epoxy matrix. This, in turn, facilitates the easier penetration of water and dissolved gas to the underlying substrate. Consequently, the accumulation of water inside coating increases the dielectric constant, resulting in a higher capacitance of the coating. It appears that high concentrations of CO2 in wet conditions, even at low pressures, can have negative impacts on the barrier performance of the coating.", "date": "2023-04-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Coating Materials; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

While designed as a competitor of the substrate S-farnesyl cysteine on Ras, it is a potent competitive inhibitor of isoprenylcysteine carboxymethyl transferase. Although different salirasib derivatives have been reported, the isoprenyl tail has not been modified. In this study, we used a series of synthetic salirasib analogues with lipophilic thioether modifications, including those with or without a 1,2,3-triazole linker, and tested their antiproliferative activity against six different solid tumor cell lines. We carried out a combination of bioassay, cheminformatics, and in silico ADME-Tox to identify new potent analogues. SAR analysis revealed structural and physicochemical features that enhance antiproliferative activity. Analogues with three or more isoprene units or a long aliphatic chain exhibited the most potent activity. Furthermore, we identified three compounds with superior antiproliferative activity than salirasib and similar potency compared to control anticancer drugs across all tested solid tumor cell lines. In addition, the behaviour of the collection on migration and invasion, the key processes in tumor metastasis, were also studied. Three analogs with specific antimigratory activity were identified with differential structural features. \nThe combination of the antiproliferative and antimigratory results prompts to propose that the modification on the thiol aliphatic/prenyl substituents can modulate the activity.

Current depolymerization approaches typically require elevated temperatures (>350 \u02daC), high dilutions in specific solvents (typically 0.1-25 mM polymer concentrations), and/or expensive catalysts. Here, we report that RAFT-synthesized polymers can undergo a low-temperature solvent-free depolymerization back to monomer thanks to the partial in-situ transformation of the RAFT end-group to macromonomer. To aid a more complete depolymerization, we performed a facile and quantitative end-group modification strategy with the modified RAFT polymers exhibiting significantly higher depolymerization conversions (~90%) at comparable temperatures. The end-group transformation was applied to polymers synthesized by ATRP triggering an efficient low-temperature bulk depolymerization (~90% of monomer regeneration) with an onset at 150 \u02daC, in contrast to previous reports where depolymerization could only be triggered at much higher temperatures (> 350 \u02daC). The versatility of the methodology was demonstrated by a scalable depolymerization (~10 g of starting polymer) retrieving 84% yield of the starting monomer intact which could be subsequently used for further polymerization.

The onset of a disease often stimulates antibody production at low quantities, making it crucial to develop sensitive, specific, and easy-to-use antibody assay platforms. Antibodies are also extensively used as probes in bioassays, and there is a need for simpler methods to evaluate specialized probes such as antibody-oligonucleotide (AbO) conjugates. Previously, we have demonstrated that thermofluorimetric analysis (TFA) of analyte-driven DNA assembly can be leveraged to detect protein biomarkers using AbO probes. A key advantage of this technique is its ability to circumvent autofluorescence arising from biological samples, which otherwise hampers homogenous assays. The analysis of differential DNA melt curves (dF/dT) successfully distinguishes the signal from background and interferences. Expanding the applicability of TFA further, here-in we demonstrate a unique proximity based TFA assay for antibody quantification which is functional in 90% human plasma. We show that conformational flexibility of the DNA-based proximity probes is critically important for optimal performance in these assays. To promote stable, proximity-induced hybridization of the short DNA strands, substitution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacers in place of ssDNA segments led to improved conformational flexibility and sensor performance. Finally, by applying these flexible spacers to study AbO conjugates directly, we validate this modified TFA approach as a novel tool to elucidate the probes valency, clearly distinguishing between monovalent and multivalent AbOs and reducing the reagent amounts by 12-fold", "date": "2023-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

How catalyzed interfacial WD is driven by voltage, however, is not understood. We designed a BPM electrolyzer with two reference electrodes attached laterally to each layer/side (here, poly(arylpiperidinium) and perfluorosulfonic-acid ionomers) to measure WD current and overpotential (\u03b7wd), without soluble electrolyte and as a function of temperature and catalyst-layer properties. Using TiO2-P25 nanoparticles as a model WD catalyst, Arrhenius-type analysis yields a WD activation energy Ea of 25\u201330 kJ mol\u22121, only weakly dependent \u03b7wd. The pre-exponential factor is unexpectedly proportional to \u03b7wd. With D2O, \u03b7wd is ~2 to 4 times larger than in H2O, largely due to a lower pre-exponential factor. Without catalyst, \u03b7wd is ~10-fold larger and Ea decreases from 34 to 24 kJ mol\u22121 as \u03b7wd goes from 0.1 to 1 V. To explain these data, we propose a new WD mechanism where metal-oxide nanoparticles, polarized by the voltage across the BPM junction, serve as i) proton acceptors (from water) on the negative sides of the particle to generate free OH\u2212, ii) proton donors on the positive sides to generate H3O+, and iii) surface proton conductors that connect spatially separate donor/acceptor sites. Increasing electric-field strength with overpotential orients water for proton-transfer elementary steps comprising WD, increasing the pre-exponential factor and hence rate, but is insufficient to lower Ea.

While the past two decades have brought Markov State Model techniques to the point where practitioners can regularly use them to glimpse the long-time dynamics of slow conformations in complex systems, many systems are still beyond their reach. In this perspective, we discuss how memory can reduce the computational cost to predict the long-time dynamics in these complex systems by orders of magnitude and with greater accuracy and resolution than state-of-the-art Markov State Models. We illustrate how memory lies at the heart of successful and promising techniques, ranging from the Fokker-Planck and generalized Langevin equations to deep learning recurrent neural networks and generalized master equations. We delineate how these techniques work, identify insights that they can offer in biomolecular systems, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in practical settings. We show how generalized master equations can enable the investigation of, for example, the gate-opening process in RNA polymerase II and demonstrate how our recent advances tame the deleterious influence of statistical underconvergence of the molecular dynamics simulations used to parameterize these techniques. This represents a significant leap forward that will enable our memory-based techniques to interrogate systems that are currently beyond the reach of even the best Markov State Models.

Recently, systematic ``bottom-up\" CG models have been introduced to capture electronic structure variations of molecules and polymers at the CG resolution. However, the performance of these models is limited by the ability to select reduced representations that preserve electronic structure information, which remains a challenge. We propose two methods for (i) identifying important electronically coupled atomic degrees of freedom and (ii) scoring the efficacy of CG representations used in conjunction with CG electronic predictions. The first method is a physically-motivated approach that incorporates nuclear vibrations and electronic structure derived from simple quantum chemical calculations. We complement this physically-motivated approach with a machine learning technique based on the marginal contribution of nuclear degrees of freedom to electronic prediction accuracy using an equivariant graph neural network. By integrating these two approaches, we can both identify critical electronically coupled atomic coordinates and score the efficacy of arbitrary CG representations for making electronic predictions. We leverage this capability to make a connection between optimized CG representations and the future potential for ``bottom-up\" development of simplified model Hamiltonians incorporating non-linear vibrational modes.", "date": "2023-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, simulations of POPC and PBd22-b-PEO14 hybrid membranes are shown, uncovering different copolymer configurations depending on the polymer-to- lipid ratio. High polymer concentrations created thicker membranes with an extended polymer conformation, while high lipid content led to the collapse of the polymer chain. High concentration of polymer further correlated with a decreased area com- pression modulus and altered lateral pressure profiles, hypothesized to result in the experimentally-observed improvement in membrane protein reconstitution and resis- tance towards destabilization by detergents.

One difficulty with neural-network output is that it is often unreliable in regions where training data is missing or sparse. Human-designed potentials often build in proper extrapolation behavior by choice of functional form. Because machine learning is very efficient, it is desirable to learn how to add human intelligence to machine-learned potentials in a convenient way. One example is the well understood feature of interaction potentials that they vanish when subsystems are too far separated to interact. In this article, we present a way to add a new kind of activation function to a neural network to enforce low-dimensional constraints. In particular the activation function depends parametrically on all the input variables. We illustrate the use of this step by showing how it can force an interaction potential to go to zero at large subsystem separations with either inputting a specific functional form for the potential or adding data to the training set in the asymptotic region of geometries where the subsystems are separated. In the process of illustrating this, we present an improved set of potential energy surfaces for the 14 lowest 3A\u00b4 states of O3. The method is more general than this example, and it may be used to add other low-dimensional knowledge or lower-level knowledge to machine-learned potentials. In addition to the O3 example, we present a greater-generality method called parametrically managed diabatization by deep neural network (PM-DDNN) that is an improvement on our previously presented permutationally restrained diabatization by deep neural network (PR-DDNN).", "date": "2023-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We verify that the polymers generally access the highest percentage of redox-active groups with K+ (versus Na+ and Li+) due to its small solvation shell/energy and favorable soft-soft interactions with reduced PDI species.

Reaction with N2O etched the NP surfaces at rates that increased with temperature and were linear with N2O pressure.  The etching efficiency was two orders of magnitude lower for N2O compared to O2 at 1600 K, and one order of magnitude lower at 1900 K.  The etching and sublimation kinetics were followed over time as the NPs lost up to ~40% of their initial masses.  Sublimation gradually slowed over time, as expected because mass tends to be lost from the least stable surface sites, increasing the average stability of the remaining sites.  O2 etching also slowed over time, but N2O etching rates initially increased.  This observation indicates that N2O dissociative adsorption can occur at surface sites different from those that dominate the kinetics for O2 dissociative adsorption or sublimation.  At long reaction times, the NPs passivated against further N2O attack even at 1800 K, indicating transformation of the surface layer to a structure with few under-coordinated reactive sites.\n", "date": "2023-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Chemical Kinetics; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Herein, we promoted the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) of platinum (Pt) in base by introducing N-methylimidazoles into the Pt-water interface. In situ spectroscopic characterization of the interface together with Quantum Mechanics computations showed that this promotion is caused by the N-methylimidazoles facilitating diffusion of hydroxides across the interface by holding the second layer water close to Pt surfaces. We accordingly propose that the HER/HOR kinetics of Pt in acid and base is governed by diffusion of protons and hydroxides, respectively, through the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water by the Grotthuss mechanism, which accounts for the pH-dependent HER/HOR kinetics of platinum, a long-standing puzzle.

Here, we report that the metallanucleophile, K[CpFe(CO)2] (KFp), is readily arylated by aryl fluorides to provide CpFe(CO)2Ar (FpAr) complexes at ambient conditions in the absence of any catalyst, contrary to previous literature reports. This C-F activation likely proceeds by a SNAr mechanism rather than the more common oxidative addition pathway for metal-mediated C-F cleavage. Facile access to FpAr derivatives has enabled further development of Fe-promoted coupling reactions of aryl fluorides with alkenes and alkynes. Under stoichiometric Fe conditions, the first documented examples of Heck-type coupling reactions with aryl fluoride electrophiles are reported herein. Various aryl fluorides were found to couple with olefins to provide E-alkene products; aliphatic derivatives unexpectedly underwent reduction to 1,2-disubsituted ethane products to varying extents. Aryl fluorides were also found to couple with 5-decyne to yield indene derivatives in a one-pot manner; indeneone and indanone products were also observed in selected cases. A mechanistic investigation to identify the apparently potent hydride donor generated under these conditions was conducted, leading to a mechanistic hypothesis involving the intermediacy of metal carbonyl-capped, triple-decker ferrocene compounds as reductants. Despite the involvement of these diiron intermediates limiting stoichiometric product yields, the observed C-C coupling reactions expand the limits of organofluorine chemistry.", "date": "2023-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organometallic Chemistry; Bond Activation", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, there has yet to be any previous research investigating the detailed mechanism of this reaction. Therefore, density functional theory calculations were performed to provide mechanistic insight into the hydrothiolation of cyclopropenes. The study results show that when L5 is the ligand, cyclopropyl sulfide 3 is the main product, and reductive elimination is the rate-determining step. However, allylic sulfide 4 becomes the primary product when L8 is employed. The reaction follows the carbene formation pathway instead of the initially proposed cyclopropene \u03c0 bond activation pathway. The chemoselectivity is determined by the competition with Rh\u2212C\u03b3 insertion and reductive elimination. When L5 as the ligand, the origin of the chemoselectivity can be attributed to the electronic effect, steric hindrance effect, and C\u2013H\u2026\u03c0 interaction. Additionally, the distortion/interaction analysis shows that the allylic sulfide originated predominantly due to the lower distortion energy of the substrate fragment in the reductive elimination transition state under the L8 ligand.", "date": "2023-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organometallic Chemistry; Theory - Organometallic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The free-base ligands were readily derivatized to their Pd(II), Pt(II), and Mn(II) complexes; of these, one Pd(II) complex was structurally characterized. Three of the complexes, M[Me-AHP] (M = Pd, Pt, Mn), were singled out for photophysical and singlet oxygen sensitization studies. Although none of the new complexes proved luminescent, Pd[Me-AHP] was found to be an excellent singlet oxygen sensitizer, with a singlet oxygen quantum yield of 84% in 9:1 v/v ethanol:tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. The corresponding value for Pt[Me-AHP] was found to be only 11% and that for Mn[Me-AHP] essentially 0%. These singlet oxygen quantum yields were consonant with triplet lifetimes accessed via transition absorption spectroscopy.

Cobalt is also the preferred metallic binder for tungsten carbide tools manufacturing. The recent increasing criticality of cobalt and tungsten is driving the interest of manufacturers and researchers towards high-rate recycling of Hard Metals (HMs) waste for limiting the demand of raw materials. A simple and environmentally friendly hydrometallurgical route for Co selective dissolution from HM wastes was developed by using weak, bio-derived and biodegradable organic acids (OAs). In this study OAs, namely acetic (HAc), citric (H3Cit), maleic (H2Mal), lactic (HLac), succinic (H2Suc), lactobionic (HLB), and itaconic (H2It) acids, were selected for their pKa1 values spanning from 1.8 to 4.7 and systematically tested as selective cobalt leaching agents from WC-Co-based wastes in water, isolating the formed complexes at the solid state. Thereby, all of them seemed to be efficient in selective Co-leaching, achieving almost quantitative Co dissolution from HM by-products still at low concentration level and room conditions in a short time, leaving the residual WC unreacted and ready to be re-employed for industrial purposes. Nevertheless, two main categories of organic acids were distinguished depending on their oxidizing/complexing behavior: Class 1 OAs, where the metal oxidation is carried out by H+; Class 2 OAs where oxidation is played by an external oxidant like O2. A combined experimental/theoretical investigation is here described to show the reasons behind this peculiar behavior and laid the foundation for a wider discussion on the leaching capabilities of OAs towards elemental metals. Due to the demonstrated effectiveness, low cost, eco-friendliness and large availability through biotechnological fermentative processes, particular attention is here devoted to the use of HLac in hydrometallurgy as an example of Class 2 OA.

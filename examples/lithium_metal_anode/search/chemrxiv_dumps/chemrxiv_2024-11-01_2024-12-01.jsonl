The platform hosts a growing library of state-of-the-art UAIQM models with calibrated uncertainties and provides a mechanism for improving the foundational models continuously with more usage. We demonstrate how the UAIQM platform can be used for massive accurate simulations within hours on a commodity hardware which would take days or weeks on high-performance computing centers with less accurate workhorse quantum chemical methods. We also show that UAIQM sets a new standard for infrared spectra, reaction barriers, and energetics whose accurate predictions can have far-reaching consequences in molecular simulations.", "date": "2024-11-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Macfarlane; Polina Anikeeva", "abstract": "Chemical interactions between nanoparticles and their surroundings are governed by their surface chemistry. Therefore, a versatile strategy for surface functionalization that is compatible with a variety of particle compositions would empower nanotechnology research. Silica coating offers a promising approach, but the ease with which silica shells can be synthesized is determined by the initial solution state of the nanoparticle, since the silica sol-gel chemistry typically occurs in an aqueous phase. While protocols for coating water-soluble particles are well-established, protocols for nanomaterials suspended in organic solvents require phase-transfer during the coating process, often leading to inconsistent reproducibility, non-uniform thicknesses, difficulty in producing thin coatings, and particle aggregation during functionalization. Here, we demonstrate that these challenges stem from insufficient stabilization of the organic-phase particles during the phase transfer, and can be overcome by adding excess surface ligands during the silica growth process. The inclusion of these excess ligands sufficiently alters the nanoparticles\u2019 surface chemistry to suppress particle aggregation, allowing deposition of shells as thin as 0.7 nm on a wide range of nanoparticle compositions, sizes, and shapes. The versatility and reproducibility of this approach is illustrated through its application to isotropic magnetite nanoparticles with diameters between 20-28 nm, anisotropic magnetite nanodiscs >200 nm in diameter, and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. These silica-coated nanomaterials retain their functional properties, and the silica shell can be further modified with application-specific organic moieties. This approach therefore provides a versatile means of stabilizing nanomaterials for applications that demand precise control over their surface chemistry independent of their functional properties.", "date": "2024-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nanotherapeutics capable of detecting distinctive chemical signals within the disparate metabolic states of invasive cancer phenotypes represents a promising avenue for eliciting a favourable anti-tumor response, thereby enhancing drug efficacy and safety through microenvironment-selective cellular uptake and intracellular release. For instance, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is notoriously difficult to treat, typically features extracellular acidification and elevated intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. By leveraging these distinctive metabolic characteristics, we have developed a surface-modified translational human serum albumin (HSA) nanocarrier, termed His-aHSA, which features anionic carboxylic acid and pH-inducible positively charged imidazole groups. This modification endows the nanocarrier with the ability to perceive the acidic TME, responding to a pH change typical for glycolytic, lactate producing tumors, which enables selective uptake into TNBC cells and spheroids. Notably, the nanocarrier His66-aHSA demonstrated a substantial increase in uptake at pH 6.5 of invasive TNBC in comparison to the pH relevant for normal tissue (pH 7.4). Furthermore, the clinically approved chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine was conjugated via a self-immolative, redox-sensitive linker that responds to the high GSH levels typical of TNBC cancer cells and spheroids, thereby achieving a controlled and traceless intracellular drug release. It is notable that the traceless cleavable analogue (Gem-SS-His66-aHSA) exhibits a comparable IC\u2085\u2080 value of 6.1 nM, similar to that of the native drug (4.4 nM).

This issue is exacerbated by the inherent characteristics of plastics, including their high thermal stability and low biodegradability. In response, the scientific community has dedicated significant efforts to combat plastic pollution and develop environmentally sustainable soft materials. A promising approach is the creation of soft materials that can be efficiently recycled within a closed-loop system, thereby minimizing their chemical impact on the environment. This study introduces polyacylhydrazones as a novel class of soft materials with the potential for closed-loop recycling. Closed-loop polymers are sought after as sustainable materials of the future. Dynamic covalent polymers have the potential to act as closed-loop materials because of their reversible linkages.  However, very few materials currently exist. Polyacylhydrazones have been explored as dynamic covalent polymers with multiple uses. Herein we demonstrate the first study that shows their potential as closed-loop materials. We show novel synthetic techniques that produce hydrophobic polyacylhydrazones with unique length and morphology under kinetic control. We demonstrate preliminary potential applications. Finally, we show the facile decom-position of a benzylic hydrazone bond down to monomeric units and extraction-based separation, without the need for chromatography.

This process entails the spontaneous accumulation of population in the polariton ground state and relies on efficient energy relaxation. In this class of materials, this relaxation is mediated by exciton reservoir emission, which pumps polariton states through radiative pumping. To achieve strong light-matter coupling and sustain a high polariton density, the material must possess excitations with large oscillator strength and high exciton binding energy. While 2D perovskites exhibit these desirable characteristics, there are no reports of room-temperature polariton condensation and only one successful demonstration at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we systematically explore the role of energy alignment between the exciton reservoir emission and the lower polariton branch in populating the polariton ground state via radiative pumping. Through cavity detuning, we shift the lower polariton energy minimum to overlap with the emission of the exciton reservoir at different energies. We identify that the multiple radiative pathways of 2D perovskites lead to inefficient radiative pumping of the lower polariton branch at the lowest energy state, ultimately posing challenges for polariton condensation in this class of materials.\n\u2003\n", "date": "2024-11-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, microbubble coalescence remains a significant challenge. High production temperatures (e.g. 55\u00b0 C) can be used to suppress coalescence, but it complicates the microfluidic device design and is incompatible with targeting agents and drug conjugates. This study investigates the production of monodisperse microbubbles at room temperature with the addition of the amphiphilic surfactant Pluronic F68. Two 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-based phospholipid formulations were investigated: F1, containing 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[carbonyl-methoxypolyethylene glycol] (DPPE-PEG5000), and F2, which included both DPPE-PEG5000 and polyoxyethylene(40) stearate (PEG40-stearate). We characterized the size stability and acoustic behavior of monodisperse microbubbles produced with various Pluronic F68 concentrations. Adding 5-10 mol% Pluronic F68 was found to effectively suppress coalescence and facilitated the production of monodisperse microbubbles that remained shelf stability for at least 7 days. Acoustic attenuation measurements revealed a shell stiffness ranging from 0.78 to 0.93 N/m for these microbubbles. The 10 mol% Pluronic F68 addition (10PF) demonstrated superior monodispersity and was selected for further experiments. Upon dilution, the size and resonance frequencies of both F1-10PF and F2-10PF decreased over time, though F2-10PF showed better stability compared to F1-10PF for both metrics. Both F1-10PF and F2-10PF exhibited a stronger subharmonic scattering intensity than SonoVue (clinical approved microbubbles), which offers potential for blood pressure sensing.

The applicability of the Butler Volmer equation (B-Ve) based on Tafel analysis is limited to single electron transfer reactions which are not typical of CO2 reduction reactions on Cu catalysts. We developed a method that involves linking the nanoscale effects encapsulated in a detailed calibrated microkinetic model (MKM) on Cu(100) electrodes to a mass transport model (MTM) on a low surface area, flooded agglomerate electrode. The MKM carries richer kinetic information of most reaction pathways described in contemporary literature for Cu(100). Polynomial equations are used to bridge kinetic and transport models without the need for excessive complexity. Our results show that using regression modelling, the microkinetic information at the microscopic level of the catalyst can be successfully linked with the macroscopic electrode models. We observe how mass transport parameters such as CO2 concentration, pH, and applied voltage, interacts with microkinetic information of the catalyst, influencing the reaction pathways and current densities of key products methane, ethylene, ethanol, and hydrogen. Although the model explores the medium to high voltage regimes, the methodology can address the oversimplification of CO2 reduction (CO2RR) kinetics and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for observed multiple kinetic regimes if comprehensive microkinetic models are integrated.

Within this group, phosphazane hybrid NHCs (PHNHCs) species have been proposed as highly versatile and promising species for reactivity and catalytic studies.

This work uses the donor-acceptor natures, steric effects, and conjugation lengths of six benzothiadiazole (BTD) based organic dyes (PC1-PC6) to control their charge transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) states. Thus, effective photosensitization and photoredox characteristics are brought about for photocatalytic applications. Additionally, theoretical research shows that the carbazole-linked-BTD with methyl (PC2 and PC3) demonstrates an effective CT feature in the T1 state. While the LE nature of the methyl-free carbazole-linked-BTD dye (PC1) is excellent. TPA-linked-BTD dyes (PC4-PC5), on the other hand, have good LE properties in the T1 state except for mono-TPA-linked-BTD derivative (PC6).  For S1 state features, though, the tendency was in the reverse direction. In the S1 state, all the compounds (PC1-PC4) exhibit outstanding HLCT capabilities except the methylated BTD dyes that contain triphenylamine donors (PC5-PC6). The letter compounds possess CT nature in the S1 state. Overall, the donor\u2019s strength and steric effect of the methyl group were found to tune the nature of S1 and T1 states of these photocatalysts with both photosensitization and photoredox qualities.

In this paper, first, we analyze the surface structure of transition metal oxycarbides (TMOCs), i.e., Mo2COx and W2COx. Further, taking the HDO of n-butyric acid to n-butane with hydrogen as an example, we rationalize the differences in HDO performances of TMOCs as compared to TMCs (Mo2C and W2C) using density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics, and microkinetic modelling. It is found that the O* domains on the surface of TMOCs enhance the HDO activity by easing the dissociation of the C-O bond and promoting the hydrogenation reactions, as compared to pure TMCs. Furthermore, microkinetic modelling analysis shows that Mo2COx is a more active and selective catalyst for alkane production compared to Mo2C, W2C, and W2COx.

Its conversion to 5-methylfurfural (5-MF), a versatile synthetic intermediate and perfuming agent, is particularly challenging, the selective hydrodeoxygenation of the C\u2013OH group in HMF being by far less favourable kinetically and thermodynamically than the hydrogenation of the C=O group that gives 2,5-bis-hydroxymethylfuran (BHMF). Herein, for the first time we showed that Ni/TiO2 catalysts can be tuned to promote the selective removal of a hydroxy group in the presence of an aldehyde moiety, and give high 5-MF yield. Among various synthesis approaches, the direct ion exchange incorporation of Ni into a TiO2 network prepared by an alginate synthesis route allowed the key-factors orientating the reaction selectivity towards 5-MF to be identified. The highest 5-MF selectivity (86%) at nearly full conversion was favoured by high acidity and ultra-high dispersion of Ni atoms at the surface, while the prime role of titania was discussed. By contrast, increasing the reduction temperature up to 700\u00b0C strongly lowered the acidity and formed larger Ni particles, which favour the C=O activation, and is thereby promoting the selectivity switch towards BHMF at 86% also at nearly full conversion.", "date": "2024-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The resulting performance of these MOF-based solid-state electrolytes was significantly enhanced, with a methoxy-functionalized framework (UiO-66-L1-100) achieving high ionic conductivities of 2.32 \u00d7 10^-4 S/cm and 2.07 \u00d7 10^-3 S/cm at 30 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C, respectively, a magnitude greater than other all-solid-state MOF electrolyte systems. The electrolyte stability was evaluated with LiIn|LPSCl|MOF:LiTFSI|LPSCl|LiIn symmetric cells, showing excellent Li plating/stripping processes for over 2 months.", "date": "2024-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The exo-chair isomer is found to be more stable by 1.83 kcal/mol, with an energy barrier of 3.65 kcal/mol separating the two using the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ method. Despite small geometric differences, significant changes in the shape, dipole moments (0.0156 Debye for the exo-chair and 0.0426 Debye for the exo-boat) and NMR chemical shifts at the flag carbon (C5), the boat tip carbon (C10) and the hydrogens bonding with them. The B3PW91/cc-pVTZ method produces more accurate carbon NMR chemical shifts than the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ method, RMSD (C) =1.48 ppm and 3.21 ppm, respectively, whereas the reverse holds for the proton-NMR chemical shifts, RMSD (H) =0.33 ppm and 0.31 ppm, in agreement with early studies. The NMR trajectories during the chair and boat transition reveal the most significant changes at the transition state (TS). In addition, the carbon atoms engaging larger strain (eg junction carbons and the flag carbon) exhibit apparent deshielding. Excess orbital energy spectrum (EOES) analysis further identifies key inner valence orbital changes during isomerization, indicating the role of bonding interactions in stabilizing the exo-chair isomer.

This study investigates the impact of adsorption of closed-shell (e.g. N2, CO, CO2) and open-shell paramagnetic (e.g. O2, NO, NO2) molecules on the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of zig-zag graphene nanoribbons using density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green\u2019s function (NEGF-DFT) methods. We found that closed-shell molecules physisorbed on graphene nanoribbons, while open-shell molecules chemisorbed strongly at the edges. This chemisorption disrupts the symmetric spin distribution, leading to spin-polarized transmission. The underlying mechanism for spin-polarized transmission in open-shell molecule adsorbed cases is quantum interference between the localized states of the molecule and the delocalized states of the graphene nanoribbons. The bond current, the current between a pair of two atoms, analysis shows that physisorbed closed-shell molecules act as a scattering center, which reduces the current through graphene nanoribbons. We showed that the interaction of open-shell molecules with the graphene nanoribbons depends on the electronic properties of adsorbed molecules. Thus a variation in destructive quantum interference pattern is observed for different open-shell molecules resulting in different spin current.

These magnets, made from rare earth elements (REEs) such as neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), and dysprosium (Dy), are essential for various high-tech applications, including electric motors for e-mobility, wind turbines, electronics, and air conditioners. However, their production is heavily reliant on REEs\u2014classified as critical raw materials in the EU due to limited geographic availability and supply risks. Over 60% of global REE production occurs in China, which also controls 91% of REEs refinement and 94% of the permanent magnet market. Given Europe\u2019s lack of internal REEs production and refining capabilities, this dependency on Chinese imports poses a supply risk. To address this problem, Europe must establish alternative REE sources, either by exploiting local mines or implementing recycling. Projections indicate that by 2050, recycling could potentially meet up to 75% of Europe\u2019s REE demand. However, current recycling efforts are limited, with less than 1% of REEs being recovered. This study aims to investigate a recycling method capable of recovering REEs, particularly from NdFeB magnets embedded within electric motors from e-mobility. The focus centers on a mechanical pretreatment approach that combines shredding with physical separation techniques, such as magnetic separation. The primary objective is to isolate a NdFeB-enriched fraction\u2014a material stream containing a substantially higher concentration of NdFeB magnets than the original motor composition. An industrial-scale trial was conducted on electric motors that were initially thermally demagnetized. This demagnetization step is crucial to mitigate issues related to magnet agglomeration during subsequent mechanical processing. The demagnetized motors were then shredded and processed via magnetic separation within an industrial facility. The separated fractions were subjected to laboratory pretreatment, involving sample homogenization, sieving, and magnetic attraction, to concentrate the NdFeB content. The samples were analyzed through MP-AES to quantify the REE content, including Nd, Pr, Ce, Dy, and Gd. This data provided insights into the enrichment of NdFeB magnets in the treated fraction. A material flow analysis (MFA) was conducted to assess the distribution of magnets throughout the process. The MFA revealed that 71.3% of magnets entering the treatment facility were retained in the ferrous fraction, while 28.3% were found in the non-ferrous fraction. The ferromagnetic properties of the NdFeB magnets facilitated their attraction to the magnetic separator, enhancing the concentration of magnets in the ferrous fraction. A significant increase was observed in the magnet concentration in the non-ferrous fraction after additional magnetic separation, with the concentration rising from 9.47% in the initial non-ferrous fraction to 50.8% in the final attracted fraction. The findings of the study provided key information for the future design of an optimized mechanical pretreatment process that could achieve both a higher concentration of NdFeB magnets and an improved process yield.

Circuit components, including diodes, transistors, and power sources, have been fabricated with soft materials that utilize ionic current instead of metals and electronic current. However, the fabrication of these iontronic components can be tedious, and widely applicable manufacturing methods are lacking, thus hindering the development of complex iontronic circuits for real-world applications. While 3D printing has recently gained popularity due to its versatility, we suggest that it has been underutilized for iontronics. By combining multi-material 3D printing and iontronics, we show the ability to rapidly iterate ionic diode design and integrate these diodes within a complex structure with advanced mechanical behavior. With an updated 3D model design, we create a new stretchable diode that is insensitive to strain, a feature that can be crucial for applications requiring soft electronics. To further emphasize the adaptability of printing soft materials, we demonstrate that three components of the based ink (conductive polymers, a thickening agent, and a crosslinker) can be used to optimize print quality and the resulting material properties. In doing so, we thoroughly characterize a mixed ionic-electronic conducing ink using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) that can provide a foundation for the further development of extrusion printed iontronics.

Waste streams containing NdFeB magnets, such as household appliances, industrial motors, electric vehicle (EV) motors, and consumer electronics, are typically processed using traditional recycling techniques. These methods often involve shredding the material and applying separation techniques like magnetic and eddy current separation, which are designed to recover materials such as copper, iron, aluminum, plastic, and precious metals. However, they do not effectively recover REEs. Studies have shown that the ferrous fraction from typical recycling facilities for ferrous waste contains a REEs concentration which is too low to be economically viable for REE recovery. This creates a pressing need of designing recycling processes able to valorize the REEs fraction. A critical step in these processes is the demagnetization of NdFeB magnets, without which their efficient separation from the waste stream would not be feasible. Demagnetization is necessary when processing waste through mechanical shredding and separation to prevent the strong magnetism of NdFeB magnets from causing operational issues. Issues such as the formation of \u201cmeatballs\u201d (clusters of magnetic material) and magnets sticking to ferromagnetic parts of machinery are common when magnets remain magnetized. Moreover, demagnetization facilitates the separation of magnets from non-ferromagnetic fractions in the waste stream. Demagnetization can be achieved using different techniques. One approach is hydrogen decrepitation, where hydrogen is absorbed by the NdFeB magnet, leading to brittle hydride formation that breaks down the magnet into a fine powder, which simultaneously induces demagnetization. Alternatively, thermal treatment can be used to raise the temperature of the magnets above their Curie temperature, at which point they lose their magnetic properties. This study focused on the thermal demagnetization of NdFeB magnets contained within electric motors. Using an experimental design approach, we developed demagnetization curves that correlate the degree of demagnetization with key parameters such as temperature and treatment duration. The study also examined potential differences in demagnetization behavior when magnets were treated as part of an assembled motor versus individually. NdFeB magnets were subjected to varying temperatures and time intervals to generate these demagnetization curves, providing insights into the behavior of both individual magnets and those integrated within motor assemblies. Notably, it was observed that the average degree of demagnetization achieved varied depending on whether magnets were treated within the rotor or individually. This suggests that the assembly within the rotor affects the demagnetization response, resulting in a slower demagnetization process. The experimental design (DOE) method enabled the development of a predictive model that estimates the degree of demagnetization based on time and temperature parameters. Results indicated that the coefficient for temperature (T) in the model consistently exerted a stronger influence on demagnetization than the coefficient for time (t), suggesting that temperature has a greater impact on demagnetization process.

CAMD often generates and evaluates molecular structures using genetic algorithms. However, genetic algorithms can suffer from slow convergence, and might yield suboptimal solutions. In response to these challenges, this work presents a method to fine-tune a genetic algorithm for CAMD. The proposed method builds on the COSMO-CAMD framework that utilizes a genetic algorithm for solving optimization-based molecular design problems and COSMO-RS for predicting physical properties of molecules. The key idea of the proposed method is to integrate results from a fast large-scale molecular screening into the molecular design framework, thereby enabling targeted initialization of the genetic algorithm, referred to as warm-start. The proposed method is applied in two case studies to design solvents for extracting gamma-valerolactone and phenol, respectively, from aqueous solutions. Compared to the benchmark method, the warm-started COSMO-CAMD framework reduces computing time by up to 70%, discovers fourfold more top performing candidate molecules, and identifies seven tailored molecular fragments, culminating in the discovery of two novel solvents specifically for the phenol case. The optimal solvent is found in all computational runs.

However, the effect of different matrices and PFAS types on combustion efficiency has not been systematically evaluated, such as varying chain lengths and head groups, different combustion times, and different types of matrices. Comparison of PFAS with chain lengths of C4 to C12 using equal fluorine equivalents of 5.27 nmol (100 ng) demonstrated no significant differences in the CIC responses, indicating uniform combustion.  Further, no significant differences in signal were observed between combustion times ranging from 7.5 to 15 min. However, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) exhibited losses due to volatility, which could be mitigated using activated carbon, improving intensities by 200-1400%. Variations in matrix exhibited no observable changes in PFAS combustion efficiency for all chain lengths in water, blood, and biosolid matrix. To validate further, CIC was applied in the analysis of real blood and biosolid samples to compare the total fluorine concentrations observed with the concentrations determined by LC-MS/MS.

In GCMC simulations, interatomic interactions are typically described using force fields, but no single existing force field can fully capture the diverse chemical environments present in MOFs. Refining force field parameters using density functional theory (DFT) provides a more accurate, ab initio-level description of interatomic interactions. In this study, we evaluate the predictive power of the widely used Universal Force Field (UFF) by comparing its predictions with experimental isotherms for four representative adsorbates, H2, CO2, C2H4, and C2H6, across 379 isotherms from 142 MOFs. The results show that UFF consistently overestimates gas uptake in GCMC simulations. To provide a customized force field for each MOF, we present a practical scheme for fitting force field parameters to DFT-calculated energies for a large set of MOFs. The refined force field successfully reproduces the DFT-calculated interaction energy, effectively correcting UFF\u2019s overestimation of interatomic repulsion. However, because UFF overestimates gas uptake, and the refined force field reduces repulsion further, this refinement amplifies the overestimation.

The recent improvement and availability of high-resolution mass\nspectrometry in combination with liquid chromatography have widely expanded the potential of\nanalytical workflows for their detection and quantitation in water. Given their high polarity, the\ndetection of some PMOC requires alternative techniques to reversed-phase chromatography,\nsuch as hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and supercritical fluid\nchromatography (SFC). Unified chromatography (UC), an SFC gradient in which the state of the\nmobile phase changes continuously from supercritical to liquid at 100% polar co-solvent, has\nshown potential for the analysis of very polar compounds.\nResults: In the present study, for the first time, a UC-HILIC method coupled with high-\nresolution mass spectrometry was set up for PMOC analysis in water. SFC and HILIC gradients\nwere run sequentially on the same bare-silica column, with the first separation running to 100%\nmodifier (UC) followed by a HILIC gradient transitioning to water. The UC and UC-HILIC\ngradients were previously optimized on a mix of 18 representative PMOC to assess solvent and\nmobile phase composition and for the instrumental system setup. The final method was\nemployed for the analysis of water samples in comparison with a traditional reversed-phase\nseparation, resulting in a significant increase in the number of annotated polar PMOC, including\ncompounds listed in the Candidate List of substances of very high concern for Authorisation by\nthe European Chemicals Agency.\nSignificance: The proposed approach represents a robust alternative to traditional methods for\nbroadening the chemical space of separation and mass spectrometric detection. The introduction\nof the HILIC section of the gradient was necessary for the elution of strongly retained\n\ncompounds on the silica phase, thus also reducing the amount of compounds that would be stuck\nonto the phase of the column, resulting in possible irreproducibility, pressure increase, and loss\nof efficiency in the compound separation.", "date": "2024-11-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science; High-throughput Screening", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, because the transition dipole matrix elements must be calculated between two excited states (i.e. the valence excited state and the final core-excited state arising from the initial valence excited state) of very different energies, this can be challenging and time-consuming to compute. Herein using two molecules, protonated formaldimine and cyclobutanone, we assess the ability of n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2), equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory (EOM-CCSD), linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) and the maximum overlap method (MOM) to describe excited state X-ray spectra. Our study focuses in particular on the behaviour of these methods away from the Franck-Condon geometry and in the vicinity of important topological features of excited-state potential energy surfaces, namely conical intersections. We demonstrate that the primary feature of excited state X-ray spectra is associated with the core electron filling the hole created by the initial valence excitation, a process that all the methods can capture. Higher-energy states are generally weaker and more sensitive to the nature of the reference electronic wavefunction. As molecular structures evolve away from the Franck-Condon geometry, changes in the spectral shape closely follow the underlying valence excitation, highlighting the importance of accurately describing the initial valence excitation to simulate the excited state X-ray absorption spectra.

Particularly, acid dissociation constants (pKa) are an essential asset in biological, synthetic or industrial chemistry whose prediction encounters several difficulties, requiring the development of novel strategies. The self-assembly of polyoxometalates (POMs) is another complex problem where acid-base reactions play a central role; a successful prediction of the formation constants of these structures is intimately linked with the limitations of pKa determination. Our methodology POMSimulator enables the prediction of these polyoxometalates formation constants from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, using the experimental Kf values available in the literature to fit the resulting predictions. In this work, we carry out a systematic analysis of a very large number of POM formation constants already predicted through the application of POMSimulator. We then propose an universal scaling scheme for the adjustment of the DFT-based formation constants of POMs, relying on a linear scaling of the form y = mx + b. Here, the slope (m) is a constant parameter - hence, universal towards the nature of the polyoxometalate and the calculation method. The intercept (b), in contrast, is a system-dependent parameter that can be predicted with a multi-linear regression model trained with statistical aggregates of the non-scaled formation constants.

While it is com- mon to incorporate information from the atomic coordinates of these complexes into docking (e.g. pharmacophore models or scaffold hopping), there are limited methods to directly leverage the underlying density information. This is desirable because it does not rely on the determination of relevant coordinates, which may require expert intervention, but instead interprets all density as indicative of regions to which a ligand may be bound. To do so, we have developed CryoXKit, a tool to incorporate ex- perimental densities from either cryo-EM or x-ray crystallogra- phy as a biasing potential on heavy atoms during docking. Using this structural density guidance with AutoDock-GPU, we found significant improvements in re-docking and cross-docking, im- portant pose prediction tasks, compared with the unmodified AutoDock4 force field. Failures in cross-docking tasks are addi- tionally reflective of changes in positioning of pharmacophores in the site, suggesting it is a fundamental limitation of trans- ferring information between complexes. We additionally found, against a set of targets selected from the LIT-PCBA dataset, that rescoring of these improved poses leads to better discriminatory power in virtual screenings for selected targets.

This process is based on an unusual, cooling-induced transition in polymer self-assembly from spherical to worm-like micelles, for which the PheOzi units are decisive. Here, we investigate this phenomenon further by introducing new variants of amphiphilic pPheOzi-based copolymers to explore the variability of the system. Changing the arrangement of the MeOx and PheOzi constitutional repeat units enables to investigate the influence of the polymer architecture on the thermogelation. We found that a triblock architecture is superior to diblock, gradient and star-like polymer architectures in terms of efficient order-order transition-based thermogelation. In addition, a coupling procedure based on copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition is presented that allows for a direct comparison of pMeOx and PEG as hydrophilic blocks in pPheOzi-based triblocks. Interestingly, PEG hydrophilic blocks also enable rapid worm-formation and show faster gelation as well as increased gel strength.

Several authors have reported problems due to the sand production in wells that includes: premature waste of equipment, a considerable increase in the number of workover operations, and the availability of rigs to attend the demand of workover operations. In this context, this paper presents a study focused on the numerical simulation of fluid dynamics inside a downhole desander device cyclonic separator considering 32 parameters modifications. The proposed designs varieties are the following: change in five geometrical parameters; one boundary condition and two-fluid properties. These changes will allow the application of fractional factorial design with two levels to evaluate the effect of these parameters (inner pipe external diameter, inner inflow tubing diameter, number of helical channels, helical channel slops, vortex finder length, volumetric flow rate, viscosity, and density) over tangential velocity and pressure drop. To achieve this goal, a three-dimensional, single-phase, and isothermal model was implemented in a commercial CFD code. Laminar and turbulent regimes were considered. According to the results, it was verified that for the five geometrical factors analyzed the inner pipe external diameter, the number of helical channels and the vortex finder length have the biggest impact on the tangential velocity presenting an increase of 7.95 m/s, which represents an increase from 60 m^3/d to 116 m^3/d in the volumetric flow rate capacity. On the other hand, the inner pipe external diameter, the flow rate and the number of helical channels are the parameters that most influences the pressure drop, among the results, an increase from 2 3/8'' to 3 1/2'' in the inner pipe external diameter yields a reduction of 0.5 MPa.

Schnell", "abstract": "Modern proteins are composed exclusively of L-amino acids but the origin of L-stereospecificity is unresolved. Carbonaceous meteorites were a significant source of organic matter on early Earth and commonly contain ten proteogenic amino acids in racemic mixtures. In conditions relevant to early Earth hydrothermal vents, surface-catalyzed peptide syntheses of these proteogenic mixtures show modest reaction rates and no significant stereoselectivity. However, we show that the presence of cysteine significantly increases peptide synthesis yields in the presence of silicate surfaces, with synthetic yields displaying a strong stereoselective bias towards L-cysteine. In a hydrothermal vent solvent model, L-cysteine doubles the increase in peptide synthetic yields compared to D-cysteine, as indicated by UV absorption, NMR, and mass spectrometry. Solid state NMR confirms that cysteine associates with silicates at alkaline pH via both carboxylate and sulfur groups. This adsorption results in a stereospecific orientation of the reactive amino group for surface-adsorbed bivalently charged amino acids detectable by Polarization-Resolved IRRAS. This stereospecific amino group reorientation provides a novel mechanism for abiotic peptide synthesis favoring L-amino acids on achiral surfaces, which is applicable to any bivalently charged amino acid at alkaline pH. Our findings here, that cysteine is incorporated stereoselectively in surface-catalyzed peptide synthesis, combined with the metal-binding capability of abiotically synthesized cysteine-bearing peptides, emphasizes the potential benefits of amino acids with sulfur functional groups to fundamental processes in early life and the potential usefulness of such amino acids as biosignatures.", "date": "2024-11-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While there have been studies showing that infiltration of trimethyl-alumina (TMA) in polymers can be used to grow Al2O3 there are still many atomic level details of the SIS process that require more investigation, including the origin of the differences in infiltration of TMA into different polymers. In this paper, we investigated in detail the Infiltration of Al2O3 into poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) experimentally and theoretically. SIS was performed in a standard ALD reactor, operating at 70\u00b0C in quasi-static mode, using TMA and water as the metal and oxygen precursors, respectively. Operando spectroscopic ellipsometry and ex-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) evidenced that Al2O3 incorporation in PLA is significantly higher than in PMMA even if, in both cases, TMA incorporation occurs through the formation of an Al-O covalent bond at the C-O-C group. The extent of swelling of the polymers upon TMA infiltration is assessed and is clearly larger for TMA in PLA than in PMMA. First principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations highlighted that both polymers display swelling upon TMA infiltration, saturating with increasing TMA, consistent with operando ellipsometry observations. The DFT results also show the origin of the larger swelling in PLA compared to TMA. Changes in vibrational modes of carbonyl backbone groups in the polymers are used to demonstrate TMA-polymer interactions from both experiment and simulation. The differences in TMA infiltration and swelling arises from differences in the TMA-polymer C-O-C group interaction, which is more exothermic in PLA than in PMMA, in agreement with experimental results.

Hydroxyl terminated polyethylene and an inexpensive commercially available polymeric carbosilazane precursor were used as organic and inorganic ceramic precursor blocks, respectively.

The Au@SiCN is active in oxidation of higher alkenes in the presence of air/O2 as an oxidant. More interestingly, Au@SiCN is highly selective in the cyclicalkenes over linear alkenes. This selectivity accounts for the activation of molecular oxygen due to surface plasmon resonance effect of Au (111) plane of nanoparticles followed by the epoxidation cycloalkenes.

Nucleic acid nanotechnology has demonstrated a variety of self-assembling nanotubes with programmable, robust features, and morphological similarities to actual cytoskeleton components. However their production typically requires thermal annealing that is not only incompatible with physiological conditions but also hinders the possibility for continuous growth and dynamic self-organization. Here we report DNA nanotubes that self-assemble from a simple mixture of five short DNA strands at constant room temperature, with remarkable capability to sustainably grow over prolonged time. The assembly, done in a monovalent salt buffer (here, 100 mM NaCl), ensures that the nanoscale features of the nanotubes are preserved under these isothermal conditions, enabling continuous growth up to 20 days and the formation of individual nanotubes with near flawless arrangement, a diameter of 22 \u00b1 4 nm, and length of several tens of micrometers. We demonstrate the crucial role of the monovalent cation to achieve such properties. We finally encapsulate the strands in micro-sized compartments, such as water-in-oil microdroplets and giant unilamellar vesicles serving as simple cell models. Notably, nanotubes not only isothermally grow in these conditions, but also self-organize into dynamic higher-order structures, such as rings and dynamic networks, demonstrating that cytoskeleton-like properties can emerge from a combination of sustained growth and confinement.

However, this usually requires expensive multireference calculations. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for rapidly identifying and quantifying open- shell character in PBHs using the fractional occupation number weighted electron density metric (NFOD) calculated with the semiempir- ical xTB method. We apply this approach to the entire chemical space of PBHs containing up to 10 rings, a total of over 19k molecules. Our findings reveal a strong correlation be- tween xTB-calculated NFOD and the more com- putationally expensive Yamaguchi y and DFT- calculated NFOD, validating the use of this effi- cient method for large-scale screening. Addi- tionally, we identify a linear relationship be- tween size and NFOD value and implement a size-dependent threshold for open-shell charac- ter, which significantly improves the accuracy of diradical identification across the chemical space of PBHs. This size-aware approach re- duces false positive identifications from 6.97% to 0.38% compared to using a single thresh- old value.

However, characterizing urban CH\u2084 emissions remains challenging due to the diversity and spatial distribution of sources. Furthermore, limited synthesis and integration of the literature has led to a poor understanding of the characteristics and contributions of different sources, with implications for policies and mitigation. This review consolidates findings from 103 peer-reviewed articles on CH\u2084 emissions from cities in the U.S. and Canada, highlighting key research priorities. We find that top-down (TD) estimates of total city-level CH\u2084 emissions exceed bottom-up (BU) inventory estimates by a factor of 0.7 to 4.9 in 34 studies. In city-level studies that disambiguated emissions by source, natural gas distribution and use, and landfills, dominated urban CH\u2084 footprints. The mean natural gas loss rate in cities of 1.8% \u00b1 0.9% suggests a broader natural gas supply chain loss rate of 4.0% \u00b1 0.9%. Notably, TD estimates of CH\u2084 emissions from six select U.S. landfills were, on average, 2.6 (\u00b1 1.8) times greater than self-reported estimates, suggesting that preferred calculation methods for reporting may systematically underestimate emissions and miss fugitive point sources. A limited number of studies examined mitigation but indicate that measurement is essential to identify mitigation opportunities and verify reductions. We raise questions and highlight challenges around existing BU inventories, urban natural gas loss rates, combustion slip, landfill emissions estimation techniques, and mitigation effectiveness. We conclude with recommendations on research priorities to address key knowledge gaps: (i) new source-level measurement datasets and modeling approaches for BU emissions estimation; (ii) more granular investigations to understand the specific sources and causes of CH4 emissions from urban natural gas infrastructure and end use; (iii) a better coupling between measurement and modeling of landfill CH4 emissions; (iv) mitigation-focused studies.", "date": "2024-11-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

All these optimizations sharply decreased the background-triggered amplification. Employing the most favourable buffer condition of 2.5 mM MgCl2 where the target-initiated amplification was least affected while reducing the background-triggered process enabled us to achieve a detection range of 14 nM-140 aM with an approximate limit of detection of 680 aM, which is six orders of magnitude more sensitive than using our standard amplification conditions.

To fill this gap, we assembled a large novel dataset of 2606 molecules with three kinds of features: mass spectra (MS), vibrational spectra (VS) and molecular fingerprint features (FP). We evaluated their performance using four different multi-label classification models. The second objective is to address an inherent challenge in odor classification multi-label datasets (MLD)\u2014the issue of class imbalance by random resampling techniques and an explainable, cost-sensitive multilayer perceptron model (CSMLP). Experimental results suggest significantly better performance of the molecular fingerprint-based features compared with mass and vibrational spectra with the micro-averaged F1 evaluation metric. The proposed resampling techniques and cost-sensitive model outperform the results of previous studies. We also report the predictive performance of multimodal features obtained by fusing the three mentioned features. This comprehensive and systematic study compares the predictive performance for odor classification of different features and utilises a multifaceted approach to deal with data imbalance.

Herein, the natural urban eutrophic lake (UEL) water with slight eutrophication was employed to elucidate the discrepancies in Xn-DBPs formation between autochthonous and allochthonous DOM based on the ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. The increased operational taxonomic units, microbial cell density and relative abundance of genus Microcystis in the collected samples indicated the slight algal bloom of the lake.

The number and its proportion of nitrogenous Xn-DBPs in chlorinated UEL water samples were significantly larger (p\u2009<\u20090.05) than those for chlorinated SRNOM. Microbes dominated by Microcystis contributed largely to releasing autochthonous DOM due to the microbial cell lysis and microbe-derived Xn-DBPs species upon disinfection. The Xn-DBPs species mainly derived from microorganisms were highly saturated, reduced, bioavailable, nitrogenous, and toxic but lowly oxidized and aromatic than terrestrially derived Xn-DBPs species.

The BRD4 protein plays an important role in gene regulation and cell functioning, and its malfunction can lead to Neuroblastoma. On the other hand, the E3 protein acts as a cancer suppressor and can inhibit BRD4 protein activity. To destroy the BRD4 protein, the E3 protein should come into proximity to each other. We hypothesize that the aptamers used in this study will bind strongly at the interface between the BRD4 and E3 ligase protein.  This is facilitated by a chemical compound known as PROTAC, which binds to both the BRD4 and E3 proteins, bringing them close together to form a BRD4-PROTAC-E3 complex. In the current work, we have used molecular docking to understand the BRD4-PROTAC-E3 interactions, and based on this knowledge, we have designed novel 30 PROTACs and computed their pharmaceutical properties and based on our analysis Aptamer II formed strong interactions with both the proteins.

The diagnosis of AMI relies on a combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests detecting elevated levels of cardiac disease protein biomarkers indicative of heart muscle injury. Nevertheless, these techniques usually necessitate skilled personnel and pose a significant economic strain. Among these biomarkers, Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) has been identified as specific to AMI. Recently, DNA-based aptamers that specifically bind to TNF-\u03b1 have been developed to detect cardiac diseases. We hypothesize that the high specificity of these aptamers towards the TNF-\u03b1 protein is due to a specific binding site present on the surface of this soluble protein. Consequently, the TNF-\u03b1-aptamer interactions have been investigated by molecular docking simulations. First, the aptamer 3D structures were modeled and docked onto the TNF-\u03b1 protein. By comparing the TNF-\u03b1 binding site using machine learning and electrostatic surface potential analysis, the docking results were further verified. Based on these findings, novel aptamers were rationally designed by making chemical mutations and were subsequently docked onto the TNF-\u03b1 protein. Among these mutate aptamers M4 binds strongly to the protein and can potentially aid in developing TNF-\u03b1 biomarkers. The current investigation work will facilitate the development of rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic tools for the early detection and monitoring of cardiac diseases using aptamers.", "date": "2024-11-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While many model LMFs have been proposed and evaluated over the past 10-20 years, their systematic construction has been hampered by a lack of exact physical constraints on their valence behavior. Here we exploit a data-driven approach and train a new type of \"n-LMF\" as a relatively shallow neural network. The input features of this n-LMF are of meta-GGA character, while the W4-17 atomization-energy and BH76 reaction-barrier test sets have been used for training. Simply replacing the widely used \"t-LMF\" of the LH20t functional by the n-LMF provides the LH24n-B95 functional. Augmented by DFT-D4 dispersion corrections, LH24n-B95-D4 remarkably improves the WTMAD-2 value for the large GMTKN55 test suite of general main-group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions (NCIs) from 4.55 kcal/mol to 3.49 kcal/mol. As we found the limited flexibility of the B95c correlation functional to disfavor much further improvement on NCIs, we proceeded to replace it by an optimized B97c-type power-series expansion. This gives the LH24n functional. LH24n-D4 gives a WTMAD-2 value of 3.10 kcal/mol, the so far lowest value of a rung 4 functional in self-consistent calculations. The new functionals perform moderately well for organometallic transition-metal energetics while leaving room for further data-driven improvements in that area. Compared to complete neural-network functionals like DM21, the present more tailored approach to train just the LMF in a flexible but well-defined human-designed LH functional retains the possibility of graphical LMF analyses to gain deeper understanding. We find that both the present n-LMF and the recent x-LMF suppress the so-called gauge problem of local hybrids without adding a calibration function as required for other LMFs like the t-LMF. LMF plots show that this can be traced back to large LMF values in the small-density region between the interacting atoms in NCIs for n- and x-LMFs and low values for the t-LMF. We also find that the trained n-LMF has relatively large values in covalent bonds without deteriorating binding energies. The current approach enables fast and efficient routine self-consistent calculations using n-LMFs in Turbomole.

This study investigates the self-assembly of a multi-structured rod-coil diblock copolymer consisting of poly(L-proline) and polystyrene (PS) segments. The unique feature of these diblock copolymers is that the secondary structure of polyproline (PLP) blocks can independently be tuned into two distinct conformations (PPI and PPII). Furthermore, a high energy barrier (81 KJ/mole) associated with the conformational transition between PPI and PPII structures makes it attractive to study the influence of the secondary structure on self-assembly under thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, the self-assembly of this block copolymer was investigated in terms of the molecular weight and composition of the individual blocks and their secondary structures. A pair of diblock copolymers (PSm-b-PLPn) with differing polyproline block lengths have been synthesized. It has been found that irrespective of the length of the PLP block studied here, the diblock copolymer with trans-polyproline (PPII) self-assembled and microphase separated into a lamellar morphology.

These enzymes are activated by the presence of GTPase activating protein (or GAP) that forms an intimate complex with residues of the two proteins present in the active site. We have explored the multidimensional reactional free energy landscape in the active site of the complex formed by RhoA and p50RhoGAP. Our Molecular Dynamics simulations show that the activating enzyme p50RhoGAP establishes catalytically important interactions with the phosphate groups of GTP through its so-called arginine finger (Arg85) and also with RhoA residue Gln63. This is a key residue because it does not only interact with the nucleophilic water molecule but also participates actively in the reaction mechanism. Adaptive String Method simulations using hybrid QM/MM potentials with both Tight-Binding and Density Functional hamiltonians show that GTP hydrolysis proceeds through formation of a metaphosphate metastable species. Mechanistic proposals differ in the proton transfer rearrangements required to form the inorganic phosphate ion. Our simulations discard a solvent assisted mechanism and point to the participation of Gln63 in the proton transfer process by means of the side chain tautomerism from the amide to the imide form. The proton transfer required to recover the amide form of Gln63 requires the participation of the inorganic phosphate and it is the rate-limiting step of the process, with a free energy barrier of 20.2 kcal mol-1 at the B3LYPD3/MM level, in good agreement with the experimentally derived value. The amide-imide tautomerism could be relevant also in other enzymes, facilitating proton transfer events in complex mechanisms.

This record high reactivity results from the combination of the increased flow velocity and light exposure by the flow reactor along with the weaker interplanar bonding and high surface area of GCN made from urea. Attempting to further enhance this reactivity by exfoliation had an adverse effect. Eliminating the mixing patterns from the flow reactor also resulted in a drastic decrease in catalyst reactivity because of particles deposition on the reactor window.

Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the syndiotactic peptide does not form stable dimers with high \u03b1-helicity in solution, unlike the isotactic peptide. However, both peptides do coacervate with RNA, albeit with distinct reentrant phase behaviors. Coacervation in each case is facilitated by oligomer formation, likely dimerization, upon RNA binding that promotes RNA cross-linking.

We attribute differences in reentrant phase behavior to differences in dimer flexibility and stability that alter the effectiveness of RNA cross-linking.

Herein we demonstrate how a flexible molecular design approach enables access to a diverse library of photophysical properties, which can be further diversified by social self-sorting strategies using a second supramolecular building block as a modulator. By intercalation into the supramolecular polymer the modulator can disrupt interchromophore interactions and modulate the ensembles emissive properties across the visible color space by simply adjusting the ratio between the two building blocks.

However, few studies have investigated the dynamic metabolic effects from a single large bolus of enteral cholecalciferol to rapidly restore vitamin D status in critically ill children. Herein, we performed a retrospective analysis of serum samples collected from the VITdALIZE-KIDS pilot study, a phase-II randomized placebo-controlled trial, to elucidate treatment response variations following the intake of 10,000 IU/kg vitamin D3 (up to a maximum of 400,000 IU or 10 mg) by critically ill children with VDD (25-OH-D < 50 nmol/L). Comprehensive vitamin D metabolite and lipidomic studies were performed by reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, whereas serum metabolomics and a targeted electrolyte panel were acquired by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis with indirect UV detection, respectively. Overall, 6 vitamin D species, 239 lipids, 68 metabolites and 4 electrolytes were measured in most serum samples (> 70%) with adequate precision (CV < 40%) from pooled quality control samples using a multi-step data workflow for molecular feature selection and metabolite authentication. Complementary statistical methods were used to classify circulating metabolites/lipids associated with treatment induced vitamin D sufficiency on day 7 (25-OH-D > 75 nmol/L) following high-dose vitamin D3 intake (n=20) or placebo (n=11) who received a daily maintenance of vitamin D3 (< 1000 IU/day). There was a striking increase in median serum concentrations of 25-OH-D3 (4.7-fold, p = 2.39 x 10-8), 3-epi-25-OH-D3 (24-fold, p = 8.27 x 10-10) and their C3-epimer ratio (6.7-fold, p = 6.22 x 10-5) in treated patients on day 3, whereas serum vitamin D3 levels peaked on day 1 (128-fold, p = 9.11 x 10-8) relative to the standard-of-care. Treatment response differences were largely attributed to differences in oral D3 bioavailability and C3-epimerase activity, but not 25-hydroxylation activity nor baseline calcium or magnesium status. Also, two treated participants were identified as poor responders likely due to malabsorption, and there was no evidence of hypercalcemia in this study.  For the first time, we report the detection of circulating 3-epi-D3 that was strongly correlated with vitamin D3 uptake (r = 0.898, p = 3.27 x 10-53), however, its C3-epimer ratio did not change when compared to the daily maintenance therapy as placebo. The systemic metabolic effects of vitamin D sufficiency (serum 25-OH-D > 75 nmol/L on days 2 or 3) corresponded to lower circulating levels of 3-methylhistidine, cystine, S-methylcysteine, uric acid, and two lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC 20:0; LPC 20:2) measured after 7 days with covariate adjustments (p < 0.05; age, sex, weight, and season) relative to vitamin D insufficient patients (serum 25-OH-D < 75 nmol/L). The former three polar metabolites were also significant after adjusting for baseline 25-OH-D status. Overall, serum cystine trajectories were the most sensitive indicator of vitamin D repletion after the first week. Rapid correction of VDD was associated with a metabolic phenotype associated with lower oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle protein turn-over that may impart clinical benefits.

We then use NMR and optical spectroscopies to demonstrate that the installation of thiol ligands improves colloidal stability, while exposure to carboxylic acids does not. Finally, facilitated by this enhanced synthetic control, we show that our ultra-small AZTS NCs can act as effective, less-toxic sensitizers for red-to-blue triplet fusion upconversion.

Spatially resolved photoluminescence is a powerful experimental characterization tool to quantify optical and electronic coupling between nanowires in an array. However, three underlying mechanisms of incident photon scattering, photon recycling, and charge-carrier diffusion dictate this coupling. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of light absorption and emission of a single nanowire at open circuit, and subsequent re-absorption and re-emission by a neighboring nanowire. We developed a novel correlated single nanowire micro-spectroscopy and widefield imaging methodology to spatially resolve photon communication pathways between neighboring nanowires and selectively image re-emitted and reflected photons. Unique multiphysics models have been developed to couple wave optics and semiconductor photophysics to especially isolate contributions from photon recycling and electronic transport to photon emission from neighboring nanowires. By systematically varying the morphologies of the nanowires modeled, we identify pathways to maximize photon recycling between neighboring nanowires. We conclude that the measured photoluminescence is more strongly influenced by the diffusion of charge-carriers as compared to photon recycling in materials with moderate-to-large charge-carrier mobilities (> 10 cm2 V-1 s-1), and that photon recycling dictates photoluminescence intensity only when the charge-carrier mobility is low (< 1 cm2 V-1 s-1).

In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in their study, often by using complex coacervates as models. Despite their similar properties, a limitation of complex coacervates is their inability to show time-dependent behavior such as aging, as they are typically structures in thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we present a simple protocol to trigger delayed formation and aging in coacervates. We use ammonium carbonate for this protocol, a volatile salt which decreases the ionic strength of the solution as it decomposes. Using this salt, we have been able to program coacervate formation after delays ranging from hours to days. This process can be repeated multiple times, as the decomposition of ammonium carbonate leaves no waste-products. The mechanical properties of the coacervate phase also change over time with this protocol, showing a steady increase in viscosity reminiscent of aging in condensates. Since the element that causes temporal evolution is the salt and not the coacervates, this protocol does not require any synthesis and can be easily adapted to multiple complex coacervates.", "date": "2024-11-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Polyelectrolytes - Polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Filling this critical need, we provide a computationally efficient and scalable version of the Gaussian puff model with a thresholding algorithm that is two orders of magnitude faster than a naive implementation and only requires readily available meteorological data. Our comparison shows that the Gaussian puff model is higher fidelity and able to capture temporal variation in atmospheric transport better than the commonly used Gaussian plume model.

This study examines the retarding impact of five strong acids (HCl, HNO3, HClO4, H2SO4, and H3PO4) on CAC hydration (1) in dilute suspensions at a water-to-solid (w/s) ratio of 100, and (2) in pastes at a w/s of 0.3. Doing so, we identified several factors that affect the dissolution and hydration of CAC. In dilute suspensions, in-situ monitoring of the pH and conductivity reveals that the acids delay the initial dissolution of monocalcium aluminate (CA). The inhibition time depends exponentially on the proton concentration, and linearly on the available CA surface area, which is partially explained by the preferential formation of Al(OH)3 suggested by thermodynamic modeling. Notably, the acids\u2019 efficiency varies at equimolar proton dosages. For H3PO4, we explain the outstanding inhibition efficiency by the joint formation of hydroxylapatite and Al(OH)3. For the other acids, the dissolution inhibition power follows an anion-specific sequence sulfate > chloride > nitrate > perchlorate, which aligns with the Hofmeister series and suggests a stabilization of calcium ion solvation by the anion. Isothermal calorimetry experiments performed on pastes show that the retardation order of these acids (H3PO4 > HClO4 > HNO3 > H2SO4 > HCl) differs from that observed at w/s of 100. Phosphoric acid still displays exceptional retardation properties suggesting a unique mechanism of action most likely related to early hydroxylapatite and Al(OH)3 formation.

However, a challenge in replicating the activity of clusters remains their instability outside of the protein scaffold. Previous efforts to mitigate this challenge include incorporation into polymeric and aerogel networks and artificial metalloenzymes or installation of bulky, strong-field ligands, but none of these retain both the native weak-field primary ligand sphere and capacity for molecular-level tuning of the cofactor and second coordination sphere. Herein, we present a new strategy for stabilizing weak-field synthetic clusters and conferring second coordination sphere functionality via encapsulation inside molecular cages.

Combined, these results demonstrate that molecular cages can function as protein-like encapsulants to site isolate, tune, and deliver substrate to functional weak-field models of bioinorganic cofactors, and support the use of molecular host-guest complexes as functional enzyme mimics for both catalytic and structure-function studies.

In this study, we synthesized and evaluated novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors derived from the clinical candidate quisinostat. A library of 16 compounds categorized in three novel chemotypes was rapidly generated using multicomponent reactions (MCRs), enabling efficient structure-activity relationship studies. The compounds were evaluated for their activity against Plasmodium falciparum, the main malaria parasite, and solid cancer cell lines. The antiplasmodial activity was assessed against P. falciparum strains 3D7 and Dd2, identifying compound 18b of the type C series as the most potent. It demonstrated low nanomolar IC50 values (IC50 (3D7) = 0.023 \u00b5M; IC50 (Dd2) = 0.047 \u00b5M) and high parasite selectivity (SIMRC-5/Pf3D7 > 2174). Docking studies suggested distinct binding modes of 18b with P. falciparum and human HDAC1. The in vitro anticancer activity was also evaluated in the Cal27 and HepG2 cell lines and compounds 9b, 9d, and 13f showed potent antiproliferative activity. Compound 9d significantly induced caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis and caused hyperacetylation of histone H3 and \u03b1-tubulin, indicating robust cellular target engagement. Overall, in this work we have identified several promising HDAC inhibitors with antimalarial and anticancer activities, providing valuable leads for further drug development efforts aimed at creating derivatives with reduced cytotoxicity compared to quisinostat.", "date": "2024-11-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, we present a novel computational protocol to efficiently explore the potential energy surface and identify reaction pathways, by combining an adaptive learning global optimization procedure and neural networks for predicting transition states. For a given reaction, the global optimizer is first used to obtain putative low-lying minima in the basins of reactants and products. In the second step, generative adversarial networks (GAN) are used to estimate the transition states that connect any two initial and final states of a given reaction.

This combination allows the quantum circuit to be initialized after a period of evolution, thereby eliminating the accumulation of errors.

Our protocol focuses on the selection of appropriate coordinates for the relevant degrees of freedom and the identification of specific mode-coupling terms for the potential energy surface that require more thorough treatment. This includes applying different levels of electronic structure theory and selecting a restricted set of higher mode-coupling terms (> mode pairs). We validate this protocol on two spectral regions: the fundamental C=O stretching vibrations in uracil and the fundamental OH stretchings in catechol. Our findings indicate that the convergence behaviour towards harmonic frequencies in the so-called FALCON algorithm is an effective indicator for the locality character of the relevant degrees of freedom. We find that the C=O stretchings in uracil are better described using normal coordinates, while the description with local FALCON coordinates of the OH stretching vibrations in catechol showed superior performances in VCC spectra calculations.

We obtain a charge-transfer diradical structure where a water molecule rearranges spontaneously to form an H-bond interaction with the excited flavin, while the FA\u2019s carboxylate group twists and migrates away from it. Together, these structural modifications provide the driving force necessary for the fET to proceed in a downhill direction. Moreover, by examining the R451K mutant where the FA substrate is farther from the flavin core, we show that the marked reduction of the electronic coupling is counterbalanced by an increased driving force, resulting in a fET lifetime similar to the WT, thereby suggesting a resilience of the process to this mutation. Finally, through QM/MM molecular dynamic simulations we reveal that, following fET, the decarboxylation of the FA radical occurs within tens of ps, overcoming an energy barrier of ~0.1 eV.

Szary", "abstract": "The physicochemical properties of Mo-bearing transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers are critical to their catalytic potential. However, these properties are generally viewed as similar across monolayers, which limits their versatility and potential for synergy in processes such as the reduction reactions of carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR). This work investigates the role of chalcogen vacancies in modulating the physicochemistry of MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 through density-functional-theory (DFT) computations, focusing on the adsorption of CO, NO, and NO2. Our findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart unique physicochemical characteristics to each material. These effects stem from intrinsic bonding differences within each TMD, resulting in distinct charge availability around exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy size, which shape specific surface interactions. Chalcogen vacancies play a more significant role in defining the unique properties of MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 than the chalcogen atoms themselves. While interaction energy differences between pristine monolayers are minimal (under 0.1 eV), vacancies amplify them to over 1 eV, representing an order-of-magnitude increase. Additionally, varying vacancy sizes among the monolayers influence how species incorporate into vacancies and interact with Mo atoms, further enhancing the differences. This variability unlocks substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings underscore the potential of Mo-bearing TMDs to achieve unique catalytic performance through defect engineering, providing valuable insights for tailoring these materials toward specialized applications in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis.", "date": "2024-11-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Moreover, significant greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ammonia) and nutrient emissions (phosphorus and nitrogen species) result from the improper management of manure waste, leading to the simultaneous degradation of valuable air, soil, and water resources. In this work, we present a techno-economic analysis (TEA) framework to investigate the viability of an integrated process that aims to recover nutrients from dairy manure. A central tenet of the proposed process (which we call ReNuAl) is that it uses cyanobacteria (CB) as a key integrative component that simultaneously: (i) harnesses renewable energy (solar energy via photosynthesis) to capture waste nutrients and (ii) captures carbon dioxide that results the anaerobic digestion of waste. Moreover, because biogas can be obtained via anaerobic digestion and CB biomass can be used as a concentrated biofertilizer, ReNuAl provides a pathway to a more circular fertilizer economy that helps manage air and water pollution. Our TEA framework is used to evaluate the phosphorus recovery costs and capital/operating expenses under varying levels of process integration.

Prescreening refers to the study of small volumes of SAF at the early stages of product development for the purpose of assessing the compatibility of the SAF candidate with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D4054 evaluation procedure for new aviation turbine fuels. The basis of the prescreening process relies on the availability of numerical models that can predict the fit-for-purpose properties of the ASTM evaluation procedure without the volumes of the SAF candidate needed to perform all the necessary measurements being available.\nIn this work, such models are developed that predict two important fit-for-purpose ASTM D4054 properties, the temperature dependent liquid density and temperature dependent surface tension of complex hydrocarbons mixtures. The basis of the method is the determination of atom type compositions by a 1H 13C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methodology. \nThe dependence of each of, temperature dependent liquid density, and temperature dependent surface tension, on the range of atom types that comprise typical aviation fuel hydrocarbons is learned by the multiple linear regression modelling to a database of pure component and pure component mixture data gathered from the literature. A data base of 1,241 entries is gathered for density, and a data base of 1,260 entries gathered for surface. Each database is divided in an 80:20 ratio for model training and model testing. Extensive iterations of model training and testing objectively identify the same seven atom types as being most influential to each property. The collection of seven atom types, in addition to a temperature dependent term, is shown to be sufficient to determine each property quite precisely.\nThe models are then applied to the atom type compositions of two fossil-derived aviation fuels, four synthetic aviation fuels, and four reference gasoline fuels, as determined by 1H 13C HSQC NMR. The methodology shows high performance, predicting the unseen liquid density of these real fuels within an absolute error range of 0.00 \u2013 5.59%, and surface tension within an absolute error range of 0.29 - 4.41%.

A total of 8216 ligands were docked on the amyloid protein, and the best five ligands based on the binding interactions were selected for further evaluation. These results were further validated using a machine-learning technique called P2Rank. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations in the protein-fibril complex were performed to understand the interactions between amyloid peptide/fibril and the plasma membrane.

AlphaFold 3 was used to predict the structure of the receptor, and molecular docking simulations using HDOCK2.4 were performed. The GrASP web server suggests that the druggable/binding site on the receptor is on domain 2, and the antibody also binds to this spot.

Its ferrimagnetism is thought to derive from the natural partitioning of magnetic ions to the central perovskite layer, engendered by chemically-driven lattice strains, together with ferromagnetic coupling via superexchange mechanisms. Motivated by the expectation of an enhancement in magnetization with increased magnetic ion content, this study examines systematic B-site substitutions with the aim of increasing (from the current level of 40%) the proportion of magnetic ions within the structure. The solubility limits of magnetic cations in this structure and their influence on the superlattice layering are investigated.

It is postulated that increasing the number of perovskite layers by forming the m = 6 structure facilitates the accommodation of additional magnetic cations at a lower average manganese oxidation state (+3.3) compared with an equivalent m = 5 stoichiometry (+4.0). While the minor out-of-plane ferroelectric response decreases as expected with increasing structural reorganization towards the m = 6 phase, the predominant in-plane piezoresponse remains unaffected by magnetic cation substitution.

However, due the weak interactions between the prochiral organic radical species and the enantiopure metal catalyst, achieving asymmetric MHAT remains challenging. Herein, we report our efforts to repurpose cytochrome P450 enzymes to catalyze asymmetric MHAT, a new-to-nature reaction. Directed evolution of the well-studied P450BM3 (CYP102A1) enzyme led to the identification of a triple mutant that catalyzes asymmetric MHAT radical cyclization of unactivated alkenes to afford diverse cyclic compounds, including pyrrolidines, in up to a 97:3 enantiomeric ratio under aerobic whole cell conditions. Mechanistic investigations support an MHAT mechanism proceeding via homolytic cleavage of a fleeting iron(III)hydride species.

However, silicon-based FETs face significant challenges when further scaled, inspiring the search for better semiconductors.

High mobility (812 cm2V\u22121S\u22121) 2D Bi2SeO2 stands out in this regard, as it can be oxidized into different forms of Bi2SeO5, thereby forming compatible high-\u03ba native oxides.

This study uses Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the intrinsic properties of Bi2SeO2 and its native oxides. Additionally, Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy is employed to complement these theoretical analyses, providing detailed insights into the atomic scale structure and interfaces of these materials. Building on these findings, we model semiconductor-oxide heterostructures and extract their intrinsic properties. Our results demonstrate that the atomically sharp and clean interface between oxide and semiconductor, the high dielectric constant (>30) of the oxide, and the sufficiently large band offsets between the semiconductor and the most relevant beta-phase of its native insulator (1.13 eV for holes and 1.55 eV for electrons) make this material system a strong candidate for future transistor technologies.

Despite their potential for creating smart responsive surfaces, a detailed microscopic understanding of the uptake behavior in dependence of various parameters remains elusive. In this study, we employ coarse-grained, particle-based simulations to investigate how charge regulation under varying environmental conditions modulate the uptake and release of pH-responsive ampholytes, serving as a toy model for proteins, into weak polyelectrolyte brushes. For quenched brushes with constant ionization, the uptake of ampholytes remains strong across different isoelectric points. In contrast, for weak brushes, the ampholyte uptake becomes selectively sensitive to different isoelectric points and pKA-values and exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with changing pH. Enhanced proton partitioning into the brush lowers the local pH, significantly shifting the ionization states of both the brush (pKAapp  > pKA) and ampholytes (pIapp > pI), such that the concurrent ionization of the brush and the ampholyte results in an optimum uptake strength for pKAapp < pH < pIapp. Adjusting the salt concentration broadens the uptake window and shifts the maximum uptake to higher pH values. Additionally, ampholytes with higher charge regulation capacitance near the isoelectric point demonstrate stronger adsorption, extending selective adsorption capabilities in ampholyte mixtures with similar isoelectric points.", "date": "2024-11-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While identifying the precise causative factors remains challenging, the interfacial electric field (IEF) and partial solvation are the two widely proposed factors, accounting for the acceleration or turning on many reactions in microdroplets. In sharp contrast, this combined computational and experimental study demonstrates that these two critical factors have negligible effect on promoting a model Diels-Alder (DA) reaction between cyclopentadiene and acrylonitrile in water microdroplets. Instead, the acceleration of the DA reaction appears to be driven by the effect of confinement and the concentration increase caused by evaporation. Quantum chemical calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations coupled with enhanced sampling techniques predict that the air-water interface exhibits a higher free-energy barrier of this reaction than the bulk, while external electric fields marginally reduce the barrier. Remarkably, the catalytic capability of the IEF at the water microdroplet surface is largely hampered by its fluctuating character. Mass spectrometric assessment of the microdroplet reaction corroborate these findings, suggesting that the DA reaction is not facilitated by the IEF as increasing the spray potential suppresses the DA products by promoting substrate oxidation. While the DA reaction exhibits a surface preference in water microdroplets, the same reaction tends to occur mainly within the core of the acetonitrile microdroplet, suggesting the partial solvation is not necessarily a critical factor for accelerating this reaction in microdroplets. Moreover, experiments indicate that the rapid evaporation of microdroplets and the subsequent reagent enrichment within the accessible confined volume of microdroplets caused the observed acceleration of the DA reaction in water microdroplets.

This work does not make that assumption.  The purpose of this paper is to explore a model of the chemical bond which does not assume that the orbitals of the bonding pair can be unambiguously identified with either of the bonding atoms when their orbitals overlap to bond.  To provide maximum flexibility in the definition of the bonding orbitals, the orbitals have been represented as spatial arrays and the calculations performed numerically.  This model of the chemical bond assumes that the identifiability of the bonding orbitals is a function of 1-(overlap/(1+overlap)) where the overlap of the two bonding orbitals is calculated in the usual manner.  The kinetic energy of the bonding electron pair and the energy required to meet the orthogonality requirements, mandated by the Pauli principle, are a function of overlap/(1+overlap).  The model assumes that the bonding orbitals are straight-forward atomic orbitals or hybrids of these atomic orbitals.  The results obtained by applying this simple approach to eleven di-atomics and seven common poly-atomics are quite good.  The calculated bond lengths are generally within 0.005\u00c5 of the measured values and bond energies to within a few percent.

Relaxation profiles are routinely acquired using field-cycling relaxometers operating at a maximum field of the order of 1 T. These measurements however suffer from a lack of resolution.

Ionic diodes, leveraging ions as charge carriers, offer selective control over ion flux, mimicking ion-selective behavior observed in biological systems. Conventional ionic diodes containing fluids encounter challenges in adapting to biological systems due to their limited stretchability and stability. Recent advancements in solid-state ionic diodes based on stretchable gels enable tissue-like stretchability while maintaining the rectification performance. However, their relatively low rectification ratio hinders their electrical performance, necessitating effective strategies to enhance the rectification effect of stretchable ionic diodes. Here, we propose a method to enhance the rectification effect of hydrogel-based stretchable ionic diodes by incorporating high-valence cations into the P-type hydrogel layer. Through neutralization reactions, cations with valences of 1, 2, and 3 were introduced to replace original hydrogen ions in the hydrogel, resulting in a substantial increase in the rectification ratio from 3 to over 70, with an elevated rectification ratio (140) under 100% strain. The enhanced rectification effect enables applications in iontronics, such as ionic rectifiers and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), highlighting the potential of improving the electrical performance of iontronics through the manipulation of different ion properties.

Herein, by the combination of radical ring-opening polymerization (rROP) and polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) under appropriate experimental conditions, we report the successful preparation of high solid contents, degradable polymer prodrug nanoparticles, exhibiting multiple drug moieties covalently linked to a degradable vinyl copolymer backbone. Such rROPISA process relied on a chain extension of a biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol)-based solvophilic block with a mixture of lauryl methacrylate (LMA), cyclic ketene acetal (CKA) and drug-bearing methacrylic esters by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization at 20 wt % solids content. This novel approach was exemplified with two different CKA monomers and two different anticancer drugs, namely paclitaxel and gemcitabine, to demonstrate its versatility. After transferring to water, remarkably stable aqueous suspensions of core-degradable polymer prodrug nanoparticles of 56-225 nm in diameter with tunable amounts of CKA units (7-26 mol.%) and drug loadings up to 33 wt % were obtained. Incorporation of ester groups in the copolymers was demonstrated by hydrolytic degradation of both the copolymers and the nanoparticles under accelerated conditions. The nanoparticles showed significant cytotoxicity on A549 cells, used as a lung cancer model. Fluorescence labeling of the solvophilic block also enabled effective monitoring of their cell internalization by confocal microscopy, with the potential for theranostic applications.", "date": "2024-11-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Drug delivery systems; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The gas-liquid interface is widely implicated for the emergence of these chemical anomalies. Experiments conducted on individual microdroplets provide a unique platform for studying interfacial effects while bypassing transport limitations often encountered in macroscopic systems. We investigate such interfacial effects by analyzing the suppression of the I- + O3 surface reaction by the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 in an array of levitated microdroplets. Using a novel kinetic framework describing surface and bulk reactivity, we find that increasing surfactant concentration shifts the locus of reaction from the top-most nanometer of the interface to a subsurface region located < 2 nm below the surface. This detailed picture of spatial reactivity is afforded only by considering the timescales for O3 adsorption and solvation combined with reaction monitoring in single microdroplets. Chemical uniqueness is further illustrated by the I- + O3 rate dependence on [Triton X-100], which is quantitatively understood by considering finite size effects in microdroplets. Both size and surface effects are considered to derive an analytical expression for reactive uptake of O3 which demonstrates the role of competitive adsorption of Triton-X and I- at the gas-liquid interface.

However, the majority of studies have focused on well-defined ligand binding pockets in small proteins, while computing SBFE of a small molecule ligand to a large, flexible binding site remains problematic. Numerous proteins with large flexible binding pockets play an important role in biological processes and are of pharmaceutical importance. Therefore, the calculation of the ligand SBFE with such proteins is an important challenge. In this work, we developed a hierarchical approach to compute SBFE of a flexible multi-conformational system as an ensemble average of individual local SBFEs to specific conformational states of the protein-ligand complex. This approach allows us to simulate a truncated portion of a large protein, which brings an intractable system within the reach of modern computational tools. Our approach also accounts for the differences in conformational preferences between a ligand-bound and an apo states of the protein. The approach is validated using the T4 lysozyme mutant in complex with a small molecule inhibitor. Binding energies of a non-competitive antagonist (GYKI) with the GluA2 glutamate receptor of AMPA type (AMPAR) are computed for several poses of GYKI in the binding pocket to help facilitate structure validation at relatively low resolution.

Chilunda; Sarvarjon A. Talipov; Elizabeth J. Biddinger", "abstract": "Hydrogen (H2) has been proposed as a way to store energy for long durations with minimal carbon footprint. The challenges of using H2 to store energy are that it has very low volumetric density and diffuses rapidly through container walls. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) have been proposed as a method of storing hydrogen in the molecular backbone of stable organic chemicals, addressing many of the concerns of molecular hydrogen. The majority of LOHC systems proposed have utilized thermochemical cycling for the hydrogenation (to store hydrogen) and dehydrogenation (to release hydrogen). Thermochemical cycling requires heating of the reactors, which results in an increased carbon footprint, and is not easily amenable to dynamic operating with the variable renewable electricity grid. Electrochemical LOHC cycling has been proposed as an alternative to thermochemical cycling because it can pair directly with the variable renewable grid and operate more dynamically. To understand the viability of the thermochemical and electrochemical processes, a comparative carbon footprint analysis is necessary. The analysis showed that the electrochemical LOHC cycling process achieves the lowest carbon footprint when using highly concentrated LOHCs as the feed or when a downstream separation process was not needed. The carbon footprint in electrochemical cycling of diluted LOHC was primarily contributed to by the LOHC distillation separation process. A sensitivity analysis showed the carbon footprint LOHC concentration dependence during the electrochemical cycling process. Moreover, the electrolyte composition significantly affects the carbon footprint during electrochemical LOHC cycling. Decisions regarding use of thermochemical versus electrochemical cycling need to include separation system boundaries, not just the reactors themselves.", "date": "2024-11-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Electrocatalysis; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We report herein that this is possible to significantly enhance the stability of supramolecular copolymers by a minimal change in the chemical nature of one of the interacting monomers.

Introduction of unnatural cofactors opens the door to new reactive enzymatic intermediates, and in turn, the possibility for new biochemical reactions. In the present study, we employed a de novo biosynthesized, non-natural cofactor, cobalt protoporphyrin IX,1 to generate a mono-nuclear cobalt hydride intermediate in the active site of a common P450 scaffold. We show that this cobalt hydride intermediate engages in metal-hydrogen atom transfer (M-HAT) reactivity, a well-studied and highly utilized reactivity pattern in synthetic chemistry,2 but which is not known to operate in nature. Because the required cofactor is fully biosynthesized and incorporated into proteins in vivo, the catalysts are highly amendable to directed evolution. We leveraged the ability to quickly access these new artificial metalloenzymes with a colorimetric screen and evolved new variants for M-HAT-mediated deallylation of phenols. We showed how common silanes have a propensity to hydrolysis that can be overcome with directed evolution by accelerating metal-hydride formation from a bulky, water stable silane. During this evolution, we discovered that variants were catalyzing HAT to the colorimetric probe itself, resulting in a unique reductive dearomatization reaction. This radical process occurs efficiently under aerobic conditions and reactions of this type have not been observed previously. These discoveries demonstrate how the tunability of biocatalytic systems can enable innovations in synthetic chemistry. We anticipate that further engineering and study of M-HAT biocatalysts will prompt new questions about hydrogen atom transfer reactivity and enable the adoption of biocatalysts for numerous synthetically useful transformations.

Neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution reveals specific ion pairing signatures between TMA and acetate, with simulations providing a detailed interpretation of the ion pairing structures. Force fields, notably CHARMM36 with the electronic continuum correction (ECC) (by a factor of 0.85) and AMBER99SB, capture essential pairing characteristics, but only revPBE-based ab initio MD simulations accurately model specific experimental features such as the low Q peak intensity in reciprocal space. Our study delivers a refined molecular model of TMA\u2013carboxylate interactions, guiding the selection of force fields for complex biological systems where such interactions are of a significant importance.", "date": "2024-11-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated that OA substantially influences the distribution of LDHs throughout PVC matrix.

Many data-driven materials design campaigns target solutions within constrained domains such as synthesizability, stability, solubility, recyclability, and toxicity. Lack of knowledge about these constraints can hinder design efficiency by producing samples that fail to meet required thresholds. Acquiring this knowledge during the design campaign is inefficient, and effective classification of common materials constraints transcends specific design objectives. However, there is no consensus on the most data-efficient algorithm for classifying whether a material satisfies a constraint. To address this gap, we comprehensively compare the performance of 100 strategies designed to classify chemical and materials behavior. Performance is assessed across 31 classification tasks sourced from the literature in chemical and materials science. From these results, we recommend best practices for building data-efficient classifiers, showing the neural network- and random forest-based active learning algorithms are most efficient across tasks. We also show that classification task complexity can be quantified based on task metafeatures, most notably the noise-to-signal ratio.

Here, we report preparation of fluorescent polymeric nanomaterials with high aspect ratio \u2013 nanorods, and study their cellular uptake for bioimaging applications. Fluorescent polymeric nanorods are prepared by scission of electrospun nanofibers using ultrasonication. To achieve high brightness, they are loaded with cationic fluorescent dyes (rhodamine or cyanines) with bulky hydrophobic counterions that prevent aggregation-caused quenching. The obtained nanorods of 400 nm diameter and 2-4 \u00b5m length show good fluorescence quantum yields (40% at 5% dye loading) and 800-fold higher brightness compared to 60-nm polymeric nanoparticles. Cellular studies reveal several remarkable features of nanorods vs NPs. First, nanorods internalization depends on the cell type, which was not the case of NPs. Second, we found that internalization of nanorods is nearly 100-fold more efficient than that of polymeric NPs, reaching ~3 wt% of the cell mass. The internalization of nanorods is an active process (endocytosis), which is inhibited by low temperature, absence of growth medium or nanorods treatment by a non-ionic surfactant. Despite this efficient internalization, nanorods exhibit negligible cytotoxicity according to three different types of assays. Due to high accumulation inside the cells, the labelled cells present ~100-fold higher fluorescence signal vs NPs, which remains for at least 6 days. This exceptional cell brightness enables single-cell tracking in two near-infrared spectral regions under the chicken skin.

Evidence is presented for the fluoride entering the catalytic cyclic through a metathesis reaction with TMS\u2013SPh to form metal thiolate intermediates, e.g. [{(ArNCMe)2CH}MF(SPh)], that are then competent nucleophiles for addition to the aromatic substrate, likely through a cSNAr mechanism.

To address this issue, we treat the local discontinuities that arise as noise within the Gaussian progress regression framework and learn the surfaces by explicitly incorporating and optimizing a whitenoise kernel. The characteristic polynomial coefficient surfaces of the potential matrix, which are smooth functions of nuclear coordinates even at conical intersections, are learned in place of the adiabatic energies and are used to optimize the DFT/MRCI(2) minimum energy conical intersection geometries for representative intersection motifs in the molecules ethylene, butadiene, and fulvene.

The oxidation of AP produces 4-quinoneimine, inducing electrochemical-electrochemical (EE) redox cycling. Operating in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) ensures a low anodic background current within a potential range where AP (formal potential = 0.07 V vs Ag/AgCl) undergoes oxidation.

Here, we propose a general theory-driven procedure for selecting thermally stable radical-type mechanophore which can be used in self-strengthening materials. First, following our previous work, it is confirmed that a conformational motif called \u201cnode\u201d along the force transduction direction enhances the force effect by generating a severe distortion on the breaking covalent bond. Molecules possessing bridged rings are ideal candidates to have a \u201cnode\u201d, as the bridged structure helps to fix the key dihedral angle. Our computational exploration then focused on camphanediol and pinanediol, which do not have highly strained ring or intrinsically weak covalent bond, but a node ensured by a small dihedral angle. Our simulations predicted that polymer chains including these molecular skeletons easily undergo a C\u2212C bond homolysis under relatively low tensile force and efficiently generate mechanoradicals. Subsequently, our automated reaction path exploration calculations unveiled the fate of the mechanoradicals by enumerating their possible reaction channels, and suggested that camphanediol can generate long-lived radicals, which can be utilized to develop self-strengthening materials. Therefore, we prepared double-network (DN) hydrogels containing camphanediol moiety and found that these novel DN hydrogels do have a good self-strengthening performance.

Hence, there is a need for the discovery of newer antituberculosis drugs. One of the important and emerging areas of discovering new drugs is by hindering the energy metabolism generator pathway like oxidative phosphorylation (OP) which helps the sustainability of both the replicating and dormant forms of the bacterium in the host. The drugs including Telacebec (Q203) and Bedaquiline target the OP pathway enzymes cytochrome bc1 complex and ATP synthase. However, the tuberculosis bacterium survives even after the inhibition of these enzymes due to the compensatory energy production by Mycobacterium tuberculosis-cytochrome bd oxidase enzyme leading to drug resistance. Additionally, this enzyme helps the survival of the organism in aerobic conditions and in the presence of stress factors including hypoxia conditions, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Hence, cytochrome bd oxidase is a promising target for the discovery of novel antitubercular lead candidates. Our work employed computational techniques to design and identify novel imidazopyridines that inhibit cytochrome bd oxidase for developing antitubercular drugs. SwissSimilarity screened structurally similar compounds from the ZINC database and resulted in 989 compounds containing different rings. However, we excluded all the non-bicyclic analogues and this resulted in a library of 824 drug-like candidates as most of the bicyclic compounds showed promising inhibitory action. Further, we considered the versatile nature of amine functionality in terms of synthetic feasibility and improving the antitubercular potency and selected 262 amine-modified derivatives of imidazopyridine (1 to 262). These 262 compounds along with three reported cytochrome bd oxidase inhibitors including amiloride derivative (1a), 2-(Quinolin-4-yloxy)acetamide (2a), and 2-Arylquinolone (3a) were docked against cytochrome bd oxidase (PDB ID: 7NKZ, 2.5 \u00c5).

These results suggest that the imidazopyridine derivative 255 is a promising lead compound based on its docking score and favorable binding properties indicating strong potential for further development as an anti-TB agent.

To this end, we assess the predictive capability of Loewdin charges for three chemical systems.

In single-cell capillary electrophoresis (CE) electrospray ionization (ESI) MS, electrophoresis-correlative (Eco) ion sorting practically orders ions into narrow mass-to-charge-dependent trends. Despite pioneering targeted and discovery single-cell MS proteomics, practically nothing is known about how close separation of similar m/z values (Eco-sorting) may affect the fidelity of quantification in CE-MS proteomics. This study is dedicated to bridging this gap in our basic knowledge for the sake of accurate proteome quantification, at a time when CE-MS is emerging into the public domain. Leveraging the mouse\u2013yeast two-proteome model, as validated in nanoLC, we systematically characterize the fidelity of quantification in CE-MS. By employing the strategies of both MS2 and MS3 on the same mass spectrometer, we gain valuable insights to interferences within and between the approaches.

Considering +2 charge state, the driver of protein identifications in this study,  we find ratio compression to be severe in MS2 in CE-MS (~66.5% interference free index, IFI), but statistically significantly less than in nanoLC (~63.5% IFI). Simultaneous precursor selection MS3 effectively remedied these interferences in CE-MS (~87.0% IFI), statistically indifferently than nanoLC.

The presence of a rotator phase leads to unique properties that influence processing methods and offer potential applications in areas such as thermal energy storage, lubrication, and sensing. Recently, a novel family of chemically recyclable oligomers, (1,n\u2019-divinyl)oligocyclobutane (DVOCB($n$)), has shown evidence of rotator phases. This study combines experimental characterization and molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the presence of and elucidate rotator phases in DVOCB($n$), with comparison to well-studied n-alkanes. In DVOCB($n$), the crystal-to-rotator phase transition involves a shift from stretched to isotropic hexagonal lamellar packing, captured by a rotational order parameter tracking local chain orientations orthogonal to the chain axis. Furthermore, rotational relaxation times decrease gradually upon heating, including through the transition to a rotator phase. This contrasts with n-alkanes, for which relaxation times are relatively constant and longer in the crystal phase before dropping sharply during the crystal-to-rotator phase transition. Such behavior is attributed to the unique enchained-ring architecture of DVOCB($n$), which allows for semi-independent rotation of chain segments that promotes overall rotational disorder. This work provides a fundamental understanding of rotator phases in DVOCB($n$) and highlights differences from conventional materials.

Specifically, we have collected the first set of high-resolution cryo-EM structures of CpVBPO in four catalytically relevant states including binding to phosphate, orthovanadate, orthovanadate and bromide, and orthovanadate and hydrogen peroxide. The collected structures, resolved at 2.2 to 3.2 \u00c5, reveal deviations from previously reported X-ray diffraction (XRD) structures, particularly in the geometry of the vanadate cofactor and key residue interactions in the active site. Our findings suggest a trigonal planar, metavanadate-like geometry for the vanadate cofactor in the resting state, contradicting the commonly proposed orthovanadate geometry containing an apical hydroxo ligand. Furthermore, the dynamic roles of residues Asp335 and Leu337 in halide specificity in the catalytic cycle are proposed through observed conformational changes upon bromide binding. Using pKa calculations and structural analyses, a mechanism for generating hypobromous acid, mediated by His487, is presented.

Recombinant human IL-6 (hIL-6) is typically expressed in Escherichia coli, resulting in significant formation of inclusion bodies, which presents challenges in solubility and refolding. Furthermore, IL-6 exhibits a strong propensity for aggregation, reducing the overall yield of biologically active protein after refolding.\nThis study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of IL-6 aggregation and to identify refolding conditions that mitigate this phenomenon. Using a combination of SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, we analyzed the dimerization and aggregation behavior of IL-6 under varying denaturation and refolding conditions.

Conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as acenes, often suffer from poor stability due to photooxidation and oligomerization, which are linked to their frontier molecular orbital energy levels. To address these limitations, we have designed and synthesized a new class of \u03c0-expanded indoloindolizines by merging indole and indolizine moieties into a single polycyclic framework. Guided by the Glidewell-Lloyd rule\u2014which predicts that in fused polycyclic systems, larger rings lose aromaticity in favor of smaller ones\u2014we achieved precise modulation of the electronic structure by controlling the aromaticity of specific rings. Benzannulation at targeted positions allowed fine-tuning of the HOMO-LUMO gap, leading to distinct shifts in optoelectronic properties.

The structural, electronic, and optical properties of these compounds were extensively characterized. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirmed their molecular structure, while theoretical calculations provided insights into the observed experimental trends.

They combine several important properties of hydrogels and elastomers, including elasticity, transparency, and capability to swell in water. Moreover, they also swell in organic solvents. However, their mechanical properties could be improved. We developed a two-level, bio-inspired, hierarchical reinforcement of APCNs using peptide-containing triblock copolymers and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Bio-inspired peptide-polymer hybrids combine the structural hierarchy often found in natural materials with synthetic macromolecules, e.g. having soft and hard segments like in multiblock copolymers, to strengthen the mechanical properties. On the other hand, CNCs provide an additional way to dissipate mechanical energy in polymeric materials and, therefore, for reinforcement. The key to achieving homogeneous incorporation of CNCs into the APCNs is the combination of hydrophobic CNCs (HCNCs) with peptide-modified APCNs, exploiting the hydrogen bonding present in the peptides to disperse the HCNCs. The effect of HCNCs on the ability of APCNs to swell in water and organic solvents and on the thermal and mechanical properties was characterized. Additionally, the nanostructure of the materials was analyzed via small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The CNC-containing APCNs exhibited similar swellability independent of the CNC concentration, and all the samples were highly transparent. The ideal CNC concentration, in terms of maximal stress, strain, toughness, and reinforcement was found to be between 6 and 15 wt%, and an increase of Young\u00b4s modulus by up to 500% and of toughness of up to 200% was achieved. The hierarchical reinforcement also greatly strengthened the APCNs when swollen in water and n-hexane. Thus, CNCs and peptide segments can be used to reinforce APCNs and to tailor their properties.

In previous works, the nature of the dissociative states for indole and indole derivatives were predicted. In this work, the N-H photodissociation dynamics of indole have been studied using nonadiabatic quantum dynamics. First, the important vibrational modes responsible for the photodissociation were detected using vibrational analysis. Potential energy cuts (PECs) along important vibrational modes have been calculated using the complete active space self-consistent field (CASPT2) method with (10,9) active space. The multi-mode multi-state model vibronic Hamiltonian is constructed by the parameters obtained from the fitting of ab initio PECs, including Morse and harmonic functions, and vibronic couplings. Nonadiabatic quantum dynamics is performed using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, considering four electronic states and four vibrational modes. N-H stretching mode, Q42 turns out to be the most important of all modes, showing an anharmonic, dissociative \ud835\uded1-\ud835\uded4* state at the third excited state. The out-of-plane C-N-H bending i.e. mode Q3 is found to facilitate the dissociation process. Additionally, effects of inclusion of Q8 and Q17, which are mixed motion modes with contribution from N-H displacement, were also assessed. Two timescales obtained from the population dynamics, 37 fs and 383 fs, are attributed to internal conversion from the second excited La state to the \ud835\uded1-\ud835\uded4* states and photodissociation at the \ud835\uded1-\ud835\uded4*, respectively, and are in good agreement with timescales obtained from femtosecond time-resolved ionization experiments. After 500 fs of dynamic propagation, around 55% reaction probability for N-H fission in indole is recorded.

Herein, leveraging multi-scale diagnostic techniques, we unraveled the distinct nanoscopic strain evolution in SC-NMC cathodes, challenging the conventional composition-driven strategies and mechanical degradation indicators used for PC-NMC. Through particle-level chemo-mechanical analysis , we reveal a decoupling between mechanical strain and lattice volume change of SC-NMC, identifying that the structural instability in SC-NMC is primarily driven by multiple-dimension lattice distortions induced by kinetics-driven reaction heterogeneity and progressively deactivating chemical phases.

Unlike cobalt\u2019s detrimental role in PC-NMC, we find Co to be critical in enhancing the longevity of SC-NMC cathodes by mitigating localized lattice strain along extended diffusion pathway, whereas Mn exacerbates mechanical degradation.

In an RBFE calculation, the difference between the binding affinities of two ligands to a protein is calculated by transforming one ligand into another, in the protein-ligand complex, and in solvent. Alchemical binding free energy calculations are often used for such ligand transformations. Such calculations are not without challenges, however; for example, it can be challenging to handle interfacial waters when these play a crucial role in mediating protein-ligand binding. In some cases, the exchange of the interfacial waters with solvent water might be very infrequent in the course of typical molecular simulations, and such interfacial waters can be considered trapped on the simulation timescale. In these cases, RBFE calculation between two ligands, where one ligand binds with a trapped water while the other ligand displaces it, can result in inaccuracies if the surrounding water structure is not sampled adequately for both ligands.  So far, a popular choice for treating the trapped waters in RBFE calculations is to combine free energy calculations with enhanced sampling methods that insert/delete waters in the binding site. Despite recent developments in the enhanced sampling methods, they can result in hysteresis in the RBFE estimate, depending on whether the simulations were started with or without the trapped waters.  In this study, we introduce an alternative method, separation of states, to calculate the RBFE between ligand pairs where the ligands bind to the protein with different numbers/positions of trapped waters. The separation of states approach treats the sampling of the trapped waters separately from the free energy calculation of the ligand transformation. In our method, a trapped water in protein's binding site is decoupled from the system first, and the cavity created by its decoupling is stabilized. We then grow a larger ligand into this cavity-- a ligand that is known to displace the trapped water. In this study, we show that our method results in precise and accurate estimates of RBFEs for ligand pairs involving the rearrangement of trapped water via RBFE calculations for five such ligand pairs. We have optimized our simulation protocol to be suited for large distributed computational resources and have automated our RBFE calculation workflow.

These techniques provide surface chemical depth profiling (from 2 nm to several hundred nm) and high-resolution elemental imaging of both LPSC and NCM622 particles. This analysis was complemented by galvanostatic cycling, impedance spectroscopy, and operando cell pressure measurements. Several correlations between interphase evolution and cell electrochemical performance are clarified, while some inconsistencies are rationalized and discussed. Firstly, the intrinsic LPSC electrochemical oxidation mechanisms were studied using an LPSC:C65 working electrode. The results showed that increased cell resistance during the first charge stemmed from polysulfide by-products and particle contact loss due to LPSC volume shrinkage at the interface. Secondly, when using an NCM622:LPSC working electrode, species such as sulfites, sulfates and phosphates, were detected on both LPSC and NCM622 particles, while electrochemically inactive reduced transition metals (TMs) were observed only at NCM622 surfaces. These species, initially present at open circuit potential, increased after the first charge, due to the chemical reactions between LPSC and NCM622 surface lattice oxygen. The estimated interphase thickness on the LPSC and NCM622 surface over the cycling remains below \u20533 nm. Our findings highlight that the formation of an electrochemically inactive NCM622 surface is a primary cause of impedance rise during the first charge, along with the formation of LPSC by-products and contact loss.

In this study, we propose LumiNet, a versatile PL interaction modeling framework that bridges the gap between physics-based models and black-box algorithms. LumiNet utilizes subgraph transformer to extract multiscale information from molecular graphs and employs geometric neural networks to integrate PL information, mapping atomic pair structures into key physical parameters of non-bonded interactions in classical force fields, thereby enhancing accurate absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations.  LumiNet is designed to be highly interpretable, offering detailed insights into atomic interactions within protein-ligand complexes, pinpointing relatively important atom pairs or groups. Our semi-supervised learning strategy enables LumiNet to adapt to new targets with fewer data points than other data-driven methods, making it more relevant for real-world drug discovery. Benchmarks show that LumiNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art model by 18.5% on the PDE10A dataset, and rivals the FEP+ method in some tests with a speed improvement of several orders of magnitude.

The latter typically operate under analytical flow (AF; 0.2-1 mL/min) regimes. Hence, AF/ESI-HRMS methods prioritize detection of analytes of higher abundances or ionizability and tend to suffer from matrix effects or ion suppression. A far higher sensitivity can be obtained with electrospray at nanoflow (10- 1000 nL/min) thanks to a better ionization efficiency and significant decrease of matrix effects. Both advantages are crucial to reliably access low-abundant compounds or weakly ionizable analytes. This work presents a microflow (\u03bcF) chromatographic set-up coupled to a novel microfabricated multinozzle electrospray (mnESI) emitter with 5 nozzles spraying at 600 nL/min per nozzle for untargeted HRMS lipidomic profiling. With a runtime of 19 minutes, similar to our established analytical flow (AF/ESI) lipidomics platform, \u03bcF/mnESI produced a 16-fold median increase across 69 deuterated lipid standards. The performance of this new configuration was also evaluated in the context of the profiling of 3D clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) model exposed to a multidrug combination therapy. The processing of the acquired data resulted in 1270 (\u03bcF/mnESI) vs. 752 (AF/ESI) MS2-annotated lipids. Among those, 762 achieved <10% variation on pooled QC samples for \u03bcF/mnESI compared to only 361 for the AF method. In addition, the measurements of ccRCC samples confirmed the improvements in ionization efficiency and adduct patterns observed with standards, enabling to annotate 79 oxidized triglycerides, 38 cholesterol esters (only 5 and 4 detected in AF/ESI, respectively), as well as 12 sitosterol esters, not yet reported in mammalian cell cultures.", "date": "2024-11-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Featuring a dense array of carbo- and heterocyclic rings, and numerous stereochemical challenges, these molecules have inspired many synthetic strategies. In spite of this rich history, the design of approaches that can access multiple family members, in an asymmetric, concise, and atom-economical fashion, remains a significant challenge.

Traditionally, a fixed representation is chosen by expert chemists or applying data-driven feature selection methods on available labelled datasets. However, when dealing with novel optimization tasks, prior knowledge or large datasets are often unavailable, and relying on these even can introduce bias into the search process. In this work, we demonstrate a Feature Adaptive Bayesian Optimization (FABO) framework, which integrates feature selection in the Bayesian optimization process to dynamically adapt material representations throughout the optimization cycles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive approach across several molecular optimization tasks, including the discovery of high-performing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in three distinct tasks, each involving unique property distributions and requiring a distinct representation. Our results show that the adaptive nature of the representation leads to outperforming random search baseline and scenarios where prior knowledge of the feature space is available. Notably, for known optimization tasks, FABO automatically identifies representations that are aligned with human chemical intuition, validating its utility for optimization tasks where such insights are not available in advance.

However, AIMD simulations are time-consuming and resource-intensive, particularly for solvated lanthanide ions, which often form multiple non-rigid geometries with high coordination numbers. To accelerate the characterization of lanthanide structures in solution, we employed the Northwest Potential Energy Surface Search Engine (NWPEsSe), an adaptive-learning global optimization algorithm, to efficiently screen first-shell structures. As case studies, we examine two systems: Eu(NO3)3 dissolved in acetonitrile with a terpyridine ligand (terpyNO2), and Nd(NO3)3 dissolved in acetonitrile. The theoretical spectra for structures identified by NWPEsSe were compared to both experimental and AIMD-derived EXAFS spectra. The NWPEsSe algorithm successfully identified the proper solvation structure for both Eu(NO3)3(terpyNO2) and Nd(NO3)(acetonitrile)3, with the calculated EXAFS signals closely matching the experimental spectra for the Eu-ligand complex and showing good similarity for the Nd salt; the better agreement with the ligand-containing structure is attributed to a less dynamic coordination environment due to the rigid ligand. The key advantage of the global optimization algorithm lies in its ability to sample the coordination environment across the potential energy surface.

Major incidents in academic and industrial settings are commonly used in the form of case studies to suggest lessons and inspire change; however, a truism of safety studies is that major incidents often arise from the same causes as those that previously caused minor events that remained unaddressed. Major events make up only a very small percentage of the events that could, with multiple failures, lead to the adverse outcomes. In this study we examined 258 routine safety incidents reported between 2016 and 2020 at a major petrochemical processing facility site in North America. Restricting the analysis to incidents that included both chemicals and human error reduced the sample to 75 incidents, which were categorized via quantitative content analysis. Findings showed a significant effect of day of the week; most incidents involved mid-operation errors and related to administrative issues. Findings highlight a culture of reporting even superficially minor incidents, which may lead to improved safety implementation policies that could help prevent major incidents from occurring. We propose a crude measure to determine the rigor of a reporting culture: the incident severity reporting threshold index, the ratio between the number of incidents involving injuries and the total number of reported incidents. We strongly suggest that the severity threshold for reporting be lowered so as to address hazards and emergent risks before they have an opportunity to become dangerous.

Herein, we present an ultrasensitive sensing platform for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) detection in tap water with a reporting limit (~250 ppq) lower than the maximum contaminant level (4 ppt) set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, using remote gate field-effect transistor (RGFET) sensors featuring \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD)-modified reduced graphene oxide as the sensing membrane.

Quartz crystal microbalance results emphasize the important roles of both analyte adsorption and charge properties of analytes and buffers in generating sensing signals.

However, establishing catalyst design rules to find optimal electrocatalysts is a substantial challenge. Complex oxides, which are often considered as suitable OER catalysts, can exhibit vastly different conductivity values, making it challenging to separate intrinsic catalytic activities from internal transport limitations. Here, we systematically decouple the limitations arising from electrical bulk resistivity, contact resistances to the catalyst support, and intrinsic OER catalytic properties using a systematic epitaxial thin film model catalyst approach. We investigate the influence of the resistivity of the three perovskite oxides LaNiO3-\u03b4 (3.7x10-4 \u2126cm), La0.67Sr0.33MnO3-\u03b4 (2.7x10-3 \u2126cm) and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-\u03b4, (0.57 \u2126cm) on the observed catalytic activity. We tune the electron pathway through the catalyst bulk by comparing insulating and conductive substrates. The conducting substrate reduces the electron pathway through the catalyst bulk from millimeter to nanometer length scale. As we show, for the large electron pathways, the observed catalytic activity scales with the resistivity because of a highly inhomogeneous lateral current density distribution. At the same time, even on the conducting substrate (Nb-doped SrTiO3), large contact resistances occur that limit the determination of intrinsic catalytic properties. By inserting interfacial dipole layers (in this case LaAlO3) we lifted these interface resistances, allowing us to reveal the intrinsic catalytic properties of all examined catalysts. We find that La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-\u03b4 and LaNiO3-\u03b4 exhibit a similar intrinsic overpotential of 0.36 V at 0.1 mA/cm2, while their resistivities differ by three orders of magnitude.

Big data analytics, coupled with advancements in \u2018omics\u2019 technologies, are revolutionizing the study of industrial cell lines. However, translating this knowledge into practical methods widely utilized in industrial biomanufacturing remains a significant challenge. This study leverages discovery proteomics to characterize dynamic changes within the CHO cell proteome during a 14 day fed-batch bioreactor cultivation. Utilizing a global untargeted proteomics workflow, we identify 3358 proteins, using a ZenoTOF 7600 and a Cyclic IMS QToF. By mapping relative abundances to key cellular processes, eight protein targets were selected as potential biomarkers. To bridge the gap between discovery and industrial applications, we translated these findings into a rapid 15 minute targeted triple quadrupole (MRM) assay. This approach demonstrates the potential of repurposing discovery proteomics for targeted biomarker identification in biotherapeutic production.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful approach to resolve and identify glycan structures. Annotation of glycans in MS data relies heavily on experimental databases or manual calculations, hindering the discovery of novel glycan compositions and structures. Here, we introduce Glyco- Annotate - a package in the open-source programming language R - for de novo annotation of glycan compositions in MS data. GlycoAnnotateR calculates all possible monomer and modification combinations, filtered against a defined set of chemical rules to provide biologically relevant compositions. The \u2018glycoPredict\u2019 function can return compositions for oligosaccharides ranging from 1-22 monomers in length while accounting for four different modifications in under ten minutes with less than 4 Gb of random-access memory (RAM). Three case studies demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of GlycoAnnotateR: (1) Analysis of commercial and synthetic mono- and oligosaccharide standards across multiple MS platforms, revealing accurate annotations of intact molecules, and fragmentation product identification; (2) On-the-fly analysis of LC-MS data guided the design of a targeted LC-MS/MS experiment that identified sulfated fucan oligosaccharides obtained by enzymatic digestion of fucoidan, a complex algal glycan; (3) Re-analysis of a published mouse lung MALDI-MS imaging dataset, reproducing and expanding annotations compared to those from a database, thereby annotating a new distribution pattern of tri-sulfated glycans.

Understanding the driving force of this transition is critical for the applications of TIs in nanodevices. Herein, we investigate the finite-size effects on the bulk band inversion and the structural relaxation effects on the surface states within the Bi2Se3 family via first-principles calculations. Thin films exposing the three lowest-energy surfaces are modeled by 2D slabs with tunable thicknesses. We propose that the thickness dependence of the topological phase originates from electron confinement created by surface cuts. The increase in film thickness then counteracts these confinement effects, resulting in a monotonically decreasing band gap evaluated at the spin\u2212orbit decoupled level. This dependence of the bulk gap on the thickness is found consistent for various surface slabs. We utilize this relationship to predict the required thickness for maintaining the 3D TI phase and 2D surface states. Our findings underscore the importance of electron delocalization in determining the topological phase of TI thin films. In addition, the actual manifestation of topological surface states on the side surfaces is affected significantly by the co-existing dangling bonds produced by surface cuts. Therefore, surface relaxation plays a crucial role in disentangling the trivial and nontrivial surface states.", "date": "2024-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, although many studies have shown that disaccharides exhibit such bioprotective and stabilizing properties, the underlying molecular mechanism is still elusive. In this study we have tried to reach such understanding by studying lysozyme in aqueous solutions of sucrose or trehalose and various ions (0.1 M of Cl\u2212 , NaCl, ZnCl2 and CaCl2 ) by classical atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and coarse-grained simulations. The latter simulations were performed for more diluted systems for elucidating larger structures of protein and disaccharide molecules, and possible aggregations. The most important finding for understanding the mechanism of protein stabilization is that the disaccharides in general, and trehalose in particular, slow down the protein dynamics by reducing the number of internal hydrogen bonds (both with and without bridging water molecules) in the protein molecules. This reduction of internal protein interactions is caused by disaccharides binding to the protein hydration water, and trehalose forms more hydrogen bonds to water than sucrose. Although it is far from obvious that such a reduction of internal hydrogen bonding in the protein should lead to slower protein dynamics, and thereby also a stabilization of the protein, the results show that this is clearly the case. The presence of ions has also some effect on the protein dynamics and stability. Particularly, it is discovered that sucrose ability to prevent protein aggregation increases substantially if ZnCl2 is added to the solution. The disaccharide and the salt seem to exhibit a synergistic effect in this case. To summarize, we have obtained molecular understanding for protein stabilization by disaccharides, and why trehalose is more effective than sucrose for this particular system, and the finding is important for understanding how the protein stability in e.g. pharmaceuticals should be optimized.", "date": "2024-11-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Biophysical Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Much evidence has pointed to the soluble nanoscale oligomers that form early in the A\u03b242 aggregation pathway, but there is little understanding of these structures, their mechanisms of formation, or how they grow into plaques.  Here, we show that a solvatochromic fluorophore with near infrared (NIR) emission can track synthetic A\u03b242 aggregation through environment-sensitive spectral shifts from the earliest timepoints through plaque formation. This azide-functionalized phosphine oxide azetidine rhodol (Phazr-N3) shows large polarity-dependent changes in fluorescence emission, with maxima shifting from 630 nm in toluene to 703 nm in aqueous buffer, and a maximum quantum yield of 62%. Upon induction of A\u03b242 aggregation, we observe immediate solvatochromic changes in Phazr-N3 fluorescence, with multiple apparent phases over 24 h, and which culminate before the onset of any major fluorescence changes of conformation-specific aggregation fluorophore ThT. Solution anisotropy measurements show a low micromolar affinity of Phazr-N3 for non-aggregated A\u03b242 in solution, and real-time measurements are consistent with rapid phase separation and slow dehydration of the growing aggregate. Spectral imaging of synthetic plaques stained in the presence of live cells and lipid-binding protein shows over 4000-fold Phazr-N3 fluorescence intensity above background under no-wash conditions, and over 100-fold intensity above co-plated microglial cells.

Specifically, it depends on the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups, which can act both as proton donors and acceptors. Reference surfaces, which are generated by bringing the unhydrogenated A- and B-terminated surfaces in contact with a stoichiometric water layer, show some spontaneous water dissociation, which produces a number of surface hydroxyl groups. On such an A-terminated reference surface, the EG molecule is barely reactive. This holds even in a more oxidative state. On the B-terminated surface, EG's decomposition into ethylenedioxy species occurs already in the reference state. Under the more oxidative hydrogen- deficient conditions obtained by removing 8 hydrogen atoms, the reaction proceeds to the formation of the two-electron oxidation product glycolaldehyde.

Recent discoveries include novel syntheses of life's building blocks, mechanisms of activation and interaction between molecules, and newly identified environments that provide promising conditions for these syntheses and mechanisms. Even with these new findings, firmly grounded in rigorous laboratory experiments, researchers often find themselves uncertain about how to apply them. How can a bridge be built between the laboratory and the geochemical environment? A critical question to ask when seeking to apply new results in origins is: how can this chemistry occur without direct intervention from a chemist? We believe the first step towards answering this question lies in the determination of rate constants and the construction of chemical networks to describe prebiotic chemistry in geochemical environments.\n\nSo far, our group has measured several rate constants relevant to different prebiotic reaction networks, starting with the synthetic pathways of the cyanosulfidic network. The reactions we explore often involve ultraviolet light-driven photochemistry, facilitated by our StarLab setup that accurately simulates the spectrum of the young Sun and other stars. Our latest work investigates environments with active photochemistry in the absence of cyanide. In this study, we measure the effective rate constant for the production of formate from the reduction of carbon species using sulfite within the context of early Martian waters. The underlying goal of the work done in our group is to predict the likelihood that certain geological conditions will result in a specific set of chemical products. These predictions can be combined with those we have made for the necessary astrophysical conditions in certain origins of life scenarios on extrasolar planets. \n\nIn the near future we expect that a sufficient number of rate constants will be measured, by our group and others, to allow for aspects of prebiotic chemistry to be predicted using chemical kinetics models. Once these models have been benchmarked against experimental data, our next step will be applying them to natural environments that better mimic the conditions thought to have been present at the onset of life. Following this, we can test these models by comparing their predictions to additional experiments. After refinement, these models will be able to provide guidance on the optimal conditions for conducting laboratory experiments, whilst helping to minimise and characterise any interference from a chemist.\n\nThis approach can provide valuable insights into what is possible within geochemical environments, where all chemistry is by necessity do-nothing chemistry.", "date": "2024-11-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Developing analytic potentials for describing potential energy surfaces underlying cation-\u03c0 interactions is a challenging task for large-scale simulations involving carbon-based materials. This study aimed to develop effective analytic models to overcome computational challenges in accurately capturing cation-\u03c0 interactions between alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+) and GYs, which are crucial for ion storage and transport within nanoporous GY frameworks. The high computational demands of ab initio methods for such large systems make analytic modeling increasingly essential. The absence of reliable analytic potentials and parameters needs to be urgently addressed. Here, we report that the commonly used 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential combined with electrostatics (EL) is insufficient for representing cation-\u03c0 interactions, as it fails to capture the ion-induced dipole effects that are crucial for the problem in hand. To address this, we propose modified 12-4 LJ + EL and improved Lennard-Jones (ILJ) potentials, which better capture the necessary short-range repulsions and long-range attractions. We developed and validated parameter sets based on interaction energy curves from density functional theory (DFT), enabling a reasonably accurate modeling of cation permeation and surface dynamics on GY sheets.

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) shows a significant increase in La ratio on the LaNiO3 surface after the introduction of oxygen defects, especially after H2 treatment where Ni/La reaches 3.5:1.

Here, we report the CO2 activation chemistry of an AlII complex supported by a chelating, dianionic ligand and investigate the electronic structure details and reaction mechanisms required to access this reactivity.

We studied the retention dynamics of a model DOM (i.e., a polysaccharide) at the water/diamond and water/goethite interface. In-situ adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted to probe the interfacial dynamicity of sorbed polysaccharide (PS) and its impact on surface wettability. Experiments revealed distinct bonding and kinetic behavior that depended on the polarity of the surface: goethite presented a higher adsorption capacity and binding strength but slower adsorption kinetics, compared to the diamond. Further, 2D correlation IR spectroscopy demonstrated surface polarity, surface loading and time alter the polysaccharide\u2019s conformation and self-assembly during adsorption and desorption. On goethite, electrostatic interactions with the surface were followed by the formation of inter- and intra- molecular H-bonds between side groups of polysaccharide chains, while at greater PS loading hydrophobic interactions between PS groups became predominant. In contrast, the non-polar diamond surface promoted hydrophobic interactions that governed polysaccharide retention initially; subsequently, increased PS loading promoted H-bond formation between its charged hydrophilic groups. Both PS-goethite and PS-diamond organo-mineral associations developed a hydrophobic character (i.e., low wettability) upon PS adsorption. Thus, we posit the stronger retention of nonpolar organic pollutants observed in soils might be caused, at least in part, by pollutant-organic interactions within hydrophobic pockets in organo-mineral associations.

Here, we demonstrate a synthesis strategy through the Ti-catalyzed addition polymerization of a cyclopropane-containing norbornadiene dimer (1) followed by post-polymerization modification (PPM). The polymerization of 1 using a constrained-geometry Ti catalyst afforded poly1 with narrow molecular weight distributions (\u0110 < 1.3), wherein the molecular weight linearly increased against the monomer conversion. Additionally, the copolymerization of 1 with 1-octene proceeded rapidly, and 1 was consumed faster than 1-octene to form gradient copolymers. The 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies indicated the 2,3-addition structure of poly1 and no side reaction at the cyclopropane moiety. The polymerizations were highly controlled and chemoselective owing to the lack of cyclopropane coordination to the active polymerization Ti species. The PPM of poly(1-co-1-octene) via the protic acid-catalyzed ring-opening reaction of the cyclopropane introduced aromatic, acyloxyl, and alkoxy groups in high incorporation ratios without cross-linking reactions.

We confirmed the reaction mechanism using smaller repeating units like glucose and cellobiose, demonstrating a pathway similar to LPMO and unlike TEMPO-mediated oxidation.

While MNPs released from plastic packaging materials at different environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature) have been explored, the influence of real food ingredients (e.g., polyphenols) on plastic release has not been studied. Herein, for the first time, we investigated the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a relevant catechin polyphenol common to tea, on the release of nanoplastics from polystyrene (PS) cups during a heating process. We developed a novel surface-enhance Raman scattering sensor to quantify released nanoplastics in situ using EGCG-based luminescent metal phenolic network labeling strategies. The presence of added EGCG enhanced MNP release (P<0.05) when microwaved, more so than in boiling water relative to cold water control. We also observed that the higher amounts of added EGCG at the same pH and temperature caused higher amounts of nanoplastics due to the interaction of EGCG with nanoplastics. Reusing PS cups treated with EGCG in boiling water resulted in a gradual increase in nanoplastic release over 4 cycles. Of interest was the finding that EGCG also mitigated the detrimental effects of increased nanoplastics exposure in differentiated Caco-2 cell redox status in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05). These results imply that polyphenols as food and beverage ingredients may influence exposure to nanoplastics, but also may act to reduce nanoplastic cytotoxicity.

Most studies have focused on using pure streams of CO2. However, CO2 is generally only available in dilute streams, which requires capture by sorbents followed by energy intensive regeneration to release concentrated CO2. Direct utilization of sorbed-CO2 avoids the costly regeneration step. Furthermore, the sorbent-CO2 interaction can kinetically activate CO2 and tune its reactivity to access products that could otherwise be inaccessible with direct CO2 reduction. We demonstrate that an N-heterocyclic carbene, 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (DPIy), can capture CO2 from dilute streams (0.04% and 10%) to form 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium-2-carboxylate (DPICx) quantitatively. Electrocatalyst iron tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (Fe(TPP)Cl) typically reduces CO2 to CO; however, with DPICx as the substrate, the 8-electron reduced product methane (CH4) is produced with high (>85%) Faradaic efficiency and regeneration of the sorbent DPIy. In addition to the overall energy and capital advantages of integrated CO2 capture and conversion, these studies illustrate how sorbents can serve a dual purpose for both CO2 capture and chemical auxiliary to access unique products. CO2 has a spectrum of reactivity with different types of sorbents; these results reveal how sorbent-CO2 interactions can be leveraged for integrated capture and utilization platforms to access a wider range of CO2-derived products.

To enable a reticular design of such materials, an accurate prediction of the adsorption properties with chemical accuracy and fully accounting for the flexibility is crucial.  The computational prediction of water adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has become standard practice.  However their predictive power to design new materials is hindered by the limited accuracy of the used interatomic potential and the limitations on how to account for the framework flexibility. In this work, we showcase a methodology to obtain chemically accurate adsorption isotherms that fully account for the framework flexibility.  The method is founded on very accurate and efficiently trained machine learning potentials and transition matrix Monte Carlo simulations to account for framework flexibility.  By first benchmarking the reference electronic level of theory used for the training, quantitatively accurate adsorption isotherms are obtained for MOF-303, a highly topical MOF being investigated for its potential use in water harvesting applications. We show that both an accurate level of theory and a proper inclusion of local and global framework flexibility is vital in the prediction of the adsorption properties of MOF-303. The broader applicability of our methodology is demonstrated through the study of related linker-exchanged materials, MOF-333 and MOF-LA2-1.  Analyses of the density profiles of water adsorbed in these MOFs yields deeper insight into the origins and differences of the observed isotherms.  An optimal water harvester should have initial seeding sites with intermediate adsorption strength, to prevent detrimental low-pressure water uptake.  To increase the working capacity, linker extension strategies can be used while maintaining the initial seeding sites, as was done in the MOF-LA2-1.

However, the physics of such active drops (matter) in contact with a soft and deformable surface has remained elusive. In this letter, we attempt to fill this gap and develop a theory for soft, active wetting. Our theory, which accounts for the various free energies for passive substrate and active drops as well as the active stresses, provides an equilibrium description of (active) particle orientation inside the drop and an equilibrium shape of the drop-soft-solid system. We obtain the equation relating the activity to the internal pressure of an active drop. The equilibrium calculation yields an ordered state of the polarization field inside the drop. The presence of the extensile (contractile) activity is found to make the drop press into the soft surface (come out of the soft surface), while increasing (decreasing) the wetting radius as compared to non-active drops. Finally, the three-phase contact line undergoes a rotation that depends on the strength of activity. These findings shed new light on the manner in which the active stresses interact with surface tension and elasticity at the fundamental level.", "date": "2024-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Therefore, this project aimed to create an energy source that solved the problems batteries had while improving the super-capacitor technology. This would be achieved by creating a cost-effective pseudo-super-capacitor. This project hence synthesized a novel electrode material. To ensure the faradaic redox reaction occurred the oxide MnO2 was used. This MnO2 was synthesized with the sol-gel process to create 1D nano-rods. It was then doped with Fe to weaken the hydrogen bonds in the MnO2 to create oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies and 1D nano-rods improve mobility, conductivity, and structural stability. The novel electrode material was combined with the binder solution and current collector to make the final pseudo-super-capacitor.

The power density was also not compromised being 2456.163 (W/kg). The prototype has the potential to store 900 watts at the mere cost of $10.03.

These electrodes consist of a single-crystalline Ru(0001) substrate covered by epitaxial Pt films of one to three atomic layers.

To study translocation of a single-subunit RNA polymerase (RNAP) during human mitochondrial transcription, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) as a vehicle to illustrate CV refinement in conformational samplings and dimension reduction analyses. The RNAP translocation is an essential mechanical step of the transcription elongation that dictates gene expression. The translocation generally follows from polymerization product release and proceeds to initial binding or pre-insertion of incoming nucleotides. The human mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNAP (or POLRMT) plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and can be a key molecular off-target in the design of nucleotide analogue antiviral and antitumor drugs due to its structural similarities with many viral RNAPs or RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). While POLRMT shares particularly high structural similarity with bacteriophage T7 RNAP, previous experimental studies and our current simulations suggest that POLRMT\u2019s mechano-chemical coupling mechanisms may be distinct. In our current work, we modeled POLRMT elongation complexes and performed equilibrium MD simulations on the pre- and post-translocation models, with extensive samplings around different potential translocation paths (with or without coupling to the fingers subdomain conformational change). We then compared time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and the neural network implementation of the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMPnets) as dimensional reduction methods on selected atomic CV sets to best represent the sampled data from the MD simulations. Our results indicate that POLRMT translocation is likely coupled with and facilitated by NTP binding to enable fingers subdomain opening at post-translocation which would otherwise be non-stabilized, or the translocations may proceed in futile without leading to the fingers opening for incoming NTP initial binding or incorporation. The timescale of the NTP binding-coupled or facilitated translocation reaches over hundreds of microseconds as predicted by the VAMPnets analyses. Such a timescale seems to match a last post-catalytic kinetic step suggested for the POLRMT elongation cycle by previous experimental detections. By inclusion of NTP binding/catalytic motifs into the analyses, the predicted time scale slightly increases as if additional protein dynamics related to NTP binding activities are considered. Thus, our MD simulation studies combining CV refinements and dimension reduction analyses on top of extensive conformational samplings suggest a distinct mechano-chemical coupling mechanism of POLRMT translocation as if the Brownian motions are slightly assisted by NTP binding.", "date": "2024-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Higher coverages typically lead to increased repulsive interactions, which should further constrain the large-amplitude modes that contribute the most to the vibrational entropy.

Single molecule junctions typically consist of two terminal anchors linking organic molecules to metal electrodes. Here, we show that p-terphenyl derivatives containing only a single terminal anchor exhibit conductance features similar to junctions with two terminal anchors, which arises due to dynamic Au-C bond formation due to a single electron oxidation event at the electrode. A set of p-terphenyl derivatives with one terminal anchor was prepared and characterized using automated chemical synthesis, single molecule electronics experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and non-equilibrium Green\u2019s function-density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) calculations. Our results show that 4-amino-p-terphenyl (PPP) exhibits a distinct and well-defined high conductance state that is greatly diminished or absent in other p-terphenyl derivatives with single terminal anchors, whereas a low conductance state is observed in all amino-p-terphenyl derivatives due to non-covalent dimeric interactions. The electronic properties of PPP are characterized using a combination of cyclic voltammetry, electrolysis, and electron spin resonance, revealing that the high conductance state in PPP arises due to robust Au-C bond formation facilitated by a single electron oxidation event and stabilized by a rigid resonance structure under an electric field. A series of control experiments with different anchor groups reveals the role of primary amines in forming dynamic linkages in molecular junctions. Overall, these results suggest that Au-C bond formation gives rise to high conductance pathways in organic molecules containing only one terminal anchor.

For the first time, such an ArM containing a non-canonical metal-binding amino acid was successfully optimized through directed evolution. The ArM was applied in the copper-catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition of 2-acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes, yielding various \u03b3-nitro butyric acid derivatives, which are precursors for a range high-value-added pharmaceutically relevant compounds, with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to >99% yield and 99% ee).

X-ray crystal structure analysis confirms the binding of the Cu(II) ions to the BpyA residues and shows that, in principle, there is sufficient space for the 2-acetyl azaarene substrates to coordinate. Kinetic studies showed that the increased catalytic efficiency of the evolved enzyme is due to improvements in apparent KM for both substrates and a notable threefold increase in apparent kcat for the 2-acetyl azaarene.

The droplet size distribution and desolvation dynamics play a major role: lower average internal energies are obtained when the ions remain protected by a solvation shell and spend less time nakedly exposed to activating conditions in the transfer interface. Methods based on small droplet formation without charging can thus be softer than electrospray. New dielectric barrier discharge sources can gas-phase ionize small molecules while conferring barely more internal energy than electrospray ionization. However, the tuning of the entire source interface often has an even greater influence on ion internal energies and fragmentation than on the ionization process itself. We hope that this review will facilitate further research to control and standardize in-source ion activation conditions, and to ensure the transferability of data and research results in mass spectrometry.", "date": "2024-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Apparatus; Mass Spectrometry; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While Liquid Chromatography coupled with High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) Non-Targeted Analysis (NTA) has emerged as an essential tool for the comprehensive study of such samples, the identification of individual constituents remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the vast number of detected features in each sample. To address this, prioritization strategies are frequently employed to narrow the focus to the most relevant features for further analysis.  In this study, we developed a novel prioritization strategy that directly links fragmentation and chromatographic data to aquatic toxicity categories, bypassing the need for individual compound identification. Given that features are not always well-characterized through fragmentation, we created two models: 1) a Random Forest Classification (RFC) model, which classifies fish toxicity categories based on MS1, retention, and fragmentation data---expressed as cumulative neutral losses (CNLs)---when fragmentation information is available, and 2) a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) model that relies solely on retention time and MS1 data when fragmentation is absent. Both models demonstrated accuracy comparable to structure-based prediction methods. We further tested the models on a pesticide mixture in a tea extract measured by LC-HRMS, where the CNLs-based RFC model achieved 0.76 accuracy and the KDE model reached 0.61, showcasing their robust performance in real-world applications.", "date": "2024-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ionic liquids are emerging as promising, non-flammable electrolytes for next-generation batteries. Yet, designing ionic liquids to facilitate redox ion transport has proven challenging, because ionic liquids are concentrated electrolytes where ion-ion interactions cause pronounced deviation from classical electrolyte scaling theories which assume viscosity governs mobility. Machine learning studies show that ionic liquid transport properties are challenging to predict from molecular descriptors, preventing rational design. Here, we pursue a broader data-centric approach to provide insight into ionic liquid design by merging databases of experimental properties and computational molecular features for 218 ionic liquids across 127 publications. We find that ionic liquids are well-described by a modified Arrhenius model that captures structure-driven ion transport in correlated electrolytes, yielding energy barriers of around 20-30 kJ/mol. This exhibits remarkable agreement with the approximately 25 kJ/mol screened ion pair interaction energy derived from surface forces measurements, suggesting links between mechanisms of ion transport and interfacial screening. We also use machine learning models to find that molecular features can predict some properties, such as density, while failing to predict properties that rely on long-range correlations, such as viscous dissipation. Our study reveals that data science tools can be leveraged to reveal non-classical transport scaling relationships and alternative materials descriptors that promise to be transformative for designing ionic liquids and other correlated electrolytes for next-generation batteries.

Although it is generally understood that one of the main mechanisms by which phenolic antioxidants prevent or slow down oxidation is by deactivating radicals and preventing the formation of alkyl radicals, detailed understanding at the atomic scale of the hierarchy of radical reactions is still lacking. Here, we investigate the interaction of a prototypical phenolic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), with radicals in a polyethylene model by means of static and dynamic simulations based on density functional theory. We focus on the H-transfer reactions between BHT and radical species by evaluating the associated energy barriers and analyses the conditions in which these relevant reactions occur by first principles molecular dynamics simulation. Our polyethylene model includes a realistic surface of a crystalline lamella, thus describing the local atomic environment in which the reactions mainly take place. Our results suggest that the H-transfer reaction of the BHT molecule with an alkoxy radical is spontaneous and the energy barrier is small (~0.1 eV) with a peroxy radical.

The equilibrated structure at 300 K and crystal growth at 500 K were analyzed in terms of interfacial enthalpy and crystallization rates. A novel method for identifying PS43- units as either glassy or crystalline was established based on the rotational motion of PS43- units. The rotational motion of PS43- units in the interfacial model was quantitatively indexed using sulfur trajectories within a 100 ps time window.  The crystallization rate calculated using crystal growth simulations was found to depend on the crystalline plane forming the interface. The predicted crystal shape, derived from the interfacial enthalpy and growth rate, was analyzed using Wulff's theorem.  The Li+ diffusivity in the crystalline, glassy, and interfacial regions of the interfacial model was evaluated through the time integration of velocity--velocity autocorrelation functions. Notably, the Li+ diffusivity in the crystalline regions varied depending on the interfacial model and differed from that of bulk beta-Li3PS4. This variation was attributed to differences in the degree of PS43- rotational motion in the crystalline regions of the interfacial model.  The analytical methodologies developed in this study and the insights into the effects of interfaces on PS43- rotational motion, make valuable contributions to the understanding and design of glass-ceramics with interfaces.

Leveraging the realism of the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential and advanced path-integral quantum dynamics, we analyze the vibrational sum-frequency generation (vSFG) spectrum of graphene/water interfaces under varying surface charges. Our quantum simulations reveal a distinctive dangling OH peak in the vSFG spectrum at neutral graphene, consistent with recent experimental findings yet markedly different from earlier studies. As the graphene surface becomes positively charged, interfacial water molecules reorient, decreasing the intensity of the dangling OH peak as the OH groups turn away from the graphene. In contrast, water molecules orient their OH bonds toward negatively charged graphene, leading to a prominent dangling OH peak in the corresponding vSFG spectrum. This charge-induced reorganization generates a diverse range of hydrogen-bonding topologies at the interface, driven by variations in the underlying electrostatic interactions. Re- markably, these structural changes extend into deeper water layers, creating an unequal distribution of molecules with OH bonds pointing toward and away from the graphene sheet.

Understanding the catalytic mechanism of EFE is essential for optimizing the biological production of these important industrial chemicals. In this study, we implemented molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) to elucidate the pathways leading to ethylene and 3HP formation. Our results suggest that ethylene formation occurs from the propion-3-yl radical intermediate rather than the (2-carboxyethyl)carbonato-Fe(II) intermediate (EFIV), which conclusively acts as a precursor for 3HP formation. The results also explain the role of the hydrophobic environment surrounding the 2OG binding site in stabilizing the propion-3-yl radical, which defines their conversion to either ethylene or 3HP. Our simulations on the A198L EFE variant, which produces more 3HP than wild-type (WT) EFE based on experimental observations, predict that the formation of EFIV intermediate is more favored than WT. Also, MD simulations on EFIV intermediate in both WT and A198L EFE predicted that the water molecules approach the Fe center, which suggests a role of water molecules in the breakdown of EFIV intermediate. QM/MM simulations on the EFIV intermediate of WT and A198L EFE predicted that the Fe-bound water molecule could provide a proton for the 3HP formation from EFIV.

Herein, we have used time-resolved neutron reflectometry (NR) to observe SEI formation under Li-N2R conditions. We found that LiBF4-based electrolyte provided a substantially more well-defined SEI layer than previous SEI NR interrogation that used LiClO4, highlighting the underlying chemistry that dictates electrolyte design and enabling new NR-based studies. Using in situ neutron reflectometry, we found the LiBF4-derived SEI under Li-N2R conditions comprises a thick, diffuse outer layer and a thin, compact inner layer at low current cycling (<2 mA/cm2), revealing a structure which ex situ studies have not been able to probe. Increased current cycling and sustained current cycling led to the merge of the layers to a single-layer SEI. We used isotope contrast methods with d6-EtOH and d8-THF to drive time-resolved tracking of SEI growth at low current cycling, revealing that the proton donor modifies the inner layer, and the solvent modifies the outer layer. Li dendritic growth was observed in the absence of a proton donor. Neutron absorption also indicated the presence of boron in the SEI, underscoring the value of neutron-based interrogation.

However, real reactor set-ups commonly feature non-idealities such as heat- and mass transfer limitations, described by partial differential equations (PDEs) or differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Discretizing such non-ideal PDE or DAE reactor models by finite volumes yields algebraic balance equations, which are solved by numerical schemes. In this work, we propose to learn kinetics from non-ideal reactor data using these balance equations and implicit neural networks, avoiding expensive backpropagation through the numerical solution by utilizing the implicit function theorem. The approach is demonstrated for the example of a mass transfer limited flat plate reactor for the preferential catalytic oxidation of CO. We show that Global Reaction Neural Networks, embedding thermodynamic and stoichiometric prior knowledge, coupled with a discretized two-phase CSTR cascade reactor model extract intrinsic kinetics from 50 integral reactor experiments. These kinetics generalize to new reactor geometries, where kinetics obtained by neural ODEs fail.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with high carrier mobility and picosecond intrinsic response times exhibit large potential in this respect. However, most reported 2D material photodetectors for the telecom C-band either suffer from a slow response speed or rely on integrated silicon waveguides, which is a consequence of the inefficient utilization of hot carriers in these devices. Here, we report a high-performance and waveguide-free WS2/graphene photodetector operating at 1560 nm enabled by hot carrier injection and long-lived charge separation. The efficiently injected hot electrons from graphene to WS2 exhibit ultrafast cooling dynamics with 3 ps intrinsic response time. Simultaneous hole trapping in WS2 ensures a long circulation of injected electrons, enabling a high responsivity of 0.26 A/W. In continuation, we present a vertical WS2/graphene/WSe2 device with a built-in electric field and the same detection mechanism, for which a photocurrent on-off ratio of 3500 and an extrinsic response time of 1.71 ns are obtained.

The adsorption energy calculations reveal that these biomarkers undergo chemisorption on pristine g-C3N4, resulting in long recovery times, which restricts the suitability of pristine g-C3N4 as a sensor. Alternatively, the band gap of Co-g-C3N4 (0.98 eV) is lower than that of pristine g-C3N4 (1.33 eV), which increases the conductivity of Co-g-C3N4 (5.11 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 S/m) compared to pristine g-C3N4 (5.714 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 S/m) - suggesting obvious selective sensitivity towards the biomarkers. Our results indicate that acetone adsorbs on the Co-g-C3N4 surface via chemisorption process, aniline undergoes physisorption, and ethanol exhibits an intermediate adsorption behaviour. Recovery time analysis revealed that aniline (0.09 s) and ethanol (3.64 s) can be recovered quickly at 398 K, which further accelerates under UV irradiation at 298 K.

Wiring precisely oriented redox protein partners to the nanoscale electrodes of an electrochemical scanning tunneling microscope allows to record the time- and distance-dependence of the current flowing between them. These methods have revealed that the current flowing between individual protein pairs extends much beyond tunneling distances and that it is electrochemically gated. However, the mechanism of this process, and especially the identity of the charge carriers in the aqueous solution, remains to be elucidated. To determine the species involved in long distance charge transport between the redox partner proteins Cc and Cc1 of the respiratory chain, we have performed recordings as a function of pH, in heavy water solutions, and in degassed solutions. We observe that the spatial span and electrochemical gating of long-distance currents are reduced at high pH. Currents are also less extended in heavy water and at low oxygen concentration. Using the experimental structures of oxidized and reduced Cc and pKa calculations, we identify residues that can switch their availability to form hydrogen bonds with water and/or engage in proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. Overall, our results show that long distance currents between cytochrome c (Cc) and cytochrome c1 (Cc1) through the aqueous solution are assisted by superoxide anions and by protons, and we discuss possible molecular mechanisms and their relevance for interprotein ET.", "date": "2024-11-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Biophysical Chemistry; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, constructing these models requires computationally expensive and manually tedious density functional theory (DFT) calculations for identifying transition states for each elementary reaction within the MKM. To address these challenges we demonstrate a novel protocol that uses the open-source kinetics workflow tool Pynta to automate the iterative training of a reactive machine learning potential (rMLP). Specifically, using the silver-catalyzed partial oxidation of methanol as a prototypical example, we first demonstrate our workflow by training an rMLP to accelerate the parallel calculation of DFT-quality transition states for all 53 reactions, achieving a 7x speedup compared to a DFT-only strategy. Detailed analysis of our training curriculum reveals the shortcomings of using an adaptive sampling scheme with a single rMLP model to describe all reactions within the MKM simultaneously. We show that these limitations can be overcome using a balanced \"reaction class\" approach that uses multiple rMLP models, each describing a single class of similar transition states. Finally, we demonstrate that our Pynta-based workflow is also compatible with large pre-trained foundational models. For example, by fine-tuning a top-performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, we observe an impressive 20x speedup with an 89\\% success rate in identifying transition states.

In this paper, we propose a method, called Temporal Analysis of Multidimensional Chemical Interaction Space (TAMCIS), which looks at important combinations of interactions, rather than analyzing them one at a time. Each molecule was assigned a vector order parameter, with components representing appropriately chosen chemical interactions. The aggregate data was processed with density-based clustering, resulting in \u201cinter- action clusters\u201d. Time dependent partitioning of the molecules among these clusters revealed the mechanism in terms of interactions, thereby making a direct connection to the molecular structures of the building blocks. We applied the method to a comparative study of assembly mechanisms of two isomeric hydrophobic tripeptides in water, namely tri-L-leucine (LLL) and tri-L-isoleucine (III). Initially, both systems started to aggregate via non-bonded interactions through sidechains.

This review represents the most comprehensive work to date on photochemical methods for synthesizing 1,3-benzothiazoles, covering developments in this field from 2009 to 2024. It is organized by the types of starting compounds and discusses synthetic strategies for the target compounds alongside proposed reaction mechanisms.

We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn-N4-C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH-dependent volcano evolution for Sn-N4-C and polyatomic Sn.

Re-occurrence is frequent and requires repeated treatments with oral, antifungal medications at high doses. Prolonged treatments contribute to development of resistant fungal strains and the risk of systemic adverse effects. Vaginal drug delivery can overcome several of the disadvantages associated with oral drug administration. However, current dosage forms, such as vaginal creams and gels, are rapidly expelled from the vaginal tract and require daily dosing to assure therapeutic outcome, thus jeopardizing patient compliance. Therefore, we developed rapidly dissolving microneedle arrays for local, vaginal delivery of antifungal drugs. Clotrimazole, a poorly water-soluble antifungal agent, was formulated in lipid-based nanocarriers (LNCs) and incorporated in the tips of microneedles. The antifungal activity was then tested against the most common VVC fungal strains, C. albicans and C. glabrata, using an in vitro disk diffusion assay and an explant model from bovine vaginal tissue. Antifungal activity  increased when the LNCs were incorporated in the microneedles. Notably, the LNC-loaded microneedles inhibited fungal growth at a 10-fold lower drug dose than a commercial clotrimazole cream. Finally, a device prototype was manufactured, based on an intravaginal ring with multiple microneedle arrays on its surface. Local vaginal drug delivery using such microneedle-based devices could enable more effective treatment strategies for VVC.

In this study, the \u0394EST of a set of 15 INVEST molecules has been computed within the framework of Restricted Open-Shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) and Delta Self-Consistent Field (\u0394SCF) methods and the results benchmarked against wavefunction-based calculations performed at the EOM-CCSD, NEVPT2 and SCS-CC2 levels.

We also show that the only way to get an inverted gap was to resort to double hy-brid functionals.

The balance between these instrument functions is especially important in glycoproteomics, where complexities of glycopeptide fragmentation necessitate large precursor ion populations and, consequently, long ion accumulation times for quality MS/MS spectra. To compound matters further, dissociation methods like electron transfer dissociation (ETD) that benefit glycopeptide characterization come with overhead times that also slow down scan acquisition. Here we explored how the dual IRM architecture of the Orbitrap Ascend can improve glycopeptide analysis, with a focus on O-glycopeptide characterization using ETD with supplemental collisional activation (EThcD). We found that parallelization of ion accumulation and EThcD fragmentation \u2013 uniquely enabled by the Orbitrap Ascend \u2013 increased scan acquisition speed without sacrificing spectral quality, subsequently increasing the number of O-glycopeptides identified relative to analyses on the Orbitrap Eclipse (i.e., the previous generation Tribrid MS). Additionally, we systematically evaluated ion-ion reaction times and supplemental activation energies used for EThcD to understand how best to utilize acquisition time in the dual IRM architecture. We observed that shorter-than-expected ion-ion reaction times minimized scan overhead time without sacrificing c/z\u2022-fragment ion generation, and that higher supplemental collision energies can generate combinations of glycan-retaining and glycan-neutral-loss peptide backbone fragments that benefit O-glycopeptide identification. We also saw improvements in N-glycopeptide analysis using collision-based dissociation, especially with methods using faster scan acquisition speeds. Overall, these data show how architectural changes to the Tribrid MS platform benefit glycoproteomic experiments by parallelizing scan functions to minimize overhead time and improve sensitivity.", "date": "2024-11-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

SEI consists of a variety of byproducts generated by spontaneous and electrochemical decomposition of the electrolyte. This thin, structurally complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution\u2014the reverse reaction of deposition\u2014in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase (T-SEI) that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully \u201crelaxable\u201d upon removal of the enforced dissolution current; That is, the T-SEI completely dissolves back into the electrolyte when rested. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Using 3D profilometry, we observe a 42% reduction in surface roughness due to T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or \u201cwater-in-salt\u201d electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in next-generation batteries cycled at high rates.

The success of these methods depends on the ability of the CVs to follow the relevant slow modes of the system. Intuitive CVs, such as distances or contacts, often prove inadequate, particularly in biological systems involving many coupled degrees of freedom. Machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks (NN), can automate the process of CV discovery by combining a large number of molecular descriptors and often outperform intuitive CVs in sampling efficiency. However, their lack of interpretability and high cost of evaluation during trajectory propagation make NN-CVs difficult to apply to large biomolecular processes. Here, we introduce a surrogate model approach using lasso regression to express the output of a neural network as a linear combination of an automatically chosen subset of the input descriptors. We demonstrate successful applications of our surrogate model CVs in the enhanced sampling simulation of the conformational landscape of alanine dipeptide and chignolin mini-protein. In addition to providing mechanistic insights due to their explainable nature, the surrogate model CVs showed a negligible loss in efficiency and accuracy, compared to the NN-CVs, in reconstructing the underlying free energy surface. Moreover, due to their simplified functional forms, these CVs are better at extrapolating to unseen regions of the conformational space, e.g., saddle points. Surrogate model CVs are also less expensive to evaluate compared to their NN counterparts, making them suitable for enhanced sampling simulation of large and complex biomolecular processes.", "date": "2024-11-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We find that for semiconducting MoTe2, spots that fall along step edges show more catalytic activity than spots that fall solely on the basal plane. In contrast, for a semimetallic phase of MoTe2, there is no measurable difference between H2 evolution activity at the step edges and at the basal plane, indicating that the active sites for H2 evolution catalysis on transition metal dichalcogenides are phase dependent. We additionally find that the local H2 evolution activity correlates with local potential differences, higher conductance, and faster rates of outer-sphere electron transfer to a redox-active probe in solution. Interestingly, in the semiconducting phase of MoTe2, these local electronic structure differences were measured both at the edge sites and at basal plane sites next to the edge, extending > 50 nm away from the edge.  These results indicate that for MoTe2, basal plane sites near the edge may have stronger free energies of H adsorption, \u0394GHads, than basal plane sites farther from the edge. Thus, we propose that edge sites in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides are better thought of as defect sites that substantially modulate the electronic structure in the surrounding region, rather than solely as undercoordinated active sites.

By analyzing multi dimensional time-variance within a matrix of time-resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. We correlate these sudden EDL reorganizations with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2 to CO, providing - to the best of our knowledge - the first direct spectroscopic evidence of such a phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice-like ordering and increased randomness.

These LPCs exhibit rapid color modulation, angle-independent coloration, and remarkable stability, surpassing the performance of traditional LPCs. A key finding lies in the observation of metamerism within MOF-based LPCs, where spectrally distinct configurations appear indistinguishable to the human eye, potentially enabling hidden optical encoding.

Current methods for smoothing rough metallic surfaces require either the removal or addition of substantial amounts of material using complex processes that are incompatible with 3-dimensional nano-scale features needed for state-of-the-art applications. We present a vapor-phase process that results in up to a 60% smoothing of nanometer scale rough gold surfaces through a single exposure to a new class of ligand called N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). This process does not require removal or addition of metal from the surface and provides smoothing at the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m scale.  Smoothing occurs in a single deposition, giving quantifiable differences in the adsorption behavior of the resulting surfaces. The process takes place through an adatom\u2013extraction-driven destabilization and restructuring of the surface in a self-limiting manner. This novel process is achieved without the use of harsh chemical etchants or mechanical intervention, takes only minutes, and can easily be integrated with vapor phase processing in situ. It offers a promising avenue for subnanometer smoothing in microfabrication workflows.

This could affect downstream ion activation exper-iments, leading to erroneous conclusions about the native-like structure. One such activation strategy is surface-induced dis-sociation (SID), which generally causes native-like protein complexes to dissociate along the weakest subunit interfaces, re-vealing critical information about the complex\u2019s native-like topology and subunit connectivity. If the quaternary structure has been disturbed then the SID fingerprint will shift as well. Thus, SID was used diagnose source-induced quaternary struc-ture rearrangement and help tune an instrument\u2019s source and other upstream transmission regions to strike the balance be-tween signal intensity, adduct removal, and conserving the native-like structure. Complementary to SID, electron-capture dissociation (ECD) can also diagnose rearranged quaternary structures and was used after in-source activation to confirm that the subunit interfaces were rearranged, opening the structure to electron capture and subsequent dissociation.

Alkaline hydrothermal vents (AHVs) may have facilitated energy-transfer and carbon-fixation at life\u2019s emergence, via a primordial chemiosmotic mechanism. Specifically, pH separation across vent walls could have been the forerunner to pH separation across microbial membranes, with electron-conductive inorganic barriers containing [Ni-]FeS minerals mimicking the active sites of metalloenzymes in potentially ancient biological reductive acetyl-CoA Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, reverse Krebs and other metabolic pathways. We previously demonstrated pH gradient dependent reduction of CO2 to formate by H2 in AHV interface conditions. Here, we address the same problem of CO2 reduction, however using a macroscale reactor that allowed us to use minerals synthesized via protocols analogous to the alkaline vent mount formation. This reactor also allowed us to probe more variables, and explore longer experimentation time-frames. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the effect of the different aspects of the gradientrich hydrothermal-vent interface on the observed CO2 electrochemical reduction- such as different minerals, temperature gradients, as well as the flow of electrons under passive vs. induced currents and potentials. Using experimental simulations and electrochemistry techniques, We detected two key steps of the WL pathway (CO2 to formic acid, and the formation acetic acid) as well as reactions in the reverse Krebs cycle (fumarate to succinate). Both Ni in the mineral, and temperature as a property, were shown to affect the formation of formate. Extremely small currents were enough to efficiently carry out CO2 reduction.

The PLS reactivity can be determined by the topology of the lowest triplet potential energy surface because the photoexcited complex is able to decay into lowest triplet state via intersystem crossing and internal conversion with sufficiently low energy barriers. The lowest triplet state has a character of metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (3MLCT) around the Franck-Condon region, and it shifts to metal-centered (3MC) state as the axial Re-CO bond is bend and elongated. The equatorial CO ligand is not dissociated in the course of PLS reaction and only axial CO ligand is selectively dissociated. This study reveals that the 3MC connecting the 3MLCT is not dissociative in nature, rather, the dissociative 3MC is reached via multiple 3MCs.

Although living organisms can produce numerous coloured substances, they frequently demonstrate poor dyeing performance, insufficient photostability, or toxicity. To guide the development of new biosynthetically accessible colourants, we developed a workflow (DyeDactic) to predict colour at different pH values. Starting with a rapid estimation of the lowest electronic transition energy for potential colourants using Graph Neural Networks, the procedure can filter large libraries of generated chemical structures producing a targeted subset of compounds for further examination. The final step employs time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to estimate the intensity of absorption peaks in the visible spectral region, model spectral band shape and estimate colour. To tackle halochromism, which is frequently observed for natural colourants, populations of protonated and deprotonated species are estimated at different pH values using predicted acidity constants of ionisable atoms followed by addition and weighting of modelled absorption spectra. The complete workflow is applied to four natural colourants belonging to different classes (emodin, quinalizarin, biliverdin, and orcein) and the predicted colour dependence on pH is compared with the experimental data. Both the machine learning tool and the quantum chemical calculations are validated and fine-tuned using an assembled dataset of spectral properties of 647 natural colourants.

Measurements demonstrate that the VCD bands of the \u03bd(OH) mode show an increased fine structure in comparison to the broad infrared absorption bands. In a computational study, the chiroptical signal can entirely be traced back to non-local terms emerging from the supramolecular environment, determined by the hydrogen-bonded network involving the hydroxyl groups.

We stabilized the activated catalyst materials in ultra-high vacuum and exposed them to controlled doses of H2O to analyse the catalyst-electrolyte interface in a quasi in-situ approach with photoelectron spectroscopy. Going from Li+ to Cs+, more OH groups are found on the surface after the exposure to H2O, demonstrating that such structural changes are facilitating the dissociation of H2O. As the dissociation of H2O is a crucial step in many OER mechanisms, its modified efficiency can be correlated with the observed trends in OER activity in LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and CsOH.", "date": "2024-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We utilized a thiophene analogue of the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and employed CuAAC chemistry for the assembly of PROTACs bearing various linkers and recruiting three different E3 ligases. Compounds were evaluated in bidirectional thermal stability studies with NLRP3 and E3 ligases. IL-1\u03b2 release and protein abundance of NLRP3 were assessed in cellular assays. PROTAC V2 induces a significant VHL-dependent degradation of NLRP3 and constitutes a valuable tool to decipher the intricate details of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "date": "2024-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

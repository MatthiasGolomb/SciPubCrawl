The available data suggest T-shaped organopalladium(II) complexes manifest unusual blue light-accessible Pd- to-C(sp3) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). The quantum efficiency and excited state lifetime of this process were unexpectedly superior compared to a prototypical (\u03b1-diimine)Pd(II) complex featuring a low-lying, ligand-centered LUMO (\u03c0*).

Small variations in MOF synthesis conditions can lead to a range of accessible frameworks with divergent chemical or photophysical properties. New meth-ods to controllably access phases with tailored properties would broaden the scope of MOFs that can be reliably prepared for specific applications. Herein, we demonstrate that simply increasing the reaction concentration during the solvother-mal synthesis of M2(dobdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Ni; dobdc4\u2212 = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), also known as MOF-74, unexpectedly leads to trapping of a kinetic intermediate termed CORN-MOF-1 (CORN = Cornell University). In-depth spec-troscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies support that CORN-MOF-1 has a similar structure to M2(dobdc) but with partially protonated linkers and charge-balancing or coordinated formate groups in the pores. The resultant vari-ation in linker spacings causes CORN-MOF-1 (Mg) to be strongly photoluminescent in the solid state, whereas H4dobdc and Mg2(dobdc) are weakly emissive due to excimer formation. In addition, CORN-MOF-1 variants can be converted into high-quality samples of the thermodynamic M2(dobdc) phases by heating in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).

While the formation of solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) on anodes has received much attention, there is still lack of understanding about the formation of cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) on the cathodes.  To fill this gap, we report on dynamic deformations on lithium iron phosphate, LiFePO4 cathodes during charge / discharge by utilizing in-operando digital image correlation, impedance spectroscopy and Cryo X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  LiFePO4 cathodes were cycled in either LiPF6, LiClO4 or LiTFSI- containing organic liquid electrolytes. Beyond the first cycle, Li-ion intercalation results in a nearly linear correlation between electrochemical strains and the state of (dis)-charge, regardless of the electrolyte chemistry. However, during the first charge in LiPF6 - containing electrolyte, there is a distinct irreversible positive strain evolution at the onset of anodic current rise as well as current decay at around 4.0V. Impedance studies show the increase in surface resistance in the same potential window, suggesting the formation of CEI layers on the cathode.  The chemistry of the CEI layer was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. LiF is detected in CEI layer starting as early as 3.4 V and LixPOyFz appeared at voltages higher than 4.0 V during the first charge.

Here, we employed two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy and structure-based spectral calculations to investigate the morphology-dependent secondary-structure and local environments in filaments and weakly or strongly bundled networks. The results indicate that actin undergo secondary structural changes upon bundling, resulting in a decrease in beta-sheet and increase in the loop conformations. Moreover, strongly bundled networks experience a decrease in backbone solvent exposure, with relatively low perturbation of alpha-helix and the beta-sheet nearly ``locked\" in buried positions. Similar changes are observed in the loops, which become less hydrated but exhibit a dynamic environment.

Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M=Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2-xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P-type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to a significant increase in the Ru d-band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and 1 NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state-of-the-art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt-like activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 (\u03b710=12.3 mV; \u03b7100=52 mV; turnover frequency (TOF)=4.7 s-1).

However, atomistic MD is currently feasible for only the smallest window of droplet sizes appearing at the end steps of a droplet's lifetime. The relevance of the observations made to the actual droplet evolution, which is much longer that the simulated sizes, has not been addressed yet in the literature. Here, we perform a systematic study of desolvation mechanisms of  poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), protonated peptides of different compositions and proteins in  order to  (a) obtain insight into the charging mechanism of macromolecules in larger droplets than those that are currently amenable to atomistic MD, and  (b) examine whether currently used atomistic modeling can establish the extrusion mechanism of proteins from droplets.  To mimic larger droplets that are not amenable to MD modeling, we scale down the systems, by simulating a large droplet size relative to the macromolecule. MD of PEG charging reveals that above a critical droplet size, ions are available near the backbone of the macromolecule,  but charging occurs only transiently by transfer of ions from the solvent to the macroion, while below the critical size, the capture of the ion from PEG has a lifetime sufficiently long for extrusion of a charged PEG from the aqueous droplet. This is the first report of the role of  droplet curvature in the relation between macroion conformation and charging.  Simulations of peptides with high degree of hydrophobicity show that partial extrusion of a peptide from the droplet surface is rare relative to desolvation by drying-out. Differently from what has been presented in the literature we argue that atomistic MD simulations have not sufficiently established extrusion mechanism of proteins from droplets and their charging mechanism. We also argue that release of highly charged proteins can occur at an earlier stage of a droplet's lifetime than predicted by atomistic MD. In this earlier stage, we emphasize the key role of jets emanating from a droplet at the point of charge-induced instability in the release of proteins.

However, no clear explanation has been put forth on why the stacking mode varies for each 2D MOF, and characterizing their stacking mode depends on expensive and time-consuming experimental measurements. Here, we construct a potential energy surface (PES) map database for 36 2D MOFs using density functional theory (DFT) for the experimentally synthesized and non-synthesized 2D MOFs to predict their stacking mode. The DFT PES results successfully predict the experimentally synthesized stacking mode with an accuracy of 92.9% and explain the coexistence mechanism of dual stacking modes in a single compound. Furthermore, we analyze the chemical (i.e. host-guest interaction) and electrical (i.e. electronic structure) property changes affected by stacking mode. The DFT results show that the host-guest interaction can be enhanced by the transition from AA to AB stacking, taking H2S gas as a case study. The electronic band structure calculation confirms that as AB stacking displacement increases, in-plane charge transport pathway is reduced while the out-of-plane charge transport pathway is maintained or even increased. These results indicate that there is a trade-off between chemical and electrical properties in accordance with the stacking mode.", "date": "2023-05-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This characteristic seeks relevance in applications related to engineering novel biological photoswitches. Using Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations and the Markov State Modeling (MSM) approach we provide the mechanism that explains the stepwise unfolding of the J\u03b1-helix. The unfolding was resolved into seven steps represented by the structurally distinguishable states distributed over the initiation and the post initiation phases. Wherein, the initiation phase occurs due to the collapse of the interaction cascade FMN-Q513-N492-L480-W491-Q479-V520-A524, the onset of the post initiation phase is marked by breaking of the hydrophobic interactions between the J\u03b1-helix and the I\u03b2-sheet. This study indicates that the displacement of N492 out of the FMN binding pocket, not necessarily requiring Q513, is essential for the initiation of the J\u03b1-helix unfolding. Rather, the structural reorientation of Q513 activates the protein to cross the hydrophobic barrier and enter the post initiation phase. Similarly, the structural deviations in N482, rather than its integral role in unfolding, could enhance the unfolding rates. Further, the MSM studies on the wild type and the Q513 mutant, provide the spatio-temporal roadmap that layout the possible pathways of structural transition between the dark and the light states of the protein. Overall, the study provides insights useful to enhance the performance of AsLOV2 based photoswitches.", "date": "2023-05-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This ought to be a prerequisite for industrial (batch or reactor) design. Objectives: The study is carried out with the objectives of deriving equations that can be explored in relating pre-zero-order (otherwise known as pre-steady-state (prss)) to zero-order kinetic parameters, such as the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM), maximum velocity of catalysis (Vmax), and specificity constant (SC), and ultimately evaluating the equations with experimental data. Methods: The study was theoretical and experimental, backed by the Bernfeld method of generating initial rates. Results and discussion: The Vmax for the higher industrial-type concentration of the enzyme (alpha-amylase) is 7812.5 micromoles/L/min, while the KM is 115.1 g/L. The SC obtained by calculation, either by the new equation (Eq. (25b)) or the ratio Vmax:KM, is 67.88 micromoles L/g min, and surprisingly, as against the literature, the SC obtained by a new graphical method is 275.4 micromoles L/g min using sub-KM values of substrate concentrations. The prss Vmax and KM are 2348.62 \u00b1 479.94 micromoles L/g min and 7.41 \u00b1 1.77 g/L. Conclusion: The need to derive an equation linking prss and the zero-order kinetic parameter is justified by the result obtained. In order to establish consistency, future studies may focus on assays at high concentrations of the enzyme and sub-KM concentrations of the substrate so as to observe a repeat of higher SC.", "date": "2023-05-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This has been driven by recent advances in small molecule force fields and sampling algorithms combined with the availability of low-cost parallel computing. Predictive accuracies of ~1 kcal mol-1 have been regularly achieved, which are sufficient to drive potency optimization in modern drug discovery campaigns. Despite the robustness of these FEP approaches across multiple target classes, there are invariably target systems that do not display expected performance with default FEP settings. Traditionally, these systems required labor-intensive manual protocol development to arrive at parameter settings that produce a predictive FEP model. Due to the a) relatively large parameter space to be explored, b) significant compute requirements, and c) limited understanding of how combinations of parameters can affect FEP performance, manual FEP protocol optimization can take weeks to months to complete, and often does not involve rigorous train-test set splits, resulting in potential overfitting. These manual FEP protocol development timelines do not coincide with tight drug discovery project timelines, essentially preventing the use of FEP calculations for these target systems. Here, we describe an automated workflow termed FEP Protocol Builder (FEP-PB) to rapidly generate accurate FEP protocols for systems that do not perform well with default settings. FEP-PB uses active learning to iteratively search the protocol parameter space to develop accurate FEP protocols. To validate this approach, we applied it to pharmaceutically relevant systems where default FEP settings could not produce predictive models. We demonstrate that FEP-PB can rapidly generate accurate FEP protocols for the previously challenging MCL1 system with limited human intervention. We also apply FEP-PB in a real-world drug discovery setting to generate an accurate FEP protocol for the p97 system. FEP-PB is able to generate a more accurate protocol than the expert user, rapidly validating p97 as amenable to free energy calculations.  Additionally, through the active learning process, we are able to gain insight into which parameters are most important for a given system. These results suggest that FEP-PB is a robust tool that can aid in rapidly developing accurate FEP protocols and increasing the number of targets that are amenable to the technology.", "date": "2023-05-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among the many strategies developed to date, palladium-catalysed asymmetric allylic alkylation is commonly used to access chiral molecules in natural product and active pharmaceutical ingredient synthesis. The use of modular Trost-type ligands and phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) ligands results in generally high stereoselectivity for a wide range of transformations. However, these reactions nearly always require relatively high catalyst loadings (5-10 mol%), reaction-specific catalyst preactivation protocols, and excess chiral ligand to ensure high yield and selectivity. Here we report the isolation and catalytic evaluation of a series of chiral palladium(0) single-component precatalysts that are active for a variety of asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions. The four Trost-type precatalysts in this work are the first characterized examples of stable, isolable Pd complexes with the diphosphines coordinated in the desired \u03ba2-P,P fashion. All of the palladium(0) complexes are stable for >12 months when stored under nitrogen, and can be handled as solids and even in solution under air for hours without decomposition.

Cross-electrophile coupling (XEC) reactions, the coupling of two different electrophiles, are of great importance in terms of the variety and availability of electrophiles compared with common nucleophiles. Among various electrophiles, phenols and aryl ethers can be particularly useful aryl electrophiles owing to their low toxicity, robustness, and availability. However, XEC of phenols and aryl ethers remains elusive because it is generally challenging to distinguish between two electrophiles and selectively obtain cross-coupling products under harsh reaction conditions that are often required for the activation of the less reactive C\u2013O bonds.

Previous work has investigated hydrogen production via partial oxidation of methane (POM) in piston reactors; however, other routes remain unexplored. This work aims to theoretically evaluate if catalytic steam methane reforming (SMR) and methane autothermal reforming (ATR) constitute promising routes for hydrogen production using piston reactor technology for typical parameters and conditions encountered in automotive internal combustion engines (ICE). Specifically, the aim is to use reactor modeling and consider process design aspects in the early stages of investigation to provide direction and justify the next research and development stages involving experimentation, while eliminating infeasible options from the further expensive analysis. The piston reactor is first modeled using a zero-dimensional thermodynamic single-zone piston model coupled with available steady-state kinetic models for these routes. This model-based analysis shows that the highly endothermic SMR reaction is not feasible at ICE conditions, leading to its elimination from further assessments and studies. Thermal coupling of an endothermic reaction with a side-exothermic reaction is a potential solution to drive thermodynamically limited endothermic reaction routes in the piston reactor. The reactor modeling revealed that operation become feasible by coupling SMR with POM in ATR-type scenarios and achieves process intensification compared to steady-state ATR reactors through a significantly higher hydrogen production per catalyst (287-fold increase) and similar methane conversion between 89% and 97% at significantly lowered intake feed temperature (reduced by 283 K). The implementation of ATR piston reactors into grey and blue hydrogen production process designs is explored to understand overall performance and economy of scale effects. The process design studies reveal that the piston reactor-based processes offer savings of approx. 20% in hydrogen production costs compared to conventional ATR processes considering identical plant sizes and natural gas prices. The hydrogen production study highlights the value of the implemented approach for quickly identifying promising directions for further detailed experimental and modeling studies during early-stage exploration.

We developed many-body GDML (mbGDML) force fields for water, acetonitrile, and methanol by training 1-, 2-, and 3-body models on only 1000 MP2/def2-TZVP calculations each.

The accumulation of lactate is associated with metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming, which has newly been suggested to involve lactylation. However, the role of secreted lactate in modulating the tumor microenvironment through lactylation remains unclear. Specifically, there are gaps in our understanding of the enzyme responsible for converting lactate to lactyl-CoA and the nature of the enzyme that performs lactylation by utilizing lactyl-CoA as a substrate. It is worth noting that there are limited papers focused on metabolite profiling that detect lactate and lactyl-CoA levels intracellularly and extracellularly in the context of cancer cells.\nMethods\nHere, we have employed an in-house developed vertical tube gel electrophoresis (VTGE) and LC-HRMS assisted profiling of extracellular metabolites of breast cancer cells treated by anticancer compositions of cow urine DMSO fraction (CUDF) that was reported previously. Furthermore, we used molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the potential enzyme that can convert lactate to lactyl-CoA. Next, the histone acetyltransferase p300 (HAT p300) enzyme (PDB ID: 6GYR) was evaluated as a potential enzyme that can bind to lactyl-CoA during the lactylation process. \nResults\nWe collected evidence on the secretion of lactate in the extracellular conditioned medium of breast cancer cells treated by anticancer compositions. MD simulations data projected that acetyl-CoA synthetase could be a potential enzyme that may convert lactate into lactyl-CoA similar to a known substrate acetate. Furthermore, a specific and efficient binding (docking energy -9.6 kcal/mol) of lactyl-CoA with p300 HAT suggested that lactyl-CoA may serve as a substrate for lactylation similar to acetylation that uses acetyl-CoA as a substrate. \nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our data provide a hint on the missing link for the lactylation process due to lactate in terms of a potential enzyme that can convert lactate into lactyl-CoA. This study helped us to project the HAT p300 enzyme that may use lactyl-CoA as a substrate in the lactylation process of the tumor microenvironment. \n", "date": "2023-05-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, despite many years of investigation, its net impact on the atmospheric Hg budget remains insufficiently constrained, in part because the transformations of Hg in volcanic plumes as they age and mix with background air are poorly understood. Here we report the observation of complete gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) depletion events in dilute and moderately aged (~3-7 hours) volcanic plumes from Piton de la Fournaise on R\u00e9union Island. While it has been suggested that co-emitted bromine could, once photochemically activated, deplete GEM in a volcanic plume, we measured low bromine concentrations in both the gas- and particle phase and observed complete GEM depletion even before sunrise, ruling out a leading role of bromine chemistry here. Instead, we hypothesize that the GEM depletions were mainly caused by gas-particle interactions with sulfate-rich volcanic particles (mostly of submicron size), abundantly present in the dilute plume. We consider heterogeneous GEM oxidation and GEM uptake by particles as plausible manifestations of such a process and derive empirical rate constants. By extrapolation, we estimate that volcanic aerosols may scavenge 210 Mg y-1 (67 \u2013 480 Mg y-1) of Hg from the atmosphere globally, acting effectively as atmospheric mercury sink.

Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) is used to deposit metal thin films in high-aspect ratio structures of vias and trenches in nanoelectronic devices. At the initial stage of deposition, the surface reactions between the precursors and the starting substrate are vital to understand nucleation of the film and optimize the deposition process through minimising so-called nucleation delay in which film growth is only observed after tens to hundreds of ALD cycles. The reported incubation period (or nucleation delay) of Ru ranges from 10 ALD cycles to 500 ALD cycles and the growth-per-cycle (GPC) varies from report to report. No systematic studies on nucleation day of Co PE-ALD were found in the literature. In this study, we use first principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate the reactions between the precursors RuCp2 and CoCp2 with Si substrates that have different surface terminations to reveal the atomic scale reaction mechanism at the initial stages of metal nucleation. The substrates include (1) H:Si(100), (2) NHx-terminated Si(100), (3) H:SiNx/Si(100). Ligand exchange reaction via H transfer to form CpH on H:Si(100), NHx-terminated Si(100) and H:SiNx/Si(100) surfaces is simulated and shows that pre-treatment with N2/H2 plasma to yield an NHx-terminated Si surface from H:Si(100) can promote the ligand exchange reaction to eliminate Cp ligand for CoCp2. Our DFT results show that the surface reactivity of CoCp2 is highly dependent on substrate surface terminations, which explains why the reported incubation period and GPC vary from report to report. This difference in reactivity at different surface terminations may be useful for selective deposition. For Ru deposition, RuCp2 is not a useful precursor, showing highly endothermic ligand elimination reactions on all studied terminations.

Although TENG has versatile applications in energy harvesting and self-powered sensing, its commercialization is still limited by the low power output. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their large surface area and excellent tunability, have been explored to enhance the electrical performance of TENG. Herein, we synthesized nanoparticles of hydrophobic zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-71 (RHO topology) and its non-porous counterpart ZIF-72 (LCS topology), which were subsequently incorporated in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix as filler materials. By modifying the topology of ZIF nanofillers, we found the dielectric constant and surface adhesion of composites are both enhanced, thereby generating significantly higher triboelectric output. Moreover, we show the resultant ZIF/PDMS nanocomposite films exhibit enhanced triboelectric properties and long-term stability under cyclic mechanical loading. After integrating the prepared nanocomposite films into TENG devices, we accomplished the peak output voltage and current of 578 V and 19 \u03bcA for thin films (3\u00d73 cm2, thickness ~0.33 mm), respectively, by embedding 1 wt% of ZIF-72 nanoparticles into PDMS matrix, with an instantaneous maximum power density of ~5 W m-2. In this study, the mechanism of improved TENG performance by incorporating MOF nanoparticles has, for the first time, been revealed through nanoscale-resolved mechanical and chemical studies. Furthermore, the practicality of MOF-based TENG was demonstrated by harvesting energy from oscillatory motions, for powering up commercial microelectronics, transmitting electrical signals remotely, and functioning as a self-powered Morse code generator.

The use of macrocyclic molecular containers as supramolecular protecting units is in this context a promising strategy.  We report here on a hexahomotrioxacalix[3]arene molecular container whose exceptional binding properties opens new directions for the supramolecular protection strategy. This macrocyclic receptor binds primary ammonium ions with high selectivity and affinity, allowing for the monofunctionalization of diamines. The reaction was readily achieved with various diamines and different types of reagents. The acid-base control of the protection/deprotection of the substrate furthermore allowed for the recovery and recycling of the molecular container and the subsequent in-situ accumulation of non-symmetric difunctionalized products, with remarkably no loss of selectivity over the reaction cycles. This recycling strategy considerably increases the synthetic viability of the supramolecular approach with only a catalytic amount of molecular container needed. The synthesis of products, such as non-symmetric diamino-diureas, which are difficult to obtain via classical synthetic routes, was also achieved through the one-pot reaction of mixtures of difunctional substrates monoprotected by the molecular container. The supramolecular protection strategy was finally extended to the selective functionalization of more complex polyamines such as a triamine and a lysine derivative. These results show that the use of a supramolecular protecting container for the functionalization of polyfunctional substrates presents many synthetic advantages over strategies using traditional protecting groups: i) it enables high chemo-, regio- and iteroselectivities through a one-pot protection/functionalization/deprotection sequence, ii) it avoids the introduction and removal of covalently linked protecting groups thus leading to high yield , iii) it allows the formation of unstable intermediates and the control of their reactivity, iv) it gives access to complex polyfunctional products whose synthesis remains challenging through classical synthetic methods.", "date": "2023-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The preparation of such electrocatalysts remains a great challenge because they are difficult to obtain a high energy input due to the limitations of kinetically sluggish anodic half-cell reaction. Herein, we develop a novel metal- and pyrolysis-free ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheet (termed JUC-627-NS) and explore its application as an efficient OER electrocatalyst for the first time. Remarkably, the samples combined with JUC-627-NS and graphene can obtain an ultralow overpotential (275 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2), which is one of the best among metal- and pyrolysis-free electrocatalysts reported so far. Combining theoretical calculations and in-situ infrared spectroscopy, it is proved that the imidazolium salt moiety is the active center of the electrocatalyst, and the strong cation-\u03c0 interaction in the complex greatly promotes the reactivity. These results therefore provide a new strategy for designing ionic COF nanosheets as efficient metal-free OER electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage devices.", "date": "2023-05-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In accordance with experimental reports, we find evidence for a double proton transfer induced order-to-disorder transition that is sensitive to the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. Our simulations show that in addition to the presence of L and R tautomers of terepthalic acid, there are a small but non negligible concentration of positive and negatively charged pairs of TPA molecules. At the onset of the transition at low temperatures, DPT likely occurs through a tunnelling mechanism while at room temperature, likely involves the dominance of  activated hopping.

Here, we expand the Nile Red (NR) staining approach often used to visualize microplastics to the quantification of nanoplastics. Using NR staining for nanoplastic quantification is largely unexplored due to the formation of fluorescent NR aggregates which cause false positive counts in single particle counting. Here, we study the number and size of the NR aggregates formed as a function of NR concentration and show that with decreasing NR concentration, the number and size of the NR aggregates drop. At nanomolar concentrations, the number of NR aggregates is low, while staining of nanoplastics at these concentrations still results in signals that are sufficiently bright for single particle detection. To challenge and verify our ap-proach, we spiked a drinking water sample with known amounts of nanoplastics. After quantifica-tion of the total amount of NR positive particles and considering NR aggregates and the added amounts of nanoplastics, we find a stable number of NR positive particles for the drinking water sample, thus verifying our approach. To demonstrate the direct applicability of our method, with-out any pre-analytical treatment, we determined the number of NR positive particles in different drinking water samples. In water obtained from plastic bottles and plastic-lined cartons, we detect-ed approximately 250 particles/nL, which is well above the level of detection of our method. In tap water, we found approximately 10 times fewer NR positive nanoparticles. Our study demonstrates that staining at nM NR concentrations combined with a careful characterization of the number of NR aggregates in solution allows for using single-particle counting for nanoplastic quantification in water samples.

Zwitterionic polymers are considered as an attractive alternative to polyethylene glycol because of their enhanced biocompatibility and effectiveness to prevent non-specific protein adsorption and formation of biofilms. To this end, zwitterionic polymers are classified in two categories, namely polybetaines and polyampholytes. Yet, despite a fundamental interest to drive the development of new antifouling materials, the chemical composition of zwitterionic polymer remains severely limited. Here, we propose an entirely new class of antifouling polymers, namely poly(sulfur ylides) belonging to the largely overlooked class of poly(ylides). We show that poly(sulfur ylides) effectively prevent the adhesion of biomolecules and formation of biofilms from pathogenic bacteria. While surface energy analysis reveals strong hydrogen-bond acceptor capabilities of poly(sulfur ylide) and suggests a repellent hydration barrier, membrane damage of pathogenic bacteria induced by poly(sulfur ylides) indicates a killing-by-contact mechanism. Such synergistic effect of poly(sulfur ylides) offers distinct advantages over polyethylene glycol when designing antifouling materials in the future.

Gasification is a promising conversion technology that can transform biomass into multiple energy carriers to produce heat, electricity, biofuels, or chemicals. At present, identifying the best gasification route for a given biomass relies on trial and error, time-consuming experimentation that, given the wide range of biomass feedstocks available, slows down the deployment of the technology. Here we develop a supervised machine-learning model to find the optimal application of a particular biomass in gasification processes. Our model can select the suitable gasification pathway from the characteristics of the biomass, and also identify the optimal operating conditions for a selected application of the produced gas. In addition, with this model, we can obtain insights into the relationships between biomass properties and gasification results, leading to a better understanding of the process. A relevant aspect of this work is that these results rely on a relatively small dataset, representative of those typically collected by research groups using different types of gasifiers worldwide. This study opens the path for future integration of such data, which would allow addressing the complexity of biomass and conversion process simultaneously.

Unfortunately, AIMDEF simulations come with a very large computational expense that severely limits statistics and propagation times. To keep ab-initio accuracy and allow for better statistical sampling, we have developed a neural network interatomic potential of hydrogen on the Ru(0001) surface based on data from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations of recombinative desorption. Using this potential we simulated femtosecond laser-induced recombinative desorption using varying unit cells, coverages, laser fluences, and isotope ratios with reliable statistics. As a result, we can systematically study a wide range of these parameters and follow dynamics over longer times than hitherto possible, demonstrating that our methodology is a promising way to realistically simulate femtosecond laser-induced dynamics of molecules on metals.

The critical plastic burdens of baseline (n=115), less-inert (n=73), and reactive (n=75) toxicants ranged from 0.17-51.33, 0.04-26.62, and 1.00 \u00d7 10^-6 - 6.78 \u00d7 10^-4 mmol/kg of plastic, respectively. While critical plastic burdens were also estimated for other plastic phases, such as polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), the findings were less reliable due to a lack of experimental data. Our study showed that PDMS, PA, POM, PE, and PU are similar to biomembranes in mimicking the exchange of chemicals with the water phase. Using the TPM, median lethal concentration (LC50) values for fish exposed to baseline toxicants were predicted, and the results agreed with experimental values, with RMSE ranging from 0.311-0.538 log unit. For less inert chemicals, predictions were within a factor of 5 of experimental values. The TPM's performance was comparable to other widely used models, such as the TLM, ECOSAR, and Abraham Solvation Model. However, like other models, TPM was not effective in predicting the toxicities of reactive toxicants, with RMSE exceeding 1 log unit. TPM can provide valuable insights into the toxicities of chemicals associated with environmental plastic phases, assisting in selecting the best polymeric phase for passive sampling and designing better passive dosing techniques for toxicity experiments.

Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) is an NMR hyperpolarization technique where light is used to excite a suitable donor\u2013acceptor system, creating a spin-correlated radical pair whose evolution drives nuclear hy-perpolarization. Systems that exhibit photo-CIDNP in solids are not common and this effect has, up to now, only been observed for 13C and 15N nuclei. However, the low gyromagnetic ratio and natural abundance of these nuclei trap the local hyperpolarization in the vicinity of the chromophore and limit the utility for bulk hyperpolarization. Here we report the first example of optically enhanced solid-state 1H NMR spectroscopy in the high-field regime. This is achieved via photo-CIDNP of a donor\u2013chromophore\u2013acceptor molecule in a frozen solution at 0.3 T and 85 K, where spontaneous spin diffusion among the abundant strongly coupled 1H nuclei relays polarization through the whole sample, yielding a 16-fold bulk 1H signal enhancement under continuous laser irradiation at 450 nm. These findings enable a new strategy for hyperpolarized NMR beyond the current limits of conventional microwave-driven DNP.

Our results show that the non-polarizable force fields lead to compact and stable complexes. The polarizability in the force field or in the water model allows significantly more movement from the complex, but in some cases, this results in the disintegration of the complex structure, especially if the protein contains longer loop regions. Thus, one should be cautious when running long-scale simulations with polarizability.

These challenges include solid-solid interfaces that are highly resistive, with slow kinetics, and a tendency to form interfacial voids leading to delamination which results in diminished cycle life.  This modelling study probes the evolution of stresses at the solid electrolyte (SE) solid-solid interfaces, by linking the chemical and mechanical material properties to their electrochemical response, which can be used as a guide to optimise the design and manufacture of silicon (Si) based SSBs. A thin-film solid-state battery consisting of an amorphous Si negative electrode (NE) is studied, which exerts compressive stress on the SE, caused by the lithiation-induced expansion of the Si. By using a 2D chemo-mechanical model, continuum scale simulations are used to probe the effect of applied pressure and C-rate on the stress-strain response of the cell and their impacts on the overall cell capacity. A complex concentration gradient is generated within the Si electrode due to slow diffusion of Li through Si which leads to localised strains. To reduce the interfacial stress and strain at 100% SOC, operation at moderate C-rates with low applied pressure are desirable. Alternatively, the mechanical properties of the SE could be tailored to optimise cell performance. To reduce Si stress, a SE with a moderate Young\u2019s modulus similar to that of lithium phosphorous oxynitride (~ 77 GPa) with a low yield strength comparable to sulfides (~ 0.67 GPa) should be selected. However, if the reduction in SE stress is of greater concern, then a compliant Young\u2019s modulus (~ 29 GPa) with a moderate yield strength (1-3 GPa) should be targeted. This study emphasises the need for SE material selection and to consider other cell components in order to optimise the performance of thin film solid-state batteries.

Computationally predicted T1/2 values are consistent among the three functionals but show limited correlation to experimentally reported T1/2 values.

Once they have been recovered from the vehicle, large-format pouch cells are challenging to characterise, measure their internal structure and determine state-of-health (SoH). Here, large-format (261 x 216 x 7.91 mm) Nissan Leaf cells are harvested from an EV and four complementary non-destructive techniques are used to distinguish the ageing of cells arranged in varying orientations and locations within the pack. The measurement suite includes infrared thermography, ultrasonic mapping, X-ray computed tomography, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and represents a unique combination of characterisation techniques.

The influence of orientation and location of the cells is significant, with the rotated/vertically aligned cells differing significantly from the flat/horizontally aligned cells in mode and degree of ageing.

In this work, we employed density functional theory calculations to study the selectivity of this anthracene sensor in the detection of Zn2+ in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+. DFT results indicate that the selectivity of the sensor on Zn2+ detection over the cations Ca2+, Mg2+, and Hg2+ due to the binding selectivity as Zn2+ binds favorably to the sensor while Ca2+, Mg2+, and Hg2+  are no binding. Although Cu2+ binds to the sensor stronger than Zn2+, the chelated sensor by Cu2+  reduces the UV-Vis absorption at the free sensor wavelength by 10 times and the fluorescence pathway is also enhanced by the chelation, thus resulting response selectivity of Zn2+  over Cu2+ . Therefore, the present DFT study shows that the sensor selectivity on Zn 2+ detection in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ is due to a combination of binding selectivity and response selectivity.", "date": "2023-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Through competition experiments in which the catalytic activity of Au was monitored as a function of the ratio of the organic to metal cation, we identify regimes in which the organic cation exclusively controls CO2 reduction selectivity and activity. We observe substantial CO production in this regime, suggesting that CO2 reduction catalysis can occur in the absence of Lewis acidic cations and thus, coordinative interactions between the electrolyte cations and surface-bound intermediates are not required for CO2 activation. For both Au and Ag, we find that tetraalkylammonium cations support catalytic activity for CO2 reduction on par with alkali metal cations, but with distinct cation activity trends between Au and Ag.

However, the recently released multi-billion-scale libraries are too challenging to screen even for the fastest structure-based docking methods. Here, we introduce a strategy that combines machine learning and molecular docking to enable rapid virtual screening of databases containing billions of compounds. In our workflow, a classification algorithm is first trained to identify top-scoring compounds based on molecular docking of one million compounds to the target protein. The conformal prediction framework is then used to make selections from the multi-billion-scale library, drastically reducing the number of compounds to be scored by the docking algorithm. The performance of the approach was benchmarked on a set of eight different target proteins, and classifiers based on gradient boosting, deep neural network, and transformer architectures were evaluated. The CatBoost classifier exhibited the optimal balance between speed and accuracy and was used to adapt the workflow for screens of ultralarge libraries. The optimized workflow was demonstrated to identify >90% of the very top-scoring molecules in a library with 0.2 billion compounds, which only required docking of 3-5% of this set. Application to a library with >3.5 billion compounds showed that molecules with substantially improved docking scores can be identified by machine learning, enabling efficient virtual screening of the largest commercial chemical libraries available.

Here, we controlled the carboxylic acid layer formation conditions on calcite surfaces with high precision via vapour deposition. The properties of the resulting carboxylic acid layers were analyzed using surface sensitive techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle measurements, angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and vibrational sum-frequency spectroscopy. A low wettability was achieved with long hydrocarbon chain carboxylic acids, such as stearic acid. The stearic acid layer formed by vapour deposition is initially patchy, but with increasing vapour exposure time, the patches grow and condense into a homogeneous layer with a thickness close to that expected for a monolayer as evaluated by AFM and XPS. The build-up process of the layer occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures due to the higher vapour pressure. The stability of the deposited fatty acid layer in the presence of a water droplet increases with chain length and packing density in the adsorbed layer. Vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy data demonstrate that the stearic acid monolayers on calcite have their alkyl chains in an all-trans conformation and are anisotropically distributed on the plane of the surface, forming epitaxial monolayers. The vibrational spectra also show that the stearic acid molecules interact with the calcite surface through the carboxylic acid headgroup in both its protonated and deprotonated forms. The results presented provide new molecular insights into the properties of adsorbed carboxylic acid layers on calcite.

Furthermore, these methods are typically designed for single tasks, such as predicting gas adsorption capacity under specific conditions, which restricts the utilization of comprehensive datasets including all adsorption capacities. To address these challenges, we propose Uni-MOF, an innovative framework for large-scale, three-dimensional MOF representation learning, designed for universal multi-gas prediction. Specifically, Uni-MOF serves as a versatile \"gas adsorption detector\" for MOF materials, employing pure three-dimensional representations learned from over 631,000 collected MOF and COF structures. Our experimental results show that Uni-MOF can automatically extract structural representations and predict adsorption capacities under various operating conditions using a single model. For simulated data, Uni-MOF exhibits remarkably high predictive accuracy across all datasets. Impressively, the values predicted by Uni-MOF correspond with the outcomes of adsorption experiments.

Herein, we report a new class of organic materials that show photochromism and photomagnetism at room temperature due to the generation of free radicals in the solid-state. 1,4-bis(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzene (BDPI) was found to acts as organic photomagnet without use of any traditional photochromic couplers or radical containing moieties. Solvent molecules (eg. water and DMSO) form hydrogen bonds with the imidazole rings which act as binding glue in stacking of 1,4-bis(imidazolyl)benzene moieties via \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions.

The sharp signal indicates formation of\nparamagnetic free radicals which influence antiferromagnetic exchange interactions with weakening of the magnetic susceptibility significantly.

A hybrid HPLC-MS approach was employed for the characterization of r-hCG, u-hCG and r-hFSH drug products at different structural levels.

In this overview, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the field of organic mechanochemistry. After a brief discussion of the basics of high-resolution solid-state NMR under magic-angle spinning (MAS) conditions, we present seven opportunities for solid-state NMR in the field of organic mechanochemistry, ranging from ex-situ approaches to structurally elucidate reaction products obtained by milling to the potential and limitations of in-situ solid-state NMR approaches. Particular strengths of solid-state NMR, for instance in differentiating polymorphs, in NMR-crystallographic structure-determination protocols, or in detecting weak noncovalent interactions in molecular-recognition events employing proton-detected solid-state NMR experiments at fast MAS frequencies, are discussed.", "date": "2023-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The resulting dependence on (absolute) electrode potential can be pivotal to a catalyst's performance in acid or alkaline media. And yet, such local field effects are very difficult to describe theoretically and are often ignored. In this work, we focus on O2 adsorption as the first step of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Au(111). Different physical effects of the local field are elucidated and compared by systematically improving the model of the double layer: from an applied saw-tooth potential in vacuum, to an implicit solvent model, and explicitly modeled water via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). We find all models predict a dominant dipole-field type interaction that significantly strengthens O2 binding at increasingly reducing conditions. However, only an atomically-resolved solvent model such as provided by AIMD can properly capture the additional stabilization due to explicit H-bonding from the water network. This contribution comes with the formation of a peroxo-like surface species and a more dramatic field response around the ORR onset. Our results overall demonstrate the importance of including local electric field effects in models of the electrochemical interface, while assessing the level of detail that is required to be accounted for.", "date": "2023-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The NP core size was held constant, and the NPs were functionalized with mixtures of long polymeric ligands (either 1 or 2 kDa PEGSH) and short oligomeric ligands (254 Da PEGSH). The ratio of short and long ligands was varied such that the grafting density of the high molecular weight (MW) ligand ranged from approximately 1-100 high MW ligands/NP. The diffusion coefficients of the NPs were then measured in gels with varying mesh sizes. The measured diffusion coefficients decreased with increasing high MW ligand density. Interestingly, the diffusion coefficients for NPs with high effective grafting densities were well-predicted by their hydrodynamic diameters, but the diffusion coefficients for NPs with low effective grafting densities were higher than expected from their hydrodynamic diameters. These results suggest that crowding in the NP ligand shell influences the mechanism of diffusion, with lower grafting densities allowing ligand chain relaxations that facilitate movement through the gel.

These calculations require restraints between the receptor and ligand to restrict their relative positions and, optionally, orientations. Boresch restraints are commonly used, but they must be carefully selected in order to sufficiently restrain the ligand and to avoid inherent instabilities. Applying multiple distance restraints between anchor points in the receptor and ligand provides an alternative framework without inherent instabilities which may provide convergence benefits by more strongly restricting the relative movements of the receptor and ligand. However, there is no simple method to calculate the free energy of releasing these restraints due to the coupling of the internal and external degrees of freedom of the receptor and ligand. Here, a method to rigorously calculate free energies of binding with multiple distance restraints by imposing intramolecular restraints on the anchor points is proposed. Ab- solute binding free energies for the human macrophage migration inhibitory factor - MIF180 system obtained using a variety of Boresch restraints and rigorous and non- rigorous implementations of multiple distance restraints are compared. It is shown that several multiple distance restraints schemes produce estimates in good agreement with Boresch restraints. In contrast, calculations without orientational restraints produce erroneously favourable free energies of binding by up to approximately 4 kcal mol\u22121.

In these previous studies, the data acquisition rate had been limited by the time it took to record an EEM, i.e. to complete one cycle of multiplexed excitation spectra. The extraction of chemical information, such as concentration and chemical identity, is then obtained from parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of the sequence of EEM spectra.\nIn this contribution we increase the data acquisition rate by another order of magnitude, i.e. to the time it takes to record a single excitation spectrum.

However, its vanishing band gap limits the use of graphene in microelectronics. Covalent functionalization of graphene has been a common approach to address this critical issue and introduce a band gap. In this paper, we systematically analyze the functionalization of single-layer graphene (SLG) and bilayer graphene (BLG) with methyl (CH3), using periodic density functional theory (DFT) at the PBE+D3 level of theory. We also include a comparison of methylated single-layer and bilayer graphene, as well as a discussion of different methylation options (radicalic, cationic and anionic). For SLG, methyl coverages ranging from 1/8 to 1/1, (i.e., the fully methylated analog of graphane) are considered. We find that up to a coverage \u03b8 of 1/2, graphene readily accepts CH3, with neighbour CH3 groups prefering trans positions. Above \u03b8 = 1/2, the tendency to accept further CH3 weakens and the lattice constant increases. The band gap behaves less regular, but overall, it increases with increasing methyl coverage. Thus, methylated graphene shows potential for developing band gap-tuned microelectronics devices and may offer further functionalization options. To guide in the interpretation of methylation experiments, vibrational signatures of various species are characterized by normal mode analysis (NMA), their vibrational density of states (VDOS), and infrared (IR) spectra, the latter two obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) in combination with a velocity-velocity autocorrelation function (VVAF) approach.", "date": "2023-05-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Empirically, the protonation state of DMAP and how this protonation state is changed with adsorption on a solid surface, is known to play a crucial role in many of these applications.  However, the direct spectroscopic evidence for bias dependent DMAP (de)protonation at solid/aqueous interfaces is still very limited. Here, we employed surface specific vibrational sum frequency (VSF) spectroscopy to study the (de)protonation process of DMAP(H$^{+}$) on a polycrystalline gold electrode at neutral pH. Because VSF is interface specific by its symmetry selection rules, its application allows us to distinguish adsorbed molecules from those close to, but not at, the interface and identify their speciation and orientation with respect to the surface normal. We find that the potential-induced (de)protonation of flat-lying DMAPH$^{+}$ molecules occurs at relatively low potentials but that both species adsorb horizontally on the surface. A horizontal to vertical phase transition occurs only at more positive biases.

These reactions can be driven by outer-sphere electron transfer to a soluble molecule (OS-PCET) or through an inner-sphere mechanism by interfacial polarization of a surface-bound active site (I-PCET). The pH-dependent kinetics of OS-PCET have been extensively studied at the molecular level, but the inherent heterogeneity of most surfaces has impeded molecular-level understanding of I-PCET. Herein, we employ graphite conjugated carboxylic acids (GC COOH) as molecularly well-defined hosts of I-PCET to isolate the intrinsic pH dependent kinetics of this reaction. Using variable scan rate voltammetry, we measure the rates of I-PCET across the entire pH range and find a pronounced \u201cV\u201d-shaped dependence on pH with a rate minimum at pH 10 that rises log-linearly to pH 0 and pH 14. This kinetic profile spans three orders of magnitude in rate and lacks the pH-independent regions characteristic of electrochemical OS-PCET reactions. To explain these trends, we develop a mechanistic model for I PCET that invokes CPET involving hydronium/water or water/hydroxide donor-acceptor pairs. This relatively simple model captures the entire data set with only four adjustable parameters corresponding to the standard rate constants and charge transfer coefficients of the two donor/acceptor couples. From this analysis, we find that I PCET with water/hydroxide is four-fold more sluggish than with hydronium/water, but both reactions display similar charge transfer coefficients near 0.7, indicating a late transition state. These studies highlight the key mechanistic and kinetic distinctions between OS PCET and I-PCET and provide a baseline framework for understanding and modeling more complex I PCET reactions critical to energy conversion and catalysis.

The other model, a Projection-based Embedding (PbE) using the Huzinaga equation includes both electrostatic and Pauli repulsion and only needs to be augmented by dispersion interactions. In both schemes the extended Effective Fragment Potential (EFP2) method of Gordon et al. was found to provide an adequate correction for the missing terms. \n\nIn the second step, the interaction of the localized chromophores is modeled for a proper description of the excitonic coupling.

By performing ensembles of ten or twelve 10-microsecond simulations for each system, we accurately and reproducibly determine ligand binding sites, both crystallographically resolved and otherwise, thereby discovering binding sites that can be exploited for drug discovery. We also report robust, ensemble-based observation of conformational changes that occur at the main binding site of 3CLPro due to the presence of another ligand at an allosteric binding site explaining the underlying cascade of events responsible for its inhibitory effect. Using our simulations, we have discovered a novel allosteric mechanism of inhibition for a ligand known to bind only at the substrate binding site. Due to the chaotic nature of molecular dynamics trajectories, individual trajectories do not allow for accurate or reproducible elucidation of macroscopic expectation values. Unprecedentedly at this timescale, we compare the statistical distribution of protein-ligand contact frequencies for these ten/twelve 10-microsecond trajectories and find that over 90% of trajectories have significantly different contact frequency distributions. Furthermore, using a direct binding free energy calculation protocol, we determine the ligand binding free energies for each of the identified sites using long-timescale simulations. The free energies differ by 0.77 to 7.26 kcal/mol across individual trajectories depending on the binding site and the system. We show that although this is the standard way such quantities are currently reported at long-timescale, individual simulations do not yield reliable free energies. Ensembles of independent trajectories are necessary to overcome the aleatoric uncertainty in order to obtain statistically meaningful and reproducible results.

Prior research has successfully used natural lipid extracts in nanodiscs that more accurately mimic natural environments, but it is not clear how nanodisc assembly may bias the incorporated lipid profiles. Here, we applied lipidomics to investigate how nanodisc assembly conditions affect the profile of natural lipids in nanodiscs. Specifically, we tested the effects of assembly temperature, nanodisc size, and lipidome extract complexity. Globally, our analysis demonstrates that the lipids profiles are largely unaffected by nanodisc assembly conditions. However, a few notable changes emerged within individual lipids and lipid classes, such as a differential incorporation of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol lipids from the E. coli polar lipid extract at different temperatures.

But in many cases, it impedes the mass transfer and diffusion of precursors toward noble metal NCs, thus resulting in suboptimal catalytic performance and inefficient use of the noble metal catalysts. Integration of noble metal NCs in a hollow MOF shell could address this concern. Herein, by using ZIF-67 as self-sacrificial template, we reported a simple strategy for synthesizing Pd@Hollow ZIF-67. Pre-formed Pd NCs are uniformly confined within a hollow ZIF-67 shell through the dissolution of the interior of a ZIF-67 sacrificial template and re-growth of a new ZIF-67 shell due to the competitive coordination of chloride ligands to cobalt ions in ethanol. This method can be easily extended to fabricate other hollow hybrid materials including Au@Hollow ZIF-67, Pt@Hollow ZIF-67 and sandwich Pd@Hollow ZIF-67.

The study provides detailed, quantitative results about the changes in the morphology and chemical structure (oxidation state) of the catalyst particles as a function of applied electrode potentials. The initially electrochemically deposited Cu particles contain both Cu(0) and Cu(I). As an increasingly cathodic potential is applied, the Cu(I) species gradually converted to Cu(0) over the potential range of +0.4 to 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). During this process, Cu(I) particles of various sizes are converted to metallic Cu at different reaction rates and at slightly different electrode potentials, indicating a degree of heterogeneity in the electrochemical response of discrete particles. At CO2R relevant potentials, only metallic Cu is observed, and the morphology of the particles is fairly stable within the spatial resolution limits of STXM (~ 40 nm). We also prepared a working electrode with relatively thick Cu-based electro-deposits. The spatially resolved chemical analysis by STXM identified that Cu-oxide species can persist under CO2R conditions, but only when the catalyst particles are electronically isolated from the working electrode and therefore are catalytically irrelevant.

Overall, initial structure-activity relationships could be inferred which point towards the influence of the extension of the aromatic N^N ligand in the cationic complexes 1-3 on the TH in both reduction/oxidation processes. The neutral complex 4, featuring a picolinamidate N^N ligand, stands out as the most active catalyst for the reduction of NAD+, while being completely inactive towards NADH oxidation. The compound can also convert pyruvate into lactate in the presence of formate, albeit with scarce efficiency. In any case, for all compounds, Ru(II) hydride intermediates could be observed and even isolated in the case of complexes 1-3. Together, insight from the kinetic and electrochemical characterization suggests that, in the case of Ru(II) complexes 1-3, catalytic NADH oxidation sees the H-transfer from 1,4-NADH as the rate limiting step, whereas for NAD+ hydrogenation with formate as the H-donor, the rate limiting step is the transfer of the ruthenium hydride to the NAD+ substrate. The latter is further modulated by the presence of di-cationic aquo- or mono-cationic hydroxo-species of complexes 1-3. Instead, compound 4, stable with respect to hydrolysis in aqueous solution, appears to operate via a different mechanism. Finally, the anticancer activity and ability to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) of complexes 1-3 have been studied in cancerous and non-tumorigenic cells in vitro. Noteworthy, the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols could be achieved by the three Ru(II) catalysts in living cells, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, the formation of Ru(II) hydride intermediate upon treatment of cancer cell extracts with complex 3 has been detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Overall, this study paves the way to the application of non-arene based organometallic complexes as TH catalysts in biological environment.", "date": "2023-05-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Compounds; Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In the present work we propose a method to  design ANN models for kinetic modelling that can be trained even with small data sets as are typically available. The key idea is to constrain the architecture of the ANN models by integrating kinetic and thermodynamic knowledge leading to what we call Kinetics-Constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (KCNODE). The feasibility and effectiveness of the approach is first demonstrated in a numerical experiment using the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methane as example. Next, we demonstrate the approach for real experimental data of a more complex reaction, the hydrogenation of CO2 to higher hydrocarbons (CO2-FT). Finally, the ANN trained for CO2-FT is used to derive an improved mechanistic model for the reverse water gas shift reaction which is a key reaction in the CO2-FT reaction network. This last step exemplifies how the opportunity to obtain reliable ANN models from small data opens new ways to approach kinetic model development.", "date": "2023-05-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Reaction Engineering; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Ultralow IFTs are beneficial towards separating emulsions and could be beneficial in the separation of bitumen emulsions.  Two possible reasons for the lack of ultralow IFTs with neutralized NAs were explored.

Dynamic IFT and pH studies suggest that adsorption and neutralization of NA proceed as predicted by the stoichiometry of the reaction.

Considering these important advancements, we sought to study the relationships between the architecture of the amphiphiles and the reactivity of their PdII loaded micellar nanoreactors in conducting depropargylation. Towards this goal, we designed and synthesized a series of isomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dendron amphiphiles with different dendritic architectures but with identical degree of hydrophobicity and hydrophilic to lipophilic balance (HLB). We observed that the dendritic architecture, which serves as the main binding site for the PdII ions, has\ngreater influence on the reactivity than the hydrophobicity of the dendron. These trends remained constant for two different propargyl containing substrates, highlighting the robustness of the obtained results. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of simplified models of the dendritic blocks revealed the different binding modes of the various dendritic architectures to PdII ions, which could explain the difference in the reactivity of the nanoreactors in this study. Our results show how tuning the internal architecture of amphiphiles and the resulting orientation of the chelating moieties can play a major role in controlling the reactivity of the nanoreactors.", "date": "2023-05-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Organic Polymers; Polymer morphology; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While naphthenic acids (NAs) are oil-soluble lipophilic amphiphiles, their neutralized form, sodium naphthenates (NaNs), has highly hydrophilic components. The right NA/NaN proportion should produce a balanced, net-zero curvature at the oil-water interface, leading to ultra-low interfacial tensions (IFTs<0.1 mN/m). A previous study showed that such an expectation is not achievable in model oil systems with NA and NaN, likely because of the partition of NA and NaN species. This work explores the hypothesis that it is possible to achieve ultralow IFTs using surfactants with balanced hydrophilic-lipophilic interactions that can trigger a \"zipper-like\" self-assembly of hydrophilic and lipophilic amphiphiles at the interface. A second hypothesis is that by producing these ultralow IFTs one can achieve fast dewatering of emulsions of oil containing partially neutralized NAs. After introducing sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate (SDHS) and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (Aerosol OT or AOT) as balanced surfactants, it was noted that one could produce ultralow IFTs in partially neutralized NAs. Using the hydrophilic-lipophilic difference (HLD) and net-average curvature (NAC) framework, it was possible to reproduce the experimental trends when using appropriate values for the critical micelle concentration (CMC) for NaN and SDHS. The best zipper assembly performance was obtained when the intrinsic HLD of the balanced surfactant is near zero. Under those conditions, it was possible to find ultralow IFTs and fast dewatering of emulsions with NA content and pH relevant to diluted bitumen emulsions obtained during naphthenic froth treatment.", "date": "2023-05-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Natural Resource Recovery; Interfaces; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

While some common intracellular ACCs have been well-documented, identifying common extracellular ACCs, including those in the ligand binding pocket, is complicated by local adjustments to different ligand scaffolds. Our analysis shows no common ACCs at the extracellular ends of the transmembrane helices. Furthermore, the restricted access to the ligand binding pocket identified previously in some receptors is not universal. Notably, the Trp6.48 toggle switch and the Pro5.50-Ile3.40-Phe6.44 (PIF) motif at the bottom of the ligand binding pocket have previously been proposed to mediate the conformational consequences of ligand binding to the intracellular side of the receptors. Our analysis shows that common ACCs in the ligand binding pocket are associated with the PIF motif and nearby residues, including Trp6.48, but fails to support a shared rotamer toggle associated with activation. However, we identify two common rearrangements between the extracellular and middle subsegments, and propose a novel \u201cactivation switch\u201d motif common to all aminergic receptors.

Here, we present a combined polarized Raman and molecular dynamics investigation of the structural changes that occur as water is added incrementally to propylene carbonate (PC), a polar, aprotic solvent that is important in lithium-ion batteries. Polarized Raman spectra of PC solutions were collected for water mole fractions from 0.003 to 0.296, which encompasses the solubility range of water in PC. Analysis of the polarized carbonyl Raman band in conjunction with simulations demonstrated that the bulk structure of the solvent remained unperturbed upon the addition of water. Experimental spectra in the O-H stretching region were decomposed through Gaussian fitting into sub-bands and studies on dilute HOD in H2O. With the aid of simulations, we identified these different bands as water arrangements having different degrees of hydrogen bonding. The observed water structure within PC indicates that water tends to self-aggregate, forming a hydrogen bond network that is distinctly different from the bulk and dependent on concentration. For example, at moderate concentrations, the most likely aggregate structures are chains of water molecules, each with two hydrogen bonds on average.

This work is based on an 11-month methane measurement campaign at oil and gas production sites. We find that operator-level top-down methane measurements are lower during the end-of-project phase than during the baseline phase. However, gaps persist between end-of-project top-down measurements and bottom-up inventories, which we reconcile with high-frequency data from continuous monitoring systems (CMS). Specifically, we use CMS to (i) validate specific snapshot measurements and determine how they relate to the temporal emissions profile of a given site and (ii) create a measurement-informed, site-level inventory that can be validated with top-down measurements to update conventional bottom-up inventories. This work presents a real-world demonstration of how to reconcile CMS rate estimates and top-down snapshot measurements jointly with bottom-up inventories at the site-level.

Recent work by Huang et al. showed that 3D crystals of small tetraheme cytochromes (STC) could transport electrons over nanoscopic to mesoscopic distances by an electron hopping mechanism. Such protein-based structures with multiple localized electron carriers are promising materials for nanowires. A potential barrier to protein nanowire adoption for handling long-range electron transport is that fluctuations at room temperature may distort the nanostructure, hindering efficient electron transport. These fluctuations at the nano- and mesoscopic scales are quantified using classical molecular dynamics simulations for a small fragment of a STC nanowire and measure the effective distance distribution between electron carriers. From distance distributions, we develop a graph network representation for electron transport along nanowires with varying dimensions, and through stochastic methods determine the maximum electron flow that can be driven through these STC wires. Longer nanowires were capable of carrying fewer electrons than shorter nanowires with the same diameter, as long electron transfer distances that occasionally arise reduce the efficiency for electron transport. Thicker nanowires permit more alternative transport pathways, increasing electron transport beyond the increase in cross-section. Thus, this model implies that the design of protein-based nanowires that depend on electron hopping between charge carriers must consider control of the inherent protein flexibility, as more flexible protein-protein interfaces impose a limit on the required minimum diameter to carry currents commensurate with conventional electronics.", "date": "2023-05-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Nanoscience; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Power", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The arene-amine exciplex formed between oligo-(p-phenylene) (OPP) and triethylamine (TEA) is of interest in photoredox catalysis for CO2 reduction as it can compete with complete quenching and electron transfer to OPP. Formation of the exciplex can therefore hinder the generation of a radical anion OPP\u00b7\u2212 necessary for subsequent CO2 reduction. We report an implementation of a workflow automating quantum-chemistry calculations that generate and characterize an ensemble of structures to represent this exciplex state.

The complex device and operation required for calibration hinder the implementation of ISEs in decen-tralized sensing. Reported herein is a new type of ISE that is calibrated by a built-in component of the sensor without requir-ing any fluid handling processes. The indicator and reference electrodes are connected by a thin ionic conductor such as an aqueous phase containing the measuring ions in a capillary tube. This connection establishes a baseline electromotive force (EMF) that incorporates phase boundary potentials across multiple interfaces of the electrochemical cell and serves as a one-point calibration. Unlike conventional ISEs relying on absolute EMF readings, the proposed sensor utilizes a sample-induced EMF change relative to the baseline for ion measurements. The variability in relative EMF is found to be < 2.0 mV for multiple full potentiometric sensors consisting of plasticizer-based K+ ISEs and hydrogel-based Ag/AgCl reference elec-trodes. This value is significantly smaller than the variability of absolute EMF readouts in similar sensors without the self-calibration design. Moreover, when the ion-conducting calibration bridge has a low concentration of primary ions, low ion mobility, and/or a small contact area with the indicator and reference phases, it does not compromise the Nernstian response slope toward the analyte ions in the sample and therefore does not need to be removed for sample testing. The accuracy of single-use self-calibrated K+ sensors in testing undiluted human blood samples is validated using a commercial blood gas analyzer as the reference method.

Understanding this allosteric regulation of CoV-2 Mpro is essential for designing Mpro specific drugs. Also, in the context of viral variants/evolution, where mutation at a distal site may alter the catalytic site dynamics, hence enzymatic activity; a probable drug evading mechanism of Mpro. One of the predominant Mpro mutations of Omicron variant is Pro132His.  Structurally, this mutation site is located ~22 \u00c5 away from the catalytic site. The solved crystal structure of this mutant in complex with inhibitors, as well as the reported catalytic efficiency didn\u2019t show any difference with respect to the wild type. Thus, it is concluded to be non-allosteric. In this present work, based on the microsecond long Molecular Dynamics simulation of this Pro132His mutant and wild type, we show that Pro132His mutation affects the conformational equilibrium, with more population of conformational substates having open catalytic site, modulated by the dynamics of the catalytic site entry loop; implying the allosteric nature of this mutant. This population shift of open conformers is reflected in the increase in reported KM values of FRET assays, though its catalytic efficiency is comparable to that of wild type. Further, the structural analysis of microsecond simulation data indicates that rearrangement of hydrogen bonds between His132 and adjacent residues enhances the dynamics of the linker, which in turn is aggravated by the inherent dynamic flexibility of the catalytic pocket entry site. This inherent dynamics of catalytic pocket entry site is due to the fluctuating electrostatics brought out mainly by the charged residues of turns (Glu47, Asp48) and \u03b12 helix (Glu55, Asp56, Arg60, Lys61) spanning the catalytic pocket entry site and base. This in turn results in the loss of key hydrogen bond between residues Met49-Gln189 and Asp187-Tyr54 of catalytic site, followed by the opening of the catalytic pocket entry site. Thus, Tyr54 could play possible role of being a gate keeper residue. Altered dynamics lead to loss of secondary structures corroborate well with the reported compromised thermal stability of this mutant. This study stands out as an example for how allosteric mutant can modulate the dynamics of protein, probably for its functional diversification.

Differences in the Tafel slope between electrocatalysts have been rationalized based on redox pre-equilibria preceding the rate-determining step. However, no study has experimentally observed a non-rate-determining redox event that directly correlates with the Tafel slope. Here, we show that the Tafel slope of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on alpha-MnO2 is markedly influenced by a Mn(III)/Mn(II) redox process located 500 mV more negative than the OER onset potential. Upon repeated cyclic voltammetry sweeps, a correlation was observed between the Tafel slope and the peak position of a redox event, which was assigned to a Mn(III)/Mn(II) redox couple based on the potential dependence of the UV-vis spectra.  Notably, the UV-vis absorption of Mn(III) did not diminish even after the OER was initiated, and another redox process was observed at the OER onset, indicating that Mn(III)/Mn(II) is not the rate-determining step for OER on alpha-MnO2 in alkaline pH.

Besides the research objectives of inanimate systems in physical science, the entities in life science can be regarded as living aggregates, which are far from being thoroughly understood despite the great advances in molecular biology. Molecular biology follows the research philosophy of reductionism that generally reduces the whole into parts to study. Although reductionism benefits the understanding on molecular behaviors, it encounters limitations when extending to aggregate level. Holism is another epistemology that is comparable important to reductionism, which claims a top-down method to explore objectives at aggregate or mesoscale level, emphasizing on the interactions and synergetic/antagonistic effects of a group of composed single entities in determining the characteristics of a whole. As a representative of holism, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) materials have made great achievements in the past two decades in both physical science and life science. In particular, the unique properties of AIE materials endow with in-situ and real-time visual methods to investigate the inconsistence between microscopic molecules and macroscopic substances, offering researchers excellent toolkits to study living aggregates. The applications of AIE materials in life science are still in its infancy and worth expanding. In this perspective, we summarize the research progresses of AIE materials in unveiling some phenomenon and processes of living systems, aiming to provide a general research approach from the viewpoint of holism.

The rigidity and microporosity of the polymeric matrix are pivotal to maximize the expansion effect of the cavitand that, under mechanical stress, can assume two different conformations: a compact vase one and an extended kite form. The auxetic behavior and the corresponding NPR of the proposed material is predicted by a specific micromechanical model that considers the cavitand volume expansion ratio, the fraction of the cavitand crosslinker in the polymer, and the mechanical characteristics of the polymer backbone. The reversible auxetic behavior of the material is experimentally verified via Digital Image Correlation technique (DIC) performed during the mechanical tests on films obtained by blending the auxetic crosslinked polymer with pristine PIM.

We systematically address the influence of noise, model bias, and model variance in the context of chemical property predictions, where the diverse nature of target properties and the vast chemical chemical space give rise to many different distinct sources of prediction error. We demonstrate that different sources of error can each be significant in different contexts and must be individually addressed during model development. Through controlled experiments on datasets of molecular properties, we show important trends in model performance associated with the level of noise in the dataset, size of the dataset, model architecture, molecule representation, ensemble size, and dataset splitting. In particular, we show that 1) noise in the test set can limit a model's observed performance when the actual performance is much better, 2) using size-extensive model aggregation structures is crucial for extensive property prediction, and 3) ensembling is a reliable tool for uncertainty quantification and improvement specifically for the contribution of model variance.

Often MALDI-MS data does not include tandem MS fragmentation data, and thus the identification of compounds in samples requires external databases so that the accurate mass of detected signals can be matched to known molecular compounds. Most relevant software tools are focused on small molecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids), and cannot be easily adapted to protein data due to their more complex isotopic distributions. Here, we present an R package called IsoMatchMS for the automated annotation of MALDI-MS data for multiple datatypes (e.g., intact proteins, lipids, metabolites, etc.). This tool accepts already computed molecular formulas, or for proteomics applications, can compute molecular formulas from a list of input peptides or proteins including proteins with post-translational modifications.

Over seasonal and diurnal cycles, the plant must constantly adjust its metabolism according to available resources or external stressors. The metabolic changes that a plant undergoes in response to stress are well understood, but the long-distance signaling mechanisms that facilitate communication throughout the plant are less studied. The phloem is considered the predominant conduit for the bidirectional transport of these signals in the form of metabolites, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Lipid trafficking through the phloem in particular attracted our attention due to its reliance on soluble lipid-binding proteins (LBP) that generate and solubilize otherwise membrane-associated lipids. The Phloem Lipid-Associated Family Protein (PLAFP) from Arabidopsis thaliana is generated in response to abiotic stress as is its lipid-ligand phosphatidic acid (PA). PLAFP is proposed to transport PA through the phloem in response to drought stress. To understand the interactions between PLAFP and PA, nearly 100 independent systems comprised of the protein and one PA, or a plasma membrane containing varying amounts of PA, were simulated using atomistic classical molecular dynamics methods. In these simulations, PLAFP is found to bind to plant plasma membrane models independent of the PA concentration. When bound to the membrane, PLAFP adopts a binding pose where W41 and R82 penetrate the membrane surface and anchor PLAFP. This triggers a separation of the two loop regions containing W41 and R82. Subsequent simulations indicate that PA insert into the \t\u03b2-sandwich of PLAFP, driven by interactions with multiple amino acids besides the W41 and R82 identified during the insertion process. Fine-tuning the protein-membrane and protein-PA interface by mutating a selection of these amino acids may facilitate engineering plant signaling processes by modulating the binding response.", "date": "2023-05-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Plant Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In a strategy reminiscent of Born-Haber cycles, the enthalpy of solvation is expressed in terms of two sub-processes: vacancy creation by water reorganization, and adsorbate interaction with solvent molecules. The magnitude of the solvation enthalpy is then determined as a mean value from statistical sampling of hydrated adsorbate-catalyst configurations obtained from simulated annealing with ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations.

Therefore, in this study we explored the growth and nature of the oxide films on the most exposed TiFe surface (110) in depth using static and dynamic first-principles methods. We identified the lowest energy structures for six oxygen coverages up to approximately 1.12 nm of thickness with a global optimization method and studied the temperature effects and structural evolution of the oxide phases in detail via ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD).

Clear and identifiable spectra are experimentally differen-tiated for the fully intercalated (fully reduced Fe2+FeII Prussian White), partially intercalated (Prussian Blue; Fe3+FeII), and free KNO3(aq) elec-trolyte. Comparison of the experiment with simulated XANES of theoretical structures indicates that potassium lies within the channels of the Prussian blue structure, but is displaced  towards the periphery of the channels by occluded water and/or structural water present resulting from  [Fe(CN)6]4- vacancies. The structural composition from the charge carrier perspective was monitored for two samples of differing crystallinity and electrochemical stability. Reproducible potassium XANES spectral sequences were observed for crystalline Prus-sian blue, in agreement with retention of capacity; in contrast, the capacity of the poorly crystalline sample declined as the potassium became trapped within the partially intercalated poorly-crystalline Prussian blue.

Mesoporous thin films have recently attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for storing enzymes while preserving their activity owing.

Chemical shifts and electronic properties of the free sensor and the sensors in the presence of different number of fluoride anions were obtained and compared. The DFT results show that strong binding responses can be found as a function of fluoride concentration. The change in UV-Vis spectra due to the presence of fluoride indicates they are promising sensor candidates for fluoride detection and further studies on fluorescence response of these sensors are worthwhile.", "date": "2023-05-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Understanding lignin's conformational diversity and dynamics in the liquid phase is crucial for designing an effective depolymerization process. Here, we conducted all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to understand the conformation and dynamics of softwood lignin on the all-silica zeolite nanosheet based on the MFI topology in a binary mixture of water-methanol at three different molar compositions (0%, 50%, 100% methanol).

However, identifying the CVs for self-assembly presents several challenges. First, self-assembly systems often consist of identical monomers and the feature representations should be invariant to permutations and rotational symmetries. Physical coordinates, such as aggregate size, lack the high-resolution detail, while common geometric coordinates like pairwise distances are hindered by the permutation and rotational symmetry challenge. Second, self-assembly is usually a downhill process, and the trajectories often suffer from insufficient sampling of backward transitions that correspond to the dissociation of self-assembled structures. Popular dimensionality reduction methods, like tICA, impose detailed balance constraints, potentially obscuring the true dynamics of self-assembly. In this work, we employ GraphVAMPnets which combines graph neural networks with variational approach for Markovian process (VAMP) theory to identify the slow CVs of the self-assembly processes. First, GraphVAMPnets bears the advantages of graph neural networks, in which the graph embeddings can represent self-assembly structures in a high-resolution while being invariant to permutations and rotational symmetries. Second, it is built upon VAMP theory that studies Markov processes without forcing detailed balance constraint, which addresses the out-of-equilibrium challenge in self-assembly process. We demonstrate GraphVAMPnets for identifying slow CVs of self-assembly kinetics in two systems: aggregation of two hydrophobic molecules and self-assembly of patchy particles. We expect that our GraphVAMPnets can be widely to applied to molecular self-assembly.

Method: DBsimilarity was written in Jupyter Notebooks to be easy to follow and values readability. It converts SDF files into CSV files, adds chemoinformatics data, constructs a MZMine custom database file and a NMRfilter candidate list of compounds for rapid dereplication of MS and 2D NMR data, calculates similarities between compounds, and constructs CSV files to be converted to Similarity Networks using Cytoscape. Results: The Lotus database was used as source for Ginkgo biloba compounds and DBsimilarity was used to create Similarity Networks that includes NPClassifier classification to indicate biosynthesis pathways. Following, a database of validated antibiotics natural products was combined with the G. biloba database to indicate promising compounds. The presence of 11 compounds in both datasets points to a possible antibiotic property of G. biloba, and 122 other compounds similar to those known antibiotics is found. Next, DBsimilarity was used to filter the NPAtlas database (selecting only those with MIBIG reference) to identify potential antibacterial compounds using the ChEMBL database as reference. It was possible to promptly identify 5 compounds found in both databases, and 167 other worth investigating compounds similar to those known antibiotics. Conclusion:   Chemical and biological properties are determined by molecular structures. DBsimilarity enables the creation of interactive Similarity Networks using Cytoscape. It is also in line with recent review that highlights significant sources of errors in compound identification: poor biological plausibility and unrealistic chromatographic behaviors.

However, the exact role of ABS in promoting the intercalation of halogens while preventing halogen gas evolution remains unclear. We find that using ABS do not favor halogen intercalation but rather trihalides formation. Electrochemically-generated trihalides are confined in the halide-rich phase of ABS, preventing their diffusion to negative electrode and selfdischarge. We also revealed that confined trihalides spontaneously intercalate in the graphite positive electrode. ABS thus enable a two-steps electrochemical-chemical intercalation mechanism of halogens.

By tuning the chemical functionality of this nanomaterial, and thus its charge and hydrogen bonding capacity, one can heavily impact its macroscopic properties such as its rheological and self-assembly characteristics. In this study, two types of ChNCs are made using acid hydrolysis (AH-ChNCs) and oxidative (OX-ChNCs) pathways, unto which deacetylation using a solvent-free procedure is utilized to create chitosan nanocrystals (ChsNCs) of varying degree of deacetylation (DDA). These nanocrystals were then studied for their rheological behaviour and liquid crystalline ordering. It was found that with both deacetylation and carboxylation of OX-ChNCs, viscosity continually increased with increasing concentrations from 2-8 wt. %, contrary to AH-ChNC suspensions in the same range. Interestingly, increasing the amine content of ChNCs was not proportional to the storage modulus, where a peak saturation of amines provided the most stiffness. Conversely, while the introduction of carboxylation increased the elastic modulus of OX-ChNCs by an order of magnitude from that of AH-ChNCs, it was degraded by increasing DDA. Deacetylation and carboxylation both inhibited the formation of a chiral nematic phase. Finally, these series of nanocrystals were incorporated into biodegradable pectin-alginate films as a physical reinforcement, which showed increased tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus values for the films incorporated with ChsNCs. Overall, this study is the first to investigate how surface functionalization of chitin-derived nanocrystals can affect their rheological and liquid-crystalline properties, and how it augments starch-based pectin/alginate films as a physical reinforcement nanofiller.", "date": "2023-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Biopolymers; Cellulosic materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Non-aqueous ionic liquid electrolytes have been shown to sustain enhanced interfacial electric field gradients at intermediate ion concentration regimes of around 1 M, creating local environments that promote CO2 electroreduction.  Notably, water at low concentrations absorbed by non-aqueous electrolytes is usually assumed to be the proton donor for CO2 reduction. Consumption of protons causes proton donors to become more negative by one unit charge, which significantly modifies the local concentration of charged species and hence should strongly impact local electric fields. Yet, how the coupling between proton donation and changing interfacial electric fields influences electrocatalytic processes in non-aqueous electrolytes remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show that the high activity of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ionic liquids for CO2 reduction in acetonitrile-based electrolytes stems from the ability to act as cationic proton donors that release neutral conjugate bases. Using in situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, we find that the formation of neutral conjugate bases from imidazolium cations preserves local electric field strengths at electrode-electrolyte interfaces, providing a powerful strategy to maintain an active local microenvironment for CO2 reduction. In contrast, conditions where water behaves as the primary proton donor generates [OH]- anions as negative \u201cco-ions\u201d in the electric double layer, which weakens the interfacial electric field and significantly compromises the steady-state CO2 reduction activity. Our study highlights that electrochemical driving forces are highly sensitive to the charge state of both reactant and product species and highlights the fact that the generation of interfacial co-ions plays a key role in determining electrochemical driving forces.", "date": "2023-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This mechanism, prior to this study, has exclusively been ob-served in DNA and is based on charge transfer from CPD-adjacent bases. In a comparative study, we determined the quantum yields of the self-repair of the CPD-containing RNA sequence, GAU=U to GAUU (0.23%), and DNA sequence, d(GAT=T) to d(GATT) (0.44%), upon 285 nm irradiation via UV / Vis spectroscopy and HPLC analysis.

There is limited information on the effect of substrate irregularities, such as adatoms, on the binding of PAHs onto substrates. Here, we examine how the presence of substrate-bound adatoms affects the binding of coronene and hexahelicene monomers and dimers on Au(111) and Cu(111) substrates, using a density functional theory approach. We found that helicene monomers were more effectively able to adapt to the presence of the adatoms than coronene, by coiling around the adatoms. Whereas upon adsorption on a pristine (111) surface, coronene can establish significantly stronger dispersive interactions than helicenes, adatom defects reverse the trend. For helicenes, the extent of flattening near the surface and molecular coiling are strongly influenced by the size of the defect, as a result of the interplay between the molecule\u2019s drive to maximize overlap with the underlying surface and the enhanced reactivity of the low-coordinated adatoms.", "date": "2023-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Present strategies employing collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD)-based multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) or MS/MS combined with sequential exoglycosidase digestion are inherently low-throughput and difficult to automate. Compared to CID and HCD, electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and electron capture dissociation (ECD) each generate more cross-ring cleavages informative about linkage positions, but electronic excitation dissociation (EED) exceeds their information content and is also applicable to analysis of singly charged precursors. Although EED can provide extensive glycan structural information in a single stage of MS/MS, its performance has largely been limited to FTICR MS, and thus it has not been widely adopted by the glycoscience research community. Here, the effective performance of EED MS/MS was demonstrated on a hybrid Orbitrap-Omnitrap QE-HF instrument, with high sensitivity, fragmentation efficiency, and analysis speed. In addition, a novel EED MS2-guided MS3 approach was developed for detailed glycan structural analysis. Automated topology reconstruction from MS2 and MS3 spectra could be achieved with a modified GlycoDeNovo software.

The current understanding of how scaling limits NRR on metal catalysts is predicated on a simplified reaction pathway that only considers proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps.

This paper describes a computational statistical tool to efficiently obtain a phase map from multi-scale experimental measurement profiles obtained from high-throughput measurements. We motivate the construction of a phase map as the problem of learning the underlying metric geometry defined by a set of templates in infinite-dimensional function spaces.

Using examples from small-angle X-ray scattering experiments of polymer blend systems, we show that learned metric geometry can efficiently differentiate ordered phase regions with shifted, missing, and broad Bragg peaks along with features related to non-Bragg behavior of soft-matter systems.

Pancharatna; Musiri M. Balakrishnarajan", "abstract": "The structural mystery of the long-known graphene oxide (GO) unfolds as one of the formidably abstract conceptual problems among nanomaterials.  Generally construed as the oxidized form of graphene, it is variously proposed to host a variety of functional groups with oxygen and hydrogen.  Theoretical studies are abundant on the highly-strained epoxides, while larger cyclic ethers having one or more oxygen atoms and vinylogous carbonyls are paid scant attention even though they are predicted by several structural models.  The nature of the geometric and electronic structure of these alternative functional groups, the preferred distribution on the graphene lattice, comparative stability, etc., remains unexplored.  Our systematic inquiry into the impact of hexagonal and periodic constraints on these mystic functional groups unveils several surprises.  Among those that retain the hexagonal carbon backbone, epoxides are surprisingly more stable than larger ethers despite the excessive strain associated with their acute triangular geometry.  Epoxidation conserves the planarity of the carbon backbone that allows their optimal distribution on the lattice by reducing the repulsive interactions from oxygen lone pairs and \u03c0-electrons. These findings categorically rule out the possibility of 1,3 ethers in GO and settle the long-standing debate on its existence.

Johan Rosengren", "abstract": "The stability of cyclic peptides, coupled with their structural diversity and ability to host an extensive range of bioactivities, make them promising leads for the development of new drugs. PawS-Derived Peptide-23 (PDP-23) is a head-to-tail macrocyclic peptide with two disulfide bonds produced in plant seeds. Its unusual fold comprises two -hairpins connected by hinges that allow the structure to adapt to different environments. In water two PDP-23 molecules form a compact intertwined dimer that buries hydrophobic residues, whereas in membrane mimicking conditions it adopts an open monomeric form that expose them. Here we investigate PDP-23 as a novel scaffold for the grafting of bioactive epitopes and conjugation of small molecules. To explore the plasticity of PDP-23 we introduced the bioactive loop of sunflower trypsin inhbitor-1 (SFTI-1) or an integrin binding RGD motif into either of the -hairpins. Solution NMR spectroscopy revealed that although the variants were unable to dimerise, the structural features of both the graft and scaffold were retained. SFTI-1 hybrid variants showed trypsin inhibitory activity. PDP-23 has previously been used as a cell permeable drug scaffold targeting drug-resistant cancer cells by inhibiting the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein and restoring their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic. Introducing the RGD motif into such PDP-23 conjugates significantly improve their potency, suggesting that the RGD sequence targets the peptide to the membrane of cancer cells and improve cell uptake. In conclusion, this study highlights PDP-23 as a stable and versatile scaffold for molecular grafting of bioactivities and targeted delivery of pharmaceutical payloads.", "date": "2023-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previous studies in the area of hydrophobic hydration have therefore often relied on using amphiphilic molecules where the hydrophilic part of a molecule enabled the solubility in liquid water. Here we show that the hydrophobic adamantane (C10H16) molecule can be fully hydrated through vapour codeposition with water onto a cryogenic substrate at 80 K resulting in the matrix isolation of adamantane in amorphous ice. Using neutron diffraction in combination with the isotopic substitution method and the empirical potential structure refinement technique, we find that the first hydration shell of adamantane is well structured consisting of a hydrogen-bonded cage of 28 water molecules that is also found in cubic structure II clathrate hydrates. The four hexagonal faces of the 51264 cage are situated above the four methine (CH) groups of adamantane whereas the methylene (CH2) groups are positioned below the edges of two adjoining pentagonal faces. The oxygen atoms of the 28 water molecules can be categorised on the basis of symmetry equivalences as twelve A, twelve B and four C oxygens. The water molecules of the first hydration shell display orientations consistent with those expected for a clathrate-hydrate-type cage, but also unfavourable ones with respect to the hydrogen bonding between the water molecules. Annealing the samples at 140 K, which is just below the crystallisation temperature of the matrix, removes the unfavourable orientations and leads to a slight increase of the structural order of the first hydration shell. The very closest water molecules display a tendency for their dipole moments to point towards the adamantane which is attributed to steric effects. Other than this, no significant polarisation effects are observed which is consistent with weak interactions between adamantane and the amorphous ice matrix. FT-IR spectroscopy shows that the incorporation of adamantane into amorphous ice leads to a weakening of the hydrogen bonds. In summary, the matrix-isolation of the highly symmetric adamantane in amorphous ice provides an interesting test case for hydrophobic hydration. Studying the structure and spectroscopic properties of water at the interface with hydrophobic hydrocarbons is also relevant for astrophysical environments, such as comets or the interstellar medium, where amorphous ice and hydrocarbons have been shown to coexist in large quantities.", "date": "2023-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Space Chemistry; Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (RASAR) is an emerging concept that utilizes various similarity functions derived from chemical information to develop highly predictive models. Unlike quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, RASAR descriptors of a query compound are computed from its close congeners instead of the compound itself, thus targeting predictions in the model training phase. The objective of the present study is not to propose new QSAR models for skin sensitization, but to demonstrate the enhancement in the quality of predictions of the skin-sensitizing potential of organic compounds by developing classification-based RASAR (c-RASAR) models. A diverse, previously curated, dataset was collected from the literature, for which 2D descriptors were computed. The extracted essential features were then used to develop a classification-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) QSAR model. Furthermore, from the Read-Across-based predictions, RASAR descriptors were calculated using the basic settings of the hyperparameters for the Laplacian kernel-based optimum similarity measure. After feature selection, an LDA c-RASAR model was developed which superseded the prediction quality of the LDA-QSAR model. Various other combinations of RASAR descriptors were also taken to develop additional c-RASAR models all showing better prediction quality than the LDA QSAR model while using a lower number of descriptors. Various other machine learning c-RASAR models were also developed for comparison purposes.  In this work, we have proposed and analyzed three new similarity metrics: gm_class, sm1, and sm2. The first one is an indicator variable used to generate a simple univariate c-RASAR model with good prediction ability, while the rest two are similarity indices used to analyze possible activity cliffs in the training and test sets and are believed to play an important role in the modelability analysis of datasets.", "date": "2023-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Chalcones are well-known, uncomplicated analogs that may be easily produced using a variety of techniques and are widely present in natural products. Utilizing in silico tools, we developed new antimalarial agents from active synthetic and natural product fragments, and then we assessed their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profiles as therapeutic molecules against the biological targets of the parasite that causes the deadly type of malaria. In this research, active fragments from prenylated and quinolinyl chalcones with known antimalarial characteristics were combined via molecular hybridization. Four enzymes that have been implicated to the spread of malaria are used as the biological targets in the docking simulation for the ligands (prenylated-quinolinyl chalcone hybrids). Receptor-ligand complexes were viewed using Discovery Studio Visualizer 2017 and Chimera. Web-based tools (Moftsoft, SwissADME, Admetlab, and AdmetSAR 1 and 2) were utilized for drug-likeness and ADME prediction. The hybridized active segments created a brand-new scaffold with 169 new prenylated-quinolinyl chalcones. Post-docking studies found significant interactions between the drugs and the used targets. At least 25 of the compounds exhibit high affinities for the targets (-9.4 to -7.5 kcal/mol-1). The selected compounds had interesting ADME and drug-like properties.

In PCM features are computed to describe small molecules and proteins, which directly impact the quality of the predictive models. State-of-the-art protein descriptors, however, are calculated from the protein sequence and neglect the dynamic nature of proteins. This dynamic nature can be computationally simulated with molecular dynamics (MD). Here, novel 3D dynamic protein descriptors (3DDPDs) were designed to be applied in bioactivity prediction tasks with PCM models. As a test case publicly available G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) MD data from GPCRmd was used. GPCRs are membrane-bound proteins, which are activated by hormones and neurotransmitters, and constitute an important target family for drug discovery. GPCRs exist in different conformational states that allow transmission of diverse signals and that can be modified by ligand interactions, among other factors. To translate the MD-encoded protein dynamics two types of 3DDPDs were considered: one-hot encoded residue-specific (rs) and embedding-like protein-specific (ps) 3DDPDs. The descriptors were developed by calculating distributions of trajectory coordinates and partial charges, applying dimensionality reduction, and subsequently condensing them into vectors per residue or protein, respectively. 3DDPDs were benchmarked on a number of PCM tasks against state-of-the-art non-dynamic protein descriptors. Our rs- and ps3DDPDs outperformed non-dynamic descriptors in regression tasks using a temporal split, and showed comparable performance with a random split and in all classification tasks.

The platform introduces various neural network architectures, including graph neural networks (GNNs), equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It demonstrates how to use these architectures for developing predictive models for molecular property and activity prediction, exemplified by the Quantum Machine 9 (QM9), ChEMBL, and Kinase Inhibitor BioActivity (KiBA) data sets. The DL edition covers methods for evaluating the performance of neural networks using uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, it introduces an application of GNNs for protein-ligand interaction predictions, incorporating protein structure and ligand information. The TeachOpenCADD platform is continuously updated with new content and is open to contributions, bug reports, and questions from the community through its GitHub repository (https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd). It can be used for self-study, classroom instruction, and research applications, accommodating users from beginners to advanced levels.", "date": "2023-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Education; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Proton-spin diffusion (SD) is a versatile polarization-transfer mechanism and plays an important role in resonance assignment and structure determination. Recently, the occurrence of negative cross peaks in 2D 1H-1H SD-based spectra has been reported associated with higher-order SD effects, in which the chemical shifts of the involved quadruple of nuclei need to compensate each other. We herein report negative cross peaks in SD-based spectra observed for a variety of small organic molecules involving methyl groups. We combine experimental observations with numerical and analytical simulations to demonstrate that the methyl groups can give rise to coherent (SD) as well as incoherent (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement, NOE) effects, both in principle manifesting themselves as negative cross peaks in the 2D spectra. The simulations however reveal that higher order coherent contributions dominate the experimentally observed negative peaks. Methyl groups are prone to the observation of such higher order coherent effects. Due to their low-frequency shifted 1H resonances, the chemical-shift separation relative to for instance aromatic protons in spatial proximity is substantial (> 4.7 ppm in the studied examples) preventing any sizeable second-order spin-diffusion processes, which would superimpose the negative contribution to the peaks.", "date": "2023-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite the fact that contributions to better understand the connection have been made, the general systematics still remain unknown. In this paper, NSOR in oxygen compounds is investigated systematically to better understand the impact of oxygen atoms on the NSOR signal.

The ability of NSOR to distinguish different molecules and individual nuclei in the molecules is studied and the information provided by NSOR is compared to conventional NMR spectroscopy.

While traditional energy decomposition analysis (EDA) methods can provide a chemically or physically interpretive decomposition of noncovalent electronic binding energies, by definition they neglect entropic effects (and nuclear contributions to the enthalpy). With the objective of revealing the chemical origins of trends in free energies of binding, we introduce the concept of a free energy or Gibbs decomposition analysis (GDA), by coupling the absolutely localized molecular orbital (ALMO) treatment of electrons in non-covalent interactions with the simplest possible quantum treatment of nuclear motion at finite temperature, which is the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator (RR-HO) model. The resulting pilot GDA is employed to decompose enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy of association of the water dimer, fluoride-water dimer, and the binding of water to an open metal site in a recently synthesized metal-organic framework (Cu(I)-MFU-4l). The results show enthalpic trends that generally track the energy of binding (i.e. EDA results), and entropic trends that reveal the increasing price of loss of translational and rotational degrees freedom with temperature.

The rational PROTAC linker design is challenging due to its relatively large molecular weight and the complexity of maintaining the binding mode of warhead and E3-ligand in the binding pockets of counterpart.

In this paper we apply the recently proposed expression of equilibrium constant for binding, that include cross-correlations in reactants' concentrations, to write an equilibrium constant for the formation of clusters larger than two (e.g., trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) as series of two-body reactions. Results obtained by molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the value of this expression is constant for all concentrations and system sizes, as well as, at an onset of a phase transition to an aggregated state where densities in the system change discontinuously. In contrast, the value of the commonly utilized expression of equilibrium constant, which ignores correlations, is not constant and its variations can reach few orders of magnitude. Considering different paths for the same multimer formation, with elementary reactions of any order, yields different expressions for the equilibrium constant, yet, with exactly the same value. This is true also for routes with essentially zero probability to occur. Existence of different expressions for the same equilibrium constant imposes equalities between averages of correlated, along with uncorrelated, concentrations of participating species. Moreover, a relation between average particle number and relative fluctuations derived for two-body reactions is found to be obeyed here as well, despite couplings to additional equilibrium reactions in the system. Analyzes of transfer reactions, where association and dissociation events take place on both sides of the chemical equation, further indicate the necessity to include cross-correlations in the expression of the equilibrium constant. However in this case the magnitudes of discrepancies of the uncorrelated expression are smaller, likely because of partial cancellation of correlations which exist on, both, the reactants and products sides.", "date": "2023-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry; Self-Assembly; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Adsorption-based methods have been proposed as one potential pathway for the removal of TCS from wastewaters. Hydrophobic high-silica zeolites could constitute suitable adsorbent materials for such applications. In order to gauge the impact of pore size, topology, and framework composition, the adsorption of TCS in six different all-silica zeolites (AFI, BEA, CFI, FAU, IFR, MOR frameworks) and two highly siliceous protonated zeolites (H-FAU, H-MOR) was investigated using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT). While pore size was found to affect the interaction strength, the rather flexible TCS molecule can adjust to different pore shapes, resulting in very similar adsorption energies for most all-silica zeolites. Although the interaction with TCS is enhanced in protonated zeolites, the affinity towards water increases even more. In DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations of TCS and water co-adsorption, H2O molecules quickly replace TCS in the vicinity of the framework protons, deprotonating the framework and forming positively charged clusters. In addition to delivering atomic-level insights into TCS adsorption, the calculations indicate that a fine-tuning of pore size with a concurrent maximization of hydrophobicity should constitute a promising strategy to develop optimized zeolite adsorbents for TCS removal.", "date": "2023-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Hydrology and Water Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Jussi Toppari", "abstract": "Organic thin film based excitonic nanostructures are of a great interest in modern resonant nanophotonics as a promising alternative for plasmonic systems. Such nanostructures sustain propagating and localized surface exciton modes which can be exploited in refractive index sensing and near-field enhanced spectroscopy. To realize these surface excitonic modes and to enhance their optical performance, the concentration of the excitonic molecules present in the organic thin film has to be quite high so that a large oscillator strength can be achieved. Unfortunately, this often results in a broadening of the material response which might prevent achieving the very goal. Therefore, systematic and in-depth studies are needed on the molecular concentration dependence of the surface excitonic modes to acquire optimal performance from them. Here, we study the effect of molecular concentration in terms of oscillator strength and Lorentzian broadening on various surface excitonic modes when employed in sensing and spectroscopy. The optical performance of the modes is evaluated in terms of sensing, like sensitivity and figure of merit, as well as near-field enhancement, like enhancement factor and field confinement. Our numerical investigation reveals that, in general, an increase in oscillator strength enhances the performance of the surface excitonic modes while a broadening degrades that as a counteracting effect. Most of all, this demonstrates that the optical performance of an excitonic system is tunable via molecular concentration unlike the plasmonic systems. Moreover, different surface excitonic modes show different degrees of tunability and equivalency in performance when compared to plasmons in gold. Our findings provide crucial information for developing and optimizing novel excitonic nanodevices for contemporary organic nanophotonics.", "date": "2023-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Optical Materials; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices; Optics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Probing their role in the high strain regime, however, has been difficult because of premature network fracture. Here, we address this problem by using a double network approach to investigate the high-strain behavior of both randomly and regularly crosslinked networks with the same backbone chemistry. Randomly crosslinked poly(n-butyl acrylate) networks with target molecular weights between crosslinks of 5-30 kg/mol were synthesized via free-radical polymerization, while regularly-crosslinked poly(n-butyl acrylate) networks with molecular weights between crosslinks of 7-38 kg/mol were synthesized via crosslinking of tetrafunctional star polymers. Both types of networks were then swollen in a monomer/crosslinker mixture, polymerized to form double networks, and characterized via uniaxial tensile testing. Interestingly, the onset of strain stiffening occurred later in regular networks than in random networks with the same modulus, but was well-predicted by the target molecular weight between crosslinks of each sample. These results indicate that the low- and high-strain behavior of polymer networks result from different molecular-scale features of the material, and suggest that controlling network architecture offers new opportunities to both further fundamental understanding of architecture-property relationships and design materials with independently controlled moduli and strain-stiffening responses.", "date": "2023-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymer chains", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, most efforts thus far have been focused solely on introducing extrinsic defects or impurity phases into the system without considering the role of intrinsic defects as critical factors. Thus, herein, we provide a holistic discussion on the correlation between the intrinsic defects and thermoelectric properties of materials using the carbothermal reduction (CTR) process. Taking ZnO as an example material, we experimentally show that vacancy-assisted migration of Zn interstitials lead to a decrease in the Schottky barrier height at grain boundaries. In addition, increasing the carrier concentration and band gap narrowing caused by the CTR reaction can lead to power factors up to 246 \u03bcW/mK2, which is comparable to the excellent values of transition metal-doped ZnO compounds. By minimizing the specific contact resistance of the interfaces down to 12.7 m\u03a9 cm2 at a clamping pressure of 20 MPa, the output power of a single-leg module reaches an outstanding value of 292 \u03bcW at \u0394T = 65 K, which is extremely higher than those of the state-of-the-art ZnO based materials, almost by a factor of three.

These constructs can bind two separate antigenic epitopes and thus provide access to unique mechanisms of action (MoAs). A key MoA is unlocked by bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), which cause T cells to be cross-linked with a targeted cancer cell, ultimately leading to death of the targeted cell. It has been shown that the combination of a BiTE with checkpoint inhibition, such as blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, can lead to a synergistic effect and greater efficacy. Constructs built from a BiTE core (anti-CD3/anti-cancer antigen) with an immunomodulatory protein added, have been dubbed checkpoint-inhibitory T cell-engagers (CiTEs). Both bsAbs and CiTEs have traditionally been generated via protein engineering. However, recently, improved chemical methods for the construction of bsAbs have been reported. This includes a strategy developed by the Chudasama and Baker groups to synthesize homogenous fragment-based bsAbs from antibodies\u2019 fragments antigen binding (Fabs), utilising click-enabled pyridazinediones (PDs) for functional disulfide re-bridging, followed by strain-promoted inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition (SPIEDAC) click chemistry to attach the two Fabs to each other. In this paper, we describe a first-in-class chemical method to generate biotin-functionalized three-protein conjugates, building significantly on the previously described PD-method. The three-protein constructs generated here include two such CiTE molecules, one containing an anti-PD-1 Fab, the other containing an immunomodulatory enzyme Salmonella typhimurium sialidase; FabCD3-FabHER2-FabPD-1-Biotin and FabHER2-FabCD3-Sia-Biotin. These constructs (along with suitable controls) were tested for their biological activity, and each of their protein components were shown to retain their function. Their efficacy was also compared to a simpler BiTE scaffold and was shown to be superior, with the sialidase-containing CiTE especially showing significantly enhanced potency in vitro. The chemical method described here has the potential to enable the rapid generation of a plethora of multi-protein constructs, which we envisage would be especially useful in hit-identification screening but could also potentially be scaled up for drug-development after further optimization.", "date": "2023-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Additionally, the functional role of charge transfer (CT) state is also examined. Using the refined parameters obtained from the reported experimental results, we conclude that the intermolecular vibrations mediate the SF in pentacene with the assistance from strong vibronic couplings to intramolecular modes, which drives the SF process to occur within 100 fs. In this timescale, the CT state has a limiting role towards the SF process in pentacene. However, the CT state plays an important role in a relatively slower SF process of tetracene. Our results disentangle the role of underlying vibrational coherences and clarify the importance of the CT state in tetracene crystal.

Giannotti; Pau Gorostiza Langa", "abstract": "Charge exchange is the fundamental process that sustains cellular respiration and photosynthesis by shuttling electrons in a cascade of electron transfer (ET) steps between redox cofactors. While intraprotein charge exchange is well characterized in protein complexes bearing multiple redox sites, interprotein processes are less understood due to the lack of suitable experimental approaches and the dynamic nature of the interactions. Proteins constrained between electrodes are known to support electron transport (ETp) through the protein matrix even without redox cofactors, as the charges housed by redox sites in ET are furnished by the electrodes in ETp configuration. However, it is unknown whether protein ETp mechanisms apply to the interprotein medium that is present in physiological conditions. Here, we study interprotein charge exchange between plant photosystem I (PSI) and its soluble redox partner plastocyanin (Pc) and address the role of the Pc copper center. Using electrochemical scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (ECSTS) current-distance and blinking measurements we respectively quantify the spatial span of charge exchange between individual Pc/PSI pairs and ETp through transient Pc/PSI complexes. Pc devoid of the redox center (Pcapo) can exchange charge with PSI and it does so at longer distances than with the copper ion (Pcholo). Conductance bursts associated to Pcapo/PSI complex formation are higher than in Pcholo/PSI. Thus, copper ions are not required for long distance ETp between PSI and Pc but regulate its spatial span and conductance. Our results suggest that the redox center that carries the charge in Pc is not necessary to exchange it in interprotein ET through the aqueous solution, and question the canonical view of tight complex binding between redox protein partners.", "date": "2023-05-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Phototrophic MFCs (PhMFCs) are a promising variant that can be implemented indoors or outdoors and use the power of the sun to boost efforts in on-site environmental remediation, biomass generation, and power generation. PhMFC variations include plant-based and algal-based MFCs. Algal-based MFCs can incorporate special photosynthetic action at either the anode or cathode, enhancing or replacing the role of other bacteria in regular bacterial MFCs. Plant-based MFCs can be more complex due to the role of the root system near an electrode and its interaction with electrode-adhered bacteria, and they are nearly universally operated outdoors in either natural or engineered conditions. This review considers PhMFCs such as algal-based MFCs, algal carbon capture cells (ACCCs) and anode algal microbial fuel cells (AAMFCs), and also plant-based MFCs which include natural plant MFCs (NPMFCs), constructed wetland MFCs (CWMFCs), and marine-rooted plant MFCs (MPMFCs).

However, the most prevalent databases currently contain either intransparent aggregated data (impeding quality checks) or, in absence of measured data, rely on widespread use of proxy data for key inventory flows. This study analyzes the quality and implications of proxy data use for filling data gaps in the chemical sector of the ecoinvent database, the most commonly used database, that has found a broad range of applications in politics, industry and science. The individual datasets in that database are compared against simulation-based data as well as commercial chemical-sector data. The propagation of the proxy data in ecoinvent is traced along the complex chemical sector supply chains and consequences for carbon footprints and life cycle assessment (LCA) are calculated. The results demonstrate that due to the use of inappropriate proxy data, the heat demand of chemicals production is heavily underestimated, while the electricity demands tend to be overestimated. Environmental impacts such as the climate change impacts of the chemical sector are largely determined by heat demands, resulting in a massive 44% underestimation of climate change impacts of chemical production in ecoinvent in comparison to simulation-based data. Hence, the quality of chemical data does not live up to the importance of the topic of sustainable chemistry and may lead to widespread erroneous conclusions of policy-makers and industries. To allow for robust environmental assessments of chemicals and to provide reliable decision support, more attention needs to be paid to appropriate data collection of key inventory flows. It is therefore necessary that the use of unspecific proxy data in key data sources is reduced to an absolute minimum and that specific industry data is used whenever possible. Such data is partly available, but needs updates and expansions. Better proxy approaches than the existing ones can also contribute to a more precise picture of environmental impacts from the chemicals sector, but these approaches should only represent a last resort for processes and products without any alternatives.", "date": "2023-05-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Fuels - Energy Science; Power", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

As a prominent example, redox flow batteries, a well-suited technology for large energy storage if the costs can be significantly reduced, leverages electrochemical reactors as power converting units. Within the reactor, the flow field geometry determines the electrolyte pumping power required, mass transport rates, and overall cell performance. However, current designs are inspired on fuel cell technologies but have not been engineered for redox flow battery applications where liquid-phase electrochemistry is sustained. Here, we leverage stereolithography 3D printing to manufacture lung-inspired flow field geometries and compare their performance to conventional flow field designs. A versatile two-step process based on stereolithography 3D printing followed by a coating procedure to form a conductive structure is developed to manufacture lung-inspired flow field geometries. We employ a suite of fluid dynamics, electrochemical diagnostics and finite element simulations to correlate the flow field geometry with performance in symmetric flow cells. The lung-inspired structural pattern is demonstrated to homogenize the reactant distribution in the porous electrode and to improve the electrolyte accessibility to the electrode reaction area. In addition, the results reveal that these novel flow field geometries can outperform traditional interdigitated flow field designs, as these patterns exhibit a more favorable electrical and pumping power balance, achieving superior current densities at lower pressure loss.

Using extended multireference perturbation theory methods (XMS-CASPT2), functional choice can be eliminated. The molecular geometries and electronic structures of both the unsubstituted and meso-triphenyl copper corroles were investigated. A minimal active space was employed for structural characterization, while larger active spaces are required to examine the electronic structure. The XMS-CASPT2 investigations conclusively identify the ground electronic state as a multiconfigurational singlet (S0) with three dominant electronic configurations, in its lowest energy and characteristic saddled structure. In contrast, the planar geometry corresponds to the triplet state (T0), which is approximately 5 kcal/mol higher in energy compared to the S0 state for both the bare and substituted copper corroles. Notably, the planarity of the T0 geometry is reduced in the substituted corrole compared to the unsubstituted one. By analyzing the potential energy surface (PES) between the S0 and T0 geometries using XMS-CASPT2, the multiconfigurational electronic structure is shown to transition towards a single electron configuration as the saddling angle decreases (i.e., as one approaches the planar geometry).

In this work, we illustrate the impact of emission size distribution on the equivalency between OGI-based LDAR programs and that of alternative LDAR programs that use site-wide surveys. We find that emission size distribution compiled from aerial measurements across four oil and gas basins include significantly more emitters in the 1 \u2013 10 kg/h and an order of magnitude lower average emission rate for large emitters compared to the emissions distribution in the EPA methane rule. As a result, equivalence between OGI-based surveys and site-wide screening may be achieved at lower site-wide survey frequencies when using technologies with detection threshold below 10 kg/h, compared to the EPA methane rule. However, equivalency cannot be achieved for site-wide screening with a detection threshold of 30 kg/h at any survey frequency because most emitters across most US oil and gas basins exhibit emission rates below 30 kg/h.

While inventories used for public or corporate GHG policies have traditionally utilized bottom-up (BU) methods to estimate emissions, the validity of such inventories has been questioned. Therefore, there is attention on utilizing full-facility measurements using airborne, satellite or drone (top-down (TD)) techniques to inform, improve, or validate inventories. This study utilized full-facility estimates from two independent TD methods at 15 midstream natural gas facilities in the U.S.A., and were compared with a contemporaneous daily inventory assembled by the facility operator, employing comprehensive inventory methods. Estimates from the two TD methods statistically agreed in 2 of 28 paired measurements. Operator inventories, which included extensions to capture sources beyond regular inventory requirements and to integrate local measurements, estimated significantly lower emissions than the TD estimates for 40 of 43 paired comparisons. Significant disagreement is observed at most facilities, both between the two TD methods and between the TD estimates and operator inventory. These findings have two implications. Firstly, improving inventory estimates will require additional on-site or ground-based diagnostic screening and measurement of all sources. Secondly, the TD full-facility measurement methods need to undergo further testing, characterization, and potential improvement specifically tailored for complex midstream facilities.", "date": "2023-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding structure-property-performance factors that impact the behavior of these systems in diverse, real-world environments. In aminopolymer-based DAC systems, gas diffusion is tightly coupled with polymer mobility, which is in turn affected by a large matrix of variables, including interactions with the pore wall of the support, nanoconfinement, the presence of co-adsorbates (moisture), and electrostatic crosslinks that develop as a function of CO2 chemisorption. Higher throughput, benchtop techniques for studying and understanding mobility in these systems would lead to more rapid advances in the field. Here, we demonstrate the value of a fluorescence technique for monitoring polymer mobility within nanocomposite capture materials as a function of CO2 and water adsorption in a series of humidified polyethylenimine-Al2O3 composite materials. The approach allows us to correlate changes in mobility with CO2 adsorption kinetics as a function of relative humidity. We further couple this information with NMR relaxometry data attained using a portable single-sided magnetic resonance device, and we employ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to correlate the formation of different relative amounts of carbamates and carbonates with the environmental conditions.

Through multiscale calculations, we decipher a de-tailed adenine excision mechanism of MutY that is consistent with all available experimental data, involving an initial proto-nation step and two nucleophilic displacement steps. During the first displacement step, N-glycosidic bond cleavage is ac-companied by the attack of residue Asp144 at the anomeric carbon (C1\u2032), forming a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate to stabilize the fleeting oxocarbenium ion. After departure of the excised base, water nucleophiles can be recruited to displace Asp144, completing the catalytic cycle with retention of stereochemistry at the C1\u2032 position. Unsurprisingly, in the absence of the protein environment, the first displacement reaction, where Asp144 acts as the nucleophile, is highly exothermic with a negative barrier, yet the second, where an un-activated water molecule acts as the nucleophile, is prohibitive both kinetically and thermodynamically. Intriguingly, we find that the enzyme modulates these two reactions by coupling them together through an internal electric field at its active site, which reduces the barrier of the difficult one at the expense of raising that of the easy one, thereby allowing both reactions to occur.

Manually calculating these parameters is tedious and error prone involving many interconnected computations. We present Pynta, a workflow software for automating the calculation of surface and gas-surface reactions. Pynta takes the reactants, products and atom maps for the reactions of interest, generates sets of initial guesses for all species and saddle points, runs all optimizations, frequency, and IRC calculations and computes the associated thermochemistry and rate coefficients. It is able to consider all unique adsorption configurations for both adsorbates and saddle points allowing it to handle high index surfaces and bidentate species. Pynta implements a new saddle point guess generation method called harmonically forced saddle point searching (HFSP). HFSP defines harmonic potentials based on the optimized adsorbate geometries and which bonds are breaking and forming that allow initial placements to be optimized using the GFN1-xTB semiempirical method to create reliable saddle point guesses. This method is reaction class agnostic and fast, allowing Pynta to consider all possible adsorbate site placements efficiently.

Using a combination of pH-dependent electrochemical characterization, operando UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations, we find that the n-type OMIEC, p(NDI-T2 P75), displays pH-dependent activity for the selective reduction of oxygen to the 2-electron hydrogen peroxide product. We use microkinetic simulations of the electrochemical behavior to rationalize our experimental observations through a polaron-mediated pathway involving chemical reduction of oxygen to the 1-electron superoxide intermediate followed by pH-dependent catalytic disproportionation to hydrogen peroxide. Finally, this pathway is applied to understand the experimental oxygen reduction reactivity of an expanded set of n- and p-type OMIECs.", "date": "2023-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Polymer Science; Conducting polymers; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We demonstrate quantum coherence and spin-lattice relaxation of organic luminescent radical spins can be facilely tuned using a library of well-defined star-like block copolymers containing a common core of tris[4-(p-benzyl)-2,6-dichlorophenyl]methyl radical in the center, from which diblock polyesters are grafted via controllable ring-opening polymerization. The fine tuning of the incompatibility and the volume ratio of the two blocks of polyesters leads to not only a series of self-assembling patterns (i.e., spheres, cylinders, lamellae, and gyroids) with phase-separation of the spins in the nanometer scale, but also tunable spin-lattice relaxation dynamics and spin coherence lifetimes that strongly depend on the lengths and rigidities of the polymeric matrices surrounding the organic radicals as molecular spins.

Individual N-containing organic molecules are known to have both natural and anthropogenic sources and implicated in a wide-ranging health and environmental effects. Yet, unlike carbon (C), the total quantity of aerosol organic nitrogen (ON) remains largely unquantified, hindering a quantitative understanding of their major sources and impacts. Here, for the first time, aerosol ON is quantified in hundreds of aerosol filter samples collected from sites of varying urban influence in China using our recently developed method that permits simple, and yet sensitive, simultaneous detection of inorganic and organic nitrogen. Annual average ON concentration was in the range of 0.4-1.4 \u03bcg N m-3, representing 17-31% of aerosol total nitrogen. Monte Carlo simulations constrained by paired ON and organic carbon (OC) measurements suggest N-containing organic molecules contributed typically 37-50%, with a 95% confidence interval of [12%, 94%], to ambient organic aerosols. Source apportionment analysis reveals that biomass burning and secondary formation are dominant ON sources, accounting for 21-24% and ~30% of ON, respectively.

The revelation of the large presence of nitrogenous molecules in atmospheric aerosols implies their role in carbon chemistry has likely been under-appreciated in the past.

Data-mining was conducted to explore the relationships among different variates (e.g., transport ion, composition, activation energy, and conductivity). Overall, we expect that this database can provide guidelines for the design and development of high-performance SSEs in ASSB applications. This database is dynamically updated, which can be accessed via: (https://ssbed-ssbed-database-gui-ntj1tz.streamlit.app/).", "date": "2023-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

MAOC is based on a cost-effective localization scheme that represents localized orbitals via a predefined set of atomic orbitals. The latter can be constructed from such small atom-centered basis sets as pcseg-0 and STO-3G in conjunction with guess (non-optimized) electronic configuration of the molecule. Importantly, MAOC is suitable for representing monatomic, molecular, and periodic systems, and can distinguish compounds with identical compositions and geometries but distinct charges and spin multiplicities. Using principal component analysis, we constructed a more compact but equally powerful version of MAOC \u2013 PCX-MAOC. To test the performance of full and reduced MAOC and several other representations (CM, SOAP, SLATM, and SPAHM), we used a kernel ridge regression machine learning model to predict frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ground state single-point energies for chemically diverse neutral and charged, closed- and open-shell molecules from an extended QM7b dataset, as well as two new datasets, N-HPC-1 (N-heteropolycycles) and REDOX (nitroxyl and phenoxyl radicals, carbonyl and cyano compounds).

The demand for fish, including salmon, is higher than ever because of the growing global population and protein needs, however this results in large quantities of wasted by-products. This waste is problematic because it is potentially harmful to the environment and results in significant disposal costs for industries. The salmon frame (bones) is disposed of during processing but is a potential feedstock for hydroxyapatite, a mineral for value-added applications. While previous research has accessed hydroxyapatite from animal wastes, these processes either use very high temperatures or chemicals that are more costly and hazardous than the method described herein. In this study, we developed an enzymatic treatment using proteases and lipases simultaneously to clean the residual meat from salmon frames to isolate collagen-containing hydroxyapatite (sHAP) using Design of Experiment (DoE) under benign conditions. The variables were optimized using 2x3 and 2x4 factorial designs and it was determined by characterization techniques, weight loss calculations, and thermogravimetric analysis that the meat from the salmon frame was successfully hydrolyzed with 15 \u03bcL/g Neutrase and 7.5 \u03bcL/g Lipozyme CALB L in 40 \u00b0C tap water for 6 h. We have performed a life cycle analysis to compare the current method with previously reported processes used to treat other types of fishery waste. The method reported herein is less impactful (environment, hazard, cost, carbon footprint) than others in the literature, as there are no solvents required, enzymes are easily disposed, and temperatures do not exceed 100 \u00b0C during the entire process.

While the extent of staining and destaining are discernable by hue values of stamped red blood cells in micrographs, quantification of adsorbed and desorbed Romanowsky dye molecules (in particular, eosin Y, methylene blue, and azure B) from and to the agarose gel stamps needs a model that can explain the sorption process.

Within transition state theory (TST), this requires an accurate estimation of the corresponding free energy barriers. While sophisticated methods for estimating free energy differences exist, these typically require extensive (biased) molecular dynamics simulations that are computationally prohibitive with the first-principles electronic structure methods that are typically used in catalysis research. In this contribution, we show that machine-learning (ML) interatomic potentials can be trained in an automated iterative workflow to perform such free energy calculations at a much reduced computational cost as compared to a direct density-functional theory (DFT) based evaluation. For the decomposition of CHO on Rh(111), we find that thermal effects are substantial and lead to a decrease in the free energy barrier, which can be vanishingly small depending on the DFT functional used. This is in stark contrast to previously reported estimates based on a harmonic TST approximation, which predicted an increase of the barrier at elevated temperatures. Since CHO is the educt of the putative rate limiting reaction step in syngas conversion on Rh(111) and essential for the selectivity towards $\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{2+}$ oxygenates, our results call into question the reported mechanism established by microkinetic models.

Systematic studies on tosyl-substituted metallated ylides (R3P=C(M)Ts) now reveal that carbonylation leads to either phosphine or metal salt (MTs) elimination. The selectivity of this reaction can be controlled by the nature of the phosphine and metal cation, the solvent and additional co-ligands, enabling full control of the selectivity and isolation of the ketenyl anion [Ts-CCO]M (2-M, M = Na, K) in high yields. Complexation of 2-Na by crown ether or cryptand allowed the structure elucidation of the first \u201cnaked\u201d ketenyl anion [Ts-C=C=O]-, which showed only a slightly bent Ts-C-C linkage indicating pronounced ynolate character. However, DFT studies confirmed the high charge concentration at the ketenyl carbon, which is reflected in the selective carbon-centered reactivity of 2-M. In contrast to previously reported ketenyl anions, ketenes obtained from the tosyl-substituted anion 2-M reacted directly with the ketenyl anion to give convenient access to a range of cyclobutadiones. Overall, the present studies provide important information on the selectivity control of ketenyl anion formation which will be crucial for broader applications in the future.

A major challenge in Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) modeling and generation of EPMs is accurately accounting for the dielectric discontinuity at the molecular surface and associated jump in normal electrostatic field.  One option for accommodating such solutions is to develop a surface conforming grid such that no element or mesh edge intersects the molecular surface.  Given the complex shapes of biomolecules, unstructured tetrahedral grids are usually necessary to develop such grids.  Here an alternate approach is presented that first develops an adaptive Cartesian grid with no attempt to align it with the molecular surface.  Next each mesh edge that intersects the surface is processed by identifying the intersection point and then using a least squares-based reconstruction (LSR) method to estimate the surface potentials and their gradients.  The LSR incorporates the analytical surface matching constraints, satisfies the PBE locally, accounts for surface curvature, and is combined with the finite difference scheme used at off-surface points to solve the PB equation.  This results in a global set of equations that solves the governing equations at all interior and exterior points, and couples then at the edge intersection points.  The LSR is implemented in the adaptive Cartesian grid PB solver (from herein called CPB) and applied to a variety of biomolecular systems ranging from small to very large-scale (e.g., viruses) assemblies to compute electrostatic energies, forces, and high-quality estimates of the surface EPM.  Using LSR within CPB allows additional memory savings and proper visualization and rationalization of electrostatic complementarity/recognition features of protein-drug and nucleic acid-ligand complexes, with the latter requiring inclusion of nonlinear screening effects. In addition to detailing the LSR method, the article provides several recommendations for producing accurate, reliable, and reproducible biomolecular EPMs. The importance of performing grid convergence tests to ensure converged predictions is emphasized along with the need to properly account for nonlinear effects in highly charged systems and provide sufficient details of the biomolecular geometry, grid size, environmental conditions, and choice of contour levels to facilitate comparison against other EPM generation software.", "date": "2023-05-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Tetrazine is an effective emission quencher in the design of fluorogenic probes, which can be selectively damaged upon bioorthogonal click reactions, leading to considerable emission enhancement. Despite significant efforts to increase the emission enhancement ratio (IAC/IBC) of tetrazine-functionalized fluorogenic probes, the influence of molecular aggregation on the emission properties has been largely overlooked in the design of these probes. In this study, we reveal that an ultrahigh IAC/IBC can be realized in the aggregate system when tetrazine is paired with aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). Tetrazine can increase its quenching efficiency upon aggregation and drastically reduce background emissions. Subsequent click reactions damage tetrazine and trigger significant AIE, leading to considerably enhanced IAC/IBC.

Recent synthesis and spectroscopic characterizations of metals deposited on N-doped graphitic materials have evidenced two types of metal-N$_4$ fourfold coordination, either of pyridine type or of porphyrin type. Here, we study at the quantum level two Fe-N$_4$ SAC defects in graphene that are immersed in an explicit aqueous medium. While the pyridine Fe-N$_4$ SAC is easily embedded in graphene and widely used in numerous DFT studies, the porphyrin one remains debated because of the necessary embedding of odd-membered rings in graphene. We propose an atomistic model for the porphyrin defect in a large graphene sheet at a moderate strain cost. Using spin-polarized \\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics, we show that both SAC defects spontaneously adsorb two interfacial water molecules on both sides of the catalytic site, retrieving an octahedral ligand field. Strickingly, the porphyrin defect promotes the dissociation of an adsorbed water into a hydroxide anion. To induce proton transfer reactions on the time scale of the simulations, we also apply moderate external electric fields. On the other hand, the pyridine defect preserves the water ligands intact. This unveils a different catalytic reactivity between the two SAC motives in liquid water, therefore promoting the porphyrin defect as a superior SAC electrocatalyst.", "date": "2023-05-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Protons associated with paired Al sites were exclusively exchanged with divalent cobalt, while isolated protons remained intact and readily quantified through Hofmann elimination of adsorbed alkylammonium species. Through a combination of temperature-programmed methods and spectroscopic characterization, the stability of the adsorbed alkylammonium was found to be crucial to the accurate estimation of isolated protons. Only alkylammonium species undergoing Hofmann elimination through a primary carbocation were found to exclusively probe isolated protons on the surface of cobalt-exchanged ZSM-5. More stable secondary and tertiary carbocations typically used in the characterization of acid sites, resulted in significant overestimates of protonic site densities. The result is contrary to purely protonic zeolites, where alkylammonium stability is inconsequential to the quantification of the acid sites they are coordinated with. Consequently, n-propylamine was found to be a suitable reactive probe molecule for the quantification of isolated protonic sites on divalent metal-cation zeolite surfaces, forming n-propylammonium upon adsorption. Ensuring accurate probing of isolated protons on the surface of metal cation exchanged zeolites was also demonstrated to require control of ion-exchange conditions and sufficient extent of zeolite exposure to the adsorbing n-propylamine.

Consistent with a platinum(0) formulation, addition of CH3I gives the known complex trans-Pt(I)(Me)(P((CH2)14)3P) (trans-10, 83% isolated), and H2 gives the dihydride complex trans-Pt(H)2(P((CH2)14)3P) (trans-11), as evidenced by 31P{1H} and 1H NMR.

However, our knowledge on the mechanism of photocatalysis enhancement at SAC-modified photocatalysts is still rather limited, which makes the rational design of high-performance photocatalysts based on SACs challenging. Herein, a series of photocatalysts for aerobic degradation of pollutants based on anatase TiO2 modified with various low-cost, non-noble SACs (vanadate, Cu and Fe ions) is reported. The most active SAC-modified photocatalysts outperform not only TiO2 modified with corresponding metal oxide nanoparticles, but also the state-of-the-art benchmark photocatalysts, such as platinized TiO2 or commercial P25 powders. A combination of in-situ EPR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the best-performing photocatalysts modified with Cu(II) and vanadate SACs exhibit significant differences in the mechanism of activity enhancement, in particular with respect to the rate of catalysis of oxygen reduction. The superior performance of vanadate SAC-modified TiO2 is found to be related to the shallow character of the SAC-induced intragap states, which allows for both effective extraction of photogenerated electrons and fast catalytic turnover in reduction of dioxygen, and translates directly into diminished recombination. These results provide essential design guidelines for the development of efficient SAC-based photocatalysts.", "date": "2023-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

For its large spectrum of biological and biomedical implications, adenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP) is a particularly interesting target for such a purpose but photoresponsive ATP-based systems, such as photocaged compounds, have mainly been relying on covalent modification of ATP. Here, we show that simply mixing unmodified ATP with AzoDiGua, an azobenzene-guanidium compound with photodependent nucleotide binding affinity, results in the spontaneous self-assembly of the two non-fluorescent compounds into photoreversible, micrometer-sized and fluorescent aggregates. Obtained in water at room temperature and physiological pH, these supramolecular structures are dynamic and respond to several chemical, physical and biological stimuli, resulting in a multi-stimuli control of the suspension turbidity and aggregate fluorescence. The presence of azobenzene allows a fast and photoreversible control of their assembly upon cycles of UV (395/25 nm) and blue (480/30 nm) irradiation of moderate power. ATP chelating properties to metal dications enable ion-triggered disassembly and fluorescence control with valence-selectivity. Finally, the supramolecular aggregates are disassembled by alkaline phosphatase in a few minutes at room temperature, resulting in enzymatic control of fluorescence through ATP hydrolysis. These results highlight the interest of using a photoswitchable nucleotide binding partner as a self-assembly brick to build highly responsive supramolecular entities involving biologically relevant target molecules without the need to covalently modify them.

Lanthanide based MOF stand out as luminescent temperature sensors due to the high luminescence intensity and sharp emission lines of the lanthanides. The use of two different lanthanide cations incorporated into the same MOF structure is supposed to allow for a rational, that is self-referencing, temperature sensing. Here, we present series of mixed EuxTb(1-x)BTC, which were designed as nanoparticles. The EuxTb(1-x)BTC series shows controllable luminescent properties, which depend on the solvation of the lanthanide. The two MOFs in the series with the lowest Eu content, i.e. Eu0.04Tb0.96BTC and Eu0.02Tb0.98BTC, are suitable candidates for rational temperature sensing in the range between 200 and 270 K and above 300 K.", "date": "2023-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

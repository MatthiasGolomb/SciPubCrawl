Protein structures can be determined by experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or cryogenic electron microscopy. As an alternative, in silico methods can be used to predict protein structures. Those methods utilize protein structure databases for structure prediction via template-based modeling or for training machine-learning models to generate predictions. Structure prediction for proteins distant from proteins with known structures often results in lower accuracy with respect to the true physiological structures. Physics-based protein model refinement methods can be applied to improve model accuracy in the predicted models. Refinement methods rely on conformational sampling around the predicted structures, and if structures closer to the native states are sampled, improvements in the model quality become possible. Molecular dynamics simulations have been especially successful for improving model qualities but although consistent refinement can be achieved, the improvements in model qualities are still moderate. To extend the refinement performance of a simulation-based protocol, we explored new schemes that focus on an optimized use of biasing functions and the application of increased simulation temperatures. In addition, we tested the use of alternative initial models so that the simulations can explore conformational space more broadly. Based on the insight of this analysis we are proposing a new refinement protocol that significantly outperformed previous state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulation-based protocols in the benchmark tests described here.      <br />", "date": "2020-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In response to the emergency, we adopted bioinformatics methods to study the virus's pathogenic mechanism and found possible control methods. We speculated in previous studies that E protein was related to viral infectivity. This study adopted the domain search techniques to analyze the E protein. The results showed that the E protein could bind iron or heme. The iron and heme bound by the E protein came from the attacked hemoglobin and phagocytes. When E protein attached to heme, it synthesized oxygen and water into superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. When the iron-bound E protein and the heme-bound E protein worked together, they converted superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. These were the \u201cROS attack\u201d and \u201cROS escape\u201d of the virus. \u201cROS attack\u201d damaged the tissues or cells exposed on the surface of the virus, and \u201cROS escape\u201d decomposed the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide that attacked the virus. When NK cells exposed to infected cells, viruses that had not shed from the infected cells\u2019 surface damaged them through \u201cROS attack\u201d. Lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells, which could be close to the antigen of the virus surface, were also easily damaged or killed by the \"ROS attack\", resulting in a decrease in lymphocytes. When memory B cells exposed to the virus\u2019s surface antigen, \u201cROS attack\u201d also damaged them, resulting in the patient's re-infection. The virus used the \u201cROS escape\u201d to decompose hydrogen peroxide released by phagocytes into oxygen and water. The surrounding cells were replenished with oxygen, and the patient had a \u201chappy hypoxia\u201d state. When the phagocytes swallowed the virus, the E protein converted superoxide anions into oxygen and water. In this way, the virus parasitized in the vesicles of the phagocyte. While virus in the lysosome, the E protein generated ROS to damage nearby hydrolases. The virus parasitized the lysosome in this way. Excessive hydroxyl free radicals destroyed the membrane structure of the lysosome, causing the lysosome to release hydrolase, phagocytic cells autophagy and died. Therefore, the colonizing phagocytes of the virus was related to asymptomatic infection or retest-positive. In short, the virus inhibited the immune system through \u201cROS escape\u201d, and damaged the immune system by \u201cROS attack\u201d. The destruction instigated a strong cytokine storm and led to organ failure and complications. This theory is only used for academic discussion.We hoped this discovery would help prevent severe epidemics and save more lives.", "date": "2020-12-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Chemical Biology; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In addition, electrostatic interactions between the ligand and the polar aminoacids are also relevant for p-diaminoazobenzene due to the presence of the amino groups on the benzene moieties. These groups participate in hydrogen bonding in the most favorable binding pocket and in long-range electrostatic interactions in the other pockets.

They often grow in discrete jumps, creating a series of crystallites, without the appearance of intermediate sizes. However, despite their long history, the mechanism behind their special stability and growth remains poorly understood. This is particularly true considering experiments that have shown discrete evolution of MSCs to sizes well beyond the \u201ccluster\u201d regime and into the size range of colloidal quantum dots. Here, we study the growth of these larger magic-sized CdSe nanocrystals to unravel the underlying growth mechanism. We first introduce a synthetic protocol that yields a series of nine magic-sized nanocrystals of increasing size. By investigating these crystallites, we obtain important clues about the mechanism. We then develop a microscopic model that uses classical nucleation theory to determine kinetic barriers and simulate the growth. We show that magic-sized nanocrystals are consistent with a series of zinc-blende crystallites that grow layer by layer under surface-reaction-limited conditions. They have a tetrahedral shape, which is preserved when a monolayer is added to any of its four identical facets, leading to a series of discrete nanocrystals with special stability. Our analysis also identifies strong similarities with the growth of semiconductor nanoplatelets, which we then exploit to increase further the size range of our magic-sized nanocrystals.

Furin and the other proprotein convertases modify certain other proteins to change them from their inactive to active forms. Previous attempts to find an effective, non-toxic furin inhibitor to treat diseases facilitated by furin have had only limited success, due to toxicity or large molecular size that impedes absorption of the molecule. This has placed increased importance on the development of small-molecule furin inhibitors. The object of this study was to consider the effect of the noble gas xenon as a furin inhibitor.<br /><br /><br /><br />    Methods:<br /><br />    This study uses a fluorometric furin inhibition assay to compare the enzymatic activity of recombinant human furin after exposure to 99.999% xenon gas, compared to the enzymatic activity of untreated recombinant human furin. <br /><br />    Results:<br />    Xenon exposure was found to decrease the in vitro enzymatic activity of recombinant human furin by 96-99%. Fluorescence measurements were taken for 24 hours and the enzyme inhibition persisted for the duration of the experiment. Further studies will be necessary to better characterize the exact duration of this inhibition.<br /><br />    Conclusions:<br />    These findings appear to be the first to report xenon as a furin inhibitor. The observed inhibition continued throughout the duration of the experiment. The effectiveness of xenon as a furin inhibitor, its favorable side effect profile, and its long history of safe use as an anesthetic, when used under direct medical supervision, make it a promising treatment for diseases facilitated by furin or its substrates. Further studies in cell culture or clinical trials may expand its clinical role for such diseases.<br /><br />", "date": "2020-12-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2-Se-pyrimidines were between 5 and 10 and thus belong to the highest described so far. Thus, a ten-fold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40-48% conversion to the target nucleoside.

Among different possibilities, the donor-acceptor modular strategy of copolymers has shown great promise in its ability to undergo iSF under certain conditions. However, the number of iSF donor-acceptor copolymers reported in the literature remains remarkably narrow and clear trends for the molecular design of better candidates have not yet been established. In this work, we identify the trade-off between the main iSF requirements of the donor-acceptor strategy and formulate design rules that allow them to be tuned simultaneously in a fragment-based approach. Based on a library of 2944 donor-acceptor copolymers, we establish simple guidelines to build promising novel materials for iSF. These consist in (1st) selecting an acceptor core with high intrinsic singlet-triplet splitting, (2nd) locating a donor with a larger monomer frontier molecular orbital (FMO) gap than that of the acceptor, and (3rd) tuning the relative energy of donor and/or acceptor FMOs through functionalization to promote photoinduced charge transfer in the resulting polymer. Remarkably, systems containing benzothiadiazole and thiophehe-1,1-dioxide acceptors, which have been shown to undergo iSF, fulfill all criteria simultaneously when paired with appropriate donors. This is due to their particular electronic features, which make them highly promising candidates in the quest for iSF materials.<br />", "date": "2020-12-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The adsorption isotherms of CO2 and N2 are described by competitive Langmuir isotherms. Two low-energy process cycles are considered and a machine learning surrogate-model is trained with inputs from an experimentally-validated detailed PVSA model. Several case studies are considered to evaluate two critical performance indicators, namely, minimum energy and maximum productivity. For each case study, the genetic algorithm optimizer that is coupled to the machine learning surrogate model, searches tens of thousands of combinations of isotherms and process operating conditions. The framework pairs the optimum material properties  with the optimum operating conditions, hence providing the limits of achievable performance. The results indicate that very low pressures ( <~0.2 bar) may be required to achieve process constraints for low feeds with low feed compositions ($<0.15$ mol fraction), indicating that PVSA may not be favourable. At higher CO2 feed compositions, PVSA can be attractive and can be operated at practically achievable vacuum levels. Further, the gap between the energy consumption of available adsorbents and the achievable limits with a hypothetical -best adsorbent varies between 20% to 2.5% as the CO2 feed composition changes between 0.05 to 0.4. This indicates a limited potential for development of new adsorbents of PVSA-based CO2 capture.

These compounds are covalent inhibitors that inactivate the protease forming a stable hemithioacetal complex. Inhibitor 11a is a potent inhibitor that has been already tested in vitro and in animals. Using a combination of classical and QM/MM simulations we determined the binding mode of the inhibitor into the active site and the preferred rotameric state of the catalytic histidine. In the noncovalent complex the aldehyde group is accommodated into the oxyanion hole formed by the NH main chain groups of residues 143 to 145.  In this pose, P1-P3 groups of the inhibitor mimic the interactions established by the natural peptide substrate. The reaction is initiated with the formation of the catalytic dyad ion pair after a proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. From this activated state, covalent inhibition proceeds with the nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated Sg atom of Cys145 to the aldehyde carbon atom and a water mediated proton transfer from the Ne atom of His41 to the aldehyde oxygen atom. Our proposed reaction transition state structure is validated by comparison with x-ray data of recently reported inhibitors, while the activation free energy obtained from our simulations agrees with the experimentally derived value, supporting the validity of our findings. Our study stresses the interplay between the conformational dynamics of the inhibitor and the protein with the inhibition mechanism and the importance of including conformational diversity for accurate predictions about the inhibition of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.

Unfortunately, even the most potent biochemical leads from these screening technologies often have weak cellular activity due to poor absorption. Biasing such libraries towards passive cell permeability in the design phase would facilitate development of leads against intracellular targets. We set out to empirically evaluate the intrinsic permeability of thousands of geometrically diverse hexa- and heptapeptide scaffolds by permuting backbone stereochemistry and N-methylation, and by including peptoid and \u03b2-amino acid residues at select positions, with the goals of providing a resource for biasing library-based screening efforts toward passive membrane permeability and studying the effects of the backbone elements introduced on a large number of compounds. Libraries were synthesized via standard split-pool solid phase peptide synthesis, and passive permeability was measured in pools of 150 compounds using a highly multiplexed version of the parallel artificial mem-brane permeability assay (PAMPA) under sink conditions. Compounds were identified using CycLS, a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based method that uses stable isotopes to encode stereochemistry and matches MSMS data to virtual fragment libraries based on the expected macrocyclic products. From the compounds that were identified with high confidence, 823 hexameric and 1330 heptameric scaffolds had PAMPA permeability coefficients greater than 1x10-6 cm/s. The prevalence of high permeability compounds in these two libraries suggests that passive permeability is achievable for hexa- and heptapeptides with highly diverse backbone geometries.", "date": "2020-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thus, they offer an economical alternative to expensive conventional platinum or iridium-based OER catalysts and could provide a crucial step towards a hydrogen-based energy economy. These favorable properties are presumably due to a synergistic effect between Fe and Ni. However, these synergistic effects strongly depend on the local structure of the catalyst and their origin \u2013 and its relation to the local structure \u2013 are still not fully understood. In this work we present a study of the thermal annealing induced structural evolution of amorphous (Ni,Fe)Ox thin films, and correlate this evolution to their OER catalytic capabilities. Samples are x-ray amorphous at low annealing temperatures. However, analysis of the x-ray absorption spectra reveals local structural transitions in all samples \u2013 before the onset of cystalization \u2013 providing evidence of polyamorphism. Transitions of the local Ni and Fe environments occur at distinctly different temperatures and coincide with a stepwise increase in the catalytic activation potential (OER thermodynamics) and the</div><div>Tafel slope (OER kinetics), respectively. We previously have attributed the increase in onset potential to a change in active site in NiOx at the phase transition temperature; considering that the mixed metal oxides\u2019 onset potentials exhibit the same behavior with annealing temperature (Tanneal), we conclude that the potential-determining OER reaction step must occur at a Ni site. Similarly, the reaction kinetics change at the same annealing temperature as the local Fe environment; we thus infer that the rate-determining step occurs at a Fe site. To reconciliate these observations we put forward a dual-site OER reaction mechanism</div><div>with potential- and rate-determining steps happening at Ni and Fe sites, respectively. This synergistic effect is ultimately responsible for the superior OER performance of many (Ni,Fe)Ox catalysts. At higher annealing temperatures, the synergistic effect is suppressed, possibly by phase separation into NiOx and FeOx phases, as suggested by our XRD results.</div>", "date": "2020-12-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Unlike other 2D materials, BP with relatively low electronegativity and buckled structure favors the strong confinement of robust zero-valent palladium SACs in the vacancy site.

It is well known that the control of light intensity, the exact reaction temperature and other parameters are crucial for the success of a photochemical reaction. However, for most reactions reported in the literature, these parameters are not precisely controlled and recorded. As a result, the reproduction of these reactions is difficult and the progress in the field of photoredox chemistry is hampered by this limitation. To address this problem, a 3D-printed photoreactor was designed which can be easily replicated with a small number of inexpensive and easily available components. Equipped with thermoelectric coolers, the reactor can access and precisely control the temperature in the range of -17 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C, while reactions under high-intensity irradiation are performed with LED lamps from Kessil or HepatoChem. The practical design of the vial holder allows a versatile use of different reaction vessels - in addition to fast reaction optimization with up to eight vials simultaneously, upscaling in batch and flow is easily possible. Due to the high light intensity, the catalyst loading can be reduced to 0.1 mol% for large-scale reactions.

Detection\nwas performed using electrical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies and\nlocalized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The highest sensitivity was reached\nwith impedance spectroscopy, including using a low-cost (US$ 100) homemade\nimpedance analyzer. Complementary ssDNA sequences were detected with a\ndetection limit of 0.5 aM (0.3 copy/\u03bcL).\nThis performance may be attributed to the high sensitivity of the electrical\nimpedance technique combined with an appropriate arrangement of the sequences\non the electrodes and hybridization between the complementary sequences, as\ninferred from polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption\nspectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). The selectivity of the genosensor was confirmed by\nplotting the impedance spectroscopy data with a multidimensional projection\ntechnique (Interactive Document Mapping, IDMAP), where a clear separation was\nobserved among the samples of the complementary DNA sequence at various\nconcentrations and from buffer samples containing a non-complementary sequence\nand other DNA biomarkers. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 mimicking sequences was\nalso achieved with machine learning techniques applied to scanning electron\nmicroscope images taken from genosensors exposed to distinct concentrations of\nthe complementary ssDNA sequences. In summary, the genosensors proposed here\nare promising for detecting SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) in biological\nfluids in point-of-care settings. </p>", "date": "2020-12-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Electrochemical Analysis; Microscopy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

To directly interrogate the evolving nature of the electronic structure of proteins, we carry out 100-ps-scale <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics simulations of three representative small proteins with range-separated hybrid density functional theory. We quantify the nature and length-scale of the coupling of residue-specific charge probability distributions in these proteins. While some nonpolar residues exhibit expectedly narrow charge distributions, most polar and charged residues exhibit broad, multimodal distributions. Even for nonpolar residues, we observe sequence-specific deviations corresponding to charge accumulation or depletion that would be challenging to capture in a fixed charge force field. We quantify the effect of residue\u2013residue interactions on charge distributions first with linear cross-correlations. We then show how additional insight can be gained from evaluating the mutual information of charge distributions. We show that a significant number of residues couple most strongly with residues that are distant in both sequence and space over a range of secondary structures including a-helical, b-sheet, disulfide bridging, and lasso motifs.  The mutual information analysis is necessary to capture coupling between some polar and charged residues.

Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the meta-stable, pre-fusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, Molecular docking is employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex are analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations.

For complexes containing redox-noninnocent ligands, the oxidation state of the ligand can be ambiguous (i.e. their spectroscopic oxidation state can differ from the formal oxidation state), and thus frustrates the assignment of the oxidation state of the metal. A quantitative correlation between empirical metric data of redox active ligands and their oxidation states using a metrical oxidation state (MOS) model has been developed for catecholate and aminophenolate derived ligands by Brown. In the present work, we present a MOS model for 1,4-diazabutadiene (DAD<sup>n</sup>) ligands. The model is based on a similar approach as reported by Brown, correlating the intra-ligand bond lengths of the DAD<sup>n</sup> moiety in a quantitative manner to the MOS using geometrical information from X-ray structures in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) database. However, accurate determination of the MOS of these ligands turned-out to be dependent the coordination mode of the DAD<sup>2-</sup> moiety, which can adopt both a planar <i>\u03ba<sup>2</sup></i>-<i>N<sub>2</sub></i>-geometry and a <i>\u03b7<sup>4</sup></i>-<i>N<sub>2</sub></i>-<i>C<sub>2</sub></i> \u03c0-coordination mode in (transition) metal complexes in its doubly reduced, dianionic enediamide oxidation state. A reliable MOS model was developed taking the intrinsic differences in intra-ligand bond distances between these coordination modes of the DAD<sup>2\u2012</sup> ligand into account. Three different models were defined and tested using different geometric parameters (C=C\u2192M distance, M-N-C angle, M-N-C-C torsion angle) to describe the C=C backbone coordination to the metal in the <i>\u03b7<sup>4</sup></i>-<i>N<sub>2</sub></i>-<i>C<sub>2</sub></i> \u03c0-coordination mode of the DAD<sup>2\u2012</sup> ligand.

This irreversible PTM is regulated and catalyzed by proteases through hydrolysis reaction in the process of protein maturation or degradation. The identification of proteolytic substrates is pivotal in understanding the specificity of proteases and the physiological role of proteolytic process. However, tracking these biological phenomena in native cells is very difficult due to their low abundances. Currently, no efficient methods are available to identify proteolytic products from large-scale samples. To facilitate the targeted identification of low-abundant proteolytic products, we devise a strategy incorporating a novel biotinylated reagent PFP (pentafluorophenyl)-Rink-biotin to specifically target, enrich and identify proteolytic N-terminus. Within the PFP-Rink-biotin reagent, an MS-cleavable feature is designed to assist in the unambiguous confirmation of the enriched proteolytic N-termini. This is the first reported study of identifying proteolytic N-terminus by MS-cleavable feature widely adopted in studying low-abundant protein PTMs and cross-linking/MS. The proof-of-concept study was performed with multiple standard proteins whose N-terminus were successfully modified, enriched and identified by a signature ion (SI) in the MS/MS fragmentation, along with the determination of N-terminal peptide sequences by multistage tandem MS of the complementary fragment generated after the cleavage of MS-cleavable bond. For large-scale application, the enrichment and identification of protein N-termini from Escherichia.coli cells were demonstrated along with a bioinformatics workflow.

We find that aryl-fluorodiazirines react primarily through a carbene intermediate, while alkyl diazirines generate a reactive alkyl diazo intermediate on route to the carbene. The generation of a reactive diazo intermediate leads to preferential labeling of acidic amino acids in a pH-dependent manner. From a survey of 32 alkyl diazirine probes, we use this reactivity profile to rationalize why these probes preferentially enrich highly acidic proteins or those embedded in membranes and why probes with a net positive-charge tend to produce higher labeling yields.

The organic groups at the catalyst surface can modify not only its hydrophilicity, but also acidity, hydrothermal stability, porosity, etc. In some cases, such properties alteration leads to improved catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, or stability. However, the choice of organic groups stays relatively narrow, as most reports focus on pendant methyl groups. Here, a series of mesoporous hybrid aluminosilicate materials containing various organic groups was prepared in one pot by non-hydrolytic sol-gel (NHSG). Both aromatic and aliphatic, pendant and bridging organic groups were incorporated. The presence of the organic groups in the bulk and at the outermost surface of the materials was verified by solid-state NMR and ToF-SIMS, respectively. Aluminum is mostly incorporated in tetrahedral coordination in the hybrid silica matrix. The organically modified mesoporous aluminosilicate samples were tested as catalysts in the gas phase ethanol dehydration (which relies on solid acids) and most of them outperformed the purely inorganic catalyst benchmark. While a direct influence of surface hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity (as probed by water sorption and water contact angle measurements) appeared unlikely, characterization of acidity (IR-pyridine) revealed that the improved performance for hybrid catalysts can be correlated with a modification of the acidic properties. In turn, acidity is determined by the quality of the dispersion of Al centers in the form of isolated sites in the hybrid silica matrix. All in all, this study establishes a \"ranking\" for a variety of organic groups in terms of their effect on gas-phase ethanol dehydration to ethylene; ethylene yield decreases in this order: bridging xylylene \u2248 pendant methyl > pendant benzyl > bridging methylene \u2248 inorganic benchmark (no organic groups) > bridging ethylene.<br />", "date": "2020-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Acid Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the link between chemical structure and emissive behaviour is poorly understood due to the numerous interconnected factors which are at play in determining radiative and non-radiative behaviours at the solid state level. In particular, the decay through conical intersection dominates the nonadiabatic regions of the potential energy surface, and thus their accessibility is a telling indicator of the luminosity of the material. In this study, we investigate the radiative mechanism for five organic molecular crystals which display solid state emission, with a focus on the role of conical intersections in their photomechanisms. The objective is to situate the importance of the accessibility of conical intersections with regards to emissive behaviour, taking into account other nonradiative decay channels, namely vibrational decay, and exciton hopping. We begin by giving a brief overview of the structural patterns of the five systems within a larger pool of thirteen crystals for a richer comparison. We observe that due to the prevalence of sheet-like and herringbone packing in organic molecular crystals, the conformational diversity of crystal dimers is limited. Additionally, similarly spaced dimers have exciton coupling values of similar order within a 50 meV interval. Next, we focus on three exemplary cases, where we disentangle the role of nonradiative decay mechanisms and show how rotational minimum energy conical intersections in vacuum lead to puckered ones in crystal, increasing their instability upon crystallisation in typical packing motifs. In contrast, molecules with puckered conical intersections in vacuum tend to conserve this trait upon crystallisation, and therefore their quantum yield of fluorescence is determined predominantly by other nonradiative decay mechanisms.<br /></p>", "date": "2020-12-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Aggregates and Assemblies; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previous work on the co-assembly of ortho-phenylene foldamers with rod-shaped linkers has shown that folding and self-assembly affect each other; that is, the combination leads to new emergent behavior, such as access to otherwise unfavorable folding states. To this point this relationship has been passive. Here, we demonstrate control of self-assembly by manipulating the foldamers\u2019 conformational energy surfaces. A series of o-phenylene decamers and octamers have been assembled into macrocycles using imine condensation. Product distributions were analyzed by gel-permeation chromatography and molecular geometries extracted from a combination of NMR spectroscopy and computational chemistry. The assembly of o-phenylene decamers functionalized with alkoxy groups or hydrogens gives both [2+2] and [3+3] macrocycles. The mixture results from a subtle balance of entropic and enthalpic effects in these systems: the smaller [2+2] macrocycles are entropically favored but require the oligomer to misfold, whereas a perfectly folded decamer fits well within the larger [3+3] macrocycle that is entropically disfavored. Changing the substituents to fluoro groups, however, shifts assembly quantitatively to the [3+3] macrocycle products, even though the structural changes are well-removed from the functional groups directly participating in bond formation. The electron-withdrawing groups favor folding in these systems by strengthening arene\u2013arene stacking interactions, increasing the enthalpic penalty to misfolding. The architectural changes are substantial even though the chemical perturbation is small: analogous o-phenylene octamers do not fit within macrocycles when perfectly folded, and quantitatively misfold to give small macrocycles regardless of substitution. Taken together, these results represent both a high level of structural control in structurally complex foldamer systems and the demonstration of large-amplitude structural changes as a consequence of a small structural effects.", "date": "2020-12-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It looks that there is a certain mechanism controlling this phenomenon. However, the epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that this virus \u2013 water interaction mechanism is not effective enough to fully inhibit coronavirus reproduction. We hypothesized that a spatially extended layer of the ordered water molecules, formed around CoV due to the spike\u2019s glycans \u2013 surrounding water interaction acts as a buffer inhibiting CoV motion and its attachment to the host cell receptor. There is experimental evidence that water molecules while interacting with glucans experience the long-range ordering and repulsive forces. Our findings revealed new features that can promote its interaction. It was shown that the glycans and water molecules have the same far ultraviolet (UV) absorbance peak at ~185 nm. This peak is a manifestation of the still little-known physical properties possessed by hydroxyl (OH) groups, including those contained in glycans and water molecules. Many studies show that the carbohydrate hydroxyl groups are a key element in the long-range antifreeze glycoproteins activity which is closely correlated with our issue. To further increase ice inhibition, a sugar-based (usually trehalose) water solution, further slowing down the water dynamics is commonly used. Our experiments with sugar-based compounds dissolved in water showed that in such solutions the UV absorbance at ~185 nm (activity of the OH groups) can be essentially increased with respect to the bulk water. The spike\u2019s glycans \u2013 water long-range interaction, activated due to the dissolved sugar-based compound, creates the glass-like stabilizing hydration layer (like in case of the trehalose) effectively inhibiting the virus \u2013 host cell binding.

To this end, the unaltered r<sup>2</sup>SCAN functional is combined with a tailor-made <br />triple-zeta Gaussian AO-basis as well as with refitted D4 and gCP corrections for London-dispersion and basis-set superposition error. The performance of the new method is evaluated for the GMTKN55 thermochemical database covering large parts of chemical space with about 1500 <br />data points, as well as additional benchmarks for noncovalent interactions, organometallic reactions, lattice energies of organic molecules and ices, as well as for the adsorption on polar salt and non-polar coinage-metal surfaces. These comprehensive tests reveal a spectacular performance and robustness of r<sup>2</sup>SCAN-3c for reaction energies and noncovalent interactions in molecular and periodic systems, as well as outstanding conformational energies, and consistent structures. At just one tenth of the cost, r<sup>2</sup>SCAN-3c provides one of the best results of all semi-local DFT/QZ methods ever tested for the GMTKN55 benchmark database.

The perhaps most relevant remaining systematic deviation of r<sup>2</sup>SCAN-3c is due to self-interaction-error, owing to its mGGA nature. However, SIE is notably reduced compared to other (m)GGAs, as is demonstrated for several examples. After all, this remarkably efficient and robust method is chosen as our new group default, replacing previous low-level DFT and partially even expensive high-level methods in most standard applications for systems with up to several hundreds of atoms.<br /><br />", "date": "2020-12-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the area of C1 chemistry, the reaction between CO2 and CH4 to produce syngas, known as methane dry reforming (MDR), is attracting a lot of interest due to its green nature. On Pt(111), elevated temperatures are necessary to activate the reactants and massive deposition of carbon makes this metal surface ineffective for the MDR process. In this study, we show that strong metal-support interactions present in Pt/CeO2(111) and Pt/CeO2 powders lead to systems which can  bind well CO2 and CH4 at room temperature and are excellent and stable catalysts for the MDR process at moderate temperature (500 \u00baC). The behaviour of these systems was studied using a combination of in-situ/operando methods which pointed to an active Pt-CeO2-x interface. In this interface, the oxide is far from being a passive spectator. It modifies the chemical properties of Pt, facilitating improved methane dissociation, and is directly involved in the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 making the MDR catalytic cycle possible. A comparison of the benefits gained by the use of an effective metal-oxide interface and those obtained by plain bimetallic bonding indicates that the former is much more important when optimizing the C1 chemistry associated with CO2 and CH4 conversion. The presence of elements with a different chemical nature at the metal-oxide interface opens the possibility for truly cooperative interactions in the activation of C-O and C-H bonds.", "date": "2020-12-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, evaluating a COF for its methane capacity involves multiple experimental or computational steps, which is expensive and time consuming.

Here we developed equations for super-fast prediction of deliverable methane capacities of COFs from a small number (3 to 7) of physically meaningful and measurable crystallographic features.  We provided a set of equations with different fidelities for on-demand predictions based on the accessibility of crystallographic features.

RT-PCR is a known, reliable method for COVID-19 diagnostics which can differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. However, PCR is location dependent, time consuming and relatively expensive. Thus, there is a need for a more flexible method which may be produced in an off-the-shelf format and distributed more widely. Paper-based immunoassays can fulfill this function. Here we present the first steps towards a paper-based test which can differentiate between different between the Spike protein of various coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and CoV-HKU1 with negligible cross reactivity for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E in a single assay which takes less than 30 minutes.

This is done by an altered assay design with four test line locations where each antigen builds a unique, identifiable binding pattern.

The concept of bioorthogonal pretargeting has attracted considerable interest, in particular for the targeted delivery of radionuclides and drugs. In nuclear medicine, pretargeting can provide increased target-to-background ratios at early time-points compared to traditional approaches. This reduces the radiation burden to healthy tissue and, depending on the selected radionuclide, enables better imaging contrast or higher therapeutic efficiency. Moreover, bioorthogonally triggered cleavage of pretargeted antibody-drug conjugates represents an emerging strategy to achieve controlled release and locally increased drug concentrations. The toolbox of bioorthogonal reactions has significantly expanded in the past decade, with the tetrazine ligation being the fastest and one of the most versatile <i>in vivo</i> chemistries. Progress in the field, however, relies heavily on the development and evaluation of (radio)labeled compounds, preventing the use of compound libraries for systematic studies. The rational design of tetrazine probes and triggers has thus been impeded by the limited understanding of the impact of structural parameters on the <i>in vivo</i> ligation performance. In this work, we describe the development of a pretargeted blocking assay that allows for the investigation of the <i>in vivo</i> fate of a structurally diverse library of 45 unlabeled tetrazines and their capability to reach and react with pretargeted <i>trans</i>-cyclooctene (TCO)-tagged antibodies in tumor-bearing mice.

Click-radiolabeling gave access to a set of selected <sup>18</sup>F-labeled tetrazines, including highly reactive scaffolds, which were used in pretargeted PET imaging studies to confirm the results from the blocking study. These insights thus enable the rational design of tetrazine probes for <i>in vivo</i> application and will thereby assist the clinical translation of bioorthogonal pretargeting.</p>", "date": "2020-12-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The\ncompound set was specifically designed to probe interactions with the kinase hinge-binding\nresidues. These compounds were evaluated in vitro in biochemical and cellular assays for\nCAMKK2 inhibition. Compared to GSK650394 and STO-609, thirteen of our compounds\ndisplayed similar or better CAMKK2 inhibitory potency in vitro, while compounds 13g and 45\nhad greatly improved selectivity for CAMKK2 across the kinome. Our systematic survey of hinge\nbinding chemotypes identified several potent and selective inhibitors of CAMKK2 to serve as\nstarting points for medicinal chemistry programs aimed at the identification of CAMKK2 chemical\nprobes and clinical candidates<br /></div>", "date": "2020-12-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Yet, accurate prediction of torsion energy\nprofiles remains a challenging task as current molecular mechanics methods are\nlimited by insufficient coverage of druglike chemical space and accurate quantum\nmechanical (QM) methods are too expensive. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce TorsionNet, a deep neural network (DNN) model\nspecifically developed to predict small molecule torsion energy profiles\nwith QM-level accuracy. We applied active learning to identify nearly 50k\nfragments (with elements H, C, N, O, F, S, and Cl) that maximized the coverage\nof our corporate library and leveraged massively parallel cloud computing\nresources to perform DFT torsion scan of these fragments, generating a training\ndataset of 1.2 million DFT energies.

Importantly, our method also provides\na direct estimate of the uncertainty in the predicted profiles without any\nadditional calculations. In this report, we show that TorsionNet can reliably identify\nthe preferred dihedral geometries observed in crystal structures. We also present\npractical applications of TorsionNet that demonstrate how consideration of DNN-based\nstrain energy leads to substantial improvement in existing lead discovery and\ndesign workflows.

Specifically, because there do not exist any functional group or material-specific terahertz transitions, it is not possible to interpret experimental spectra without additional analysis, specifically, computational simulations. Over the years simulations utilizing periodic boundary conditions have proven to be most successful for reproducing experimental terahertz dynamics, due to the ability of the calculations to accurately take long-range forces into account.

Although numerous urine normalization methods have been implemented (e.g., creatinine, specific gravity \u2013 SG), most are manual and therefore not practical for population-based studies. To address this issue, we developed a method to measure SG in 96-well-plates using a refractive index detector (RID), which exhibited accuracy within 85-115% and <3.4% precision. Bland-Altman statistics showed a mean deviation of -0.0001 SG units (limits of agreement: -0.0014-0.0011) relative to a hand held refractometer. Using this RID-based SG normalization, we developed an automated LC MS workflow for untargeted urinary metabolomics in 96-well-plate format. The workflow uses positive and negative ionization HILIC chromatography and acquires mass spectra in data independent acquisition (DIA) mode at 3 collision energies. Five technical internal standards (tISs) were used to monitor data quality in each method, all of which demonstrated raw coefficients of variation (CVs) <10% in the quality controls (QCs) and <20% in the samples for a small cohort (n=87 samples, n=22 QCs). Application in a large cohort (n=842 urine samples, n=248 QCs), demonstrated CVQC<5% and CVsamples<16% for 4/5 tISs after signal drift correction by cubic spline regression.

It is now widely appreciated that the phonon-gas model does not describe the full vibrational spectrum in amorphous materials, since this picture likely breaks down at higher frequencies. A two-channel heat conduction model, which uses harmonic vibrational states and lattice dynamics as a basis, has recently been shown to capture both crystal-like (phonon-gas channel) and amorphous-like (diffuson channel) heat conduction. While materials design principles for the phonon-gas channel are well established, similar understanding and control of the diffuson channel is lacking.  In this work, in order to uncover design principles for  the diffuson channel, we study structurally-complex crystalline Yb<sub>14</sub>(Mn,Mg)Sb<sub>11</sub>, a champion thermoelectric material above 800 K, experimentally using inelastic neutron scattering and computationally using the two-channel lattice dynamical approach. Our results show that the diffuson channel indeed dominates in Yb14MgSb<sub>11</sub> above 300 K. More importantly, we demonstrate a method for the rational design of amorphous-like heat conduction by considering the energetic proximity phonon modes and modifying them through chemical means. We show that increasing (decreasing) the mass on the Sb-site decreases (increases) the energy of these modes such that there is greater (smaller) overlap with Yb-dominated modes resulting in a higher (lower) thermal conductivity. This design strategy is exactly opposite of what is expected when the phonon-gas channel and/or common analytical models for the diffuson channel are considered, since in both cases an increase in atomic mass commonly leads to a decrease in thermal conductivity. This work demonstrates how two-channel lattice dynamics can not only quantitatively predict the relative importance of the phonon-gas and diffuson channels, but also lead to rational design strategies in materials where the diffuson channel is important.  </pre></pre>", "date": "2020-12-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Thermal Conductors and Insulators", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is a software suite developed to automatically generate such models by incorporating and extrapolating from a database of known thermochemical and kinetic parameters. Here, we present the recent version 3 release of RMG and highlight improvements since the previously published description of RMG v1.0. One important change is that RMG v3.0 is now Python 3 compatible, which supports the most up-to-date versions of cheminformatics and machine learning packages that RMG depends on. Additionally, RMG can now generate heterogeneous catalysis models, in addition to the previously available gas- and liquid-phase capabilities. For model analysis, new methods for local and global uncertainty analysis have been implemented to supplement first-order sensitivity analysis. The RMG database of thermochemical and kinetic parameters has been significantly expanded to cover more types of chemistry. The present release also includes parallelization for reaction generation and on-the-fly quantum calculations, and a new molecule isomorphism approach to improve computational performance. Overall, RMG v3.0 includes many changes which improve the accuracy of the generated chemical mechanisms and allow for exploration of a wider range of chemical systems.", "date": "2020-12-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The \u03b11 phase was attributed to adsorption on step sites, while the \u03b12 and \u03b13 phases were assigned to adsorption on terrace sites under different local molecular densities. A physical model was constructed to describe the desorption kinetics from each of the three monolayer phases, including intermolecular repulsion from interfacial dipoles produced as a result of charge transfer bonding between pentacene and the Ag substrate.

It was found that as the temperatures of the synthesis increase, the specific surface areas of the ZnO-SnO2 composites decrease, which would decrease their photocatalytic activities due to decreased adsorption of the dye on the surface of the composites; while their crystallinity increases, which would increase their photocatalytic activities due to the smaller concentration of defects and thus improved mobility of the charge carriers.

Filling with chemically-inert atoms provides an idealised model for isolating the effects of the fillers from the impact of redox changes to the host electronic structure. A range of analysis techniques are proposed to estimate the filler rattling frequencies, to quantify the separate impacts of the filler on the phonon group velocities and lifetimes, and to show how changes to the phonon spectra and interaction strengths lead to suppressed lifetimes. The noble-gas fillers are found to reduce the thermal conductivity of the CoSb3 framework by up to 15 % primarily by suppressing the group velocities of low-lying optic modes. The filler rattling frequencies are determined by a detailed balance of increasing atomic mass and stronger interactions with the framework, and are found to be a good predictor of the impact on the heat transport. Lowering the rattling frequency below ~1.5 THz by selecting heavy fillers that interact weakly with the framework is predicted to lead to a much larger suppression of the thermal transport, by inducing avoided crossings in the acoustic-mode dispersion and facilitating enhanced scattering and a consequent large reduction in phonon lifetimes. Approximate rattling frequencies determined from the harmonic force constants may therefore provide a useful metric for selecting filler atoms to optimise the thermal transport in skutterudites and other cage compounds such as clathrates.", "date": "2020-12-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Thermal Conductors and Insulators; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The protocol has been validated with an external validation set and applied to five modafinil and its derivatives to set the order of binding affinity to Adenosine A2A receptors (ADORA2A, A2aR), which is a membrane protein, for a case study. This protocol could be time efficient and useful for computational drug discovery where limited experimental data is available.", "date": "2020-12-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemoinformatics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Antibodies can also have catalytic activity, although the contribution of catalysis to their biological functions has been more difficult to establish. With the ubiquity of catalytic antibodies against glycans virtually unknown, we sought to advance this knowledge. The use of a glycan microarray allowed epitope mapping of several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the capsule of <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. From this, we designed and synthesized two glycan based F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) probes, which we used to discover antibodies with innate glycosidase activity and analyse their enzyme kinetics, including mAb 2H1, a polysaccharide lyase, and the most efficient glycosidase to date. The validity of the FRET assay was confirmed by demonstrating that the mAbs mediate glycosidase activity on intact cryptococcal capsules, as observed by a reduction in capsule diameter. Further the mAb 18B7, a glycosidase hydrolase, resulted in the appearance of reducing ends in the capsule as labelled by hydroxylamine-armed fluorescent (HAAF) probe. Finally, we demonstrate that exposing <i>C. neoformans </i>cells to catalytic antibodies results in changes in complement deposition and increased phagocytosis by macrophages \u2014 suggesting the anti-phagocytic properties of the capsule have been impaired.

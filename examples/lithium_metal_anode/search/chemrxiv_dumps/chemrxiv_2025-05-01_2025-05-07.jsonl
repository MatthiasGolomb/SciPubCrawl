The primary objective is to generate accurate image captions that describe the content of images, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for the visually impaired. We systematically analyze the architecture of our model, which consists of three main components: a CNN for feature extraction, an LSTM for sequence generation, and a mechanism for sentence formulation. By employing transfer learning with the Inception v3 architecture, we enhance the model's performance while reducing computational costs. Our experiments utilize the Flickr8k dataset, which comprises 8,000 images, each accompanied by five descriptive sentences. We introduce a simplified version of Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) as an alternative to LSTMs, demonstrating comparable performance with fewer parameters, thus improving training efficiency. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, which quantifies the quality of generated captions against reference sentences. Results indicate that our architecture achieves a BLEU score of aprox 80% on the training set and approx 75% on the test set, showcasing its capability to produce semantically and grammatically correct captions. Additionally, we explore the integration of attention mechanisms to enhance the model's focus on relevant image features during caption generation. The findings suggest that our approach not only meets the challenges of automatic image captioning but also holds potential for broader applications in image understanding and navigation systems. Future work will involve expanding the dataset and refining the model to further improve accuracy and robustness in diverse scenarios.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While \u00b5 is a key factor of TFT performance and can be tackled by molecular design of OSCs, threshold voltage (Vth) significantly impacts operational voltage and power consumption in integrated circuits and is typically controlled by device engineering. A traditional Vth tuning method involves interfacial modifications of gate-dielectric surface by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with different dipolar characters. Yet, the SAM is less compatible with printed electronics using polymeric gate dielectrics. Therefore, controlling Vth through OSC material design is of interest. This work demonstrates that Vth in sin-gle-crystal OSCs can be effectively modulated by engineering the dipolar character of side-chain substituents which are widely employed in solution-processable OSCs. To validate this concept, we focused on 3,4,9,10-benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8-gh]quinolinetetracarboxylic diimide (BQQDI) derivatives because they have formed compara-ble layered brickwork packing structures mostly irrespective of the side-chain structures. Stemming from the bench-marked, phenethyl-substituted BQQDI (PhC2\u2212BQQDI), here, three PhC2\u2212BQQDI analogues with mono-fluorination at the ortho, meta or para position of the phenyl ring were synthesized. These compounds were designed to maintain isostruc-tural crystal packing while varying the dipolar character of the side chains. In solution-processed single-crystal TFTs, obvious Vth shifts depending on the fluorine substitution position were found. By crystal structure and computational analyses, the Vth shift was correlated with the dipolar character of the side chains at the OSC\u2212gate dielectric interface. This side-chain-engineered dipolar effect is not only useful for Vth control in TFTs but also proposes new avenues for de-signing high-performance OSCs and various thin-film devices with tailored interfacial properties.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Aggregates and Assemblies; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The development of efficient, reliable, and low-cost diagnostics is critical for identifying cell-to-cell inconsistencies and subtle differences for both factory-manufactured and second-life recycled batteries. To this end, this study presents a multi-channel and multi-frequency electrical excitation response (MMER) technique, containing the same impedance information as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), but capable of screening multiple batteries in one second. The MMER technique significantly reduces measurement time from several minutes per EIS measurement \u2014 which scales with the number of cells \u2014 to just one second for the entire module. A comparative analysis between individual multi-frequency voltage responses and individual EIS reveals that multi-frequency voltage responses provide equivalent results of battery consistency and performance rankings compared to EIS, with reduced measurement time from ten or more minutes to several seconds. Furthermore, the integration of multi-channel technology enables simultaneous measurement of multiple batteries, maintaining measurement time comparable to that of a single cell, independent of the number of batteries. This approach not only enhances the screening efficiency but also eliminates errors associated with repeated set-up of individual tests. The diagnostic results from MMER align with true performance characteristics obtained from the discharge profile. The proposed technique offers a practical solution for pilot/industrial-scale battery diagnostics and holds potential for broader applications in any electrochemical device, such as fuel cells or electrolysers.

In this study, we explore the modification of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) using molten salt methods to enhance its piezoelectric properties for H2 and H2O2 production from water without any co-catalysts or sacrificial agents. A one-pot synthesis approach was used to anchor Sn-based species onto g-C3N4. During thermal pyrolysis, SnCl2 facilitated the exfoliation of the g-C3N4 layer. The oxidation of SnCl2 and its interaction with g-C3N4 promoted the formation of g-C3N4/Sn-based composites. The synergistic interaction between exfoliated, defect-rich g-C3N4 and non-piezoelectrically active Sn species leads to a significant enhancement of the piezoelectric effect compared to pristine g-C3N4. Notably, the g-C3N4/Sn-based composites achieved superior H2 (3846.46 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) and H2O2 (999.11 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) production rates from pure water.

Localized in vivo sampling identified extracellular peptides from secretogranin-1, ProSAAS, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and others. Minimal tissue damage, enabled by probe dimensions of 75\u00d715 \u03bcm\u00b2, resulted in the detection of only one structural peptide (JIP-2), indicating low intracellular contamination. Many detected secretory peptides correlated with strong local mRNA expression; however, the detection of POMC-derived peptides, despite negligible local expression, suggests long-distance peptide transport or extracellular processing. To expand peptide identification, a discovery-to-targeted peptidomics approach was developed, revealing 46 peptides from 24 proteins in dialysate samples, including 10 proteins with low local expression. Complementary S1 tissue analysis confirmed POMC peptides and showed that 17% of 304 prohormone-derived peptides had low local expression.

Consequently, structure-dependent multiscale modeling is required to accurately capture the interaction of CO2 with the various Ni facets and to provide accurate atomistic insights. While mean-field multiscale models can be constructed that account for multiple active facets, almost all of these studies neglect the diffusion of adsorbates between the facets. In this study, we close the gap by extending the open-source Cantera toolkit with capabilities for surface diffusion in mean-field microkinetic models, making it the first widely adopted software tool that includes these features.  We developed a thermodynamically consistent microkinetic model for a Ni nanoparticle consisting of Ni(111), Ni(100), Ni(211), and Ni(110) using data from DFT calculations and single-crystal experiments to unravel the interaction of CO2 with these facets through the simulation of temperature-programmed desorption profiles.  Including surface diffusion and coverage effects into the mean-field microkinetic model leads to a significantly improved agreement between experiments from a Ni/SiO2 catalyst and the simulations.  Using a rigorous correlated uncertainty quantification of all structural and energetic parameters, we found a detailed chemical model within the uncertainty space that is in excellent agreement with the recorded CO2 desorption profile. This model highlights that Ni(110), which contributes only to a small extent to the overall Ni surface area, dominates the desorption pattern and that surface diffusion reactions play a crucial role.  The implemented surface diffusion into Cantera is generic and can be applied to other (mixed) metal nanoparticles and metal/metal oxide interfaces, providing a step towards closing the material gap.

Emerging fabrication techniques, including microfluidics, 3D printing, and electrospinning, have further expanded the design flexibility, enabling spatially organized, heterogeneous constructs resembling the complex architecture of native tissues.

We analyzed the veralipride Cp\u2013time profiles of 12 participants at 189 time points. The ML algorithms random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) were used. PPK analysis was also performed using established a two-compartment model with two absorption sites, incorporating either additive or additive plus multiplicative error models. In our ML model, we used the Cp data at 0.5, 3, and 24 h (final time point) post veralipride administration from one participant and the data at all time points from other participants. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) was conducted to evaluate the predictive models. We observed that the first and second peaks occurred after approximately 0.5 and 3 h of administration, respectively. Pre-evaluation using all the data for model development showed that the PPK(additive) model visually reproduced the double-peak profiles; however, on performing LOSO-CV, only the ML models predicted them. Compared with the actual values associated with double peaks, PPK showed discrepancies of 44.0% (additive model) and 58.4% (additive + multiplicative model), whereas ML exhibited discrepancies of 34.7% (RF) and 33.0% (GB), indicating better reproduction of the observed double-peak profiles by ML. The application of ML to drugs with complex Cp\u2013time profiles in clinical settings can improve the Cp prediction accuracy.", "date": "2025-05-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

CH-bonding receptors, which rely on nonclassical CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5anion hydrogen bonds, offer a pH-independent alternative to traditional hydrogen-bonding hosts; however, their design is challenged by the inherently weak nature of CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5anion interactions. This study presents modified resorcin[4]arenes as versatile scaffolds to address this challenge. By the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the upper rim, we effectively convert electron-rich resorcin[4]arenes into potent anion receptors. A series of resorcin[4]arenes bearing -Br, -CHO, -NO2, and -CN substituents exhibit a systematic enhancement in anion binding affinity, reaching a record value for the CN-substituted receptor: Ka (Cl\u207b, THF) = 7\u00d710\u2075 M\u22121. The logKa values of this series of receptors correlate strongly with the electrostatic potential (ESP) at the anion binding site, calculated by DFT methods. In addition, incorporating hydroxyl-terminated alkyl chains at the lower rim promotes the formation of higher-order complexes and further boosts anion binding, even in competitive aqueous\u2013organic media. Notably, these hydroxyalkyl-footed receptors display exceptional selectivity for HSO4\u2212, with a selectivity factor of 17 over similar tetrahedral oxyanions. Transmembrane anion transport studies in large unilamellar vesicles reveal that the nitro-substituted resorcin[4]arene is by far the most effective chloride transporter in this series, followed by the CN-substituted one, emphasizing that the most strongly binding receptors are not necessarily the most efficient transporters.

This strategy yields very promising results, with essentially no degradation of the conformational properties of a broad range of DNA (and a ds-RNA) sequences, and a strong improvement of both monovalent ion retention in G-quadruplexes and divalent ion pairing.

Gold (Au) co-catalysts are often employed as catalytic active sites in photocatalytic material designs. However, little is known about the effect of Au particle size, particularly in different size domains (cluster vs nanoparticle), on photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Here we employed Au9 clusters and Au101 nanoparticles supported on sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (SCN) to study the size effects on the photocatalytic performance in H2O2 synthesis. Au101/SCN exhibits the highest photoactivity with H2O2 production rate 19.5 mM h-1 g-1 followed by SCN (16.2 mM h-1 g-1) and Au9/SCN (13.6 mM h-1 g-1). Transient photocurrent response and photoluminescence spectroscopy indicate that gold loaded SCN (both Au9/SCN and Au101/SCN) has higher efficiency of charge carrier generation and separation compared to pure SCN. A kinetic analysis revealed that Au9/SCN catalyzes the fastest H2O2 decomposition (high kd) leading to a reduced overall H2O2 yield despite having higher charge generation and separation efficiency than SCN. The findings from this work show that better charge carrier generation, separation and transfer alone is not enough to warrant higher photoactivity in H2O2 synthesis because the rate of H2O2 decomposition supersedes the charge carrier properties.

Enhancing the performance of n-type OMIECs is crucial for advancing next-generation technologies that rely on mixed conduction, including bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and energy storage. Here, we investigate how blending two n-type conjugated polymers with oligoglycol and alkyl side chains impacts OECT performance. Specifically, we examine NDI(biOE2)-T2, which has branched oligoglycol side chains, and N2200, which has branched alkyl side chains. Blending these polymers in a 90:10 NDI(biOE2)-T2:N2200 ratio results in a twofold increase in the electronic mobility volumetric capacitance product (\u03bcC*) compared to pure NDI(biOE2)-T2. However, at higher N2200 concentrations, the \u03bcC* product declines sharply.

These updates are obtained from forces that are computed traditionally from physics-based Hamiltonians, and more recently from machine-learned (ML) numerical forms. An alternative strategy that is being explored is to predict velocity updates from ML models without concerning with energy or force calculations. The key advantages of this strategy are that bypassing force calculations, especially when dealing with quantum mechanical Hamiltonians, should effectively speed up MD simulations, and such ML predictors can also be trained on the fly. Here we take this development to the next stage by showing how ML velocity predictors can be incorporated into MD integrators to propagate trajectories accurately. In addition, we explore a new type of ML velocity predictor that is trained exclusively on historical particle velocities, where we exploit the fact that particle velocities are inherently auto-correlated in time. We show how stacked long short-term memory neural networks can be trained to accomplish these tasks and propagate trajectories that conserve energy, structure and dynamics. The fascinating aspect is that structure and energies are conserved without actually predicting them directly. Trajectories do tend to accumulate errors upon continual use of ML velocity predictions, despite velocity prediction accuracy being greater than 99.9%. Nevertheless, we show that error accumulation can be controlled and MD stability can be rescued by making periodic injections of velocity updates computed from Hamiltonians (frequency \u2264 0.01). We propose this proof-of-concept machine-learned MD (MLMD) protocol using a series of harmonic oscillators, laying the foundation necessary to extending its applications to complex systems.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, current paraptosis agents face critical challenges, including poor targeting specificity, limited imaging capability, and low therapeutic efficacy. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel approach by functionalizing the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) unit at the meso position of xanthene dyes, enabling the synthesis of two sterically hindered regioisomeric fluorescent paraptosis-inducing agents (m-TSX and p-TSX) for mitochondria-targeted chemo-photodynamic anticancer therapy. These agents exhibited strong near-infrared (NIR) emissions (~663 nm) with a quantum yield of up to 82.9%. The TPE substitution, in contrast to the phenyl group, allowed for precise modulation of triplet excited state energy levels, boosting type I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and notable enhancement of the\nparaptotic anticancer activity. Comparative studies of the meta and para-substituted regioisomers revealed that the metasubstituted m-TSX exhibited superior ROS generation and anticancer behavior. m-TSX effectively induced Alix/ATF4-regulated paraptosis, along with apoptosis and necrosis, while also triggering GPX4/SLC7A11-regulated ferroptosis under low-power 655 nm laser (0.1 W/cm2) irradiation, leading to effective cancer cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, in vivo chemo-photodynamic therapy against HeLa tumor by inducing multiple cell death pathways was successfully achieved.

The results revealed a notable consistency in the effects of ions with a specific charge at one end of Sorensen's pH scale, compared to the influence of ions with the opposite charge at the other end. The data analysis demonstrated that the pH shift is primarily influenced by the electrostatic forces exerted by the ions and the concentration of ionic particles within the solution. Interestingly, this shift appeared to be independent of the degree of dissociation of either acetic acid or ammonia.\nThese results led to a reinterpretation of electrolytic dissociation. Therefore, I propose a theory that explains the behavior of electrolytes in aqueous solutions based on three premises: (i) electrolyte molecules, once dissolved in water, fully dissociate; (ii) when the electrolyte contains H\u207a or OH\u207b ions, those species become part of the solvent and propagate throughout the entire solution; and (iii) the movement of these charged species (H\u207a or OH\u207b) is significantly influenced by the electrostatic forces exerted by the ions in solution, as described by classical physics.\nThis theory is consistent with the experimental observations and clarifies the unusual impact of the common ion. Furthermore, these considerations support the notion that water contains a persistent population of molecules resulting from its auto-dissociation, which propagates throughout the entire volume of the solution.\n", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Most electrochemical systems rely on a liquid electrolyte to conduct electrical current through the concerted motion of ions. Ideally, this liquid phase remains chemically stable under the applied potential. Among all solvents, water (H2O), unsurprisingly, was the first used for electrochemical systems due to its non-toxicity, abundance, and exceptional ability to dissolve and dissociate ionic salts. Despite its early dominance, research shifted toward nonaqueous electrolytes\u2014such as organic solvents and ionic liquids\u2014because of their wider electrochemical stability windows, enabling the deposition of a broader range of materials. However, interest in electrochemical crystallization from aqueous electrolytes has resurged; this is largely driven by two factors. First, water\u2019s environmental friendliness makes it attractive for large-scale and sustainable applications. Second, water\u2019s inherent reactivity\u2014primarily due to spontaneous proton production (H_2 O \u2194 H^+  + \u3016OH\u3017^-)\u2014presents both challenges and, counterintuitively, unique opportunities. In particular, recent research into emerging aqueous battery chemistries based on in-situ electrochemical crystallization of metals such as Zn, Cu, and Sn at the anode, and compounds like MnO2 at the cathode has offered exciting new insights into the associated complex interfacial phenomena. Drawing in part on advances from the battery field, this Review aims to offer perspectives on tailoring aqueous systems for the electrochemical synthesis of crystalline matter. In contrast to nonaqueous systems, the proton-induced reactivity in aqueous electrolytes introduces additional complexities. Continuous gas generation and pH-induced precipitation can lead to porous, passivating interphases, posing significant challenges to precise control. However, this same proton activity also enables the formation of a diverse library of materials\u2014such as oxides and hydroxides\u2014that are often inaccessible through nonaqueous electrochemical paths. These aqueous crystallization processes offer a cost-effective and highly controllable approach for synthesizing critical materials for energy and sustainability applications such as electrochemical energy storage. In this Review, we first explore the key physicochemical processes involved in aqueous electro-crystallization of metals, a simpler group of materials with well-defined lattice structures and stoichiometries. We then turn our attention to critical considerations for growing more complex compounds, characterized by intricate lattice symmetries and stoichiometries. We argue that achieving precision control in aqueous electrochemical crystallization requires a holistic understanding of proton activity, its influence on crystallization, and the ability to regulate interfacial chemical kinetics and transport phenomena across multiple length scales. With such control, electrochemical crystallization in aqueous systems offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the precision synthesis of materials essential to energy technologies and sustainability.", "date": "2025-05-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While these algorithms improve quantification and reduce processing time, we hypothesize that they alter statistical comparisons between samples when samples are searched together. Herein, we search different cleanup methods or single proteins separately versus together in Progenesis Qi for proteomics database searching software. Our results show that searching samples together increases the number of identifications by each sample, enhances protein similarity between samples, and leads to false transfers.

Drugs that enhance the action of GABAARs are used to treat epilepsy, anxiety and other conditions but their therapeutic action is often limited by sedation because their binding sites are the same as those used by sedatives and general anesthetics. With the exception of the benzodiazepines, which only act on synaptic GABAARs that contain one \u03b3-subunit, little progress has been made on this problem. Recently, it was shown that certain spiro-barbiturates can reverse the action of anesthetics on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs.

Its abnormal activation is closely related to various myeloproliferative neoplasms and inflammatory diseases. Developing selective JAK2 inhibitors is an important direction in drug discovery. Accurate prediction of compound inhibitory activity (pIC50) against JAK2 is crucial for accelerating the discovery and optimization of lead compounds. Objective: This study aims to utilize public resources from the ChEMBL database, combined with machine learning methods, to build a computational model capable of efficiently and accurately predicting the pIC50 values of JAK2 inhibitors. Methods: We collected compounds targeting human JAK2 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL2971) and their IC50 (nM) activity data from the ChEMBL database. After data cleaning (retaining only precise values with standard_relation = '=') and standardization (converting IC50 to pIC50, retaining the average pIC50 for duplicate compounds), a dataset containing 5546 compounds was finally obtained. RDKit (version 2022.9.5) was used to calculate Morgan fingerprints (radius=2, 2048 bits), MACCS Keys fingerprints (167 bits), and 13 physicochemical and topological descriptors. Based on feature importance calculated during the data processing phase (derived from preliminary model evaluation), the top 350 features were selected. However, due to the absence of some features in the current dataset, the final model used 345 features. The dataset was randomly split into training (n=4436) and test sets (n=1110) at an 80:20 ratio. The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, version 3.0.0) algorithm was used to build the prediction model, and hyperparameters (learning_rate, max_depth, subsample, colsample_bytree, gamma, reg_alpha, reg_lambda) were optimized using 5-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV. An early stopping strategy was employed during the final model training to prevent overfitting. Results: After hyperparameter optimization, the final XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive performance on the independent test set, achieving a coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) of 0.7184, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.5968, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.4593. Performance metrics on the training set (R\u00b2=0.8978) also indicated a good model fit, and the gap between training and test set performance was within an acceptable range, suggesting that overfitting was effectively controlled. Conclusion: This study successfully constructed an XGBoost-based prediction model for JAK2 inhibitor pIC50. Utilizing easily accessible molecular descriptors, the model demonstrated high prediction accuracy and robustness on an external test set. This model holds promise as an efficient virtual screening tool to aid the early discovery and optimization process of JAK2 inhibitors.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Established mechanisms and verified material candidates for ultrafast magnetic transitions in semiconducting magnets remain limited. Using density-functional theory (DFT) and real-time time-dependent DFT simulations, we demonstrate that spin-selective charge transfer across van der Waals layers, enabled by type-II bipolar band alignment, offers a robust way to control the magnetic order on the femtosecond timescale. In a representative CrSBr/CrSCl heterostructure, an antiferromagnetic-to-ferrimagnetic transition can be triggered within 40-56 fs under laser excitation above 4.2\u202feV, generating a net magnetic moment of ~1 \u00b5B per unit cell. The transition originates from a spin-flip charge transfer from spin-up valence states in CrSBr into spin-down conduction states in CrSCl. The resulting asymmetric demagnetization stabilizes residual spin polarization in CrSCl and induces a net magnetic moment. Additionally, electronic anisotropy facilitates an optically polarization-dependent charge redistribution, showing the main contribution from surface Cl atoms upon b-polarized excitation, while under a-polarized excitation the donation stems from interfacial Cr atoms. Our findings of spin-selective interlayer charge flow based on band alignment and symmetry breaking present a general mechanism for ultrafast optical control of magnetic order in low-dimensional materials.

As a reference, we use the \u0394CCSD(T) (coupled-cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples) approach. Our results show that the single-shot GW (G0W0) approximation achieves an accuracy comparable to that of higher-level wave function methods.

Four classes of neutral complexes were examined, based on -diketiminate, bis(imino)carbazolate (pincer), cyclopentadienide, and monocoordinate aryl ligands. Also examined was a set of N,N-diaryl-1,4-diazabutadiene dianion-coordinated triel(I) anions. For four of the five series, the ionization potential of the Ga-based lone pairs was found to be nearly 1 eV or more higher than that of Al-based lone pairs in similar species; the IPs for In were found to hover around the values calculated for Ga. This remarkable effect is thought to be an electronic manifestation of scandide contraction, which results in stabilization of the 4s and 4p subshells due to poor screening by the filled 3d subshell. Only for the aryl series was this effect found to be quite muted, apparently because these complexes do not harbor a genuine metal-based lone pair. Instead, the HOMO consists of a metal-carbon -antibonding orbital, spread over multiple atoms. The calculations also underscore the major role of the supporting ligand in modulating the electronic properties of trielylenes and help explain why certain species such as Al(I) bis(imino)carbazolates might not be stable enough to permit isolation.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, traditional methods often struggle with efficiency due to the limited availability of experimental data and insufficient understanding of polymer microstructures, particularly in few-shot leraning scenarios for amorphous polymers. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel paradigm based on \"local clusters\", structural motifs whose properties are efficiently computed using quantum chemistry (QC) methods. These clusters, simulated across multiple scales, serve as key descriptors that encapsulate essential microstructural features of polymers. By integrating these QC-derived descriptors with graph convolutional networks (GNNs) or neural networks (NNs), we have developed Locluster, a multiscale, microstructure-driven predictive model tailored for data-scarce environments in amorphous polymer research. Notably, Locluster requires only 2\u20135 descriptors and as few as two dozen training samples to accurately predict critical polymer properties, including density, refractive index, dielectric constant, and glass transition temperature.

All photosynthetic reaction centers (Photosystems I, II, Heliobacter, and bacterial reaction centers (bRCs)) have their charge separating cofactors arranged with two, c2-symmetric paths from primary donor to terminal acceptor. In Type II reaction centers (PSII and bRCs), electrons utilize only one active branch. In bRCs the electron transfer occurs in the A branch from the excited state of dimer P860 through BChlA, BPhA, to QA, and then to the B-branch QB. B-branch BChlB and BPhB do not participate. A similar path is found in PSII. These proteins challenge our understanding of how proteins can turn on or off the activity of bound ligands. The shift of the electrochemical midpoint potential (Em) of each cofactor by the protein environment is calculated using the continuum electrostatics within the MultiConformation Continuum Electrostatic program (MCCE). In bRCs from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the electrostatic potentials favor reduction of the active branch cofactors. The residues that contribute to a more positive potential on the A branch are identified. These are often distant from the cofactors. The large difference of the potential at the competing BChls may direct the electron transfer to the A branch. Residues TyrM210 and PheL181 are at symmetrical positions on the A and B branches, near P860 and between BChlA or BChlB. Mutated bRCs that swap the Tyr and Phe (YF mutant), have been shown to support some electron transfer to the B-branch cofactors. The calculated Ems in the bRC with the YF swap show that more positive B-branch potentials help explain the electron transfer from excited P860 to the normally inactive B branch.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We used fractional cohesion parameters shown in the modified equations using the cohesive energy density approach to expose these forces. The original cohesive energy density equation does not apply to ionic systems. So we modified this equation and developed a protocol for applying this modified equation to evaluate the influence of a salt.  We did this by allocating salt effects to either the water or the denaturant, creating an \"effective\" cohesion parameter, and then comparing this effective cohesion parameter to the control cohesion parameters without salt.   Our theory has been developed for the chemical denaturation of DNA in the presence of salts for low- and medium-denaturation degrees, including but not limited to 50\\% denaturation.

By analyzing independent experimental data, we show that salt affects electrostatic repulsion forces, with the most significant compensating attractive forces being dispersion forces, suggesting that at constant 50\\% denaturation, salt leads to the formation of bubbles between DNA strands. Results also show that salt has the least effect on hydrogen bonding. However, there is an internal change in the electron donor and electron acceptor characteristics of hydrogen bonding shown.

However, predicting their ionization states in aqueous solutions with added salt remains challenging due to the interplay between long-range Coulomb interactions, conformational degrees of freedom and chemical equilibria. While flexible bead-spring models with an explicit ion treatment provide accurate results, they are computationally expensive. In contrast, Ising-like site-binding models can often be solved in a matter of seconds and a further speed-up is possible using exact reweighting techniques. Notably, these models neglect conformational degrees of freedom and rely on an implicit salt description. To address the question under which circumstances these approximations are justified, we compare a site-binding model to bead-spring models with implicit and explicit ion treatments. Our results show that under strong electrostatic coupling, an explicit ion treatment is critical for accurately capturing ionization behavior. In particular, both, the site-binding model, and the bead-spring model with implicit ion treatment, strongly overestimate correlations between monomers in this regime, leading to significant deviations from the explicit bead-spring model. Conversely, under weak coupling, which is realized in aqueous environments in the presence of monovalent salts, all three models yield reasonable ionization curves. Minor differences arise, with the implicit bead-spring model showing slightly stronger suppression of ionization, while the site-binding model aligns more closely with the explicit bead-spring model due to compensating errors in ion treatment and conformational flexibility. In summary, while all models are effective under weak coupling, the explicit ion treatment within the bead-spring model is essential for capturing accurate ionization behavior under strong coupling.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, analogous strategies for synthetic macromolecules remain in nascent stages, complicated by sequence polydispersity and analytical limitations. To address this, we have developed a comprehensive and open-source Python software, PRISM (polymer rate insights and sequence modeling), that provides quantitative and qualitative metrics for describing chemical patterning in stochastic polymers. First, a numerical integration strategy was constructed to simulate and fit experimental data from reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization kinetics, enabling facile estimation of relevant reactivity ratios. These ratios were then used in a mechanism-specific\nstochastic kinetic simulation strategy to simulate sequence ensembles corresponding to model systems spanning experimental copolymers, classes of statistical polymers (e.g., alternating, block, gradient), and multiblock copolymers. Finally, inspired by sequence homology metrics from bioinformatics, we introduce visualization strategies and quantitative metrics to facilitate comparisons of\ndifferent sequence ensembles. As the sequence-structure-function paradigm becomes increasingly central in de novo design of synthetic macromolecules, this toolkit provides a first step towards accurate and representative sequence description and featurization.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While common for semiconductor and quantum materials, plasmonic materials have inhabited a narrow phase space typically comprising one or two elements, e.g., face-centered cubic metals. While this simplicity has enabled robust use and understanding of Au and Ag nanoparticles, it has also limited the design and manipulation of solid state properties. Here, we show that by tuning the phase and elemental composition of binary Au-Sn nanoparticles, the steady-state absorbance and ultrafast thermalization properties of plasmonic nanoparticles can be controlled. Solid state characterization suggests this is due to the dealloying of Sn and destabilization of AuSn phase, leading to higher quality Au5Sn intermetallic phases alongside Au. Consequently, this work shows that phase control can profoundly influence the properties of plasmonic nanoparticles, providing important tunability for applications in catalysis, photothermal heating, and sensing.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Azine dynamic chemistry has recently been explored and, thus far, has only been incorporated into step-growth CANs. We developed an azine-based cross-linker with methacrylate end groups, enabling radical-based CAN synthesis. Free-radical copolymerization of this cross-linker with n-hexyl methacrylate yielded robust CANs with full property recovery upon reprocessing by compression molding at 120 \u00b0C. The associative azine dynamic chemistry resulted in constant cross-link density across the rubbery plateau, extraordinary creep suppression at temperatures of 190-210 \u00b0C, and severely limited stress relaxation at temperatures as high as 200-210 \u00b0C; nevertheless, this did not hinder the CAN\u2019s reprocessability by compression molding at 120 \u00b0C and 8 MPa pressure. Finally, preliminary injection molding and extrusion experiments at temperatures of 200-210 \u00b0C indicated the potential feasibility of these methods for azine-based CAN production.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Materials Processing; Polymer chains; Polymerization (Polymers); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we describe a new organic electrode material, which is obtained via ionothermal polymerization of low-cost starting materials melem (2,5,8-triamino-tri-s-triazine) and perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA). The resulting networked polymer Melem-PDI exhibits favourable thermal and electrochemical properties that prompted us to investigate its performance as a positive electrode material in rechargeable lithium and magnesium batteries. We found that a hybrid material with carbon nanotubes (Melem-PDI-CNT) exhibits excellent cycling stability in Li-ion batteries at a current rate as high as 500 mA g-1 for 5000 cycles. While the Li-ion storage is based on a pseudocapacitive mechanism, a diffusion-controlled mechanism was observed in magnesium batteries. Our work underscores that classic dyes (here: PDI) can be re-purposed for energy storage, once they are integrated into suitable polymer topologies and brought into nanoscale contact with conductive materials.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Energy; Conducting polymers; Organic Polymers; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

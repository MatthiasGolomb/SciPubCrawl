Substitution of the N+ center with alkyl, alkoxy, vinyl, acyl, sulfonyl, among others, were evaluated. For these species, three properties are considered. (1) the stability of the nitrenium ions to unimolecular isomerizations such as 1,2 alkyl or H shifts. And, to the extent the singlet states could be characterized as discrete minima on the PES,  (2) the effect of the substituents on singlet-triplet energy splitting as well as (3) the relative stabilities of the nitrenium ions as defined by N-hydration enthalpies (RR\u2019N+ + H\u00ac2O -> RR\u2019NOH\u00ac2+). Nearly all simple alkyl and di-alkyl nitrenium ion singlet states are predicted to rearrange without detectable barriers, largely through 1,2 H or alkyl shifts. Methyl and N-N-dimethylnitrenium ion singlet states could be characterized as formal minima on the PES. However these species show small or insignificant barriers to isomerization. Disubstituted nitrenium ions that include an alkyl group and a conjugating substituent such as alkoxyl, vinyl or phenyl, show meaningful barriers to isomerization and are thus predicted to possess non-trivial lifetimes in solution. Alkyl groups substantially stabilize the singlet state relative to the situation in the parent nitrenium ion NH\u00ac2+ To the point where the two states are nearly degenerate. Other groups that interact with the nitrenium ion center decrease DEst in the order formoyl< vinyl < phenyl < alkoxy ~sulfonyl < cyclopropyl ~ cyclobutyl. The latter two substituents interact strongly with the (singlet) nitrenium ion center through the formation of non-classical bonding reminiscent of the bisected cyclopropylcarbinyl ion case for carbocations. When singlet state stability is evaluated in the context of N-hydration enthalpies, it is found that the ordering is acyl<br />", "date": "2018-04-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Reaction (Inorg.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For large-scale calculations, such as those encountered in many-body theories, reduced memory footprint alleviates memory and input/output bottlenecks. Reduced size of data can lead to additional gains due to improved parallel performance on CPUs and various accelerators. However, using single precision can potentially reduce the accuracy of computed observables. Here we report an implementation of coupled-cluster and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster methods with single and double excitations in single precision. We consider both standard implementation and one using Cholesky decomposition or resolution-of-the-identity of electron-repulsion integrals. Numerical tests illustrate that when single precision is used in correlated calculations, the loss of accuracy is insignificant and pure single-precision implementation can be used for computing energies, analytic gradients, excited states, and molecular properties. In addition to pure single-precision calculations, our implementation allows one to follow a single-precision calculation by clean-up iterations, fully recovering double-precision results while retaining significant savings.", "date": "2018-04-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Bifunctional precatalysts were designed with tridentate ligands and potentially hemilabile heterocyclic spacers, expected to be suitable for the binding of pi-acidic metals such as copper (I) and silver (I). The structures of the designed catalysts were computed using density functional theory (DFT), and the relative energies of putative catalytic intermediates were estimated.

The reaction consists of the iron-catalyzed homolytic cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond in the hydrogen peroxide molecule and the reduction of the hydroxyl radical. Here, we study these two elementary steps with high-level ab-initio calculations at the complete basis set limit and address the performance of different DFT methods following a specific classification based on the Jacob\u00b4s ladder in combination with various Pople's basis sets. Ab-initio calculations at the complete basis set limit are in agreement to experimental reference data and identified a significant contribution of the electron correlation energy to the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the oxygen-oxygen bond in hydrogen peroxide and the electron affinity (EA) of the hydroxyl radical. The studied DFT methods were able to reproduce the ab-initio reference values, although no functional was particularly better for both reactions. The inclusion of HF exchange in the DFT functionals lead in most cases to larger deviations, which might be related to the poor description of the two reactions by the HF method. Considering the computational cost, DFT methods provide better BDE and EA values than HF and post--HF methods with an almost MP2 or CCSD level of accuracy. However, no systematic general prediction of the error based on the employed functional could be established and no systematic improvement with increasing the size in the Pople's basis set was found, although for BDE values certain systematic basis set dependence was observed. Moreover, the quality of the hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and hydroxyl anion structures obtained from these functionals was compared to experimental reference data. In general, bond lengths were well reproduced and the error in the angles were between one and two degrees with some systematic trend with the basis sets. From our results we conclude that DFT methods present a computationally less expensive alternative to describe the two elementary steps of the Fenton reaction. However, choice of approximated functionals and basis sets must be carefully done and the provided benchmark allows a systematic validation of the electronic structure method to be employed", "date": "2018-04-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thiols can be deprotonated to form a thiolate, which affords a diverse range of enzymatic activity and modes for chemical modification of proteins. Parameters for modeling thiolates using molecular mechanical force fields have not yet been validated, in part due to the lack of structural data on thiolate solvation. Here, the CHARMM36 and Amber models for thiolates in aqueous solutions are assessed using free energy perturbation and QM/MM MD simulations. The hydration structure of methylthiolate was calculated from 1 ns of QM/MM MD (PBE0/def2-TZVP//TIP3P), which show that the water\u2013S- distances are approximately 2 \u00c5. The CHARMM thiolate parameters predict a thiolate S radius close to the QM/MM value and predict a hydration Gibbs energy of -331 kJ/mol, close to the experimental value of -318 kJ/mol. The cysteine thiolate model in the Amber force field underestimates the thiolate radius by  0.2 \u00c5 and overestimates the thiolate hydration energy by 119 kJ/mol because it uses the same Lennard-Jones parameters for thiolates as for thiols. A recent Drude polarizable model for methylthiolate with optimized thiolate parameters also performs well. SAPT2+ analysis indicates exchange repulsion is larger for the methylthiolate, consistent with it having a more diffuse electron density distribution in comparison to the parent thiol. These data demonstrate that it is important to define distinct non-bonded parameters for the protonated/deprotonated states of amino acid side chains in molecular mechanical force fields.", "date": "2018-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The presented applications highlight the interpretability of Chimera to corroborate design choices on tailoring system parameters.

As the salt\nconcentration is increased from ~10 \u03bcM to 0.1 M, the SFG intensities in the O\u2013H stretching\nregion decrease by a factor of 2, consistent with significant absorptive-dispersive mixing\nbetween \u03c7(2) and \u03c7(3) contributions to the SFG signal generation process from charged interfaces.\nA method for estimating the surface potential from the second-order spectral lineshapes (in the\nOH stretching region) is presented and discussed in the context of choosing truly zero-potential\nreference states. Aided by atomistic simulations, we find that the strength and orientation\ndistribution of the hydrogen bonds over the purely zwitterionic bilayers are largely invariant\nbetween sub-micromolar and hundreds of millimolar concentrations. However, specific interactions between water molecules and lipid headgroups are observed upon replacing phosphocholine (PC) lipids with negatively charged phosphoglycerol (PG) lipids, which\ncoincides with SFG signal intensity reductions in the 3100 cm-1 to 3200 cm-1 frequency region.\nThe atomistic simulations show that this outcome is consistent with a small, albeit statistically\nsignificant, decrease in the number of water molecules adjacent to both the lipid phosphate and\ncholine moieties per unit area, supporting the SFG observations. Ultimately, the ability to probe\nhydrogen-bond networks over lipid bilayers holds the promise of opening paths for\nunderstanding, controlling, and predicting specific and non-specific interactions between\nmembranes and ions, small molecules, peptides, polycations, proteins, and coated and uncoated\nnanomaterials.<br /></p></div></div>", "date": "2018-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysical Chemistry; Interfaces; Optics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Structure; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Machine--learning techniques are used to identify structural classes across the landscapes of all molecules and we find that, despite differences in the arrangement of hydrogen bond functionality, the predicted crystal structures of the molecules studied here can be classified into a small number of packing types. We analyze the predicted property landscapes of the series of molecules and discuss several metrics that can be used to rank the molecules as promising semiconductors. The results suggest several isomers with superior predicted electron mobilities to <b>1</b> and suggest two molecules in particular that represent attractive synthetic targets.", "date": "2018-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Self-Assembly; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In cells, <i>de novo</i> and salvage nucleotide enzymatic synthesis combines 5-phospho-\u03b1\u000b-D-ribose-1-diphosphate (\u000b\u03b1-PRPP) and nucleobases. Interestingly, these reactants are also known as prebiotically plausible compounds. Combining ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with recently developed reaction exploration and enhanced sampling methods, we show that nucleobases and \u03b1\u000b-PRPP should spontaneously combine, under mild hydrothermal conditions, with an exothermic reaction and a facile mechanism, forming both purine and pyrimidine ribonucleotides.<br />Surprisingly, this mechanism is very similar to the biological one, and yields ribonucleotides with the same anomeric carbon chirality as in biological systems.<br />These results suggest that natural selection might have optimized -- through enzymes -- a pre-existing ribonucleotide formation mechanism, carrying it forward to modern life forms.<br />", "date": "2018-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Solution Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

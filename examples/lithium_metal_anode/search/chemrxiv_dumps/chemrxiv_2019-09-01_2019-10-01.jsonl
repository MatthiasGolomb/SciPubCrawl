Here, we introduce a new enzyme-based amperometric sensor technique for direct counting of the number of glutamate molecules stored inside single synaptic vesicles. An ultra-fast enzyme-based glutamate sensor is placed into a solution of isolated synaptic vesicles, which stochastically rupture at the sensor surface in a potential dependent manner by applying a constant negative potential. High-speed (10 kHz) amperometry is used to record sub-millisecond current spikes, which represent glutamate release from single vesicles that burst open. Glutamate quantification is achieved by a calibration curve that is based on measurements of glutamate release from vesicles pre-filled with various concentrations of glutamate. Our measurements show that a single synaptic vesicle encapsulates about 8000 glutamate molecules, which is comparable to the measured exocytotic quantal glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens of mouse brain tissue. Hence, this new methodology introduces the means to quantify ultra-small amounts of glutamate and to study synaptic vesicle physiology, pathogenesis and drug treatments for neuronal disorders where glutamate is involved.</p></div>", "date": "2019-09-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Numerous studies have been reported for the rational design of BODIPY derivatives based on their spectroscopic and photophysical properties, including absorption and fluorescence wavelengths (<i>\u03bb</i><sub>abs</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>fl</sub>), oscillator strength (<i>f</i>), nonradiative pathways, and quantum yield (<i>\u03d5</i>). In the present work, we illustrate a theoretical, semi-empirical model that accurately predicts <i>\u03d5</i> for various BODIPY compounds based on inexpensive electronic structure calculations, following the data-driven algorithm proposed and tested on the naphthalene family by us [Kohn, Lin, and Van Voorhis, <i>J. Phys. Chem. C.</i> <b>2019</b>, <i>123</i>, 15394]. The model allows us to identify the dominant nonradiative channel of any BODIPY molecule using its structure exclusively and to establish a correlation between the activation energy (<i>E</i><sub>a</sub>) and the fluorescence quantum yield (<i>\u03d5</i><sub>fl</sub>). Based on our calculations, either the S<sub>1</sub> \u2192 S<sub>0</sub> or <i>L<sub>a</sub></i> \u2192 <i>L<sub>b</sub></i> internal conversion (IC) mechanism dominates in the majority of BODIPY derivatives, depending on the structural and electronic properties of the substituents. In both cases, the nonradiative rate (<i>k</i><sub>nr</sub>) exhibits a straightforward Arrhenius-like relation with the associated <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>. More interestingly, the S<sub>1</sub> \u2192 S<sub>0</sub> mechanism proceeds via a highly distorted intermediate structure in which the core BODIPY plane and the substituent at the 1-position are forced to bend, while the internal rotation of the very same substituent induces the <i>La </i>\u2192<i> Lb</i> transition.

Experimentally, the CCS trends of synthetic homopolymers are analyzed as a function of increasing degrees of polymerization (DP) for different charge states. Then, shape evolutions of modeled shape deformations yield theoretical CCS trends, calculated using new software called MoShade (projected area calculations). The shapes are modeled using computer-aided design software where we considered only geometric factors: no atoms, chemical potentials or interactions are taken into consideration to make the method orthogonal to classical methods for 3D shape assessments using time-consuming computational chemistry. We are able to correlate modeled shape evolutions to experimentally-obtained polymer CCS trends. We thus modeled the apparent volume or envelope of their ion-drift gas interactions as sampled by IM-MS. Moreover, the CCS of convex shapes could be directly related to their surface area. The relation seems to hold even for concave shapes which could be correlated to geometry-optimized structures of ions obtained by conventional computational chemistry methods.

Because it is highly scalable it is increasingly used in drug development in academic and pharmaceutical contexts. We have identified assumptions commonly used in LBVS that are false, which collectively can be described as the missing label problem. Firstly, many of the binding interactions in the bioactivity databases typically used to train LBVS models have never been tested before, but the absence of a label is interpreted by most models as a true negative. Secondly, many proteins have multiple binding sites with unrelated shapes but the associated ligands are grouped together under the one protein label. These assumptions frustrate the ability of the model to learn a correct mapping function. Here we use statistical techniques to predict values for the missing labels and binding sites and show how this improves the ability of LBVS models to rank ligands correctly.

The conventional, biogenic agriculture has yet failed to provide a reliable concept which circumvents its severe environmental externalities\u2014such as the massive use of land area, water for irrigation, fertiliser, pesticides, herbicides, and fossil fuel. In contrast, the artificial synthesis of carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy would allow not only for a highly reliable production without those 10 externalities, but would also allow to increase the agricultural capacities of our planet by several orders of magnitude. All required technology is either commercially available or at least developed on a lab-scale. No directed research has, however, yet been conducted to wards an industry-scale carbohydrate synthesis because the biogenic carbohydrate production was economically more competitive. Taking the environmental and socioeconomic externalities of the conventional sugar production into account, this economical narrative has to be questioned. We estimate the production costs of artificial sugar at \u00181 C/kg. While the today\u2019s spot market price for conventional sugar is about 0.3 C/kg, we estimate its total costs (including external costs) at \u00150.9 C/kg in humid regions and \u00152 C/kg in semi-arid regions. Accordingly, artificial sugar appears already today to be the less expensive way of production. The artificial sugar production allows in principle also for a subsequent synthesis of other carbohydrates such as starch and cellulose as well as fats.

In this context, the interfacial tension (IFT) between CO<sub>2</sub> and the aqueous fluid and the contact angle, theta, with the pore mineral surfaces are the two key parameters that control the capillary pressure in the pores of the candidate host rock. Knowledge of these two parameters and their dependence on the local conditions of pressure, temperature and salinity is essential for the correct prediction of structural and residual trapping. We have performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to predict the CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013water IFT and the CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013water\u2013calcite contact angle. The IFT results are consistent with previous simulations, where simple point charge water models have been shown to underestimate the water surface tension, thus affecting the simulated IFT values. When combined with the EPM2 CO<sub>2</sub> model, the SPC/Fw water model indeed underestimates the IFT in the low pressure region at all temperatures studied. On the other hand, at high pressure and low temperature, the IFT is overestimated by ~5 mN/m. Literature data regarding the water contact angle on calcite are contradictory. Using our new set of force field parameters, we performed NVT simulations at 323 K and 20 MPa to calculate the contact angle of a water droplet on the calcite {10.4} surface in a CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. We performed simulations for both spherical and cylindrical droplet configurations for different initial radii, to study the size dependence of the water contact angle on calcite in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>. Our results suggest that the contact angle of a cylindrical water droplet on calcite {10.4}, in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>, is independent of droplet size, for droplets with a radius of 50 \u00c5 or more. On the contrary, spherical droplets make a contact angle that is strongly influenced by their size. At the largest size explored in this study, both spherical and cylindrical droplets converge to the same contact angle, 38 degrees, indicating that calcite is strongly wetted by water.</p>", "date": "2019-09-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The simulated results show that core-level spectroscopy not only observes these integrated outcomes, but also provides a direct measure of the abrupt switching of electronic character at the avoided crossing. The valence and core-excited electronic structures of NaI are computed by spin-orbit general multi-con\fgurational quasi-degenerate perturbation theory, from which core-level absorption spectra of the predissociation dynamics are constructed. The wave-packet motion on the covalent potential is continuously mapped as shifts in the absorption energies, and the switching between the covalent and ionic character at the avoided crossing is characterized as the sharp rise and fall of the Na+ signal.

A range of natural and synthetic zeolites have been studied for removing ammonium from wastewater.

Here, we compare the most commonly used natural zeolites US-Clinoptilolite, UK-Clinoptilolite, Mordenite and Chabazite (using Na- and Ca- as main cation exchanger) as well as a thermally modified US-Clinoptilolite and a synthetic zeolite MesoLite in terms of their capacity and regeneration efficiency to determine whether a synthetic zeolite like MesoLite can address the aforementioned problems related to capacity and regeneration efficiency. This investigation was performed as a series of batch experiments on synthetic and real wastewater solutions. When zeolites were pre-saturated with sodium ions, we found the overall highest capacity of 4.6 meq/g for the synthetic zeolite MesoLite, relative to a range between 1.1 and 2.1 meq/g for the natural zeolites. Ammonium adsorption capacity of MesoLite with real wastewater ranged between 74 and 97% of what was observed for a synthetically generated mono component solution set at approximately the same ionic load.

Noncovalent complexes between a host molecule with a binding cavity and a drug-like guest molecules have emerged as powerful model systems. As model systems, host-guest complexes reduce many of the errors in more complex protein-ligand binding systems, as their small size greatly facilitates conformational sampling, and one can choose systems that avoid ambiguities in protonation states.

Here, we evaluate the accuracy of this initial force field, using free energy calculations of 43 \u03b1 and \u03b2-cyclodextrin host-guest pairs for which experimental thermodynamic data are available, and compare with matched calculations using two versions of GAFF.

Previous batch-type experiments analysed a range of popular zeolite types to see which would show highest capacity and selectivity toward ammonium and may thus be best suited for removing ammonium from wastewater. Here, as a next step, toward determining real-world applicability, the top three zeolites from these previous batch-type experiments, namely Clinoptilolite, Mordenite and Mesolite, were compared in a column-type experiment, where synthetic ammonium solution was flowing continuously through the zeolite media. This experiment showed substantially longer cycle times with MesoLite relative to the other two zeolites. Cycle time with MesoLite ranged between 3 and 40 days at empty bed contact times (EBCT) of 1.2 minutes and 15 minutes respectively. The resultant capacities to breakthrough of 1 mg/L were 22, 25 and 47 mg/g for Clinoptilolite, Mordenite and MesoLite. Operating the MesoLite column at higher initial ammonium concentration decreased the cycle time at an EBCT of 1.2 minutes from 3672 BV when treating 5 mg/L to 255 BV when treating 30 mg/L. Based on a Thomas reaction model of second order, the maximum capacity for an EBCT of 1.2 minutes was predicted to be 56.8 mg/g. Taken together, these findings show that ammonium removal through zeolite media is feasible in a continuous flow setup at lab-scale with synthetic ammonium solution and that MesoLite compares favourably to two other options for zeolite media. This work can form the foundation for future research into improving process parameters or into applying this setup to conditions that more closely resemble those seen with real wastewater.", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Wastes; Natural Resource Recovery", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Both binary and distance-dependent occupancies were examined for how an atom affects its neighbor voxels in this grid. A combination of different features including ANOLEA, ligand elements, and Arpeggio atom types were used to represent the input.

Damped response formalism allows one to circumvent problems of divergent behavior of the response equation in the resonant regime. However, the convergence of response equations in the X-ray frequency range is often erratic due to the resonant nature of the virtual core-excited states embedded in the valence ionization continuum. We demonstrate that this problematic behavior can be avoided by extending the core-valence separation (CVS) scheme, which decouples the valence-occupied and core-occupied excitation manifolds, into the response domain. The accuracy of the CVS-enabled damped response theory, implemented within the EOM-EE-CCSD (EOM-CC for excitation energies with single and double excitations) framework, is assessed by comparison against damped EOM-EE-CCSD response calculations.

We recently reported a peptide (VIQKI), derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of the HPIV3 fusion (F) glycoprotein that inhibits infection by both HPIV3 and RSV. The dual inhibitory activity of VIQKI is due to its unique ability to bind to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRN) domains of both HPIV3 and RSV F, thereby preventing the native HRN-HRC interactions required for viral entry.

To advance these applications, facile and robust routes to synthesize highly magnetic nanoparticles over a wide size range are needed.

We show that degassing at 90\u00b0C nearly entirely removes acetylacetone ligands from the reaction, which results in an early formation of monomers and a reaction-controlled growth following LaMer's model towards small nanocubes. In contrast, degassing at 25\u00b0C only partially dissociates acetylacetone ligands from the metal center and triggers a delayed formation of monomers, which leads to intermediate assembled structures made of tiny irregular crystallites and an eventual formation of large nanocubes via a diffusion-controlled growth mechanism. Using complementary techniques, we determine the substitution fraction x of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to be in the range of 0.35-0.37.

As there are millions of possible MOFs (with tens of thousands already synthesized), molecular simulation, such as grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), has frequently been used to rapidly evaluate the adsorption performance of a large set of MOFs. This allows subsequent experiments to focus only on a small subset of the most promising MOFs. In many instances, however, even molecular simulation becomes prohibitively time consuming, underscoring the need for alternative screening methods, such as machine learning, to precede molecular simulation efforts. In this study, as a proof of concept, we trained a neural network as the first example of a machine learning model capable of predicting full adsorption isotherms of different molecules not included in the training of the model. To achieve this, we trained our neural network only on alchemical species, represented only by their geometry and force field parameters, and used this neural network to predict the loadings of real adsorbates. We focused on predicting room temperature adsorption of small (one- and two-atom) molecules relevant to chemical separations. Namely, argon, krypton, xenon, methane, ethane, and nitrogen. However, we also observed surprisingly promising predictions for more complex molecules, whose properties are outside the range spanned by the alchemical adsorbates. Prediction accuracies suitable for large-scale screening were achieved using simple MOF (e.g. geometric properties and chemical moieties), and adsorbate (e.g. forcefield parameters and geometry) descriptors. Our results illustrate a new philosophy of training that opens the path towards development of machine learning models that can predict the adsorption loading of any new adsorbate at any new operating conditions in any new MOF.</div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The exception was G37R, which proceeded only through the\nfirst unfolding transition, and displayed a much higher abundance of asymmetric\nproducts.

Standard techniques for this dimensionality reduction employ statistical methods that identify the modes that account for the largest variance in nuclear positions. However, large-amplitude motion is not necessarily a good proxy for the influence of a mode on the excited-state wave function evolution. Hence, here we report a number of analysis techniques aimed at extracting from nonadiabatic dynamics simulations the vibrational modes that are most strongly affected by the electronic excitation process and that most significantly affect the interaction of the electronic states. The first technique identifies coherent nuclear motion after excitation from the ratio between total variance and variance of the average trajectory. The second strategy employs linear regression to find normal modes that have a statistically significant effect on excitation energies, energy gaps, or wave function overlaps. The third approach uses time-frequency analysis to find normal modes where the vibrational frequencies change in the course of the dynamics simulation. All three techniques are applied to the case of surface hopping trajectories of [Re(CO)<sub>3</sub>(Im)(Phen)]<sup>+</sup> (Im=imidazole; Phen=1,10-phenanthroline), showing that in this transition metal complex the nonadiabatic dynamics is dominated by a small number of carbonyl and phenanthroline in-plane stretch modes.</div><div><br /></div>", "date": "2019-09-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Their applications have been mainly focused on isolated molecules in their most stable conformation without considering the effects of the surroundings. Here, we propose to combine QM/MM Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the microstates (configurations) of a molecular system using different representations of the molecular environment and calculate Boltzmann weighted atom condensed local reac- tivity descriptors based on conceptual DFT. Our approach takes the conformational fluctuations of the molecular system and the polarization of its electron density by the environment into account allowing us to analyze the effect of changes in the molecular environment on reactivity. In this contribution, we apply the method mentioned above to the catalytic fixation of carbon dioxide by crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase and study if the enzyme alters the reactivity of its substrate compared to an aqueous solution.

The indirect method features a direct\ncalculation of the free energy profile at a relatively cheap low-level\nHamiltonian and a low-level to high-level correction. In the thermodynamic\ncycle, the direct low-level calculation along the physically meaningful\nreaction coordinate is corrected via the alchemical method, which is often\nachieved with perturbation-based techniques. Often the indirect method can lead\nto about an order of magnitude speedup in free energy simulation. In our\nprevious work, a multi-dimensional nonequilibrium pulling framework is proposed\nfor the indirect construction of QM/MM free energy landscapes. The method\nrelies on bidirectional nonequilibrium pulling and bidirectional reweighting\nwith the statistically optimal estimator. In the previous work, we focus on\nobtaining semi-empirical QM (SQM) results indirectly from direct MM simulations\nand MM<->SQM corrections. In this work, we apply this method to obtain\nresults under ab initio QM Hamiltonians by combining direct SQM results and\nSQM<->QM corrections. The indirect nonequilibrium scheme is tested on a\ndihedral flipping case and a series of SQM and QM Hamiltonians are benchmarked.\nIt is observed that PM6 achieves the best performance among the low-level\nHamiltonians, while AM1 and MNDO perform less well. Therefore, we recommend\nusing PM6 as the low-level theory in the indirect free energy simulation. The\ncomparison between the indirect results from different SQM Hamiltonians could\nalso provide some hints on the development of charge models. As AM1 can be\ncorrected with the bond charge correction (BCC) to provide a cheap and accurate\ncharge model, which is able to accurately reproduce the electrostatic potential\n(ESP) at HF level, PM6 would be able to do the same thing. Considering its\nhigher similarity to the high-level Hamiltonians, the PM6-BCC model could be\nmore accurate than the existing AM1-BCC model. Another central result in the\ncurrent work is a basic protocol of choosing the strength of restraints and an\nappropriate time step in nonequilibrium free energy simulation at the stiff\nspring limit. We provide theoretical derivations to emphasize the importance of\nusing a sufficiently large force constant and choosing an appropriate time\nstep. It is worth noting that a general rule of thumb for choosing the time\nstep, according to our derivation, is that a time step of 1 fs or smaller\nshould be used, as long as the stiff spring approximation is employed, even in\nsimulations with constraints on bonds involving hydrogen atoms. </p>", "date": "2019-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Statistical Mechanics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite their potential for architectural integration, the optical efficiency of LSCs is often limited by incomplete harvesting of solar radiation and aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) of lumophores in the solid state. Here, we demonstrate a multi-lumophore LSC design which circumvents these challenges through a combination of non-radiative F\u00f6rster energy transfer (FRET) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE). The LSC incorporates a green-emitting poly(tetraphenylethylene), p-O-TPE, as an energy donor and a red-emitting perylene bisimide molecular dye (PDI-Sil) as the energy acceptor, within an organic-inorganic hybrid di-ureasil waveguide. Steady-state photoluminescence studies demonstrate that the di-ureasil host induced AIE from the p-O-PTE donor polymer, leading to a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ~45% and a large Stokes shift of ~150 nm. Covalent grafting of the PDI-Sil acceptor to the siliceous domains of the di-ureasil waveguide also inhibits non-radiative losses by preventing molecular aggregation. Due to the excellent spectral overlap, FRET was shown to occur from p-O-TPE to PDI-Sil, which increased with acceptor concentration. As a result, the final LSC (4.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 0.3 cm) with an optimised donor- acceptor ratio (1:1 by wt%) exhibited an internal photon efficiency of 20%, demonstrating a viable design for LSCs utilising an AIE-based FRET approach to improve the solar-harvesting performance.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2019-09-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Optical Materials; Polymers; Photovoltaics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we report on the use of partially miscible binary liquid mixtures that lend their microfluidic properties from a highly temperature-sensitive mixing and phase separation behaviour. For a blend composed of the thermotropic liquid crystal 4-Cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and methanol, mixing at temperatures above the upper critical solution temperature (UCST; 24.4\u00b0C) leads to a uniform single phase while partial mixing can be achieved at temperatures below the UCST. Thermally-driven phase separation inside the microfluidic channels results in the spontaneous formation of very regular phase arrangements, namely in droplets, plug, slug and annular flow. We map different flow regimes and relate findings to the role of interfacial tension and viscosity and their temperature dependence. Importantly, different flow regimes can be achieved at constant channel architecture and flow rate by varying the temperature of the blend. A consistent behaviour is observed for a binary liquid mixture with lower critical solution temperature, namely 2,6-lutidine and water.

Furthermore, it is shown that the correct asymptotic behavior of one of the aforementioned quantities does not guarantee a correct behavior of the other. In this process, a new quantity, the xc hole response function, is defined and its exact exchange part is analytically derived. The extent to which existing xc approximations satisfy the named exact properties is reviewed and the relationship between correct asymptotics and freedom from one-electron self-interaction in DFT is discussed.

We demonstrate here how the milling under controlled, prolonged and\nvariable heating programs accomplished in a new milling reactor introduces a new\nlevel of mechanochemical reactivity beyond what can be achieved by conventional\nmechanochemical or solution procedures, and also reduces the time and energy costs\nof the milling process. The methodology is demonstrated on four varied systems:\nC\u2013C bond forming Knoevenagel condensation, selective C\u2013N bond formation for\namide/urea synthesis, selective double-imine condensation, and solid-state\nformation of an archetypal open metal-organic framework, MOF-74. The potential\nof this methodology is best demonstrated on the one-pot selective synthesis of\nfour complex products containing combinations of amide, amine or urea\nfunctionalities from the same and simple acyl azide and diamine reactants.\nPrincipal control over this enhanced reactivity and selectivity stemmed from\nthe application of specific heating regimes to mechanochemical processing\naccomplished by a new, in-house developed mechanochemical reactor. As even the\nmoderate increase in temperature strongly affects the selectivity and the rate\nof mechanochemical reactions, the results presented are in line with recent\nchallenges of the accepted theories of mechanochemical reactivity.", "date": "2021-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Materials Processing; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Solid State Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

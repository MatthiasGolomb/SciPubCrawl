H. Zhang; Zhaoxi Sun", "abstract": "\tHost-guest binding, despite the relatively simple structural and chemical features of individual components, still poses a challenge in computational modelling. The problems lie in both the accuracy of the employed Hamiltonian (often fixed-charge force fields) and the exhaustiveness of conformational sampling. End-point free energy calculations as fast alternatives to rigorous but costly methods are widely applied in virtual screening in protein-ligand and host-guest systems. However, the extreme underperformance of standard end-point methods makes them practically useless. Modifications of the end-point procedure could bring these methods back to the pool of usable tools, e.g., regression considered in our previous work. In the current work, we explore a potentially promising modification, the three-trajectory realization of the end-point simulation protocol. The alteration couples the binding-induced structural reorganization into free energy estimation and suffers from dramatic fluctuations of internal energies in protein-ligand situations. Fortunately, the relatively small size of host-guest systems minimizes the magnitude of internal fluctuations and makes the three-trajectory realization practically suitable. Due to the incorporation of intra-molecular interactions in free energy estimation, a strong dependence on the force field parameters could be incurred. Thus, a term-specific investigation of transferable GAFF derivatives is presented, and noticeable differences in many aspects are identified between commonly applied GAFF and GAFF2. These force-field differences lead to different dynamic behaviors of the macrocyclic host, which ultimately would influence the end-point sampling and binding thermodynamics. Therefore, the three-trajectory end-point free energy calculations are performed with both GAFF versions to investigate the force-field dependent behavior of computed binding affinities. Also, due to the noticeable differences between host dynamics under GAFF and GAFF2, we add additional benchmarks of the single-trajectory end-point calculations. Numerical results suggest that the single-trajectory realization, regardless of the GAFF version, is still not useful in host-guest binding, although the prediction quality of the GAFF2 parameter set is slightly better than GAFF. As for the three-trajectory realization, the absolute values of computed binding thermodynamics exhibit pronounced force-field-dependent behaviors, which are less significant for ranking information. When only the ranks of binding affinities are pursued, the three-trajectory realization performs very well, comparable to and even better than the regressed PBSA_E scoring function and the dielectric-constant-variable regime. With the GAFF parameter set, the TIP3P water in explicit-solvent sampling and either PB or GB implicit-solvent model in free energy estimation, the predictive power of the three-trajectory realization in ranking calculations surpasses all existing end-point methods on this dataset. We further combine the three-trajectory realization with another promising modified end-point regime of varying the interior dielectric constant. The predicted binding affinities exhibit monotonic responses to the variation of the internal dielectric constant, but the deviations from experiment exhibit non-monotonic variations, which are related to the systematic overestimation of the binding strength under the original three-trajectory realization. By contrast, the combined regime does not incur sizable improvements for ranks, although for most systems the dielectric constant 2 seems to be the best option.

Physical and numerical experiments are conducted in the temperature range from 513 to 573 K and different CO/CO2 ratios. It is revealed that CO and CO2 behave very differently when both are simultaneously converted into CH4, which is mainly due to the competing reaction kinetics. Since CO inhibits the methanation of both CO2 and itself, large pellets and the associated diffusion limitation can be used to reduce the concentration of CO inside the pellets and hence its overall inhibiting effect. This catalyst design aspect can be used to increase the effective methane formation rate up to 35 % for a co-methanation of CO and CO2, while larger pellets allow to reduce the pressure drop in the reactor at the same time, which provides further advantages for reactor operation. Moreover, it is found that a selective CO methanation can be conducted with low-loading (nickel) catalysts, as long as the catalyst is operated in the low-temperature region (T << 300 \u00b0C) with small particle sizes below 1.5 mm.

Recently, covalent functionalization was demonstrated by conjugating guanine bases of adsorbed DNA to the SWCNT surface as guanine quantum defects (g-defects).

To overcome these risks of traditional batch-mode PEGylation, a manufacturing strategy utilizing structural analysis and a continuous-flow-mode reaction was examined.

Often criticized as a distraction from global efforts towards reducing GHG emissions, SAI aims to increase the Earth\u2019s albedo by seeding aerosols in the lower stratosphere. SAI has been explored extensively in modeling studies based on observations of temporary cooling of the Earth\u2019s surface following major volcanic eruptions which introduced significant loadings of sulfate particles into the stratosphere. The cooling effect is accompanied by other significant consequences including stratospheric heating, stratospheric ozone (O3) depletion, and reduced global mean precipitation. In order to understand the potential environmental and climate impacts of SAI, we review the state of the knowledge regarding these issues, starting from an aerosol science perspective. We summarize aerosol radiative properties and the role they play in defining the optimal chemical and physical aerosol characteristics for SAI, and their implications for lower stratospheric warming. We then review in depth the impacts of stratospheric aerosol heterogeneous chemistry on global O3 levels. We review SAI modeling studies as well as their uncertainties, in comparison to the observed environmental and climate impacts of volcanically derived sulfate aerosols, including impacts on global temperature, stratospheric warming, and hydrological cycle.

In this work, we present a new methodology for profiling such compounds by liquid-liquid extraction and selective derivatization using 4-bromo-N-methylbenzylamine (4-BNMA) followed by liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Orbitrap HRMS).

Seeded CdSe@CdS nanorods have shown increasing performance with increasing rod length. This observation was rationalized by the increasing lifetime of the separated charges, as a large distance between holes localized in the CdSe seed and electrons localized at the metal tip decreases their recombination rate. However, the impact of nanorod length on electron-to-tip localization efficiency or pathway remained an open question. Therefore, we investigated the photo-induced electron transfer to the metal in a series of Ni tipped CdSe@CdS nanorods with varying length. We find that the transfer processes occurring from the region close to the semiconductor-metal interface, the rod region, and the CdSe seed region depend in different ways on the rods length. The rate of the fastest process from excitonic states generated directly at the interface is independent of the rod length but the relative amplitude decreases with increasing rod length as the weight of the interface region is decreasing. The transfer of electrons to the metal tip from excitons generated in the CdS rod region depends strongly on the length of the nanorods which indicates an electron transport limited process, i.e., electron diffusion towards the interface region followed by fast interface crossing. The transfer originating from CdSe excitonic states again shows no significant length dependence in its time constant as it is probably limited by the rate of overcoming the shallow confinement in the CdSe seed.", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In these domains, the  use of grand-canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) in combination with  implicit solvation models has become popular. GC-DFT can be conveniently applied not only to metallic surfaces, but also to semi-conducting oxides and sulfides and is, furthermore, sufficiently robust to achieve a consistent description of reaction pathways. However, the accuracy of implicit solvation models for solvation effects at interfaces is in general unknown. One promising way to overcome the limitations of implicit solvents is going towards hybrid quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) models. For capturing the electrochemical potential dependence, the key quantity is the capacitance, i.e., the relation between the surface charge and the electrochemical potential. In order to retrieve the electrochemical potential from a QM/MM hybrid scheme, an electrostatic embedding is required. Furthermore, the charge of the surface and of the solvent regions have to be strictly opposite in order to consistently simulate charge-neutral unit cells in MM and in QM. To achieve such a QM/MM scheme, we present the implementation of electrostatic embedding in the popular VASP code. This scheme is broadly applicable to any neutral or charged solid/liquid interface. Here, we demonstrate its use in the context of GC-DFT for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a noble-metal-free electrocatalyst, MoS2. We investigate the effect of electrostatic embedding compared to the implicit solvent model for three contrasting active sites on MoS2: (i) the sulfur vacancy defect which is rather apolar. (ii) an Mo anti-site defect, where the active site is a surface bound highly polar OH group and (iii) a reconstructed edge site which is generally believed to be responsible for most of the catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic embedding leads to almost indistinguishable results compared to the implicit solvent for apolar systems, but has a significant effect on polar sites. This demonstrates the reliability of the hybrid QM/MM, electrostatically embedded solvation model for electrified interfaces.", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, a lack of understanding of the fundamental underlying principles has long stymied our ability to fully harness the power of these interactions. Fortunately, advances in affordable computing power together with new quantum chemistry methods have increasingly enabled a detailed atomic-level view. Empowered by this more nuanced perspective, synthetic practitioners are now adopting these techniques with growing enthusiasm.\nIn this review, we narrate our recent results rooted in state-of-the-art quantum chemical computations, describing pivotal roles for electrostatic interactions in the organization of transition state (TS) structures to direct reactivity and selectivity in the realm of asymmetric organocatalysis. To provide readers with a fundamental foundation in electrostatics, we first introduce a few guiding principles, beginning with a brief discussion of electrostatic interactions and electrostatics-dominated non-covalent interactions as well as and their modulating factors. We then describe computational approaches to capture these effects, primarily through representative case studies. Subsequently, we cover some general strategies that have been utilized to impart stereocontrol in asymmetric organocatalysis, presenting our own results along with selected highlights from other groups. \nWe then briefly cover our most significant recent computational investigations in three specific branches of asymmetric organocatalysis, beginning with chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. We disclose how CPA-catalyzed asymmetric ring openings of meso-epoxides are driven by stabilization of a transient partial positive charge in the SN2-like TS by the chiral electrostatic environment of the catalyst. We also report on substrate-dependent electrostatic effects from our study of CPA-catalyzed intramolecular oxetane desymmetrizations. For non-chelating oxetane substrates, electrostatic interactions with the catalyst confers stereoselectivity, whereas oxetanes with chelating groups adopt a different binding mode that overrides this electrostatic stereodetermination and erodes selectivity. In another example, computational approaches revealed a pivotal role of CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and NH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding in CPA-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolinones. These interactions control selectivity during the enantiodetermining intramolecular amine addition step, and their strength is modulated by substrate positioning within the electrostatic environment created by the catalyst, allowing us to rationalize the effect of introducing o-substituents. Next, we describe our efforts to understand selectivity in a series of NHC-catalyzed kinetic resolutions. We discovered that electrostatic interactions are the common driver of selectivity. Finally, we discuss our breakthrough in understanding asymmetric silylium ion-catalyzed Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition of cinnamate esters to cyclopentadienes. The diastereoselectivity of these transformations is guided by CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O electrostatic interactions that selectively stabilize the endo-transition state. Additionally, we deduced the geometry of the preferred binding mode to explain the requirement for a 9-fluorenylmethyl ester to achieve high selectivity.\nWe conclude with a brief overview of the outstanding challenges and the potential roles of computational chemistry in enabling the exploitation of electrostatic interactions in asymmetric organocatalysis.\n", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We find that the DNN potential is able to reliably reproduce the MB-pol results for liquid water but provides a less accurate description of the vapor-liquid equilibrium properties. This shortcoming is traced back to the inability of the DNN potential to correctly represent many-body interactions. An attempt to explicitly include information about many-body effects results in a new DNN potential that exhibits opposite performance, being able to correctly reproduce the MB-pol vapor-liquid equilibrium properties but losing accuracy in the description of the liquid properties. These results suggest that DeePMD-based DNN potentials are not able to correctly \"learn\" and, consequently, represent many-body interactions, which implies that DNN potentials may have limited ability to predict properties for state points that are not explicitly included in the training process. The computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework can still be exploited to train DNN potentials on data-driven many-body potentials, which can thus enable large-scale, \"chemically accurate\" simulations of various molecular systems, with the caveat that the target state points must have been adequately sampled by the reference data-driven many-body potential in order to guarantee a faithful representation of the associated properties.", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Machine Learning; Physical and Chemical Properties; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Typically, the intensity of a scattering produced from the sample at a fixed angle from an incident laser beam is recorded as a function of time and converted into time autocorrelation data, which can be inverted to estimate the distribution of colloid diffusivity to estimate the colloid size distribution. For polydisperse samples, this inversion problem, being a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, is ill-posed and is typically handled using cumulant expansions or regularization methods. Here, we introduce a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing the measured scattering intensity time autocorrelation data using both the cumulant expansion method and regularization methods, with the latter implemented using various commonly employed algorithms including NNLS, CONTIN, REPES, and DYNALS.

Among the many examples, anionic cyclodehydrogenation using potassium(0) has attracted synthetic chemists because of its irreplaceable reactivity and utility in obtaining rylene structures from binaphthyl derivatives. However, existing methods are difficult to use in terms of practicality, pyrophoricity, and lack of scalability and applicability. Herein, we report the development of a lithium(0)-mediated mechanochemical anionic cyclodehydrogenation reaction for the first time. This reaction could be easily performed using a conventional and easy-to-handle lithium(0) wire at room temperature, even under air, and the reaction of 1,1-binaphthyl is complete within 30 min to afford perylene in 94% yield. Using this novel and user-friendly protocol, we investigated substrate scope, reaction mechanism, and gram-scale synthesis. As a result, remarkable applicability and practicality over previous methods, as well as limitations, were comprehensively studied by computational studies and NMR analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated two-, three-, and five-fold cyclodehydrogenations for the synthesis of novel nanographenes. In particular, quinterrylene ([5]rylene or pentarylene), the longest non-substituted molecular rylene, was synthesized for the first time.

Based on this strategy, both isomers with dia or qtz net (termed JUC-620 and JUC-621) have been obtained, and their structures are deter-mined by combining powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Remarkably, these architectures show a dis-tinct difference in their porous features, e.g., JUC-621 with qtz net exhibits permanent mesopores (up to ~ 2.3 nm) and high surface area (~ 2060 m2 g-1), which far surpasses those of JUC-620 with dia net (pore size of ~1.2 nm  and surface area of 980 m2 g-1). Further-more, mesoporous JUC-621 can remove dye molecules efficiently and achieves excellent iodine adsorption (up to 6.7 g g-1), which is 2.3 times that of microporous JUC-620 (~2.9 g g-1).

One option is the development of new antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), to which bacterial resistance build-up is comparatively slow. Deep generative models have recently emerged as a powerful method for generating novel therapeutic candidates from existing datasets; however, there has been less research focused on evaluating the search spaces associated with these generators from which they sample their new data-points.  In this research we employ five deep learning model architectures for de novo generation of antimicrobial peptide sequences and assess the properties of their associated latent spaces. We train a RNN, RNN with attention, WAE, AAE and Transformer model and compare their abilities to construct desirable latent spaces in 32, 64, and 128 dimensions.  We assess reconstruction accuracy, generative capability, and model interpretability and demonstrate that while most models are able to create a partitioning in their latent spaces into regions of low and high AMP sampling probability, they do so in different manners and by appealing to different underlying physicochemical properties. In this way we demonstrate several benchmarks that must be considered for such models and suggest that for optimization of search space properties, an ensemble methodology is most appropriate for design of new AMPs. We design an AMP discovery pipeline and present candidate sequences and properties from three models that achieved high benchmark scores. Overall, by tuning models and their accompanying latent spaces properly, targeted sampling of new anti-microbial peptides with ideal characteristics is achievable.", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here we present an automated user-friendly framework, HOAX, to perform the hyperparameter optimization for neural networks, which bypasses the need for a lengthy manual process.

This conclusion was drawn from the mainstay Clausius-Mossotti (CM) susceptibility applied to the dielectrophoretic force. However, dielectric interfacial polarization leading to the CM result does not account for a large protein dipole moment which is responsible for the dipolar mechanism of dielectrophoresis outcompeting the CM induction mechanism by three-four orders of magnitude in the case of proteins. Here we propose an explicit geometry within which the dipolar susceptibility may be put to the test. The electric field and dielectrophoretic force are explicitly calculated, and the dependence of the trapping distance on the strength of the applied field is explored.

Despite the majority of the surface being covered by ligands, our understanding of the effect of the ligand shell on photocatalysis is limited to steric effects. We hypothesise that we can increase the activity of QD photocatalysts by designing a ligand shell with targeted electronic properties, namely redox-mediating ligands. Herein, we functionalise our QDs with hole-mediating ferrocene (Fc) derivative ligands and perform a reaction where the slow step is hole transfer. Surprisingly, we find that a hole-shuttling Fc inhibits catalysis, but that dynamically bound Fc ligands can promote catalysis by surface exchange and creation of a more permeable ligand shell. Despite poor catalytic behaviour, a hole-shuttling Fc confers much greater stability to the catalyst by preventing a build-up of destructive holes. Conversely, we find that trapping the electron on a ligand dramatically increases the rate of reaction. These results have major implications for understanding the rate-limiting processes in charge transfer from QDs and the role of the ligand shell in modulating it.

This linear function was further recalibrated to enhance its predicting capabilities, generating such a refining process the equation   characterized by a squared Pearson correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.9774) 1.1 times higher.

The cavity loss process is modeled with the Lindblad jump superoperator on the reduced density of the electronic-photonic quantum subsystem. We inves- tigate the azomethane molecule and its photoinduced isomerization dynamics inside the cavity. Our results show the accuracy of the machine-learned dipoles and their usage in simulating polariton dynamics. Our po- lariton dynamics results also demonstrate the isomer- ization reaction of azomethane can be effectively tuned by coupling to an optical cavity and by changing the light-matter coupling strength and the cavity loss rate.", "date": "2023-02-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Vanadyl salen (salen = N,N-ethylenebis(salicylideneaminato)) complexes functionalized with a crown ether containing a non-redox active Lewis acidic metal cation (V-Na, V-K, V-Ba, V-La, V-Ce, and V-Nd) were synthesized.  The electrochemical behavior of this series of complexes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in solvents with varying polarity and dielectric constant (acetonitrile = 37.5; N,N-dimethylformamide = 36.7; and dichloromethane = 8.93). The vanadium(V/IV) reduction potential shifted anodically (>900 mV in acetonitrile and >700 mV in dichloromethane) with increasing cation charge as compared to complexes lacking the proximal cation. The reduction potential for all vanadyl salen-crown complexes measured in N,N-dimethylformamide was insensitive to cation charge magnitude, regardless of electrolyte or counter anion used. Titration studies of N,N-dimethylformamide into acetonitrile resulted in cathodic shifting of the vanadium(V/IV) reduction potential with increasing concentration of N,N-dimethylformamide. Binding constants of N,N-dimethylformamide (log(KDMF)) for the series of crown complexes show increased binding affinity in the order of V-La>V-Ba>V-K>(salen)V(O), indicating an enhancement of Lewis acid/base interaction with increase of cation charge.

Y. Jen; Xian-Kai  Chen; Chun-Sing Lee; Chihaya Adachi; Xiaohong Zhang", "abstract": "Efficient utilization of triplet excitons is vital in organic optoelectronics. One important strategy for harvesting triplets is thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In most TADF materials, the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states both show strong charge-transfer (CT) character to reduce their energetic gap (EST); however, the negative consequence is small spin-orbit coupling and broad fluorescence emission width. To overcome this trade-off, our present work developed a novel strategy, i.e., intermolecular pi-pi-packing-induced (pi3) TADF, named pi3TADF. Distinct from the previously reported TADF systems, the excited states of our intermolecular pi3TADF systems show weak CT-excitation character. Our designed coplanar molecules based on a 1,5,9-trioxo-13-azatriangulene core show low photoluminescent quantum yields (PLQYs) in dilute solutions while their PLQYs in solid films reach ~ 100%. Their face-to-face pipi packings lead to the hybridization of intermolecular CT and localized pi-pi* excitations as well as electronic delocalization in the S1 states, while their T1 states show little changes. Consequently, with a dense manifold of the triplet states, the EST is significantly reduced while the large spin-orbit couplings are induced, thus leading to efficient TADF and significantly enhanced PLQYs in films. Organic light-emitting diodes exploiting the intermolecular pi3TADF systems as emitters show simultaneously high maximum external quantum efficiencies (e.g., over 30%) and narrow emission spectral widths (e.g., 44 nm). Our present work not only develops a new strategy, i.e., pi3TADF, for efficient TADF but also provides an in-depth understanding of its photophysical mechanism, thus opening a new approach for designing novel and efficient TADF materials.", "date": "2023-02-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recently, \u2206-machine learning (\u2206-ML) was shown to be a promising approach to correcting errors in the quantum chemistry calculation of solvated molecules. However, this approach's applicability to different molecular properties and its performance in various use cases are still unknown. In this work, we tested the performance of \u0394-ML in correcting redox potential and absorption energy calculations using four types of input descriptors and various ML methods. We sought to understand the dependence of \u2206-ML performance on the property to predict, the quantum chemistry method, the data set distribution/size, the type of input features, and the feature selection techniques. We found that \u2206-ML can effectively correct the errors in redox potentials calculated by density functional theory (DFT) and absorption energies calculated by time-dependent DFT. For both properties, the \u2206-ML corrected results showed less sensitivity to the DFT functional choice than the raw results. The optimal input descriptor depends on the property, regardless of the specific ML method used. The solvent-solute descriptor (SS) is the best for redox potential, whereas the combined molecular fingerprint (cFP) is the best for absorption energy. A detailed analysis of the feature space and the physical foundation of different descriptors well explained these observations. Feature selection did not further improve the \u0394-ML performance.

Physics-based simulations and wet-lab experiments often have symmetries (degeneracies) that allow reducing problem dimensionality or search space, but constraining these degeneracies is often unsupported or difficult to implement in many optimization packages, requiring additional time and expertise. So, are the possible improvements in efficiency worth the cost of implementation? We demonstrate that the compactness of a search space (to what extent and how degenerate solutions and non-solutions are removed) affects Bayesian optimization search efficiency. Here, we use the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform by Meta and a physics-based particle packing simulation with eight or nine tunable parameters, depending on the search space compactness. These parameters represent three truncated log-normal distributions of particle sizes which exhibit compositional-invariance and permutation-invariance characteristic of formulation problems (e.g., chemical formulas, composite materials, alloys). We assess a total of four search space types which range from none up to both constraint types imposed simultaneously. In general, the removal of degeneracy through problem reformulation (as seen by the optimizers surrogate model) improves optimization efficiency.

Correct equipartitioning of kinetic energy among translations, rotations and vibrations of the simulated reactants is critical for many processes occurring in the gas phase. As thermalizing collisions are infrequent in gas-phase simulations, the thermostat has to efficiently reach equipartitioning in the system during equilibration and maintain it throughout the actual simulation. Furthermore, in non-equilibrium simulations where heat is released locally, the action of the thermostat should not lead to unphysical changes in the overall dynamics of the system. In this study, we explore issues related to both obtaining and maintaining thermal equilibrium in MD simulations of an exemplary ion-molecule dimerization reaction. We first compare the efficiency of Nos\u00e9-Hoover, Canonical Sampling through Velocity Rescaling, and Langevin thermostats for equilibrating the system and find that of these three only the Langevin thermostat achieves equipartition in a reasonable simulation time. We also study the effect of unphysical removal of latent heat released during simulations involving multiple dimerization events, when global thermostatting schemes are applied, which effectively cools down the reactants and leads to an overestimation of the dimerization rate. Our findings underscore the importance of thermostatting for the proper thermal initialization of gas-phase systems and the consequences of global thermostatting in non-equilibrium MD simulations.

Here, we show that the exchange rate of the reaction in aqueous environments is highly sensitive to the structure of the acceptor and may be varied over four orders of magnitude. Cyclic acceptors exchange rapidly, from 0.95 to 15.6 M-1s-1, while acyclic acceptors exchange between 3.77x10-3 and 2.17x10-2 M-1s-1. Computational, spectroscopic, and structural data suggest that the cyclic acceptors are more reactive than their linear counterparts because of resonance stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate. We leverage this insight to design a compound with reactivity intermediate to that of the cyclic and linear analogs.

While the large electric charges on monomers of either peptide prevent aggregation at neutral pH, stoichiometric mixing of ACC1-13E8 and ACC1-13K8 triggers rapid self-assembly of two-component fibrils driven by favorable Coulombic interactions. The role of low-symmetry non-polar ACC1-13 pilot sequence is crucial in enforcing the amyloidal parallel -sheet motif as self-assembly of free poly-E and poly-K chains under similar conditions results in amorphous antiparallel -sheet conformation. Interestingly, the pathway to highly ordered fibrils is accessible to ACC1-13E8 also when paired with non-polypeptide polycationic amines such as branched poly-ethylenimine, PEI, instead of ACC1-13K8. Remarkably, such synthetic polycations are more effective in triggering fibrillization of ACC1-13E8 than poly-K (or poly-E in the case of ACC1-13K8). High conformational flexibility of these polyamines makes up for the apparent mismatch in periodicity of charged groups.

Unlike classical HTS libraries, the DEL composition cannot be modified once synthesized and, therefore, it must be considered as a stand-alone chemoinformatic object  represented both as a collection of independent molecules, and yet an individual entity. For the analysis of such collections, the concept of the Chemical Library Space (CLS) where entire libraries become objects is indispensable. In this article, we introduce, analyze and compare four vectorial library representations obtained using Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM), formally defining CLS. Such representations allow effective comparison of libraries, with the ability to tune and chemically interpret the similarity relationships. In particular, property-tuned CLS encodings enable to simultaneously compare libraries with respect to both property and chemotype distribution. We apply the various CLS encodings for the selection problem of  DELs that optimally match a reference collection (here ChEMBL28), showing how the choice of the CLS descriptors may help to fine-tune the matching (overlap) criteria.

Leveraging these resources depends in part on a mechanistic understanding for diffusive processes within plant cell walls. Common wood protection treatments and biomass conversion processes to create biorefinery feedstocks feature ion or solvent diffusion within the cell wall. X-ray fluorescence microscopy experiments have determined that ionic diffusion rates are dependent on cell wall hydration as well as the ionic species through non-linear relationships. In this work, we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to map the diffusion behavior of different plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin), ions (Na+ , K+ , Cu2+ , Cl- ) and water within a model for an intact plant cell wallat various hydration states (3 - 30 wt.% water). From these simulations, we analyze the contacts between different plant cell wall components with each other and their interaction with the ions. Generally, diffusion increases with increasing hydration, with lignin and hemicellulose components increasing diffusion by an order of magnitude over the tested hydration range. Ion diffusion depends on charge. Positively charged cations preferentially interact with hemicellulose components, which include negatively charged carboxylates. As a result, positive ions diffuse more slowly than negatively charged ions. Measured diffusion coefficients are largely observed to best fit piecewise linear trends, with an inflection point between 10-15% hydration. These observations shed light onto the molecular mechanisms for diffusive processes within secondary plant cell walls at atomic resolution.", "date": "2023-02-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Biopolymers; Cellulosic materials; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We also probe combining different polarization levels for salt ions and water: when ion polarization is described by the Drude method, water is modeled by either the non-polarizable SPC/E model or the polarizable SWM4-NDP model. The main goal is to achieve simulation stability for different force fields and investigate the influence of the force field parameters on the electrolyte properties. Force field parameters that adjust the interactions of cations or Drude pairs are found to significantly affect the electrolyte structure and its dynamic properties. This effect is primarily due to the strong dependence of the degree of salt dissociation on these parameters.

OLEDs have already been commercialized; however, blue OLEDs have the problem of requiring a high applied voltage due to the high-energy of blue emission. Herein, an ultralow voltage turn-on at 1.47 V for blue emission with a peak wavelength at 462 nm (2.68 eV) is demonstrated in an OLED device. This OLED reaches 100 cd/m2, which is equivalent to the luminance of a typical commercial display, at 1.97 V. Blue emission from the OLED is achieved by the selective excitation of the low-energy triplet states at a low applied voltage by using the charge transfer (CT) state as a precursor and the triplet-triplet annihilation, which forms one emissive singlet from two triplet excitons. We found that the essential component for efficient blue emission is a smaller energy difference between the CT state and triplet exciton, accelerating the energy transfer between the two states and achieving the optimal performance by avoiding direct decay from the CT state to the ground state. Our study demonstrates that the developed OLED allows for a much longer operation lifetime than that from a typical blue phosphorescent OLED because the blue emission originates from a stable low-energy triplet exciton that avoids degrading the constituent materials.", "date": "2023-02-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Metal cations with stronger coordination to ligands (Cu and Ni) tend to form uniform crystals with unusual shapes, whereas weaker coordinating metal cations (Mn and Co) produce crystals with more regular hexagonal morphologies.  The unusual flower-like crystals formed with copper nitrate have two pairs of six symmetrical petals with hexagonal convex centers. The texture of the petals indicates dendritic growth.

The CuPy2XPFe incorporates a second metal center within the pyridine residues and represents a heterodinuclear system, while the structurally analogous Py2XPFe lacks an additional metal in the second coordination sphere. Both the Py2XFe and CuPy2XPFe complexes are observed to activate the weak acid, acetic acid (AcOH) at the FeII/I couple rather than at the more energy intensive FeI/0 couple observed for the TMPFe species at low acid concentrations. The ability of the monometallic Py2XPFe complex to activate the weak proton source at the FeII/I couple manifests as an ECEC(E) type electrochemical mechanism, rather than an EECC(E) type mechanism as observed for the unsubstituted TMPFe. The CuPy2XPFe displays improved reactivity compared with the Py2XPFe and TMPFe under the same substrate conditions; however the mechanistic nuances into the bimetallic CuPy2XPFe system are currently unclear. The concentration of AcOH was incrementally increased and the rate constants of the initial protonation step i.e. formation of a hydridic species (k1,app), as well as of the protonation of the hydric species to produce dihydrogen (k2,app) were calculated using the Foot-of-the-wave and KS zone rate equation methodologies, respectively. The kinetic analysis indicates that the activation of protons through the ECEC(E) type mechanism results in a system in which k1,app < k2,app. As both the monometallic Py2XPFe and bimetallic CuPy2XPFe activate the AcOH at less cathodic potentials than the TMPFe under identical conditions, the overpotential (TOF/2) for these complexes is thus dramatically lower. The reactivity difference of the Py2XPFe when compared to the TMPFe due to the hanging groups influence is postulated to be either a result of the pyridine residues acting as hydrogen bonding promoters to the active site or aiding to stabilize a catalytic intermediate species during catalysis. Interestingly, a mechanistic change for the TMPFe is also observed at higher AcOH concentrations, underlying perhaps an increased HER reactivity of iron-porphyrins in MeCN.

The results of this evaluation reveal that each DEP method requires a distinct frequency to achieve capture of melanoma cells and that the distribution of dielectric properties of PBMCs is more broadly varied in and among patients versus healthy controls. Based on this evaluation, we conclude that 50 kHz provides the highest capture efficiency on our DEP-BPE platform while maintaining a low rate of capture of unwanted PBMCs. We further quantified the efficiency of single-cell capture on the DEP-BPE platform and found that the efficiency diminished beyond around 25% chamber occupancy, thereby informing the minimum array size that is required. Importantly, the capture efficiency of the DEP-BPE platform for melanoma cells when using optimized conditions matched the performance predicted by our analysis. Finally, isolation of melanoma cells from contrived (spike-in) and clinical samples on our platform using optimized conditions was demonstrated. The capture and individual isolation of CMCs, confirmed by post-capture labeling, from patient-derived samples suggests the potential of this platform for clinical application.

Hydrophobicity is often regarded as an undesirable aspect that hinders their dissolution in aqueous electrolytes. In contrast, we modified established Co terpyridine catalysts with hydrophobic perfluorinated alkyl side chains and took advantage of their hydrophobic character by utilizing them not as dissolved species in an aqueous electrolyte but at the gas-liquid-solid interfaces on a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) applied towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2. We found that the self-assembly of these perfluorinated units on the GDE surface results in a catalytic system selective for CH4 production, whereas every other Co terpyridine catalyst reported before was only selective for CO or formate. An array of mechanistic and operando spectroscopic investigations suggests a mechanism in which the pyridine units function as proton shuttles that deliver protons to the dynamic hydrophobic pocket in which CO2 reduction takes place. Finally, optimizing the system by integrating fluorinated carbon nanotubes as a hydrophobic conductive scaffold leads to a Faradaic efficiency for CH4 production above 80% at rates above 10 mA/cm2, thus far unprecedented for a molecular electrocatalytic system.

However, the simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence and MR signals plus the efficacy of the treatment is still a major challenge. To solve this problem, we put forward a strategy of aggregation and de-aggregation based on aggregation-induced emission (AIE). NIR II photosensitizer TQ-TPA with Type I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability and an amphiphilic 2TPE-Gd were firstly synthesized, and both of them showed the AIE property. Depending on the hydrophilic properties, hydrophobic TQ-TPA spontaneously aggregated into the core of nanomicelles formed by DSPE-PEG. Meanwhile, the aggregated 2TPE-Gd in aqueous solution could de-aggregate and insert in the interface, and formed TGdTT NMs. Based on this strategy and AIE property, TGdTT NMs exhibited strong NIR II fluorescence emission and Type I ROS generation ability, and enhanced T1 relaxivity (r1). Moreover, in vitro, in vivo, and pharmacokinetics results demonstrated these nanomicelles had good biosafety and long blood circulation time.

The latter occur for example in magnetic fields. Furthermore, KS references for relativistic open-shell molecules also break time-reversal symmetry due to the single determinant ansatz used.

Recently, we reported a proof-of-principle study of a two-step photobiological-photochemical approach to kerosene biofuels in which a volatile hydrocarbon (isoprene) is produced by photosynthetic cyanobacteria, followed by its photochemical dimerization into C10 hydrocarbons. Both steps can utilize solar irradiation. Here we report the triplet state (T1) sensitized photodimerization of a broader set of small 1,3-dienes to identify which structural features lead to rapid photodimerization. Neat 1,3-cyclohexadiene gave the highest yield (93%) after 24 hours of irradiation at 365 nm, followed by isoprene (66%). The long triplet lifetime of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which is two orders of magnitude longer than those of acyclic dienes, is key to its high photoreactivity and stem from its planar T1 state structure. In contrast, while isoprene is conformationally flexible, it has both photochemical and photobiological advantages as it is the most reactive among the volatile 1,3-dienes and it can be produced by cyanobacteria. At the end, we explored the influence of solvent viscosity, diene concentration, and triplet sensitizer loading on the photodimerization, with a focus on conditions that are amenable when the dienes are produced photobiologically.

Opin. Electrochem. 2020, 22, 170177). Attainable limits of quantification are made much larger by greater background currents and insufficient instrumentation, which restricts progress in sensing and single-entity applications. This limitation can be overcome by converting electrochemical charges into photons, which can be detected with much greater sensitivity, even down to a single-photon level. In this work, we demonstrate the use of fluorescence, induced through a closed-bipolar set-up, to monitor charge transfer processes below the detection limit of electrochemical workstations. During this process, the oxidation of ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) in one cell is used to concurrently drive the oxidation of Amplex Red (AR), a fluorogenic redox molecule, in another cell. The spectroelectrochemistry of AR is investigated and new insights on the commonplace practise of using deprotonated glucose to limit AR photooxidation are presented. The closed-bipolar set-up was used to produce fluorescent signals corresponding to the steady-state voltammetry of FcMeOH on a microelectrode. Chronopotentiometry is then used to show a linear relationship between the charge passed through FcMeOH oxidation and the integrated AR fluorescence signal.

Although these compounds most closely resemble the natural neurotransmitter serotonin, their therapeutic and psychoactive action is still not well understood. Therefore, a quantitative atomistic description of their interaction in the 5-HT2AR receptor is required to shed light into their mode of action. In this work, we performed a computational characterization of the orthosteric binding pocket for classical and photoswitchable psychedelics by means of semi-flexible molecular docking, classical molecular dynamics and binding free energy computations to identify the interactions with the key protein residues. Two nearly degenerate binding poses were observed inside the orthosteric pocket. 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) show a preference for the canonical crystallized pose of the 5-HT2AR-LSD structure, in contrast to N,N-DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and 4-OH-N,N-DMT (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), which show a small preference for the newly identified pose. The photoswitchable analogs trans- and cis- AzobenzeneDMT (AzoDMT) interact similarly to N,N-DMT, with the cis-AzoDMT isomer being the most stable. Finally, the azobenzene domain of both cis- and trans-AzoDMT interact with the same key residue (L229) responsible for the extracellular loop closure of LSD. Our simulations clarify the nature of intermolecular drug/protein interactions, which can help to develop new classes of classical and photoswitchable psychedelics.

However, the low chemical activity of their basal plane results in several technological bottlenecks, including high contact resistance at TMDelectrode interfaces, difficult growth of high-quality gate-oxide layers, and challenging functionalization. The simplest, and perhaps only, approach to overcoming those limitations may be to exploit dative bonding. The effect can enhance binding on TMDs, since their chalcogen nonbonding lone-pair orbitals can function as electron donors. Therefore, it should also be able to impact the surface catalysis for reactions that produce acceptors. This computational study seeks to investigate whether S\u2192P dative bonding may be an effective mechanism for catalysis on the surface of MoS2, and whether the sheet can be functionalized via chemical reactions enabled by the binding of PHn and PCln. The results show that the bonding facilitates the PH functionalization of MoS2. The interaction is strong (1.11 eV), making the whole process exothermic, and the activation energy notably reduced (from 2.08 to 0.5 eV). Furthermore, the mechanism is intrinsically selective, which could prove a vital feature for future advancements in TMD-based electronics, since it could steer selected processes toward surface functionalization or thin-film growth.", "date": "2023-02-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Following characterization of cavity polaritons formed from spatially separated porphyrin monomers and uniformly dispersed porphyrin dimers, we find the peak corresponding to the lower polariton (LP) state in each sample does not possess a width consistent with con- ventional theories of the dispersive energetics in these systems. We model the anomalous, dispersive behavior of the LP peak width in each sample effectively using the results of a Greens function theory used to explain motional narrowing of polariton luminescence spectra in high quality, fully inorganic micro-cavities. We correlate differences in the suppression of excitonic energetic disorder between our samples with macroscopic aspects of specific FP micro-resonators and microscopic attributes of the distinct porphyrin species we use to form cavity polaritons.

Electrochemical aptamer sensors, however, have a recent history of successful in-vivo demonstrations in rat animal models. Herein, we present the first report of real-time human molecular data collected using such sensors, successfully demonstrating their ability to measure the concentration of phenylalanine in dermal interstitial fluid after an oral bolus.

The resulting architecture achieves good precision over the physiological concentration range and clinically relevant, 20 min time lag times. By also demonstrating 90 day dry room-temperature shelf-storage, the reported work also reaches another important milestone in moving such sensors to the clinic.

However, LARP synthesis is susceptible, and thus, little has been deeply understood about how to control the growth of PNCs and the optical characteristics of the PNCs. Herein, by implementing a high-throughput automated experimental platform, we explore the growth behaviors and colloidal stability of the LARP-synthesized PNCs. Using two distinctive acid-base pairs - oleic acid-oleylamine and octanoic acid-octylamine, we systematically explore the influence of ligands - chain lengths, concentration and ratios - on the particle growths and consequent functionalities of the PNCs. We observe that the short-chain ligands cannot make functional PNCs with desired sizes and shapes, whereas the long-chain ligands provide homogeneous and stable PNCs. The PNCs transform into a Cs-rich non-perovskite structure with poorer emission functionalities and larger size distributions by employing excessive amines or polar antisolvent.

Photocatalysis could be one of the ways to address them. It is considered as an advanced oxidation method that involves light to activate a semiconductor. Semiconductors based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) are widely regarded as photocatalytically active materials. However, the performance of TiO2 has limitations due to its wide band gap (~3.2 eV), and a high recombination rate of the photo-generated electron-hole (e\u2212\u2212h+) pair. To overcome these drawbacks, TiO2 in heterojunction with tungsten trioxide (WO3) is well recognized as one of the most explored systems for photocatalytic applications. Depending on the synthesis technique, and the photocatalytic application, various yet contrasting behaviour can be found in the literature.\nIn this work, the photocatalytic properties of the TiO2/WO3 system were thoroughly examined in the removal of gaseous benzene, and generation of H2. Graphene nanoplatelets were included into the TiO2/WO3 system to increase transport and life-time of the photo-generated exciton. The investigation of various parameters that affected the photocatalytic activity of synthesised materials were carried out, including the ratio of WO3 to TiO2, the presence of graphene, and the nature of the photocatalytic application. It has been observed that the position of the conduction bands played indeed a key-role in case of hydrogen generation. A type II heterojunction was found in the TiO2/WO3 system. Modification of TiO2/WO3 with graphene nanoplatelets improved the photocatalytic hydrogen generation, which was particularly evident in samples with higher WO3 content. The most significant increase in hydrogen production was observed with the photocatalyst with 15 mol% WO3 and 1 wt% graphene \u2212 a five-fold increase in yield, compared to its counter-part with no graphene.\n", "date": "2023-02-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Nanoscience; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Photocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Because of its high productivity and lipid content, Nannochloropsis is a promising algae genus. The research shows how to quantify the constituent fatty acid type and composition in order to optimize the growing medium composition for increased biodiesel quality while maintaining high productivity (GC). The algae are grown in three 2.5 L glass jugs with three different nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Throughout the trials, a growing \"1/2\" medium is used. A flocculating solution of aluminum sulfate and vacuum filtration are used to harvest the algae. In situ transesterification is used to maximize fatty acid conversion into fatty acid methyl esters, which are then analyzed using GC. After 32 days of growth, the algae grown in low, medium, and high nutrient concentrations had average absorbance values (a measure of biomass concentration) at 750 nm of 0.91, 0.99, and 1.18, respectively. In a low nutrient concentration, the maximum monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) concentration of 62.68 percent of total fatty acids was achieved, corresponding to high-quality biodiesel. This study resulted in a scientific breakthrough by maximizing both the quality of biodiesel produced, which is superior to any currently available biodiesel, and the quantity, with a productivity that is more than one hundred times that of current biodiesel feedstocks.

Furthermore, the use of nanomaterials could improve the efficiency of lipid extraction while causing no harm to the microalgae., as well as the research needs and future directions for sustainable microalgal biofuel production.

While the FRIPS technique shows great promise, when applied to multiply charged derivatized peptide ions, a series of high abundance mass losses are observed which syphon ion abundance from radically generated sequence ions. This loss of ion abundance reduces the sequence coverage generated by FRIPS fragmentation. In this work, we hypothesized that these mass losses were assisted by the ortho-orientation of the radical precursor undergoing facile conversion into five- or six-membered intermediates or products and that when combined with the lower bond dissociation energy of the para-precursor, conjugated peptides would not undergo this chemistry. To test this assertion, we synthesized para-TEMPO-Bz, conjugated it to these peptides, and collisionally activated each.

In addition, the versatility of this continuous flow device allowed both steps of the reaction to be carried out, namely the formation of the imine directing group and the C3-functionalization with some vinylsilanes and norbonene.", "date": "2023-02-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using industry provided samples of oil sands process water (OSPW) containing anaerobically produced aqueous sulfide, the FRB system was evaluated at both the bench and pilot scale. The photocatalytic FRB demonstrated a 95% reduction in H2S emissions at the lab scale and up to 98% at the pilot-scale under outdoor weather conditions and natural sunlight. H2S emissions intercepted by the FRB were found to be oxidized to non-volatile sulfate. An empirical reactive transport model describing the performance of the FRB is proposed informed by the results obtained in this work.

However, the effectiveness of photocatalysts is usually limited by the irradiation conditions and the properties of the water matrix. In this work, we have demonstrated the capability of surface microlenses (MLs) as a clean technology for more efficient photocatalytic water decontamination. Random or ordered surface MLs were fabricated from simple polymerization of nanodroplets produced in a solvent exchange process. Both random microlenses (MLR) and microlenses array (MLA) could enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of four representative pollutants, including methyl orange (MO), norfloxacin (NFX), sulfadiazine (SFD), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), spiked in ultra-pure water, synthetic natural water, or real river water. By controlling the conditions of light treatment, the photodegradation efficiency could be enhanced by up to 402%. The effectiveness of surface MLs was validated under both visible LED light and simulated solar light and for two photocatalysts zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2). By reducing the concentration of the photocatalysts from 100 to 5 mg/L and the intensity of irradiation intensity from 1 Sun to 0.3 Sun, our findings suggest that the enhancement factor by MLs was higher at lower catalyst concentration, or at lower light intensity. Based on optical simulations and experimental results, we demonstrated that surface MLs optimize the light distribution and promote the formation of active species, which results in the enhancement of degradation efficiency. The use of MLs may serve as a novel strategy to improve the photocatalytic degradation of micropollutants, especially in places where the available light source is weak, such as indoors or in cloudy regions.", "date": "2023-02-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This has parallels with the foundations of the digital revolution which required standard architectures with a well-defined specification.  Recently, we have developed automated platforms for the chemical artificial intelligence driven discovery, synthesis of molecules, materials, nanomaterials, and formulations. To avoid the use of highly expensive systems we focussed on the design and construction of standard hardware and software modules creating a road map for the digitization of chemistry across different fields. Our platforms can be divided into four different categories depending on their application: i) discovery systems for the search of chemical space and new reactivity, ii) synthesis and manufacture of fine chemicals, iii) formulation discovery and exploration, and iv) materials discovery and synthesis. We describe the evolution and convergence of these platforms in terms of, common hardware, firmware, and software along with the development of a programming language for chemical and material systems. This programming approach is not only useful for reliable synthesis, but for design of experiments, discovery, optimisation and providing new standards for collaboration.

However, direct measurement of OMIEC ionic composition and distribution is not common. In this work, we investigate the ionic composition and mesoscopic structure of three typical p-type OMIEC materials: an ethylene glycol treated crosslinked OMIEC with large excess fixed anionic charge (EG/GOPS-PEDOT:PSS), an acid treated OMIEC with tunable fixed anionic charge (crys-PEDOT:PSS), and a single component OMIEC absent any fixed anionic charge (pg2T-TT). A combination of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS), gravimetry, coulometry, and grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) techniques were employed to characterize these OMIECs following electrolyte exposure and electrochemical cycling. In particular, XRF provided quantitative ion-to-monomer compositions for these OMIECs from passive ion uptake following aqueous electrolyte exposure, and potential driven ion uptake/expulsion following electrochemical doping and dedoping. Single ion (cation) transport in EG/GOPS-PEDOT:PSS due to Donnan exclusion was directly confirmed, while despite significant fixed anion concentration in crys-PEDOT:PSS doping and dedoping was shown to occur through mixed anion and cation transport. Controlling the fixed anionic (PSS-) charge density in crys-PEDOT:PSS mapped the strength of Donnan exclusion in OMIEC systems following a Donnan-Gibbs model. Anion transport dominated pg2T-TT doping and dedoping, but a surprising degree of anionic charge trapping (~1020 cm-3) was observed. GISAXS revealed minimal ion segregation both between PEDOT- and PSS-rich domains in EG/GOPS-PEDOT:PSS, and between amorphous and semicrystalline domains in pg2T-TT, but showed significant ion segregation in crys-PEDOT:PSS at length scales of tens of nm, ascribed to inter-nanofibril void space. These results bring new clarity to the ionic composition and distribution of OMIECs that are crucial for accurately connecting structure and properties in these materials.", "date": "2023-02-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Conducting polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We show that active learning-based subsampling can lead to better molecular machine learning performance when compared to both training models on the complete training data and 19 state-of-the-art subsampling strategies.

We discovered that annulation with a simple adamantane scaffold exerts a significant impact on the properties, alignment, and stability of aromatic pi-systems. This unprecedented adamantane annulation was achieved by a two-step transformation of metalated arenes and 4-protoadamantanone, generating a range of adamantane-annulated arenes. Analysis on structural and electronic property uncovered unique effects of the process, such as high solubility and enhanced conjugation. The oxidation of adamantane-annulated perylenes produced strikingly stable cationic species with emission extended to near-infrared region.

Since no single targeted method can identify and quantify all OHCs, the size of the OHC iceberg may be underestimated. We sought to address this problem in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) sludge by quantifying the unidentified fraction of the OHC iceberg using targeted analyses of major OHCs together with measurements of total- and extractable (organo)halogen (TX and EOX, respectively; where X=F, Cl, or Br). In addition to extensive method validation via spike/recovery and combustion efficiency experiments, TX and/or EOX were determined in reference materials (BCR-461 and NIST SRMs 2585 and 2781) for the first time. Application of the method to WWTP sludge revealed that chlorinated paraffins (CPs) accounted for most (~92%) of the EOCl, while brominated flame retardants and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) accounted for only 54% of the EOBr and 2% of the EOF, respectively. Moreover, unidentified EOF in non-polar CP extracts points to the existence of organofluorine(s) with physical-chemical properties unlike those of target PFAS. This study represents the first multi-halogen mass balance in WWTP sludge, and offers a novel approach to prioritization of sample extracts for follow-up investigation.", "date": "2023-02-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Analytical Chemistry - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The difficulties of experimental data and polymer structure representation form a significant barrier in developing foundational AI models in polymer chemistry. These issues are further compounded by a lack of accessible and extensible software tools for experimental researchers to effectively leverage their historical data for AI development. To address these difficulties, we developed an extensible domain specific language, termed Chemical Markdown Language (CMDL), to enable flexible and consistent representation of disparate experiment types. CMDL can be extended to cover new data types and provides built-in support for the graph representation of polymers and automated experimentation platforms such as continuous flow reactors facilitating their ingestion into AI/ML pipelines. CMDL enabled seamless use of historical experimental data to train new AI models for catalyst and materials design. Here, the utility of this approach was first demonstrated through the successful synthesis and experimental validation of novel AI-generated ring-opening polymerization catalysts. Next, we derived a first-of-kind generative model for block and statistical co-polymer structures from their CMDL graph representations. This model preserved critical functional groups within the polymer structure, allowing them to be readily validated experimentally. These results reveal how the versatility of CMDL facilitates translation of historical experimental data into meaningful predictive and generative models which produce experimentally actionable output.", "date": "2023-02-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Submicron SSA particles have long lifetimes in the atmosphere and impact the Earths climate, yet their cloud-forming potential is difficult to study at the single-particle level using conventional experimental techniques due to their small size. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a computational microscope to provide never-before-seen, dynamical views of 40-nm model aerosol particles and their detailed molecular morphologies. We investigate how increasing chemical complexity impacts the distribution and partitioning of organic material throughout individual particles for a range of organic constituents with varying chemical properties. Our simulations show that organic surfactants commonly found in SSA readily partition between both the surface and interior of the aerosol, indicating that nascent SSA may be more heterogeneous than traditional morphological models suggest. We support our computational observations of heterogeneity at the SSA surface with Brewster angle microscopy on model interfaces. Ultimately, our work establishes large-scale MD simulations as a novel technique for interrogating aerosols at the single-particle level, and shows the morphological mechanisms underlying why submicron SSA readily absorb waterand thus have a higher cloud forming potentialthan would otherwise be predicted for organic-rich aerosols.

The crystalline powders of DCzPy emitted blue-green fluorescence at 490 nm. Upon gently grinding, the fluorescence intensity of DCzPy was dramatically enhanced with a hypsochromic-shift by 33 nm. Further heavily grinding, its emission wavelength returned to 490 nm.

The bioaccumulation of PFOS after 28 d increased, while that of PFOA decreased when E. fetida was exposed to the mixture compared to the individual compounds.

Eighty percent of the statistically (p and FDR < 0.05) altered metabolites after 28 d were similarly perturbed by both PFOA and PFOS+PFOA.

The construction of crosslinkers with distance constraints adapted into the design gives a three-dimensional structure of the protein obtained from the crosslinked peptides. Currently, most crosslinkers are designed with reactive groups that target only a few amino acid residues, such as lysine, arginine, cysteine, and glutamic/aspartic acid. This narrow set of amino acid targets restricted the potential of chemical crosslinking strategy capturing protein-protein interactions and protein structure analysis. The demand for new crosslinkers targeting other residues is immense, but unfortunately, the chemistry associated with these residues is not very suitable to conjugate with reactive functional groups.

To improve on the charge separation and electron transfer properties, twenty one D-pi-A organic dyes with nitrostyryl triphenylamine-based structures (NTPAs) were designed and computationally studied, in which triphenylamine, carbazole, or indoline structures were used as donor and NO2 group as acceptor. The LUMOs of these dyes are more localized at the nitrostyryl moiety with almost the same energy and the HOMOs, which are orthogonal to the LUMOs, can be conveniently tuned by changing the donor structure and using different functional groups substituted on the donor. Compared with triphenylamine molecules, carbazole molecules decrease the HOMO energy of NTPA, whereas cis N-phenylindoline structure increase the HOMO energy. In addition, the exciton sizes generated by these dyes are also tuned in a range of 7.0-12.7 A. These results show that introduction of dimethylamino group on the triphenylamine moiety greatly increases the HOMO energy and prolongs the maximum absorption wavelength as well as increases the exciton size, indicating that NTPA dyes containing strong electron donating dimethylamino group on the donor part are promising candidates as sensitizers in the dye-sensitized solar cell applications.

However, reactions under cationic conditions can lead to multiple products due to the intermediacy of non-classical carbocations (carbonium ions  cations featuring a formally pentavalent carbon atom). A famous example is the solvolysis of cyclobutyl or cyclopropylmethyl derivatives, which proceed via two equilibrating non-classical carbocations the cyclopropylcarbinyl ion (CC), and the bicyclobutonium ion (BB)  generating up to three products on nucleophilic capture. The utility of such reactions is therefore often limited, despite the value of the small ring products. Using bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as a template, we show that the regiochemical outcome of small ring opening can be controlled by subtle changes to the structure of non-classical carbocation intermediates, in turn enabling the rational prediction of regioselectivity. We find that the regio- and stereochemistry of ring opening depends not only on the degree of substitution, but also the nature of the substituents, of the BCB ring system and its resulting cationic intermediate. We show that these outcomes can be rationalised by computational models, where bond lengths in the non-classical carbocation inform on the site of reaction. As BCBs are finding increasing use as tools in chemical synthesis and bioconjugation, understanding the factors that control their ring opening offers new opportunities for applications of these molecules.

Membrane fluidity and charge can affect daptomycin activity, but its mechanisms are poorly understood because it is challenging to study daptomycin interactions within lipid bilayers. Here, we combined native mass spectrometry (MS) and fast photochemical oxidation of peptides (FPOP) to study daptomycin-membrane interactions with different lipid bilayer nanodiscs. Native MS suggests that daptomycin incorporates randomly and does not prefer any specific oligomeric states when integrated into bilayers. FPOP reveals significant protection in most bilayer environments. Combining the native MS and FPOP results, we observed that stronger membrane interactions are formed with more rigid membranes, and pore formation may occur in more fluid membranes to expose daptomycin to FPOP oxidation. Electrophysiology measurements further sup-ported the observation of polydisperse pore complexes from the mass spectrometry data.

For that purpose, polyethylene pellets were collected at the beach La Pineda near Tarragona, Spain. Pellets were sorted by chemical composition and a yellowing index, which was used as an indicator of aging. The hydrophilicity of the pellets was estimated through contact angle measurements. We produced microplastics  from these pellets by grinding and filtering. Then, microplastics were dispersed around a free-standing bilayer formed in a 3D microfluidic chip to study interactions between microplastics and lipid bilayers. Our findings indicate that as the microplastics aged, the bilayer was stretched more significantly due to its increased adhesive interaction with the lipid bilayer.

Yet there remains a need for more generalizable EC platforms for the detection of multiple classes of clinically relevant targets. Our group has recently reported a nucleic acid nanostructure that permits simple, economical, and generalizable EC readout of a wide range of analytes (small molecules, peptides, large proteins, or antibodies). The DNA nanostructure is built through on-electrode enzymatic ligation of three oligonucleotides for attachment, binding, and signaling. However, the signaling mechanism predominantly relies on tethered diffusion of methylene blue at the electrode surface, limiting the detection of larger proteins that have no readily available small molecule binding partners. In this study, we adapted the nanostructure sensor to quantify larger proteins in a more generic manner, through conjugating the proteins minimized antibody-binding epitope to the central DNA strand of the nanostructure (DNA-peptide conjugate). This concept was verified using creatine kinase (CK-MM), an important biomarker of muscle damage, myocardial infarction, overexertion/rhabdomyolysis, or neuromuscular disorders where clinical outcomes could be improved with rapid sensing. DNA-epitope conjugates permitted a competitive immunoassay protocol at the electrode surface for quantifying CK protein. Square-wave voltammetry (SWV) signal suppression was proportional to the amount of surface-bound antibody with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5 nM and a response time as low as 3 minutes, and displacement of antibody by native CK-MM protein analyte could also be assayed. CK was quantified from the LOD of 14 nM up to 100 nM, overlapping well with the normal (non-elevated) human clinical range of 3  37 nM, and the sensor response was validated in 98% human serum. While a need for improved DNA-epitope conjugate purification was identified, overall this approach not only allows the detection of a generic protein- or peptide-binding antibody, but it also should facilitate future quantitative EC readout of various clinically relevant protein analytes that were previously inaccessible to EC techniques.

We find that the structure and diffusivity of both the water and the metal ions depends strongly on the humidity of the environment and the relative height within the adsorbed water film.Aqueous aluminum ion diffusion rates in water films corresponding to a typical indoor relative humidity of 30% are found to be more than two orders of magnitude slower than self-diffusion of water in the bulk limit.

We find that the equivalence condition between OGI-based surveys and site-wide screening is robust against different assumptions about the duration of large emitters. As duration of large emitters decrease, monthly site-wide screening surveys are more effective at detecting large emitters compared to quarterly OGI monitoring. However, the contribution of large emitters to total emissions also decreases, which reduces the impact of the higher detection effectiveness of site-wide surveys. In addition, annual OGI survey as part of site-wide screening strategy is more critical when the detection threshold of the screening technology is greater than 10 kg/h or higher as the screening survey does not detect below detection threshold emissions.", "date": "2023-02-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the diversity of compounds exhibiting PCMT is severely limited, which hampers further functionalisation of PCMT-active materials and the fundamental understandings of PCMT. Here, we report on heteroaromatic 1,2-diketones as the new class of PCMT-active compounds, whose PCMT is based on conformational isomerisation. In particular, one of the diketones demonstrates luminescence evolution prior to crystal melting. Thus, the diketone crystal exhibits dynamic multistep changes in the luminescence colour and intensity during continuous ultraviolet irradiation. This luminescence evolution can be ascribed to the sequential PCMT processes of crystal loosening and conformational isomerisation before macroscopic melting. Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis, thermal analysis, and theoretical calculations of two PCMT-active and one inactive diketones revealed weaker intermolecular interactions for the PCMT-active crystals. In particular, we observed a characteristic packing motif for the PCMT-active crystals, consisting of an ordered layer of diketone core and a disordered layer of triisopropylsilyl moieties. Our results demonstrate the integration of photofunction with PCMT, provide fundamental insights into the melting process of molecular crystals, and will diversify the molecular design of PCMT-active materials beyond classical photochromic scaffolds such as azobenzenes.

Applied to extended systems, this electronic structure-based method succeeds to compute a sufficient number of excitations to cover the emergence of plasmon-like states.

In this work, we employed the machine learning (ML) regression algorithms Decision Tree Regressor, the neural network Multilayer Perceptron Regressor, and Lasso Lars IC in a cross-validation (CV) approach combined with quantum chemical calculations of atomic charges to estimate theoretically the new Hammett's constants for 90 chemical donor or acceptor groups by employing different types of quantum chemical atomic charges of the groups as input properties.

In this work, an algorithmic approach was implemented to significantly accelerate the discovery and optimization of periodic steady states. Decomposition of complex dynamics into fundamental mechanistic fast-slow steps improves conceptual understanding of the relationship between binding energy oscillation protocols and overall catalytic rates. Finding the structured forcing protocols, optimally tailored to the multiple time scales of a given individual mechanism, requires efficient search of high-dimensional parameter spaces.

One general strategy to decrease Tm, exemplified by deep eutectic solvents, is to mix components with favorable (negative) enthalpic interactions. We demonstrate a complementary strategy to decrease Tm by mixing many components with neutral or slightly positive enthalpic interactions, using the number of components (n) to increase the entropy of mixing and decrease Tm. In theory, under certain conditions this approach could achieve an arbitrarily low Tm. Furthermore, if the components are small redox-active molecules, such as the benzoquinones studied here, this approach could lead to high energy density flow battery electrolytes. Finding the eutectic composition of a high-n mixture can be challenging due to the large compositional space, yet is essential for ensuring the existence of a purely liquid phase. We reformulate and apply fundamental thermodynamic equations to describe high-n eutectic mixtures of small redox-active molecules (benzoquinones and hydroquinones). We illustrate a novel application of this theory by tuning the entropy of melting, rather than the enthalpy, in systems highly relevant to energy storage. We demonstrate with differential scanning calorimetry measurements that 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives exhibit eutectic mixing that decreases their Tm, despite slightly positive enthalpies of mixing (0-5 kJ/mol). By rigorously investigating all 21 binary mixtures of a set of seven 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives with alkyl substituents (Tm's between 44-120 \u00b0C), we find that the eutectic melting point of a mixture of all seven achieves a large decrease in Tm to -6 \u00b0C. We further determine that the regular solution model shows improvement over an ideal solution model in predicting the eutectic properties for this newly investigated type of mixture composed of many small redox-active organic molecules.", "date": "2023-02-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Theoretical models and experimental techniques show that metal ions can change RNA dynamics and how it transitions through different stages of folding. However, the specific ways in which metal ions contribute to the formation and stabilization of RNA's tertiary structure are not fully understood at the atomic level. Here, we combined oscillating excess chemical potential Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and metadynamics to bias towards the sampling of unfolded states using reaction coordinates generated by machine learning allowing for examination of Mg2+-RNA interactions that contribute to stabilizing folded states of the pseudoknot found in the Twister ribozyme. GCMC is used to sample diverse ion distributions around the RNA with deep learning applied to iteratively generate system-specific reaction coordinates to maximize conformational sampling during metadynamics simulations. Results from 6 s simulations performed on 9 individual systems indicate that Mg2+ ions play a crucial role in stabilizing the 3D structure of the RNA by stabilizing specific interactions of phosphate groups or phosphate groups and bases of neighboring nucleotides. While many phosphates are accessible to interactions with Mg2+ it is observed that multiple, specific interactions are required to sample conformations close to the folded state; coordination of Mg2+ at individual specific sites facilitates sampling of folded conformations though unfolding ultimately occurs. It is only when multiple specific interactions occur, including the presence of specific inner shell cation interactions linking two nucleotides, that conformations close to the folded state are stable. While many of the identified Mg2+ interactions are observed in the X-ray crystal structure of Twister, the present study suggests two new Mg2+ ion sites in the Twister ribozyme that contribute to stabilization. In addition, specific interactions with Mg2+ are observed that destabilize the local RNA structure, a process that may facilitate the folding of RNA into its correct structure.

However, the applicability of GOase towards more complex molecules such as those frequently found in the pharmaceutical, or agrochemical industries remains restricted. Here, by employing a combined approach of directed evolution and predictive modelling, we have identified new GOases with significantly expanded substrate specificity toward both bulky benzylic and unactivated secondary alcohols, showing activity enhancements of up to 2,400-fold compared to the reported benchmark M3-5 mutant. Beneficial mutations conveying relaxed substrate enantioselectivity biases (R/S ratios down to 1.05) and higher thermostabilities (up to 20-fold versus benchmark) have also been identified.

In this work, we report a new class of electrocatalysts based on the layered Weyl semimetals MIrTe4 (M = Nb, Ta) for the Eosin Y (EY)-sensitized hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under visible light illumination.

Under conditions that promote overcharging, the zeta potential and the vSFG measurements follow a similar trend, however, SHG yields the opposite behaviour. The results can only be rationalized by considering a significant pH dependent increase in the silica contribution. Using a simplistic, yet physically motivated model, we demonstrate that silica can interfere either constructively or destructively with water. By computing the hyperpolarizabilities of neutral and deprotonated silica clusters with density functional theory (CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)), we reveal that one potential source of this pH-dependent response of silica is a change in the hyperpolarizability upon the deprotonation of surface sites suggesting SHG is directly sensitive to surface charging of mineral oxides.", "date": "2023-02-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Using small angle x-ray scattering, we find that structural heterogeneities across a wide range of compositions in binary mixtures of malonamide extractants and alkane diluents are well described by Ornstein-Zernike scattering. This suggests that structure in these simplified organic phases originates from the critical point associated with the liquid-liquid phase transition. To confirm this, we measure the temperature dependence of the organic phase structure, finding critical exponents consistent with the 3D Ising model. Molecular dynamics simulations were also consistent with this mechanism for extractant aggregation. Due to the absence of water or any other polar solutes required to form reverse-micellar-like nanostructures, these fluctuations are inherent to the binary extractant/diluent mixture. Our previous work found pseudobinary critical fluctuations near the critical point for more complex organic phases with extracted polar solutes, including water, acid and metal ions. Taken together, these results suggest this mechanism for explaining organic phase aggregation may dominate over a wide range of conditions encountered in practical liquid-liquid extraction organic phases. We also show how the molecular structure of the extractant and diluent modulate these critical concentration fluctuations by shifting the critical temperature: critical fluctuations are suppressed by increasing extractant alkyl tail lengths or decreasing diluent alkyl chain lengths. This is consistent with how extractant and diluent molecular structure are known to impact metal and acid loading capacity in many-component LLE organic phases, suggesting phase behavior of practical systems may be effectively studied in simplified organic phases.

Early studies of Zr-MOF-catalyzed hydrolytic degradation of an organophospho-ester type CWA, Sarin, and its simulant, dimethyl-4-nitrophenylphosphate (DMNP), suggested that the activity originates from ZrIV-OH-ZrIV moieties that resemble the structure of the active-site phosphotriesterase enzyme. Measurements of pKa values for hexa-zirconium-node-sited bridging hydroxo, terminal hydroxo, and aqua ligands reveal essentially complete conversion of mu-hydroxo ligands to substitution-inert mu-oxo ligands at alkaline pHs, ruling out a primary role for ZrIV-OH-ZrIV moieties, despite the resemblance to the phosphotriesterase enzyme active-site. The measurements also rule out a secondary role as a hydrogen bond donor/stabilizer of bound DMNP. Additionally, the measurements show that reactant-displaceable node-aqua ligands become increasingly scarce in increasingly alkaline environments. Here, rates of catalyzed hydrolysis reaction were examined experimentally to ascertain reaction orders and, in turn, interrogate the mechanism. In striking contrast to the ubiquitous Zr-MOF, UiO-66, for which simulant displacement of water as a node ligand is rate-determining, and the rate of catalysis (in alkaline environments) increases with decreasing pH, catalysis by NU-1000 is rate-limited by solution hydroxide attack of the nitrophenoxide-phosphorous bond of the MOF-activated simulant, with the overall hy-drolysis rate being remarkably insensitive to pH (or pOH). Underlying the unusually weak sensitivity of rates of hydroly-sis to pH is almost exact counter-balancing of the prevalence of catalyst active-sites (Zr-OH2 sites) with activity of the re-action nucleophile, free hydroxide ion, as a function of pH. We ascribe the residual pH dependence of the overall rate to a charge-based modulation of the equilibrium constant for simulant binding to the node. In contrast to overall hydrolysis rates, the catalyst turnover frequencies per Zr-OH2 active-site are strongly pH dependent, exceeding 30,000 s-1 at pH 10.5.

Here, we derive an empirical two-parameter model to fit isotherm data of IUPAC types I, III, and V in a descriptive way based on the Bass model for innovation diffusion. We report 31 isotherm fits to existing literature data covering all six types of isotherms, various adsorbents, such as carbons, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks (MOF), as well as different adsorbing gases (water, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen). We find several cases, especially for flexible MOFs, where previously reported isotherm models reached their limits and either failed to fit the data or could not sufficiently be fitted due to stepped type V isotherms. Moreover, in two instances models specifically developed for distinct systems are fitted with a higher R2 value compared to the models in the original reports. Using these fits, it is demonstrated how the new Bingel-Walton isotherm can be used to qualitatively assess the hydrophilic or hydrophobic behavior of porous materials from the relative magnitude of the two fitting parameters. The model can also be employed to find matching heats of adsorption values for systems with isotherm steps using one, continuous fit instead of partial, stepwise fits or interpolation. Additionally, using our single, continuous fit to model stepped isotherms in IAST mixture adsorption predictions leads to good agreement with results from the Osmotic Framework Adsorbed Solution Theory (OFAST) that was specifically developed for these systems using a stepwise, approximate fitting, yet is far more complex. Our new isotherm equation accomplishes all of these tasks with only two fitted parameters, providing a simple, accurate method for modeling a variety of adsorption behavior.", "date": "2023-02-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Separation of succinic acid from its aqueous phase was investigated in a recent work using a tertiary amine, such as tri-n-octyl amine (TOA), with different diluents. The study based on the acid concentration ranged from 0.14 to 0.5 mol/kg, while the TOA concentration ranged from 0.11 to 0.57mol/kg to study the parameters like the distribution coefficient, loading ratio, equilibrium complexation constant, and degree of extraction.

Many works in the last decades have contributed with mechanistic studies on this reaction. Nevertheless, the reaction scheme is entangled which makes difficult to correlate it with the kinetic response in electrochemical experiments. In this paper we propose a microkinetic model for the methanol electro-oxidation reaction on polycrystalline platinum. The model was built on relevant mechanistic aspects available in the literature and formulated based on the mean-field approach. The kinetic parameters were determined by optimization and the validation was performed through the comparison with distinct sets of experimental data, namely cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and also oscillatory time-series recorded under galvanostatic conditions. The resulting model was able to simulate successfully the nonlinear dynamics observed in galvanostatic experiments, including chaotic behavior, as well as a reasonable voltammetric profile with the same set of electrokinetic parameters. The sensitivity analysis of the kinetic parameters showed that the electro-oxidation pathway through the formic acid intermediate is not significant under these experimental conditions and that the OHad and COad species are mainly involved in the origin of the oscillations, while species that affect the rate of formation/consumption of the latter causes the mixed-mode oscillations. The electrokinetic parameters were discussed with the data available for the electrooxidation reaction of formic acid, where the connection between the values highlights the applicability of this approach to other electrocatalytic reactions.", "date": "2023-02-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Kinetics; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We compare GPR-MGK to graph neural networks on four logic datasets and find that the atomic attribution of GPR-MGK generally outperforms the atomic attribution of graph neural networks. We also perform a detailed molecular attribution analysis using the FreeSolv dataset, showing how molecules in the training set influence machine learning predictions and why Morgan fingerprints perform poorly on this dataset. This is the first systematic examination of the interpretability of GPR-MGK and thereby an important step in the further maturation of marginalized graph kernel methods for interpretable molecular predictions.

Top-down proteomics may provide additional insights into disease etiopathogenesis since this approach focuses on protein forms, or proteoforms, originally circulating in blood, potentially providing access to information about relevant post-translational modifications, truncation, single amino acid substitutions and many other sources of protein variation. However, the vast majority of proteomic studies on serum and plasma are carried out using peptide-centric, bottom-up approaches which cannot recapitulate the original proteoform content of samples. Lengthy sample preparation and the need for extensive prefractionation to mitigate proteoform dynamic range issues are likely factors preventing clinical laboratories from routinely performing top-down experiments. In this study, we describe a straightforward protocol for intact proteoform sample preparation based on depletion of albumin and immunoglobulins followed by simplified fractionation of remaining serum proteins via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After molecular weight-based fractionation, we supplemented the traditional liquid chromatography  tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS2) data acquisition with high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), which served as an additional separation dimension to further simplify serum proteoforms mixtures. This LC-FAIMS-MS2 method led to the identification of over 1,000 serum proteoforms <30 kDa using a reduced number of experiments, more than doubling the number of proteoforms identified in previous studies.", "date": "2023-02-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

ThDP-dependent enzymes all require ThDP as a coenzyme for catalytic activity, although individual enzymes vary significantly in substrate preferences and biochemical reactions. A popular way to study the role of these enzymes through chemical inhibition is to use thiamine/ThDP analogues, which typically feature a neutral aromatic ring in place of the positive thiazolium ring of ThDP. While ThDP analogues have aided work in understanding the structural and mechanistic aspects of the enzyme family, at least two key questions regarding the ligand design strategy remain unresolved: 1) among the reported aromatic rings, which is the best? and 2) how can we achieve selectivity towards a given ThDP-dependent enzyme? In this work, we synthesise derivatives of these analogues covering all central aromatic rings used in the past decade and make a head-to-head comparison of all the compounds as inhibitors of several ThDP-dependent enzymes. Thus, we establish the relationship between the nature of the central ring and the inhibitory profile of these ThDP-competitive enzyme inhibitors. We also demonstrate that introducing a C2-substituent onto the central ring to explore the unique substrate-binding pocket can improve selectivity.", "date": "2023-02-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, many electronic properties (such as excitation energies or ionization energies) do not necessarily scale linearly with system size and may even be spatially localized.

However, this approach only allows simulations of relatively small canonical ensembles over a limited period (shorter than 100 ps). On the other hand, computationally efficient semiclassical approaches can treat the EDL model based on a grand canonical scheme by averaging the microscopic details. Thus, an improved description of the EDL can be obtained by combining AIMD simulations and semiclassical methods based on a grand canonical scheme.

Regeneration of monomer starting materials allows for the reproduction of virgin polymer in a closed-loop fashion. However, methods for chemical recycling to monomer typically rely on bulk heating of polymer, which leads to unselective depolymerization in complex polymer mixtures and the formation of degradation byproducts. Here, we report a selective chemical recycling strategy facilitated by photothermal carbon quantum dots under visible light irradiation. Upon photoexcitation, we found that carbon quantum dots generate thermal gradients that induce bulk depolymerization of various polymer classes, including commercial samples. This method also provides selective depolymerization in mixed polymer waste streams enabled by the spatial control over thermal gradients.

While PESs are intuitively appealing because anchoring the anion to a polymer backbone selectively slows down anionic motion and therefore increases t+, increasing the anion charge will act as a competing effect, decreasing t+. In this work we directly measure ion mobilities in a model non-aqueous polyelectrolyte solution using electrophoretic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (eNMR) to probe these competing effects. While previous studies that rely on ideal assumptions predict that PESs will have higher t+ than monomeric solutions, we demonstrate that below the entanglement limit, both conductivity and t+ decrease with increasing degree of polymerization. For polyanions of 10 or more repeat units, at 0.5m Li+ we directly observe Li+ move in the wrong direction in an electric field, evidence of a negative transference number due to correlated motion through ion clustering. This is the first experimental observation of negative transference in a non-aqueous polyelectrolyte solution. We also demonstrate that t+ increases with increasing Li+ concentration. Using Onsager transport coefficients calculated from experimental data, and insights from previously published molecular dynamics studies we demonstrate that despite selectively slowing anion motion using polyanions, distinct anion-anion correlation through the polymer backbone and cation-anion correlation through ion aggregates reduce the t+ in non-entangled PESs. This leads us to conclude that short-chained polyelectrolyte solutions are not viable high transference number electrolytes.", "date": "2023-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Even though these schemes have been successfully implemented in several quantum chemistry codes,their basis set requirements remained largely unknown. Here, we assess the basis set requirements of the full interaction operator and the generalized length and velocity representations. These three schemes were applied in the calculation of radial distributions of transition moment densities corresponding to the 1s1/2 and 7s1/2  7p1/2transition in the radium atom, representative of core and valence excitations, respectively. We have performed calculations with the dyall.aeXz (X=2,3,4) basis sets at the four-component relativistic TD-HF level of theory and compared them withequivalent finite-difference calculations. We find that the full interaction is extremelystable with respect to the choice of basis set, already being converged with dyall.ae2z.With respect to truncated interaction, we find that the length representation electric multipoles is the easiest to converge, requiring the dyall.ae2z basis for low-order multipoles and the dyall.ae4z basis at higher orders. The magnetic multipole moments follow a similar trend, although they are more diffcult to converge. The velocity representation electric multipoles are the most difficult to converge: at high orders, thedyall.ae3z and dyall.ae4z basis sets introduce artificial peaks and oscillations, which increase the overall error. These artifacts are associated with linear dependence issues in the small component space of the larger basis sets. The full interaction operator,however, does not suffer from these problems, and we therefore recommend its use in the simulation of x-ray spectroscopy.", "date": "2023-02-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, individual voltammetry techniques are likely to be subcomponents of broader analytical workflows that incorporate complementary methods to diagnose evolving electrolyte solutions of uncertain composition. As such, we demonstrate that jointly evaluating electrolyte solutions with distinct voltammetric modes can enhance the capabilities and sensitivities of characterization protocols. Specifically, by considering both macroelectrode cyclic square wave and microelectrode cyclic voltammograms in sequential (\"one after another\") and simultaneous (\"all at once\") manners, the composition of an electrolyte solution may be estimated with greater accuracy, and analytes that exhibit near identical electrode potentials may be more readily differentiated. We additionally explore means of further improving this method, finding that protocol accuracy increases when multiple voltammetry techniques are included in the training dataset. We also observe that the algorithm typically becomes more confident--but not necessarily more accurate--when the number of data points increases. Overall, these studies show that the sequential and simultaneous methods may hold utility when evaluating multiple voltammetry datasets that, in turn, may be leveraged to streamline diagnostic workflows used to examine electrolyte solutions within electrochemical technologies.", "date": "2023-02-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, using planar p-Si (100) as the absorbing material, we show that TaOx satisfies all three of the above criteria. TaOx films were synthesized by both pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and radio-frequency (RF) sputtering. In both cases, careful control of the oxygen partial pressure during growth was required to produce ETLs with acceptable electron conductivity. p-Si/TaOx photocathodes were interfaced with ca. 10 nm of a CO2R catalyst: Cu or Au. Under front illumination with simulated AM 1.5G in CO2-saturated bicarbonate buffer, we observed, for both metals, faradaic efficiencies for CO2R products of ~50% and ~30% for PLD TaOx and RF sputtered TaOx, respectively, at photocurrent densities up to 8 mA cm-2. p-Si/TiO2/Cu photocathodes were also evaluated but produced mostly H2 (>97%) due to reduction of the TiO2 to Ti metal under CO2R conditions. In contrast, a dual ETL photocathode (p-Si/TiO2/TaOx/Cu) was selective for CO2R, which suggests a strategy for separately optimizing selective charge collection and the stability of the ETL/water interface. The maximum photovoltage obtained with p-Si/TaOx/Cu devices was 300 mV which was increased to 430-460 mV by employing ion implantation to make pn+-SiTaOx/Cu structures. Photocathodes with RF sputtered TaOx ETLs are stable for CO2R for at least 300 min.

Aza-bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane (aza-BCH) and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) scaffolds have recently emerged as attractive classes of sp3-rich cores for replacing flat, aromatic scaffolds with metabolically resistant, three-dimensional frameworks.

While multiple, independent methods have been developed for the preparation of these structural motifs, strategies to directly convert, or scaffold hop, between these bioisosteric subclasses through single-atom skeletal editing would enable efficient interpolation within this valuable chemical space. Herein, we describe a strategy to scaffold hop between aza-BCH and BCP cores through a nitrogen-deleting skeletal edit. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions, used to prepare multifunctionalized aza-BCH frameworks, are coupled with a subsequent deamination step to afford bridge-functionalized BCPs, for which few synthetic solutions currently exist.

Despite the advances in experimental techniques, theoretical calculations have become increasingly challenging as the molecule of interest grows complex. Here, we propose a novel conformational search method, which exploits the structure-spectrum correlation using a similarity score that quantifies the agreement of theoretical and experimental spectra. The method reveals the atomistic structure of two conformers of a capped penta-peptide, acetyl-SIVSF-N-methylamine, which has remained unknown since its first observation [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2018, 57, 5626]. Although one of the conformers is assigned to the lowest-energy conformer, the other one is found to be 25 kJ mol-1 higher in energy with distinctly different geometry. The result suggests multiple pathways in the early stage of the folding process; one to the global minimum and the other to a different basin. Once such a structure is formed, the second conformer hardly overcomes the barrier to produce the most stable structure due to a vastly different hydrogen bond network of the backbone. The proposed method can characterize not only the lowest-energy conformer but also kinetically trapped, high-energy conformers of complex biomolecules.

In this respect, the carbonyl group is a particularly relevant due to its ability reacting either as electrophile or pro-nucleophile at the alpha-carbon in its enolized form. The transition from precious metals to catalysts based on earth-abundant metals made impressive progress, and especially nickel became a powerful tool due to its low-cost and unique reactivity profiles. Low-valent nickel(0) complexes promote reductive couplings carbonyl compounds exploiting the electrophilic nature of the carbonyl group. In stark contrast, complementary alpha-functionalization of carbonyls leveraging its pro-nucleophilic character in conjunction with olefin acceptors are very scarce despite their attractivity. We report a Ni(0)NHC catalyst which promotes the conversion of ketones and non-conjugated dienes that are both cheap and widely accessible starting materials to synthetically highly valuable alpha-allylated products in excellent yields under mild conditions without any additional base or additive. The catalyst directly activates the alpha-hydrogen atom of the carbonyl substrates transferring it the olefin acceptor. The complete process is redox neutral and fully atom-economic. This feature contrasts typical carbonyl -functionalizations with precious metals that require functionalized substrates like a pre-formed enolate nucleophile and allyl electrophile. The transformation creates adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. Moreover, we introduce a chiral bulky designer NHC ligand allowing to conduct the reaction in an enantioselective manner providing the functionalized products with up to 99:1 er and >20:1 dr. Mechanistic and computational studies indicate an initial LLHT process from the ketone substrate to the olefin substrate to set the selectivity of the whole transformation. A beta-hydride elimination chain walking events is triggered until a favorable pi-allyl intermediate is reached leading by reductive elimination to the targeted products.

This paper focuses on the more efficient utilization of the UV light-excited charge carriers in cuprous oxide by preparing different heterostructures with gold. While keeping the size, shape as well as overall composition of the heterostructures identical, the realization of the gold component is varied: either nanograins are created at the surface of the Cu2O nanooctahedra or nanorods are embedded in their interior. The effect of the morphology and the semiconductor-metal contact on the optical and photocatalytic properties is investigated in-detail by spectroscopy, spectrofluorometry, imaging techniques, X-ray diffractometry, and photoelectron spectroscopy extended with optical simulations and single-particle spectroscopy measurements. In terms of particle stability and photocatalytic activity, gold-decorated Cu2O nanooctahedra show superior properties. The comprehensive comparison of the multicomponent nanoparticles underlines the importance of the nanoscale design (including composition, morphology, and surface chemistry), which utilizes the photoexcited carriers in the semiconductor without injecting hot electrons from the metal.", "date": "2023-02-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Optical Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The formal introduction of sulfur centres into the parent polycarbonates results in a net shift of the polymerisation equilibrium towards, and therefore facilitating, depolymerisation.

However, their application is less straightforward than the corresponding process by which the thermal chemistry of such systems is rationalized in terms of ground-state aromaticity (GSA) and antiaromaticity (GSAA). Recognizing that the harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) provides an easy way to measure aromaticity on geometric grounds, it is therefore notable that this model is yet to parameterized for excited states. Against this background, we here present a new parameterization of HOMA \u2212 termed HOMER \u2212 for the T1 state of both carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds based on high-level quantum-chemical calculations. Considering CC, CN, NN and CO bonds and testing the parametrization using calculated magnetic data as reference, we find that the description of ESA and ESAA by HOMER is superior to that afforded by the original HOMA scheme, and that it reaches the same overall quality as HOMA does for GSA and GSAA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derived HOMER parameters can be used for predictive modeling of ESA and ESAA at very different levels of theory. Altogether, the results highlight the potential of HOMER to facilitate future studies of ESA and ESAA.

However, this neglects the actual local aromaticity of the molecules, which often feature multiple subunits with [4n+2] pi-electrons besides the formal 4n pi-electron system. This has led to considerable criticism from those who believe that the term antiaromatic should not be used for any molecule with a formal 4n pi-electron system but should be reserved for truly antiaromatic molecules. To reconcile the different viewpoints, the concept of concealed antiaromaticity is introduced here. Concealed antiaromaticity acknowledges that many molecules claimed to be antiaromatic are not truly antiaromatic, but they can exhibit behaviour under certain conditions that would normally be expected for antiaromatic molecules. Three types of concealed antiaromaticity are distinguished based on the conditions under which the molecules can behave like antiaromatic molecules: concealed antiaromaticity revealable in redox reactions (Type I-CA), upon photoexcitation (Type II-CA), and in intermolecular interactions (Type III-CA). The concept of concealed antiaromaticity will enable the rational design of molecules that show the desirable properties of antiaromatic molecules under the different conditions, with broad applications from organic electronics to supramolecular architectures, while avoiding the low stability of truly antiaromatic molecules.", "date": "2023-02-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To decrease the cost in the production of hydrogen through electrolysis, there are several obstacles that must be overcome. For instance, more active and stable anodes made of abundant and cheap materials will contribute to lowering the capital and operational expenditure of the process. It is well-known that the oxidation of water requires high overpotentials, which is the main limitation for the performance of the device. In this context, substituting the oxidation of water (OER) at the anode of electrolyzers by the oxidation of biomass-derived substances contribute to the overall process by decreasing the power input of the devices and, in some cases, by producing value-added chemicals.\nHerein, we re-visited some of the most important fundamental aspects of the (electro-)oxidation of alcohols and polyols on metal-based catalysts, focusing on reaction descriptors. Then, we moved to the (electro-)oxidation of these molecules on metal oxides, re-visiting some of the literature about their application in heterogeneous catalysis and for OER, to get insights about the relation of the structure of the materials and their activity.\nDue to the lack of fundamental knowledge about the electro-oxidation of alcohols and polyols on metallic oxides and to the vast literature about the use of perovskite oxides for OER, we propose to start systematic studies using perovskite oxides for the electrooxidation of alcohols and polyols. Consequently, we presented results for LaCoO3, LaFeO3, LaMnO3, and LaNiO3, and propose a mechanism for the electro-oxidation of glycerol based on the formation and reactivity of MOH(O) species.

Due to the poor pharmacodynamic properties and the shallow interface of the PD-1/PD-L1 binding pocket, progress in developing small molecule PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors that can overcome the limitations of monoclonal antibodies has been slow.

Here we report the development of a new i, i + 7 diyne-girder stapling strategy that addresses these issues. The asymmetric synthesis of nine unnatural Fmoc-protected alkyne-amino acids facilitated a systematic study to determine the optimal (S,S)-stereochemistry and 14-carbon diyne-girder bridge length. Diyne-girder stapled T-STAR peptide 29 was demonstrated to have excellent helicity, was cell permeable and stable to protease degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the diyne-girder constraint is a bifunctional Raman chromophore with potential use in Raman cell microscopy. Development of this highly effective, bifunctional diyne-girder stapling strategy leads us to believe that it can be used to produce other stapled peptide probes and therapeutics.", "date": "2023-02-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While this unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed within the molecular structure, close to its metal center, quantitative activity descriptors are still lacking to guide the rational design of molecular catalysts with enhanced activity. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a detailed kinetic treatment based on a mechanistic model that applies to the whole DuBois catalyst series and show that, with a unique set of parameters, it allows, for a good fit of the experimental data measured in a wide range of pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from the balanced equilibrium constant of the kinetically critical hydrogen uptake and evolution chemical step and the corresponding rate constants being large enough in both directions, as well as a very fast intramolecular proton transfer, both being likely due to concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays at the immediate vicinity of the catalysts. In that specific case, we show that hydrogen oxidation, kinetically limited by H2 insertion, has a larger turnover frequency than hydrogen evolution that is kinetically limited by H2 release. The reversibility of catalysis appears also to result from a subtle balance between the characteristics of two sequential proton-coupled electron transfer square schemes and the equilibrium constants as well as the kinetic constants of both chemical steps. We illustrate experimentally that reversibility does not required that the energy landscape be flat, with in the present case redox transitions occurring at potentials ~250 mV away for the equilibrium potential. Still, large deviations from a flat energy landscape requires interfacial electron transfers to occur far from their equilibrium potential, which impacts their kinetics and the overall rate of catalysis. At that point, the rate of catalysis may be limited by the efficiency of deprotonation/reprotonation of the relays, a concern that also holds for the design of improved monodirectional electrocatalysts.", "date": "2023-02-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Electrocatalysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Aqueous emulsions of thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) can exhibit distinctive optical responses in the presence of surfactants and have thus emerged as sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive sensors or reporters of environmental amphiphiles. However, many existing LC-in-water emulsions require the use of complicated or expensive instrumentation for quantitative characterization, owing to variations in optical responses among individual LC droplets. In many cases, the responses of LC droplets are also analyzed by human inspection, which can miss subtle color or topological changes encoded in LC birefringence patterns. Here, we report an LC-based surfactant sensing platform that takes a step toward addressing several of these issues and can reliably predict concentrations and types of model surfactants in aqueous solutions. Our approach uses surface-immobilized, microcontact printed arrays of micrometer-scale droplets of thermotropic LCs and hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically extract and decode rich information about topological defects and color patterns available in optical micrographs of LC droplets to classify and quantify adsorbed surfactants. In addition, we report computational capabilities to determine relevant optical features extracted by the CNN from LC micrographs, which can provide insights on surfactant adsorption phenomena at LC-water interfaces.

We discovered in this study that CV-N and His6-tagged GRFT not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection but also lead to irreversibly inactivated pseudovirus particles.  The irreversibility effect was revealed by the observation that pseudoviruses first treated with either CV-N or GRFT and then washed to remove all soluble lectin did not recover infectivity.  Infection inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus mutants with single-site glycan mutations in Spike suggested that two glycan clusters in S1 are important for both CV-N and GRFT inhibition, one cluster associated with the RBD (receptor binding domain) and the second with the S1/S2 cleavage site. We observed lectin antiviral effects with several SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus variants, including the recently emerged omicron, as well as a fully infectious coronavirus, therein reflecting the breadth of lectin antiviral function and the potential for pan-coronavirus inactivation.  Mechanistically, observations made in this work indicate that multivalent lectin interaction with S1 glycans is likely a driver of the lectin infection inhibition and irreversible inactivation effect and suggest the possibility that lectin inactivation is caused by an irreversible conformational effect on Spike.

Herein, we have designed three pyridine-substituted triphenylamine derivatives and achieved ultralong RTP properties with both color-tunability and UV irradiation-responsiveness by embedding them into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrices, respectively. Notably, introducing the pyridine groups with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing (ISC) and forming hydrogen-bonding networks is essential for triggering efficient and ultralong RTP from doping PVA systems. Consequently, doping film TPA-2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4 ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. Moreover, by co-doping with the fluorescent dye rhodamine B, color-tunable persistent luminescence has been realized via phosphorescence energy transfer. More importantly, doping PMMA systems exhibit reversible UV irradiation-responsive ultralong RTP properties. Finally, various patterns are devised to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in advanced anti-counterfeiting and information encryption.

However, experimental limitations and a poor understanding of the distribution underlying the stretched exponential function, commonly used to model the data, may be leading to misinterpretation of the results. Herein we develop guidelines on the experimental design, data fitting, and analysis required to accurately interpret magnetisation\ndecay measurements. Different measures of the magnetic relaxation rate extracted from magnetisation decay measurements of [Dy(Dtp)2][Al{OC(CF3)3}4], fitted using\ndifferent combinations of fixing or freely fitting different parameters, are compared to those obtained using the innovative square-wave \u201cwaveform\u201d technique of Hilgar et\nal, which is comparable to AC susceptometry for measurement of relaxation rates on long timescales. The most reliable measure of the relaxation time for magnetisation decays is found to be the the average logarithmic relaxation time, $e^{\u27e8ln [\u03c4]\u27e9}$, obtained via a fit of the decay trace using a stretched exponential function, where the initial and equilibrium magnetisation are fixed to first measured point and target values respectively. This new definition has causes the largest differences to traditional approaches in the presence of large distributions or relaxation rates, with differences up to 50% with \u03b2 = 0.45, and hence could have a significant impact on the chemical interpretation of magnetic relaxation rates. A necessary step in progressing towards chemical control of magnetic relaxation is the accurate determination of relaxation times, and such large variations in experimental measures stress the need for consistency in fitting and interpretation of magnetisation decays.", "date": "2023-02-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Magnetic Materials; Magnetism; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The covalent radii of atoms, ionic radii of ions, and van der Waals (VDW) radii of neutral atoms can all be derived from crystal structures. However, the VDW radii of ions are a challenge to determine because the atomic distances in crystal structures were determined by a combination of the VDW interactions plus the electrostatic interactions, making it unclear how to define the VDW sphere of ions in such an environment. In the present study, we found that the VDW radii, which were determined based on the 0.0015 au electron density contour through a wavefunction analysis on atoms, have excellent agreement with the VDW radii of noble gas atoms determined experimentally. Based on this criterion, we calculated the VDW radii for various atomic ions across the periodic table, providing a systematic set of VDW radii of ions. Previously we have shown that the 12-6 Lennard-Jones nonbonded model could not simultaneously reproduce the hydration free energy (HFE) and ion-oxygen distance (IOD) for an atomic ion when its charge is +2 or higher. Because of this, we developed the 12-6-4 model to reproduce both properties at the same time by explicitly considering the ion-induced dipole interactions. However, recent studies showed it was possible to use the 12-6 model to simulate both properties simultaneously when an ion has the Rmin/2 parameter (i.e., the VDW radius) close to the Shannon ionic radius. In the present study, we show that such a \u201csuccess\u201d is due to an unphysical overfitting, as the VDW radius of an ion should be significantly larger than its ionic radius. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we show that such overfitting causes significant issues when transferring the parameters from ion-water systems to ion-ligand and metalloprotein systems. In comparison, the 12-6-4 model shows significant improvement in comparison to the overfitted 12-6 model, showing excellent transferability across different systems. In summary, although both the 12-6-4 and 12-6 models could reproduce HFE and IOD for an ion, the 12-6-4 model accomplishes such a task based on the consideration of the physics involved, while the 12-6 model accomplishes this through overfitting, which brings significant transferability issues when simulating other systems. Hence, we strongly recommend the use of the 12-6-4 model (or even more sophisticated models) instead of overfitted 12-6 models when simulating complex systems such as metalloproteins.", "date": "2023-02-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The Stern-Volmer (S-V) equation is the most common expression used to analyzing quenching behavior, and can be used to extract kinetics in complex environments. However, the approximations underlying the S-V equation are incompatible with Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) acting as the primary quenching mechanism. The nonlinear distance dependence of FRET leads to significant departures from standard S-V quenching curves, both by modulating the interaction range of donor species, and increasing the effect of component diffusion. We demonstrate this inadequacy by probing the fluorescence quenching of long-lifetime lead sulfide quantum dots (QDs) mixed with plasmonic covellite copper sulfide (CuS) nanodisks (NDs), which serve as perfect fluorescent quenchers. By applying kinetic Monte-Carlo methods which consider particle distributions and diffusion we are able to quantitatively reproduce experimental data which shows significant quenching at very small concentrations of NDs. Distribution of interparticle distances and diffusion are concluded to play important roles in the fluorescence quenching, particularly in the shortwave infrared, where photoluminescent lifetimes are often long relative to diffusion time-scales.", "date": "2023-02-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Addressing the gas-phase ionisation behaviour has been realised by gas chromatography coupling to high-resolution mass spectrometry without the usage of a dopant. For the multicomponent standard, it has been found that Xe-APPI is able to ionise a broad range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as their heteroatom-containing and alkylated derivatives. However, thiol and ester compounds could not be detected. Moreover, Xe-APPI revealed a high tendency to generate oxygenated artefact, most likely due to a VUV absorption band of oxygen at 148 nm. Beneficially, almost no chemical background, commonly caused by APCI or Kr-APPI due to column blood, plasticisers or impurities, is observed. This advantage is noteworthy for evolved gas analysis without pre-separation or for chromatographic co-elution. For the complex mixtures, Xe-APPI revealed the predominant generation of radical cations via direct photoionisation with a high selectivity towards aromatic core structures with low alkylation. Interestingly, both Xe-APPI and Kr-APPI could sensitively detect sterane cycloalkanes, validated by gas chromatographic retention. The narrowly ionised chemical space could let Xe-APPI find niche applications, e.g., for strongly contaminated samples to reduce the background.", "date": "2023-02-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A major challenge is the lack of an efficient tool to discover DES candidates. Currently, the search relies heavily on the researchers intuition or a trial-and-error process, which leads to a low success rate or bypassing of promising candidates. Recognizing the central role that hydrogen bonds play in the DES formation, this work aims to decipher the hydrogen bond features for DESs and develop machine learning models to predict the potential of a system to be DES based on the hydrogen bond-based descriptors. We first analyze the hydrogen bond properties of 38 known DES and 111 known non-DES systems using their molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. The analysis reveals two features for DES compared to non-DES: (a) the imbalance between the numbers of the two intra-component hydrogen bonds, and (b) more and stronger inter-component hydrogen bonds. Based on the analysis results, we developed 30 machine learning models using ten algorithms and three types of hydrogen bond-based descriptors. The model performance is first benchmarked using their average and minimal ROC-AUC values. We also analyze the importance of individual features in the models and the results are consistent with the simulation-based statistical analysis. Finally, we validate the prediction ability of the models using the experimental results of 34 systems. The Extra Trees outperforms the others in the validation with an ROC-AUC of 0.88. Our work iterates the importance of hydrogen bond in DES formation and shows the potential of machine learning in discovering new DESs.

However, gauging the crossover point at which the CpR substituents are large enough to prevent equatorial ligand binding, but small enough to approach the metal closely and generate strong crystal field splitting, has required laborious synthetic optimization. We therefore created the computer program, AtomAccess, to predict the accessibility of a metal binding site and its ability to accommodate additional ligands. Here we apply AtomAccess to rapidly screen a series of derivatized dysprosium metallocene fragments of varying steric bulk in silico, allowing us to identify the crossover point for equatorial coordination in [Dy(CpR)2]+ cations, and hence predict a cation that is at the cusp of stability without equatorial interactions, viz. [Dy(Cpttt)(Cp*)]+ (Cpttt = C5H2tBu3-1,2,4, Cp* = C5Me5). Upon synthesizing this cation we found it crystallizes as either a contact ion-pair, [Dy(Cpttt)(Cp*){Al[OC(CF3)3]4-k-F}], or separated ion-pair polymorph, [Dy(Cpttt)(Cp*)][Al{OC(CF3)3}4]C6H6. These complexes, together with their precursors and yttrium analogs, have been characterized by NMR and ATR-IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, SQUID magnetometry and ab initio calculations. We find that the contact ion-pair shows inferior SMM properties to the separated ion-pair, as expected, due to faster Raman and quantum tunneling of magnetization relaxation processes.

Indeed, bisguaiacol F diisocyanate (BGI) was obtained via a three-step process from readily available bisguaiacol F (BGF), involving conversion of aromatic amine into aromatic isocyanate. The unusual metal-free conversion of BGF to bisguaiacol F diamine (BGA) was performed by a two-step approach: a) the Williamson-type alkylation of BGF and then b) the base-promoted Smiles rearrangement of bis O-Alkylated BGF. In order to improve the sustainability of this process, the first step was realized under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions, and the second step was performed using two different activating methods: thermal and microwave. The thermal process provided an isolated BGA yield of ca. 70%. Microwave activation proved to be an interesting alternative, although a lower yield (32%) of the desired BGA was achieved. Finally, the diisocyanate synthesis was performed via a phosgene-free/room temperature protocol using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in presence of a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Two polyurethane thermosets were designed and synthesized using the aromatic diisocyanates, biobased BGI and petrochemical-based methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), by a solvent-free two-step polymerization process, and their thermo-chemical properties were evaluated.

To further aid covalent drug design, we extended a functional group mapping approach based on explicit solvent all-atom molecular simulations (SILCS: Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation) that intrinsically considers protein flexibility, functional group and protein desolvation along with functional group-protein interactions. Through docking of a library of representative warhead fragments using SILCS-Monte Carlo (SILCS-MC), reactive cysteines can be correctly identified for proteins being tested.

In this context, atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques have been previously employed for InN growth at low temperatures (typically < 350 C), reportedly yielding crystals with high quality and purity. In general, this technique is assumed to not involve any gas phase reactions as a result from the time-resolved insertion of volatile molecular sources into the gas chamber. Nonetheless, such temperatures could still favour the precursor decomposition in gas phase during the In half-cycle, therefore altering the molecular species that undergoes physisorption and, ultimately, driving the reaction mechanism to pursue other pathways. Thence, we herein evaluate the thermal decomposition of relevant In precursors in gas phase, namely trimethylindium (TMI) and tris(N,N-diisopropyl-2-dimethylamido-guanidinato) (III) (ITG), by means of thermodynamic and kinetic modelling. According to the results, at T= 593 K, TMI should exhibit partial decomposition of ~8% after 400 s to first generate methylindium (MI) and ethane (C2H6), a percentage that increases to ~34% after 1 hour of exposure inside the gas chamber. Therefore, this precursor should be present in an intact form to undergo physisorption during the In half-cycle of the deposition experiment (< 10 s). On the other hand, the ITG decomposition starts already at the temperatures used in the bubbler and it will slowly decompose as it is evaporated during the deposition process. At T= 300 C, the decomposition is a fast process that reaches 90% completeness after 1 s, and where equilibrium, at which almost no ITG remains, is achieved before 10 s. In this case, the decomposition pathway is likely to occur via elimination of carbodiimide ligand. Ultimately, these results should contribute for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism involved in the InN growth from these precursors.

This is illustrated by comparing Mo-based (pre)catalysts prepared by impregnation with different metal loadings (2.5-15.6 wt% Mo) and a well-defined model material (2.3 wt% Mo) prepared via a surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) synthetic approach. Analyses of FTIR, UV-vis, and Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectra provide strong evidence that all the (pre)catalysts are composed predominantly of similar isolated Mo dioxo sites; however, they exhibit very different proportions of reducible surface sites and catalytic reaction properties. Specifically, the SOMC-derived catalyst is more active for liquid and gas-phase olefin metathesis conditions than a classical catalyst of similar Mo loading by a factor of 1.5-1.9, depending on precise reaction conditions. Most notably, solid-state 95Mo NMR spectra of these catalysts show distinct features, particularly evident under state-of-the-art high-field (28.2 T) measurement conditions where at least four distinct types of surface Mo dioxo sites are resolved, the distribution of which depends on the preparation methods. In particular, the presence of Mo sites with a specific deshielded 95Mo NMR signal correlates with the catalysts reducibility and metathesis activity; such sites are most prominent in the SOMC-derived catalyst. First-principles calculations show that the 95Mo NMR parameters, specifically the isotropic chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constant, are good descriptors for local strain and coordination environment: acute (SiO-Mo(O)2-OSi) angles and low coordination numbers at the Mo sites leads to highly deshielded iso chemical shifts and small CQ values, respectively. Orbital and natural chemical shift analyses indicate that the deshielded 95Mo iso values of strained species are directly related to low LUMO energies, consistent with their higher reducibility and corresponding reactivity. Overall, this study shows that solid-state NMR is particularly powerful for the identification of distinct supported Mo dioxo species and that their 95Mo chemical shifts are related to their specific local electronic structures, providing a powerful descriptor for the propensity of Mo sites towards reduction and the formation of active sites.

Moreover, inclusion of FP fragments could lead to, for example, wrong identification further down the workflow. Commonly used methods for deconvolution of fragment signals rely on the presence of a time domain (e.g., peak apex retention time difference and correlation analysis). However, when there is no or insufficient MS2 information in the time domain, these methods are unusable and only the mass domain remains. A probability based cumulative neutral loss (CNL) model for fragment deconvolution using the mass domain information was thus developed to allow deconvolution for such cases. The optimized model, with a mass tolerance of 0.005 Da and a CNL score threshold of -0.95, was able to achieve true positive rate (TPr) of 95.0%, a false discovery rate (FDr) of 25.6%, and a reduction rate of 39.9%. Additionally, the CNL model was extensively tested on real samples containing predominantly pesticides at different concentration levels and with matrix effects. Overall, the model was able to obtain a TPr above 95% with FD rates between 45% and 77% and reduction rates between 10% and 24%. Finally, the CNL model was compared with the retention time difference method and peak shape correlation analysis, showing that a combination of correlation analysis and the CNL model was the most effective for fragment deconvolution, obtaining a TPr of 93.1%, a FDr of 57.2%, and a reduction rate of 42.6%.", "date": "2023-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Constant potential or grand canonical ensemble (GCE) simulations are indispensable for unraveling the properties of electrochemical processes as a function of the electrode potential. Currently, GCE calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level are carried out by fixing the Fermi level of the simulation cell. Here we show that this method is inadequate for modelling semiconductor electrodes, outer sphere reactions, and a biased two-electrode cell; for these systems the Fermi level obtained from DFT calculations does not reflect the experimentally controlled electrode potential or describe the thermodynamic independent variable in GCE-DFT. To remedy this deficiency, we developed and implemented a constant inner potential (CIP) method as a more robust and general approach to carry out GCE-DFT simulations of electrochemical systems under constant potential or bias conditions. In CIP-DFT the electrode inner potential and hence the thermodynamically relevant electron bath electrochemical are directly controlled which makes the method widely applicable in simulating electrochemical interfaces. We demonstrate that the CIP and Fermi level GCE-DFT approaches are equivalent for metallic electrodes and inner-sphere reactions but CIP is also applicable to systems for which the constant Fermi level approach fails. A key advantage of CIP is that, unlike the Fermi level method, it does not require any electronic structure information. This is because only the inner potential of the systems is needed, CIP is also more compatible with classical force field or machine learning potentials. Altogether, the CIP approach emerges as a general and efficient GCE-DFT method to simulate (photo)electrochemical interfaces from first principles.", "date": "2023-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

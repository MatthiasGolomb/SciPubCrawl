Their lightweight nature facilitates easy dispersal by wind, water, and animals, exacerbating pollution issues. Moreover, the limited incentives for recycling and challenges in collection compound these problems. This study highlights how plastic litter disproportionately affects rural areas, subsequently impacting urban dwellers and the broader Nigerian economy. It identifies issues such as transmission of diseases, contamination risks, airborne pollutants like phthalates and bisphenol, and their adverse effects on both the environment and human health. In agriculture, plastic pollution disrupts soil structure, reduces water retention, hampers microbial activity, and interferes with nutrient cycling. Additionally, it causes equipment damage, obstructs tilling operations, promotes fertilizer runoff, and contributes to erosion. In the transportation, tourism, and recreation sectors, plastic litter results in unsightly pollution, impairs visual aesthetics, blocks drainage systems, accelerates erosion, triggers flash floods, and harms wildlife habitats. While plastic bottles and similar items pose fewer environmental concerns due to their easier collection, recycling, and reuse compared to lightweight packaging polymers, urgent action is imperative to address the pervasive plastic pollution. A shift from polyethylene bags for small product packaging to plastic bottles is recommended to mitigate these adverse impacts on the Nigerian populace and the environment.

The triazole spacer significantly enhanced the reactivity of the neopentyl sulfonate towards nucleophilic substitution. Additionally, we developed a novel Resin-Assisted Purification and Deprotection (RAPD) protocol involving a solid-phase extraction of the protected 211At-labeled compound from the mixture of the labeling reaction, hydrolysis of the acetal on the resin, and finally an elution of the 211At-labeled activator from the resin.

Using this 211At-labeled activated ester, we efficiently synthesized 211At-labeled cetuximab in 27\u00b11% radiochemical yield with 95% radiochemical purity. This activated ester demonstrated high reactivity, and enabled the completion of the reaction with the antibody within 10 minutes.

The low affinities of these interactions are typically enhanced by multivalent engagements to promote binding. However, each biological interaction requires a unique display and orientation of ligands. Therefore, the availability and diversity of synthetic multivalent probes are invaluable to the investigation of ligand-receptor binding interactions. Here, we report glycopolymers prepared from bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-6-ene-7-carboxamide and 4,7-dihydro-1,3-dioxepin or cyclohexene. These glycopolymers, synthesized by alternating ring-opening metathesis polymerization, display precise ligand spacing as well as the option of a hydrophobic or acetal-functionalized polymer backbone. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data analysis revealed that these [4.2.0] glycopolymers adopted distinct conformations in solution. In aqueous media, [4.2.0]-dioxepin glycopolymers formed swollen polymer chains with rod-like, flexible structures while [4.2.0]-cyclohexene glycopolymers assumed compact, globular structures. To illustrate how these glycopolymers could aid in the exploration of ligand-receptor interactions, we incorporated the [4.2.0] glycopolymers into a biological assay to assess their potential as activators of acrosomal exocytosis (AE) in mouse sperm. The results of the biological assay confirmed that the differing structures of the [4.2.0] glycopolymers would evoke distinct biological responses; [4.2.0]-cyclohexene glycopolymers induced AE in mouse sperm while [4.2.0]-dioxepin glycopolymers did not.

Here, we deduce the formation mechanisms of anisotropic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, 1D nanorods and 2D nanoplatelets, by combining in situ X-ray scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy. In both cases, emissive prolate nanoclusters form upon mixing of the two precursor solutions. The divergent anisotropy is induced by ensuing antisolvent addition: The intermediate nanoclusters are driven into a dense hexagonal mesophase, where they fuse to form nanorods. Contrastingly, nanoplatelets grow freely dispersed from dissolving nanoclusters, stacking subsequently in lamellar superstructures. Shape and size control of the nanocrystals are determined primarily by the antisolvent's dipole moment and Hansen hydrogen bonding parameter.

Therefore, assessing and ensuring drinking water supply is a critical task in modern society. Conventional approaches to analyzing and controlling drinking water quality are labor-intensive and costly with a low throughput. Machine learning (ML) is an alternative, promising technique to assess and ensuring safe drinking water supply. Existing reviews have summarized the applications of ML in safe drinking water supply from different aspects. However, a state-of-the-art, comprehensive review is missing that focuses on applying ML to monitor, simulate, predict, and control drinking water quality, especially in municipal engineered water systems. This review, therefore, critically compiles the applications of ML in assessing and ensuring water quality in engineered water systems. To be comprehensive, we also cover the applications of ML in other drinking-water-related settings such as water sources and water purification processes. We explain the basic mechanics and workflows of ML, focusing on the applications of ML to access and control key factors or etiologies in drinking water from the physical, chemical, and microbiological aspects. Those factors or etiologies affect water quality and public health, such as water pipeline failures, disinfectant by-products, heavy metals, opportunistic pathogens, biofilms, and antimicrobial resistance genes. We then illustrate the distribution of ML models across research topics in safe drinking water supply. Finally, we discuss the challenges and outlooks for the applications of machine learning in safe drinking water supply. This is the first review summarizing the feasibility and applications of ML in assessing and ensuring water quality in municipal engineered water systems as well as other related water environments.

With the increase of xylazine in the drug supply in recent years, use of xylazine test strips has also begun to take root. As adoption and implementation of this tool continues, a desire to implement test strips for other drugs may emerge. However, since these strips are designed for urine testing, it is important to understand their applicability to testing drugs themselves. In this work, we investigate the utility of seven types of urine immunoassay test strips \u2013 amphetamine, benzodiazepine, cocaine, methamphetamine, nitazene, opiate, and xylazine \u2013 for drug checking applications. Reproducibility, sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and the effect of prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures were studied. Generally, the tests were found to be reproducible, able to detect trace (\u00b5g/mL) levels of the analyte of interest, and minimally affected by prolonged storage at elevated temperatures. Nearly all tests showed cross-reactivity with compounds other than the analyte of interest, highlighting the need to better understand these limitations prior to implementation in a drug checking scenario (that may involve additional chemical analysis on or off site). The viability of expired cocaine, fentanyl, and methamphetamine and test strips was also interrogated, and little to no change in sensitivity was found even though the tests were multiple years expired.", "date": "2024-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; High-throughput Screening", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the present study, we aim to provide fundamental information on the behavior of NO2 at atmospherically relevant organic interfaces that may also help inform innovation in NO2 sensing and trapping development. We then present an investigation into the structural changes induced by NO2 at the surface of propylene carbonate (PC), an environmentally relevant carbonate ester. Surface-sensitive spectra of the PC liquid surface are acquired before, during, and after exposure to NO2 using infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS). Spectra reveal that NO2 preferentially interacts with the carbonyl of PC at the interface, forming a distribution of binding symmetries. At low ppm levels, NO2 saturates the PC surface within 10 minutes and the perturbations to the surface are constant over time during the flow of NO2. Upon removal of NO2 flow, and under atmospheric pressures, these interactions are reversible, and the liquid surface structure of PC recovers completely within 30 min. Another ester-containing molecule, diethyl sebacate (DES), was also investigated and the same carbonyl-specific interaction with NO2 was intermittently observed.

Sourced either from plants, algae, or bacteria, nanocellulose can be processed into colloid, gel, film and fiber forms. However, the required fundamental understanding of process parameters that govern the morphology and structure-property relationships of nanocellulose systems, from colloidal suspensions to bulk materials, has not been developed and generalized for all forms of cellulose.  This further hinders the more widespread adoption of this biopolymer in applications. Our study investigates the dispersion of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) produced by a bacterial-yeast co-culture, in solvents, highlighting the role of thermodynamic interactions in influencing their colloidal behavior.  By adjusting Hansen solubility parameters, we controlled the thermodynamic relationship between CNFs and solvents across various concentrations, studying the dilute to semi-dilute regimes. Rheological measurements revealed that the threshold at which a concentration-based regime transition occurs is distinctly solvent-dependent.  Complementing rheological analysis with small angle X-ray scattering and zeta potential measurements, our findings reveal that enhancing CNF-solvent interactions increases excluded volume in the dilute regime, emphasizing the importance of the balance between fiber-fiber and fiber-solvent interactions. Moreover, we investigated the transition from colloidal to solid state by creating films from dispersions with varying interaction parameters in semi-dilute regimes.  Through mechanical testing and scanning electron microscopy imaging of the fracture surfaces, we highlight the significance of electrokinetic effects in such transitions, as dispersions with higher electrokinetic stabilization gave rise to stronger and tougher films despite having less favorable thermodynamic interaction parameters.

Polaritons provide a versatile platform for investigating quantum electrodynamics effects in chemical systems, such as polariton-altered chemical reactivity. However, using polaritons in chemical contexts will require a better understanding of the photophysical properties of polaritons, especially at ambient temperature and pressure, where chemistry is typically performed. Here, we investigated leveraging strong light-matter interactions to control the excited state dynamics of colloidal CdSe nanoplatelets (NPLs) coupled to a Fabry-P\u00e9rot optical cavity. Importantly, changes in the cavity quality (Q) factor, which is a measure of photon loss from the cavity, were used to profoundly change the polariton dynamics. As the Q-factor was increased, we observed significant population of the upper polariton (UP) state, exemplified by the rare observation of substantial UP photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. In fact, with low energy excitation at the lower polariton (LP), which is not absorbed by uncoupled nanoplatelets, we observed upconverted PL emission from the UP branch, due to efficient exchange of population between the LP, UP and the reservoir of dark states present in collectively coupled polaritonic systems. Critical physical insight into the mechanism of PL enhancement of the UP, and PL upconversion, was provided by state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations that account for multiple cavity electromagnetic modes and cavity loss. In addition, by resolving lower and upper polariton PL lifetimes, we found timescales for polariton dynamics on the order of 100 picoseconds, implying great potential for NPL based polariton systems to affect photochemical reaction rates. This work provides important insight into the photophysics of nanocrystal-based exciton-polariton systems and is a significant step towards the development of practical polariton photochemistry platforms.

The core of our approach comprises the interaction between myelin assemblies that deliver copper(II) ions to the tips of copper dendrites, which in turn grow along the Cu2+-gradient upon electrodeposition. First, we successfully include Cu2+ ions amongst amphiphile bilayers in myelin filaments, which grow from C12E3-based source droplets over air-water interfaces.

The myelins deliver Cu2+ at a negative electrode, feeding copper dendrite growth upon electrodeposition. Intriguingly, the copper dendrites follow the Cu2+ gradient towards the myelins, and grow along them towards the source droplet.

Surface-initiated polymer brushes were recently found to be particularly effective at delivering oligonucleotides and maintaining high knock down efficiencies for prolonged periods of time, in highly proliferative cells. However, what distinguishes their binding capacity for oligonucleotides from that of larger therapeutic macromolecules remains unknown. In this report, we characterise the binding capacity and adsorption kinetics of different types of nucleic acid materials for gene delivery (single and double stranded oligo RNA and DNA, mRNA and plasmid DNA) to PDMAEMA and PMETAC brushes, using surface plasmon resonance. The type and size of these nucleic acid macromolecules are found to have an important impact on their maximum surface density, and the association and adsorption constants of the resulting complexes. To gain further insight into the mechanisms that restrict the adsorption of higher molecular weight materials, and promote particularly effective RNA capture, the architecture of PDMAEMA brushes prior and after complexation is investigated by in situ ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry. Deep infiltration of oligonucleotides was found, irrespective of their binding capacity, suggesting that their infiltration is not a limiting factor in their dense capture on polymer brushes. In contrast, mRNA and pDNA were found to partially infiltrate within PDMAEMA brushes, although some of the nucleic acid materials could be found deep into the brush layer. This indicates that the size of these macromolecules and their partial infiltration may restrict further adsorption and high binding capacities, but also suggests that oligonucleotides will experience enhanced protection within polymer brushes, with fewer residues accessible for enzymatic degradation.", "date": "2024-04-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Drug delivery systems; Polymer brushes; Polymer morphology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, we propose Graph Neural Network (GNN) models for predicting CO2 solubility directly from the molecular structure of its constituents. The GNN leverages a mixture graph representation that captures the molecular structure of the DES components as well as their intermolecular interactions. We compare the GNN framework against alternative architectures (neural networks, graph convolution networks, and random forests) and data representations (molecular fingerprints, sigma profiles, pseudo-component graphs). We show that the proposed approach offers superior predictive performance;\nspecifically, we show that solubility can be predicted reliably directly from molecular structure (without the need of using sigma profiles as proposed in previous studies). This result is important, as obtaining sigma profiles requires expensive density functional theory computations. We also explored the ability of GNNs to predict solubility for new DES mixtures and operating conditions. We found that the model extrapolates across temperature, pressure, and molar ratios\nreliably. However, we also found deficiencies in the ability of the model to predict solubility for DES mixtures not included in the training set; we show that this is due to an inherent lack of chemical diversity in datasets available in the literature.

Our extended experimental findings reveal that these materials exhibit notable sensitivity, particularly within relative humidity ranges of 40% to 100%.

In light of this observation, we conduct periodic cycling experiments at relative humidity levels of 40-70% to evaluate the measurement repeatability and feasibility of these sensors for indoor applications. Interestingly, the periodic cycling study demonstrates that MOF-545 shows promising repeatability, positioning it as a strong contender for indoor humidity sensing. In contrast, MOF-525 may necessitate extended desorption time, and NU-902 displays diminished sensitivity at low relative humidity levels. Nevertheless, a preliminary treatment of the MOF-545 QCM sensor may be necessary to address irreversible adsorption sites and uphold measurement repeatability, as only reversible adsorption sites are currently accessible.

We analyzed (1) how food memory associated with a food product affects consumer\u2019 perception, and (2) which visual sensory cues are most significant for food preference and how these cues interact.  A traditional dessert, helva, with collective memories and sensory expectations among participants, was selected as a case study. A functional food product was formulated by modifying a traditional recipe of helva to produce model food products. For that, the butter was replaced with pumpkin seed flour in varying amounts: 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, while keeping the rest of the traditional recipe the same. The modification of fat contents resulted in a gradual shift from the typical visual attributes of the product that consumers have stored in their memories. Various image compositions of the model products were taken and used as visual sensory cues in the study. The study compared data from two groups of participants. The first group, referred as the 'food item\u2019 group,  received images showing the entire model food product. This allowed them to clearly see the complete food item. The second group, the 'visual item' group, received images showing only a section of the product, resembling ordinary objects rather than clearly indicating that it was food. Both groups responded to questions about how they perceive the products via visual stimuli (images). Our results indicate that visual sensory cues used in food-based decisions are more interdependent, e.g., rougher products are perceived to be darker, compared to those used in decisions about perceived ordinary objects. Furthermore, in the food item group, 11 pairs of visual sensory cues showed significant correlation (e.g., softer products appear stickier), whereas only one pair of sensory cues was correlated in the visual item group. We propose that food memory and top-down attention influence food perception via visual cues, and thus product choices.

Modified peptides featuring helix-stabilizing macrocycles have shown promise as inhibitors of these interactions. Here, we tested the ability of N-terminal to side-chain thioether-cyclized peptides to inhibit the \u03b1-helix binding protein Mcl-1, by screening a trillion-scale peptide library using RaPID technology.

To this scope, we designed two systems based on battery electrical vehicles (BEV) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV). The supply is primarily provided by renewable electricity, eventually converted to H2 in an electrolyser to feed FCEV. Excess electricity is stored in methane or methanol, synthesised using CO2 coming from biogas upgrading. We calculated technical performance indicators based on input values obtained for the city of Zurich. We observed that the electrical mobility is the most efficient option from various perspectives, including the efficiency of the engine and the lower amount of electricity required for conversion to H2. The study shows that for electrical mobility the system would work in storage mode for ca. 70 % of the time (i.e., converting the excess electricity in methane or methanol), requiring the re-conversion of electricity for the remaining time. Methane appears as the best storage molecule for electricity, due to the higher efficiency of the conversion processes, however limiting the electricity-to-electricity efficiency to 29 %. Methanol proves to be the best molecule for H2 storage, with 43 % H2-to-H2 efficiency. The total cost of the system is evaluated considering the case study of a biogas plant close to Zurich. It was found that the cost of the generated electricity and H2 would range between 0.18-0.21 \u20ac/kWh. Combined with the low cost of renewable electricity that is offered to customers for 70 % of the time, this makes the proposed solution a cost-competitive option for the decarbonisation of mobility. Additionally, we observed how the designed system would allow a simple option to integrate carbon capture, operating the transfer of CO2 from decentralised emitters to a centralised reforming plant.

To achieve this, we combine ensemble reweighting techniques with the potential contrasting method. Ensemble reweighting is used to reweight an ensemble of conformations generated using an existing force field to match experimental data while minimizing the perturbation to the original ensemble.

Method development is still challenging in this application space, particularly when dealing with closely-related compounds.  Models of chromatographic selectivity are useful for predicting which columns out of the hundreds that are available are likely to have very similar, or different, selectivity for the application at hand. The hydrophobic subtraction model (HSM1) has been widely employed for this purpose; the column database for this model currently stands at 750 columns. In previous work we explored a refinement of the original HSM1 (HSM2) and found that increasing the size of the dataset used to train the model dramatically reduced the number of gross errors in predictions of selectivity made using the model. In this paper we describe further work in this direction (HSM3), this time based on a much larger dataset (43,329 total measurements) containing selectivities for compounds covering a broader range of physicochemical properties compared to HSM1. This includes multiple compounds that are actual active pharmaceutical ingredients and related synthetic intermediates and impurities, as well as multiple pairs of closely related structures (e.g., geometric and cis-/trans- isomers). The HSM3 model is based on retention measurements for 75 compounds using 13 RP stationary phases and a mobile phase of 40/60 acetonitrile/25 mM ammonium formate buffer at pH 3.2. This data-driven model produced predictions of ln(alpha) (chromatographic selectivity using ethylbenzene as the reference compound) with average absolute errors of approximately 0.033, which corresponds to errors in alpha of about 3 %. In some cases, the prediction of the trans-/cis- selectivities for positional and geometric isomers was relatively accurate, and the driving forces for the observed selectivity could be inferred by examination of the relative magnitudes of the terms in the HSM3 model. For some geometric isomer pairs the interactions mainly responsible for the observed selectivities could not be rationalized due to large uncertainties for particular terms in the model. This suggests that more work is needed in the future to explore other HSM-type models and continue expanding the training dataset in order to continue improving the predictive accuracy of these models.

The resulting conductivities of the aligned and chained samples were up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of unaligned samples prepared via regular drop-casting. The performance of the unaligned and aligned samples for resistive humidity sensing was investigated, whereby the aligned samples showed a conductivity gain of 230 times at a relative humidity of 90% versus 10%, whereas the unaligned samples showed a lower gain of 40 times at relative humidity 90% versus 10%. Further, the aligned samples could also be utilized as capacitive humidity sensors, showing a change of sensitivity at different frequencies for the aligned sample, whereas unaligned samples show a resistive behavior unsuitable for capacitive sensing.

However, the conversion from the biological domain to the computational realm requires special attention to ensure the training of accurate and precise models. In this review, we examine the critical step of encoding protein information to numeric representations for use in machine learning.

Combined representations of proteins and substrates are also introduced as emergent tools in biocatalysis. We propose the division of fixed representations, a collection of rule-based encoding strategies, and learned representations extracted from the latent spaces of large neural networks. To select the most suitable protein representation, we propose two main factors governing this choice. The first one is the model setup, being influenced by the size of the training dataset and the choice of architecture. The second factor is the model objectives, concerning the assayed property, the difference between wild-type models and mutant predictors, and requirements for explainability.

The reaction enthalpies in a micro-kinetic model often need to be adjusted when changing species\u2019 binding energies to model different catalysts, when performing thermodynamic sensitivity analyses, and when fitting experimental data. When altering reaction enthalpies, the activation energies should also be reasonably altered, to ensure realistic reaction rates. The Blowers-Masel approximation (BMA) relates the reaction barrier to the reaction enthalpy. Unlike the Br\u00f8nsted-Evans-Polani (BEP) relationship, the BMA requires less data because only one parameter, the intrinsic activation energy, needs to be determined. We validate this application of BMA relations to model surface reactions by comparing against density functional theory (DFT) data taken from literature. By incorporating the BMA rate description into the open-source Cantera software we enable a new workflow, demonstrated herein, allowing rapid screening of catalysts using linear scaling relationships (LSRs) and BMA kinetics within the process simulation software. For demonstration purposes, a catalyst screening for catalytic methane partial oxidation (CMPO) on 81 hypothetical metals is conducted. We compare the results with and without BMA-corrected rates. The heat maps of various descriptors (e.g. CH4 conversion, syngas yield) show that using BMA rates instead of Arrhenius rates (with constant activation energies) changes which metals are most active. Heat maps of sensitivity analyses can help identify which reactions or species are most influential in shaping the descriptor map patterns. Our findings indicate that while using BMA-adjusted rates didn't markedly affect the most sensitive reactions, it did change the most influential species.

However, unlike benzene ring the saturated and structurally rigid bioisosteric mimetics of heteroaromatic rings are rarely known, mainly due to the inherent challenges associated with the stability and synthesis of heteroatom-substituted C(sp3)-rich polycyclic hydrocarbons. We envisioned that the strategic and highly selective insertion of different heteroatomic units to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) could offer an ideal platform to access diverse heterobicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes. Herein, by circumventing the intrinsic challenges associated with the reaction of BCBs with heteroatomic radicals, we report a photoredox-catalyzed highly regio- and chemoselective insertion of amidyl radicals to BCBs, which provided direct access to 2-oxa-4-azabicyclo[3.1.1]hept-3-enes. Detailed experimental and computational studies have been carried out to underpin the mechanistic paradigm of this reaction. The newly synthesized heterobicyclic motifs are structurally rigid and exhibit well-defined exit vectors, the two important molecular properties in medicinal chemistry.

Analysis of the product under various buffer conditions at each stage is desirable to show that the integrity of the sample is maintained and to monitor any potential product loss. In this study we examine how varying buffer conditions during downstream processing impact the structural integrity of a biopharmaceutical product, with a specific focus on the model IgG1 antibody, mAb4, provided by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies. Flexibility, stability, aggregation propensity, and bulk properties were evaluated across the buffers of four sample points, including perfusion media, purification stages, and formulation buffer. Comparisons with Herceptin, an extensively studied IgG1 antibody, were conducted in a mass spectrometry-compatible buffer. Although mAb4 and Herceptin present with similar charge state distributions (CSD) in native mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, they exhibit distinct unfolding patterns during the activated ion mobility-mass spectrometry (aIM-MS) and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF).  The greater structural stability and aggregation onset temperature (Tagg) observed in Herceptin, are primarily attributed to the heavier glycosylation and kappa-class light chains present in Herceptin compared to the lambda-class light chains in mAb4. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) revealed that while mAb4 experiences substantial structural changes during purification, characterized by high flexibility, a low melting temperature (Tm), and prevalent repulsive protein-protein interactions, it eventually transitions to a highly compact and stable structure in buffers with higher salt concentrations and during formulation. Notably, in the formulated environment, the third constant domain (CH3) of the heavy chain retains flexibility and is identified as a region of interest for aggregation formation.

This host-guest approach is, however, still constrained to small, minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability and functionality in advanced multicomponent  molecular systems. Herein, we expand the DESC concept to steer the supramolecular assembly of surfactants at the air-water  interface.

As a case study we focused on the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient (Kp), which is an important parameter for understanding drug distribution in tissues and building the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, is a representative of small and sparse datasets. In this study, we predicted the Kp values of 119 compounds in nine tissues (adipose, brain, gut, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, and skin), while some of these were not available. To fill the missing values in Kp for each tissue, firstly we predicted those Kp values by the non-missing dataset using a random forest (RF) model with in vitro parameters (log P, fu, Drug Class, and fi) like a classical prediction by a QSAR model. Next, to predict the tissue-specific Kp values in a test dataset, we constructed a second RF model with not only in vitro parameters but also the Kp values of other tissues (i.e. other than target tissues) predicted by the first RF model as explanatory variables. Furthermore, we tested all possible combinations of explanatory variables and selected the model with the highest predictability from the test dataset as the final model. The evaluation of Kp prediction accuracy based on the root-mean-square error and R2-value revealed that the proposed models outperformed other machine learning methods, such as the conventional RF and message-passing neural networks. Significant improvements were observed in the Kp values of adipose tissue, brain, kidney, liver, and skin. These improvements indicated that the Kp information of other tissues can be used to predict the same for a specific tissue. Additionally, we found a novel relationship between each tissue by evaluating all combinations of explanatory variables. In conclusion, we developed a novel RF model to predict Kp values. We hope that this method will be applied to various problems in the field of experimental biology which often contains missing values in the near future.", "date": "2024-04-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Especially, mixed NP dispersions of differently-sized colloids are heavily affected by segregation during the assembly. Herein, the influence of the colloidal arrangement of Pt and SiO2 NPs within a single supraparticulate entity is investigated. A salt-based electrostatic manipulation approach of the utilized NPs is proposed to customize the structure of spray-dried Pt/SiO2 SPs.

Additionally, the textural properties (pore size and distribution) of the SiO2 pore framework are altered to improve the mass transfer within the material leading to increased catalytic activity. The suggested strategy demonstrates a powerful, material-independent, and universally applicable approach to deliberately customize the structure and functionality of multi-component SP systems.

Andr\u00e9s Cisneros", "abstract": "Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is an important enzyme for industrial purposes due to its ability to oxidize pollutants from wastewater. A previous report indicated that peroxidases can have up to a 20% increase in the initial enzymatic activity in an aqueous solution of 0.26 M 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ([EMIm][EtSO4]) at neutral pH. However, the atomistic details of how the solution affects peroxidase activity remain elusive. In the enzymatic landscape of HRP, an intermediate termed Compound II (Cpd II) plays a key role and involves a histidine (H42) residue that may take different protonation states. Cpd II displays structural versatility, existing as oxo-ferryl (2a) or hydroxo-ferryl (2b(FeIV)) forms, where 2a is the predominantly observed form in experimental studies. Intriguingly, the ferric 2b(FeIII) form seen in synthetic complexes, has not been observed in HRP. Here, we have investigated the structure and dynamics of HRP in pure water and aq. [EM-Im][EtSO4] (0.26 M), as well as the reaction mechanism of Cpd II catalyzed conversion of 2a to 2b using polarizable molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. When HRP is solvated in aq. [EMIm][EtSO4] a significant reduction in the fluctuation of residues 70, 71 and 74 is observed. This reduction is due to the migration of EtSO4\u2013 ions close to this region, which results in structural changes in the active site; including the displacement of the catalytic water, and orientation of H42 directly over the ferryl moiety. This configuration of the active site leads to a direct proton transfer (PT) with a significant energy reduction in the reaction barrier. Conversely, in neat water, the reaction for 2a to 2b follows the previously reported mechanism where H42+ transfers a proton to the ferryl moiety via an ordered water in the active site. We further investigated an alternative path with the deprotonated form of H42, where the mechanism shifts to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), with similar reaction barrier differences between the aqueous and aqueous/IL mixture, albeit with significantly higher relative barriers. Analysis of the electric fields at the active site indicate that the aq. [EMIm][EtSO4] medium facilitate the reaction by providing a more favorable environment compared with the system solvated in neat water. Overall, our calculations provide atomic-level insights that help explain the observed improvement in activity for peroxidases in IL solution, and underscore the importance of favorable electric fields in the active site to promote catalysis.", "date": "2024-04-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While usual solvents often need additives to avoid nanoparticles coalescence, some ionic liquids can dispense their use, being able to stabilize nanoparticles in dispersion. In order to quantify how the ionic liquids can affect both the aggregation thermodynamics and kinetics, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to simulate the evolution of concentrated dispersions and to compute the potential of mean force between nanoparticles of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature in two imidazolium-based ionic liquids, which differ from each other by the length of the cation alkyl-group. Depending on the nature of the nanoparticle, structured layers of the polar and apolar regions of the ionic liquid can be formed close to its surface and those layers lead to activation barriers for dispersed particles to get in contact. If the alkyl group of the ionic liquid is long enough to lead to domain segregation between ionic and apolar portions of the solvent, the layered structure around the particle becomes more structured and propagates to several nanometers away from its surface. The leads to stronger barriers close to the contact and also in multiple barriers at larger distances that result from the unfavorable superposition of solvent layers of opposing nature when the nanoparticles approach each other. Those long-range solvent-mediated forces not only provide kinetic stability to dispersions, but also affect their dynamics and lead to a long-range ordering between dispersed particles that can be explored as a template for the synthesis of complex materials.", "date": "2024-04-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Self-Assembly; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries feature promising high energy density and sustainability, but are hindered by a short cycle life under lean lithium and electrolyte conditions. A critical hurdle for Li-S batteries is the selection of an optimal electrolyte solution, crucial for controlling effective polysulfide electrochemical reactions. The conventional ether- based Li-S electrolyte, consisting of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3), frequently suffers from LiNO3 depletion in high-energy-density applications. To address the capacity decay in Li-S batteries caused by LiNO3 depletion, this investigation introduces 2-nitrophenol lithium (NPL) as an alternative. By incorporating 25  1 mM NPL and 1 M LiTFSI in a 1,3-dioxolane/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME) solvent, NPL mediates polysulfide oxidation during charging and prevents polysulfide corrosion, therefore improving Li retention and plating behavior. This results in Li-S batteries with NPL achieving 310 cycles, significantly surpassing the 75 cycles observed with traditional LiNO3-containing electrolytes using lean lithium anode. Pouch cells incorporating NPL exhibit stable cycling over 80 cycles, maintaining 75% of their capacity. The molecular structure of NPL prevents decomposition and facilitates interaction with polysulfides to minimize corrosion, positioning it as a strong substitute for LiNO3. This highlights NPL as a promising solution for extending the lifespan of Li-S batteries.", "date": "2024-04-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we combine information from molecular dynamics simulations, surface tensiometry, and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the behavior of arylazopyrazole (AAP) as a surfactant. This combination of the experimental techniques allows a direct relation between surface tension and surface excess rather than just bulk concentration. Specifically, we compare the case with (O-AAP) and without (H-AAP) the addition of an octyl carbon chain, as well as for two different isomers (E and Z). From the simulations of these four systems, we see that a stronger cluster formation is accompanied by a weaker reduction of the surface tension for intermediate surface excesses. In some cases, even a small but noticeable maximum in the surface tension isotherm is observed. This correlation is expected from the general properties of the Frumkin isotherm. Both the addition of the carbon chain and the consideration of the E isomer compared to the Z isomer increase this effect. Although the experimental data of the surface tension vs. surface excess do not show a maximum, the general features of the surface tension isotherm are consistent between experiment and simulation. Evidence is also provided that it is primarily the interaction of the aromatic benzene rings that determines the strength of the surfactant interactions.", "date": "2024-04-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Clusters; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here, we show how both the electrode potential and pH dependence arise from the formation of interacting oxidized sites within the bulk-active catalyst material and outline a conceptual framework for understanding the steepness of the current-potential relationship that contrasts with classical paradigms. Two prominent electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction, oxide materials based on cobalt and nickel in synergistic cooperation with varying amounts of iron, were studied by an unconventional ensemble of experiments combining electrochemistry with X-ray absorption spectroscopy during electrocatalytic operation. We find that both electrode potential and pH control the catalytic rate indirectly, first through non-Nernstian oxidation of the catalyst material, and second through the energetic interactions between oxidized sites, resulting in catalytic currents that depend exponentially on the concentration of oxidized sites. Thus, the slope of the Tafel is not determined by the specifics of the reaction mechanisms, as was often assumed in the past, but by the energetic interactions between oxidized sites. The optimization of the interaction energies between oxidized catalyst sites could be targeted in the development of future electrocatalyst materials with high energy efficiency.

In the present study, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymers were generated using a flow synthesis system and the processing variables were tuned employing Bayesian optimization (BO) to obtain a target composition. Initial trials employed BO to produce four candidate points per cycle, completing the optimization within five cycles, and the solvent-to-monomer ratio was identified as the most important variable. Subsequent BO tests employed 40 points per cycle and established that multiple sets of processing conditions could provide the desired composition, but with variations in the physical properties of the copolymers. The role of each variable in the radical polymerization reaction was elucidated by assessing the extensive array of processing conditions while evaluating several broad trends. The proposed model confirms that specific monomer proportions can be produced in a copolymer using machine learning while investigating the reaction mechanism.

Here, we employed Orthogonal Nano-Engineering (ONE) to decouple the influences of nanotopography and surface chemistry on surface antifouling. Nanotopography and surface chemistry were systematically varied with a two-step process. Controlled nanotopography was obtained by electrochemical anodization of aluminum, which generated anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) surfaces with cylindrical nanopores (diameters: 15 nm, 25 nm, 100 nm). To modify surface chemistry while preserving nanotopography, an ultrathin (~5 nm) yet stable zwitterionic coating of poly(divinylbenzene-4-vinylpyridyl sulfobetaine) was deposited on these surfaces using initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD). Antifouling performance was assessed by quantifying 48-h biomass formed by Gram positive and negative bacteria. The ONE surfaces demonstrated enhanced antifouling performance, with small-pore nanotopography and zwitterionic chemistry each lowered biomass accumulation by tested species, with potential additive effects. The most effective chemistry-topography combination (ZW-AAO15) enabled an overall reduction of 91% for Escherichia coli, 76% for Staphylococcus epidermidis, 69% for Listeria monocytogenes, and 67% for Staphylococcus aureus, relative to the uncoated nanosmooth control. Additionally, the composite ZW coating exhibited encouraging anticorrosion properties under both static and turbulent cleaning conditions, vital to antifouling applications in healthcare and food industries.

This essay summarises the most encountered chemical sulfation methods of small molecules. Sulfation reactions using sulfur trioxide amine/amide complexes are the most used method for alcoholic or phenolic groups in carbohydrates, steroids, proteins, and aliphatic or alicyclic scaffolds. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they suffer from some issues such as multiple-purification steps, toxicity issues (eg pyridine contamination), purification challenges, stoichiometric excess of reagents which leads to increase of a reaction cost, and intrinsic stability issues of both the reagent and product.

It is imperative to both minimize and quantitatively assess the systematic errors inherent in Kd determination. Traditionally, Kd values are determined through nonlinear regression of binding isotherms. This analysis utilizes three variables: concentrations of two reactants and a fraction R of unbound limiting reactant.

In this work, we introduce a new class of designer sorbent materials known as \u201ccharged-sorbents\u201d.

Unlike traditional bulk carbonates, charged-sorbent regeneration can be achieved at low temperatures (90-100 \u00baC), and the sorbent's conductive nature permits direct Joule heating regeneration2,3 using renewable electricity.

Previous experiments demonstrated their ability to distinguish differences in purine and pyrimidine bases and in the orientation of the ssDNA molecule inside the nanopore. Unfortunately, the microscopic details of ssDNA translocation over experimental time scales, which are not accessible through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), have yet to be examined. However, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations enable systems to be simulated over longer characteristic times closer to experiments than all-atom MD. This paper studies the ssDNA translocation through alpha-hemolysin nanopore exploiting steered MD using MARTINI CG force field. The impact of sequence length, orientation inside the nanopore and DNA charges on translocation dynamics as well as the conformational dynamics of ssDNA during the translocation are explored. Our results highlight the efficacy of CG molecular dynamics in capturing experimental properties of ssDNA translocation, including a wide distribution in translocation time per base. In particular, the phosphate charges of the DNA molecule are crucial in the translocation dynamics and impact the translocation rate. Additionally, the influence of the ssDNA molecule orientation on the translocation rate is explained by conformational differences of ssDNA inside the nanopore during its translocation.

In this study we report on the interfacial electrochemistry of self-assembled 2D nanosheets of graphene nanoribbons (GNR-2DNS) and analogs containing a Rh-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst (RhGNR-2DNS) immobilized on conductive electrodes. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) taking place at N-centers of the nanoribbons was utilized as an indirect reporter of the interfacial electric fields experienced by the monolayer nanosheet located within the electric   double layer. The experimental Pourbaix diagrams were compared with a theoretical model which derives the experimental Pourbaix slopes as a function of parameter f, a fraction of the interfacial potential drop experienced by the redox-active group. Interestingly, our study revealed that GNR- 2DNS was strongly coupled to glassy carbon electrodes (f = 1), while RhGNR-2DNS was not (f = 0.15). We further investigated the HER mechanism by RhGNR-2DNS using electrochemical and X-ray absorption spectroelectrochemical methods and compared it to the homogeneous molecular model compounds. RhGNR-2DNS was found to be an active HER electrocatalyst over a broader set of aqueous pH conditions than its molecular analogs. We find that the improved HER performance in the immobilized catalyst arises due to two factors. First, redox-active bipyrimidine- based ligands were shown to dramatically alter the activity of Rh sites by increasing the electron density at the active Rh center and providing RhGNR-2DNS the improved catalysis. Second, the catalyst immobilization was found to prevent catalyst aggregation that was found to occur for the molecular analog in the basic pH.

It is found that intercalated Ni and Cr atoms exhibit strong antiferromagnetic coupling with the CrI3 and NiI2 host layers, respectively.

However, viscoelastic materials resist this trend towards increased data rates due to the very material time-dependence that should be measured. Therefore, viscoelasticity measurements present a roadblock for data collection in an important aspect of material design.\n\nFor thermorheologically simple materials, time-temperature superposition (TTS) has for many years provided a method to accelerate relaxation spectrum measurements relative to, for example, very long creep experiments. However, TTS itself currently faces a speed limit originating in the common logarithmic discrete frequency sweep (DFS) mode of operation. In DFS, measurement time is proportional (by a factor much greater than one) to the lowest frequency of measurement. This state of affairs has not improved for TTS for half a century or more.\n\nWe utilize recent work in experimental rheometry on windowed chirps to collect three decades of complex modulus data simultaneously. Furthermore, the three-decade chirp response is recorded in the time it would take to collect only the lowest frequency data point of a traditional DFS experiment, resulting in a 500% speedup in data collection. In BOTTS, we superpose several isothermal chirp responses to produce a master curve in a fraction of the time of the traditional DFS-TTS technique. The chirp responses have good, albeit nontrivial, signal-to-noise properties. We use linear error propagation and a noise-weighted least squares approach to automatically incorporate all the data in a reliable shifting method. Using model thermoset polymers, we show DFS-TTS and BOTTS results are comparable, and therefore BOTTS data represent a first step towards a fast, reproducible method for master curve generation from existing rheological measurement instruments.", "date": "2024-04-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Due to their complex chemical and physical properties, method development for the separation of vaccine adjuvants is considered a highly challenging and laborious task. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is among the most important tests in the (bio)pharmaceutical industry for release and stability indicating measurements including adjuvant content, identity, and purity profile. However, the time constraints of developing \u201con-demand\u201d robust quantitative methods prior to each change in formulation can easily lead to sample analysis becoming a bottleneck in vaccine development. Herein a simple and efficient generic analytical framework capable of chromatographically resolving the most commonly used non-aluminum based adjuvants across academic and industrial sectors is introduced. This was designed to seek a more proactive approach for fast-paced assay development endeavors that evolved from extensive stationary phase screening in conjunction with multifactorial in silico simulations of adjuvant retention time (RT) as a function of gradient time, temperature, organic modifier blending, and buffer concentration. The multifactorial retention models yield 3D resolution maps with excellent baseline separation of all adjuvants in a single run, which was found to be very accurate, with differences between experimental and simulated retention times of less than 1%. The analytical framework described here also includes the introduction of a more versatile approach to method development by introducing a dynamic RT database for adjuvants covering the entire library of adjuvants with broad mechanisms of action across numerous vaccine formulations with excellent linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity.

Of these, we identify peaks in off-atom electron density by density functional theory and discuss the validity with which the design rules can be applied to these likely electrides.

Herein, we report the three-dimensional single-atom ligation of four different fragments (alcohols) at one silicon center using triphenylchlorosilane as the ligation hub in an iterative, controllable, and programmable fashion. To fulfill the mission, we established a new silicon-phenyl exchange reaction with alcohols. A broad spectrum of alcohols could be ligated using various types of phenylchlorosilanes as ligation hubs, affording a library of mixed-dialkoxysilanes, trialkoxysilanes, and tetraalkoxysilanes. Notably, fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes were barely known in literature and extremely difficult to access in a selective fashion from a retrosynthetic viewpoint. Our protocol thus provided a robust solution to materials of such nature. To highlight the application potential, four different biologically relevant alcohols, representing four different functions, were successfully ligated to one Si(IV) center as fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilane.

The study considered fully developed laminar power-law fluid flow regimes without considering any losses in the network system. A key observation was the sensitivity of the dimensionless effective flow conductance to the network's geometrical parameters.

In one proposed catalytic cycle, each arene adds to a palladium carboxylate catalyst according to a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism, followed by reductive elimination to couple the arenes and the replenishment of the catalyst by an oxidant. Using this proposed mechanism, molecular structures and free energy profiles were calculated for coupling of benzene with a range of heteroarenes containing various substituents and with several Pd-carboxylate catalysts. Reaction kinetics were analysed using the energetic span model, predicting TOFs of heterocoupling (HB & BH) and homocoupling (HH & BB) pathway and assessing degrees of turnover frequency control (XTOFs). More electron-withdrawing carboxylate ligands and more electron-donating heteroarene substituents decrease activation and reaction free energies of addition steps, with C-2 more favourable than C-3. When heteroarene and catalyst choice are particularly favourable, the first association can become exergonic, causing a significant change in catalytic kinetics. When not exergonic, free energy for addition of benzene is almost always higher, leading to large energetic spans and slower TOFs (BB < HB < BH < HH). Non-exergonic pathways are also faster with more electron-withdrawing ligands and more electron-donating heteroarene substituents because of a lower energy addition steps and smaller energetic span. For exergonic associations, the low energy arene-catalyst intermediate creates a larger energetic span, slowing down the HH and HB pathways. More electron-withdrawing ligands and more electron-donating substituents increase the relative TOF for BH and the reaction requires only small excesses of benzene to induce heterocoupling.", "date": "2024-04-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The expanding wastewater sector plays a pivotal and growing role in managing wastewater globally. Furthermore, technology in use at wastewater treatment plants is evolving to recover nutrients, which increases energy consumption.  This technology, however, may reduce demand to produce nutrients from virgin sources.  To capture these trends in the wastewater sector and its interlinkages with the fertilizer and agricultural sectors, it is essential for integrated assessment and computable general equilibrium models that address the energy-water nexus to evolve. We estimate how much energy consumption (1,100 million GJ) and greenhouse gas emissions (84 million t CO2e) may increase globally until 2030.  We also estimate that the share of national fertilizer demand that could be recovered from wastewater could be nearly 100% for some African nations, but is much lower for large, agriculturally dominant nations like China and the United States.

Four models explicitly included representations of energy demand for wastewater treatment, and eight models included explicit representation of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by wastewater treatment.

Using a combination of pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we have probed the self-diffusion of acetonitrile in the 1.7 nm diameter pore channels of two imine-linked COFs (PI-3-COF) featuring different levels of crystallinity and porosity, between 270 K and 300 K.

Self-diffusion in the pores vs. bulk liquid is thus reduced by a factor of 7.4, in good agreement with MD simulations which predict a reduction of the self-diffusion coefficient by a factor of 5.4 compared to the bulk liquid value, assuming an offset-stacked COF layer arrangement.

The predictions of these models diverge in significant ways. Interaction free energies calculated using the SSIP approach are typically small and vary little, but in contrast, Lifshitz theory yields works of adhesion that span a broad range. Moreover, the SSIP model also yields significantly different \u2206\u2206G values in some liquids for which, in contrast, Lifshitz theory predicts similar values of W. These divergent predictions were tested using atomic force microscopy. The experimentally determined work of adhesion was found to be closer to the value predicted using the SSIP model than to W(Lifshitz). Still greater differences were found in the interaction energies calculated using the two models when liquid mixtures were considered. For mixtures of methanol and benzyl alcohol, \u2206\u2206G declines smoothly as the benzyl alcohol concentration increases, but W(Lifshitz) decreases to a minimum and then increases, reaching a larger value for benzyl alcohol than for methanol. The experimental adhesion data were correlated closely with the predictions of the SSIP model.

The organization of Chl is controlled by adjusting the brush grafting density and polymerization time. For dense brushes, the C, N, S elemental composition remains constant throughout the 36 nm brush layer until the underlying gold substrate is approached. However, for either reduced density brushes (mean thickness 20 nm) or mushrooms grown with reduced grafting densities (mean thickness 6-9 nm), elemental intensities decrease continuously throughout the brush layer, because photoelectrons are less strongly attenuated for such systems. For all brushes, the fraction of positively charged nitrogen atoms (N+/N0) decreases with increasing depth. Chl binding causes a marked reduction in N+/N0 within the brushes and yields a new feature at 398.1 eV in the N1s spectrum assigned to tetrapyrrole ring nitrogen atoms coordinated to Zn2+. For all grafting densities, the N/S ratio remains approximately constant as a function of brush depth, which indicates a uniform distribution of Chl throughout the brush layer. However, a larger fraction of repeat units bound to Chl is observed at lower grafting densities, reflecting a progressive reduction in steric congestion that enables more uniform distribution of the bulky Chl units throughout the brush layer.

A widely employed strategy to increase the gravimetric activity of the catalyst is to increase the active surface area via nanostructuring or decreasing the particle size. However, fundamental understanding about how tuning these parameters influences the density of oxidized species and their reaction kinetics remains unclear. Here, we use solution combustion synthesis, a low-cost and scalable approach, to synthesize a series of Fe0.1Ni0.9O samples from different precursor salts. Based on the precursor salt, the nanoparticle size can be changed significantly from ~2.5 nm to ~37 nm. The OER activity in pH 13 trends inversely with the particle size. Using operando, time-resolved optical spectroscopy, we quantify the density of oxidized species as a function of potential and demonstrate that the OER kinetics exhibits a second order dependence on the density of these species, suggesting that the OER mechanism relies on O-O coupling between neighbouring oxidized species. With decreasing particle size, the density of species accumulated is found to increase, with a decrease in their intrinsic reactivity for OER, attributed to a stronger binding of *O species (i.e. a cathodic shift of species energetics). This signifies that the high apparent OER activity per geometric area of the smaller nanoparticles is driven by their ability to accumulate a larger density of oxidized species. This study not only experimentally disentangles the influence of the density of oxidized species and intrinsic kinetics on the overall rate of OER, but also highlights the importance of tuning these parameters independently to develop more active OER catalysts.", "date": "2024-04-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

HIV-1 is more prevalent worldwide, while HIV-2 is less pathogenic and found predominantly in Africa. Although not fully understood, the key differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses, lie in the mechanism of retroviral pathogenesis. HIV-1 is comprised of a protein called the envelope protein, which is required for entry of the virus into the host cell. In our work, we have used computational strategies like molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to predict inhibitors that can bind to the envelope protein, thus inhibiting viral entry into the host cell. Based on our studies, we have proposed five chemical compounds that bind strongly to the viral envelope protein. These chemical compounds bind specifically to the Phe43 cavity on the envelope protein. The Phe43 cavity is a promising target for drug therapy. We have also introduced virtual reality (VR) technology to visualize and modify the protein-ligand complexes. Our current work will not only help in developing novel therapeutics against HIV, but also pave way for many potential new treatments, thus helping combat the global burden of this disease.", "date": "2024-04-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To address the high computational demand of this methodology, we propose a novel transfer learning approach for generating MLPs. First, the models are pre-trained on a large set of classical data (ReaxFF) and then re-trained with Density Functional Theory (DFT) data. We demonstrate that the transfer learning enhanced potentials exhibit higher accuracy, require less training data, and are more transferable than those trained exclusively on DFT data. The generated machine learning potential enables a fast, exhaustive, and reliable exploration of the dicalcium silicate polymorphs.

The organization of Chl is controlled by adjusting the brush grafting density and polymerization time. For dense brushes, the C, N, S elemental composition remains constant throughout the 36 nm brush layer until the underlying gold substrate is approached. However, for either reduced density brushes (mean thickness 20 nm) or mushrooms grown with reduced grafting densities (mean thickness 6-9 nm), elemental intensities decrease continuously throughout the brush layer, because photoelectrons are less strongly attenuated for such systems. For all brushes, the fraction of positively charged nitrogen atoms (N+/N0) decreases with increasing depth. Chl binding causes a marked reduction in N+/N0 within the brushes and produces a new feature at 398.1 eV in the N1s core-line spectrum assigned to tetrapyrrole ring nitrogen atoms coordinated to Zn2+. For all grafting densities, the N/S atomic ratio remains approximately constant as a function of brush depth, which indicates a uniform distribution of Chl throughout the brush layer. However, a larger fraction of repeat units bound to Chl is observed at lower grafting densities, reflecting a progressive reduction in steric congestion that enables more uniform distribution of the bulky Chl units throughout the brush layer.

However, it is difficult to realize such structures as bulk assemblies, since molecules generally tend to assemble into a closest packing structure to maximize intermolecular forces. To tackle this question, we examined an approach using a supramolecular scaffold composed of a tripodal triptycene, which has been demonstrated to strongly promote the assembly of various molecular and polymer units into regular \u201c2D hexagonal packing + 1D layer\u201d structures.

Due to decreased crop yields that lead to higher simulated feedstock prices and lower biorefinery capacities, current oilcane prototypes result in higher costs and carbon intensities than microbial oil from sugarcane. To inform oilcane feedstock development, we calculated the required biomass yields (as a function of oil content) for oilcane to achieve financial parity with sugarcane. At 10 dw % oil, oilcane can sustain up to 30% less yield than sugarcane and still be more profitable in all simulated scenarios.

The charge density for finite external dielectric constant can then be approximated using a simple perturbation approach.

The carboxy-2H-azirine moiety, including those appended to well-characterized chemical scaffolds, is understudied, which creates a challenge for understanding potential modes of inhibition. In particular, some known natural product carboxy-2H-azirines have long hydrophobic tails, which might lead to amphipathicity and implicate them in membrane associated processes. Metadynamics is an effective method for calculating the free energy changes associated with membrane embedding processes. In this study, we examined a small set of carboxy-2H-azirine natural products, including analogs with long alkyl chains, geometric isomers, and one comprising the simple carboxy-2H-azirine core. We compared the physiochemical properties of these compounds to those of established membrane embedders with similar chemical scaffolds. This was intended to isolate the physiochemical properties of the carboxy-2H-azirine group and understand molecular influences of this moiety on membrane partitioning. To accomplish this, we developed a force field for the 2H-azirine functional group and performed metadynamics simulations of the partitioning into a model membrane (75 % POPE, 25 % POPG) from aqueous solution. We determine that the carboxy-2H-azirine functional group is likely hydrophilic, imbuing the long chain analogs with amphipathicity similar to the known membrane binding molecules to which they were compared.

We analyzed 12 moldable plastics advertised for modeling and dental applications and determined them to be polycaprolactone (PCL) or thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The bioactivities of the most popular brands advertised for modeling applications of each type of polymer were evaluated using a zebrafish embryo bioassay. Both products were sold as microplastic-sized resin pellets. While water-borne exposure to the TPU pellets did not affect the targeted developmental endpoints at any concentration tested, the PCL pellets were acutely toxic above 1 pellet/mL. Aqueous leachates of the PCL pellets demonstrated similar toxicity. Methanolic extracts from the PCL pellets were assayed for their bioactivity using the Attagene FACTORIAL platform.

By non-targeted high-resolution comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC\u00d7GC-HRT), we tentatively identified several compounds in the methanolic extracts, including PCL oligomers, a phenolic antioxidant, and residues of suspected anti-hydrolysis and crosslinking additives. In a follow-up zebrafish embryo bioassay, because of its stated high purity, biomedical grade PCL was tested to mitigate any confounding effects due to chemical additives in the PCL pellets; it elicited comparable acute toxicity.

This study delves into the rapid conversion of residual plant biomass into organic fertilizer, presenting an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution. The effects of this novel fertilizer on maize growth, development, and yield were meticulously compared to traditional NPK 20:10:5 fertilizers and rabbit manure. Three unique organic fertilizers were synthesized from a blend of eleven types of residual dry plant biomass, incorporating calcium hydroxide, clay soil, and thiourea for optimized maize application. The most promising formulation demonstrated significant nutrient content, including Total nitrogen (2.18%), Total phosphorus (1.80%), Total potassium (3.77%), and Total Carbon (37.40%), with a pH of 5. Impressively, maize plants treated with this synthesized fertilizer reached a maximum height of 171.45 cm, outperforming both NPK fertilizer (134.0 cm) and rabbit manure (121.92 cm). Moreover, maize yield was significantly enhanced with the synthesized fertilizer, particularly with fertilizer C boasting a weight of 287.38 g. Notably, this fertilizer exhibited both rapid and slow nutrient release dynamics, with 11% thiourea incorporation yielding superior results.

To address this issue, synchronous measurement of neutron imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is carried out at various water contents for the first time to the best of our knowledge.

In this study, the effect of calcination on Al coordination was assessed in a low-Fe clay used as a reference system, and a Fe-rich clay. Al coordination in the low-Fe clay was quantified via 27Al MAS NMR spectra deconvolution, using data collected at 9.4 T and 11.7 T.

Conversely, the Fe-rich clay contained a lower proportion of 4/5-fold Al in meta-kaolinite after calcination, relative to the low-Fe clay.

PPII is stabilized in part by n->pi* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron-donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron-acceptor carbonyl (pi*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n->pi* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X\u2013PPGY-NH2 peptides (X = 10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron-rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac-) group, with the pivaloyl and iso-butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X\u2013APPGY-NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non-proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII. The effects of acyl capping groups were further analyzed in X\u2013DfpPGY-NH2 and X\u2013ADfpPGY-NH2 peptides, Dfp = 4,4-difluoroproline.

We theoretically demonstrate that hybridizing many molecular excitons in a cavity protects the overall quantum coherence of phonon-induced decoherence originating from the collective light-matter couplings. The polariton co- coherence time can be prolonged up to 100 fs with a realistic Rabi splitting and quality factor at room temperature, compared to the typical electronic coherence time which is around 15 fs. Our numerically exact simulations and analytic theory suggest that the dominant decoherence mechanism is the population transfer from the upper polariton state to the dark state manifold. Increasing the collective coupling strength will increase the energy gap between these two sets of states, and thus prolong the coherence lifetime.

Here, we characterized self-assembled nanoparticles of cellulose and lignin and of two newly identified ice-nucleating biopolymers, namely xylan and laminarin.

Key residues for electrostatic interactions were identified via bond distance analysis and frustration analysis method. An end-point free energy calculation method determines the stability of the 5-HT$_{1B}$R due to serotonin binding. The single-point mutation of the polar/charged amino acid residues (Asp129, Thr134) on the binding sites and the calculation of binding free energy validates the quantitative contribution of these residues in the stability of the serotonin-receptor complex.

The archetype of the reactive RTILs is n-octylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (OA-TFSI), which has promising functions as an additive for the hole transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PCSs); the high reactivity of the OA cations on the perovskite surface allows effective spontaneous perovskite passivation via HTM deposition, significantly improving the PV performance of the PSC. However, although the reactivity manipulation of the reactive RTILs is instrumental for exploiting their potential functions and exploring their application scope, methods for reactivity control have not been developed. In this study, we propose and demonstrate that the co-addition of a pyridine moiety can effectively manipulate the reactivity of OA-TFSI by controlling the protonation between OA and the 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) HTM. The pyridine prevented OA deprotonation presumably via stabilization of the OA cation, thus retaining its ammonium form, which allowed effective spontaneous perovskite passivation. Although the proton being with OA owing to pyridine addition is disadvantageous for Spiro-OMeTAD radical formation via its protonation, which is crucial when conventional RTILs are used, a supportive function of the spontaneous perovskite passivation (i.e., the absence of cationic species in the HTM core) likely facilitated Spiro-OMeTAD radical formation, mitigating the requirement of Spiro-OMeTAD protonation. Therefore, overall, optimal pyridine addition significantly enhanced the PV performance, revealing the preference of protonation in the OA-TFSI system used in this study, which is opposite to that in conventional RTILs and represents the specificity of the reactive RTILs. This study provides valuable guidance for developing spontaneous perovskite passivation techniques, which can lead to further advancement of PCSs.

Computational methods have played a crucial role in understanding and predicting energy transfer catalysis, bypassing the need for complex and laborious photophysical measurements. Specifically, adiabatic triplet energies have been used as a predictive tool in the design of substrates amenable to sensitization, as well as a mechanistic tool. However, this approach fails to accurately predict the likelihood of triplet energy to molecules that undergo large structural changes upon excitation, and provides qualitatively incorrect predictions of E/Z-isomerism under energy transfer catalysis.

The material undergoes a structural transition from an \u201copen pore\u201d phase to a contracted \u201cclosed pore\u201d phase upon gas adsorption, leading to macroscopic gas desorption visible to the naked eye. It was initially evidenced experimentally in 2016 for the adsorption of methane and n-butane in the DUT-49 metal\u2013organic framework (DUT = Dresden University of Technology), and later demonstrated to be a general phenomenon, occurring for different gases and in a variety of materials with the same topology. NGA materials belong to the category of metamaterials, displaying behavior that is not found (or rarely observed) in \u201cnatural\u201d or simple materials. The negative adsorption transition takes place outside of thermodynamic equilibrium, and its characterization requires the use of many complementary experimental techniques (adsorption measurements, in situ X-ray diffraction, EXAFS, NMR, etc.), as well as molecular simulation techniques. In order to obtain a full and consistent picture of the NGA phenomenon, it is indeed necessary to combine computational modelling with a variety of methods, at different scales, in order to understand the microscopic behavior of the host framework and guest molecules to the macroscopic experimental results. At the smallest scale, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to understand the energetics and structure of the NGA materials, as well as the micromechanical properties of their organic linkers: the buckling of these linkers explains the large metastability of the open-pore phase, and gives rise to the NGA transition. At a larger scale, classical grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations in the \u201crigid host\u201d structures can predict the adsorption capacity of different phases, elucidating the driving force behind the structural transition. To explicitly couple the flexibility of the framework and the adsorption of guest molecules, molecular dynamics simulations (relying on a classical force field for the flexible MOF) can be coupled with free energy methods to investigate the thermodynamics of NGA, obtaining free energy profiles that determine the relative stability of different phases with varying amounts of adsorbed gas. Finally, mesoscopic-scale modeling methods are required in order to understand the phenomenon at a scale larger than one unit cell, and explain experimental findings about the influence of crystal size effects on the NGA transition.

The commercial form of gentamicin is a mixture of five compounds with minor differences in the methylation of one of their aminosugars. In the case of two compounds, gentamicin C2 and C2a, the only difference is the stereochemistry of the methyl group attached to C-6\u2019. GenB2 is the enzyme responsible for this epimerization and it is one of the four PLP-dependent enzymes encoded by the gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Herein, we have determined the structure of GenB2 in its holo form in complex with PMP and also in the ternary complex with gentamicin X2 and G418, two substrate analogs. Based on the structural analysis, we were able to identify the structural basis for the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, which was also studied by site-directed mutagenesis.

Despite extensive endeavors from experiments and computations, how non-heme iron halogenases dictate the reaction toward the thermodynamically unfavored halogenation is still elusive. Here, we have investigated the chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity in both halogenase BesD and hydroxylase-evolved halogenase Chi-14, using extensive MD simulations and QM/MM calculations. In BesD, our calculations have shown that 2OG-assisted O2 activation affords the axial Fe(IV)-oxo species that is responsible for the substrate C-H activation. To facilitate the following Cl-rebound reaction, the nascent axial Fe(III)-OH species has to undergo the conformational isomerization to the equatorial one. This can remove the steric effects between the axial Fe(III)-OH and the substrate radical, thereby facilitating the migration of substrate radical toward Cl-ligand during the Cl-rebound. Notably, the second-sphere residue Asn (Asn219 in BesD or Asn225 in Chi-14) can form persistent hydrogen bond interactions with succinate, which is vital to maintain the unsaturated five-coordination shell of Fe, thereby facilitating the conformational flip of Fe(III)-OH from the axial orientation to the equatorial one.

Initially, complex 1 extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)-O-Fe(III) complex 2 as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex 2 and 9,10-dihydroanthracene. Further, an oxidative homocoupling reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions, achieving the complete biphasic activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high-valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.", "date": "2024-04-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A major challenge in building better ADMET models is the experimental error inherent in the data. Furthermore, ADMET predictors are typically regression tasks due to the continuous nature of the data. This makes it difficult to apply existing methods as most focus on classification tasks. Here, we develop denoising schemes based on deep learning to address this. We find that the training error can be used to identify the noise in regression tasks while ensemble-based and forgotten event-based metrics fail to detect the noise. The most significant performance increase occurs when the original model is finetuned with the denoised data using training error as the noise detection metric. Our method has the ability to improve models with medium noise and does not degrade the performance of models with noise outside this range. To our knowledge, our denoising scheme is the first to improve model performance for ADMET data and has implications for improving models for experimental assay data in general.

We study the use-case of spin-alignment echo (SAE) NMR for exploring Li-ion diffusion within the solid state electrolyte material Li3PS4 (LPS) by calculating quadrupolar frequencies of 7Li. SAE NMR probes long-range dynamics down to microsecond-timescale hopping processes. Therefore only a few machine learning force field schemes are able to capture the time and length scales required for accurate comparison with experimental results. By using a new class of machine learning interatomic potentials, known as ultra-fast potentials (UFPs), we are able to efficiently access timescales beyond the microsecond regime. In tandem, we have developed a machine learning model for predicting the full 7Li electric field gradient (EFG) tensors in LPS. By combining the long timescale trajectories from the UFP with our model for 7Li EFG tensors, we are able to extract the autocorrelation function (ACF) for 7Li quadrupolar frequencies during Li diffusion. We extract the decay constants from the ACF for both crystalline \u03b2-LPS and amorphous LPS, and find that the predicted Li hopping rates are on the same order of magnitude as those predicted from the Li dynamics.

The principal function of AfKDNAse is still unclear, but a study suggest a critical role in fungal cell wall morphology and virulence. Potent AfKDNAse inhibitors are required to better probe the enzyme\u2019s biological role and as potential antivirulence factors. In this work, we developed a set of AfKDNAse inhibitors based on enzymatically stable thio-KDN motifs. C2, C9-linked heterodi-KDN were designed to fit into unusually close KDN sugar binding pockets in the protein. A polymeric compound with an average of 54 KDN motifs was also designed by click chemistry. Inhibitory assays performed on recombinant AfKDNAse showed a moderate and strong enzymatic inhibition for the two classes of compounds, respectively.

Central to this approach is the use of competitive ABPP, which utilizes an activity-based probe (ABP) to directly observe and characterize the interactions between inhibitors and an enzyme. In this study, we use an in-house fluorophosphonate (FP)-based probe, as an example of an electrophilic probe, and pig liver esterase (PLE), as a model enzyme.

Usually, partitioning is studied under equilibrium multiphase conditions. However, there are situations where a mixture may form only a single phase at equilibrium but can exist in multiple phases when out-of-equilibrium. Emulsion droplets, such as oil-in-water droplets stabilized by surfactant, are one such example. Droplets are often thermodynamically unstable and persist under non-equilibrium conditions for some time while disappearing by dissolution or solubilization over longer timescales. Consequently, equilibrium properties like partition coefficients or interfacial tensions may not necessarily describe the properties of an out-of-equilibrium droplet. Here, the partitioning of nonionic surfactants between microscale oil droplets and water is investigated under non-equilibrium conditions wherein the droplets shrink in volume over time via solubilization and only a single phase exists at equilibrium. Quantitative mass spectrometry is used to analyze the composition of individual micro-droplets as a function of time under conditions of varying surfactant composition, concentration, and oil molecular structure. Common nonionic surfactants partition into oil micro-droplets within minutes and reach a non-equilibrium steady state concentration that can be orders of magnitude higher than the aqueous phase. Over timescales of hours, the droplet solubilizes and sheds accumulated surfactant back into the water. Transiently high concentrations of oil and surfactant accumulate near the oil droplet - water interface over time, which leads to the localized evolution of a microemulsion phase and unexpectedly low interfacial tension. The introduction of an ionic surfactant that forms mixed micelles with the nonionic surfactant reduces the nonionic surfactant transfer into oil. Based on this observation, we use stimuli-responsive ionic surfactants to trigger phase separation and mixing inside binary oil droplets via modulation of the nonionic surfactant partitioning. This study thus reveals generalizable non-equilibrium states and conditions experienced by solubilizing droplets that govern emulsion properties.

We took inspiration from the HD-Zip, a transcription factor family only found in plants. No high-resolution structures exist for HD-Zip: genome-wide analyses indicate that they use a homeodomain to bind DNA and leucine zipper for dimerization. HinZip is a fusion of the Hin recombinase DNA-binding domain and FosW leucine zipper. HinZip binds cooperatively as a dimer to DNA targets comprising two 12 base-pair hixC half-sites. Using bacterial one-hybrid and quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we tested spacings of 0-9 base pairs between half-sites to optimize the orientation and space parameters that FosW needs for coiled-coil dimerization. HinZip binds cooperatively to a 29 base-pair inverted hixC palindrome with Kd 17 nM and no binding to nonspecific DNA up to 2 \u00b5M protein. Hin\u2014which lacks ability to dimerize\u2014was previously shown to bind hixC with Kd 34 nM, showing similar binding to half- or full-sites and no cooperativity. HinZip/LA, where the Leu residues responsible for dimerization were replaced with Ala, showed virtually no benefit from cooperative binding at any full-site, and bound first as a monomer, and then as two monomers. Circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering indicate that only HinZip is capable of forming a coiled-coil dimer. HinZip demonstrates that even in the absence of guidance from structural information, small frankenproteins designed from cut-and-paste of unrelated protein modules can specifically target long DNA sequences with broad applications toward orthogonally controlling gene networks in a wide variety of organisms.

Investigations into the specific role of these metal ions, sometimes referred to as \"danglers,\" have been hindered by a paucity of rational synthetic routes to appropriate model structures. To generate pendent metal ions bonded to an oxo cubane through a carboxylate bridge, the cubane Co4(\u03bc3-O)4(OAc)4(t-Bupy)4 (OAc = acetate, t-Bupy = 4-tert-butylpyridine) was exposed to various metal acetate complexes.

In contrast, the anal-ogous reaction with Mn(OAc)2 produced the MnIV-containing cubane cation [MnCo3(\u03bc3-O)4(OAc)4(t-Bupy)4]+ by way of a metal-metal exchange that gives Co(OAc)2 and [CoIII(\u03bc-OH)(OAc)]n oligomers as byproducts.

However, one significant challenge in MOF development is their overwhelmingly large design space, which is intractable to fully explore even computationally. To find diverse optimal MOF designs without exploring the full design space, we develop Vendi Bayesian optimization (VBO), a new algorithm that combines traditional Bayesian optimization with the Vendi Score, a recently introduced interpretable diversity measure. Both Bayesian optimization and the Vendi Score require a kernel similarity function, we therefore also introduce a novel similarity function in the space of MOFs that accounts for both chemical and structural features. This new similarity metric enables VBO to find optimal MOFs with properties that may depend on both chemistry and structure. We statistically assessed VBO by its ability to optimize three NH3-adsorption dependent performance metrics that depend, to different degrees, on MOF chemistry and structure. With ten simulated campaigns done for each metric, VBO consistently outperformed random search to find high-performing designs within a 1,000-MOF subset for i) NH3 storage, ii) NH3 removal from membrane plasma reactors, and iii) NH3 capture from air. Then, with one campaign dedicated to finding optimal MOFs for NH3 storage in a \u201chybrid\u201d ~10,000-MOF database, we identify twelve extant and eight hypothesized MOF designs with potentially record-breaking working capacity \u2206NNH3 between 300 K and 400 K at 1 bar. Specifically, the best MOF designs are predicted to i) achieve \u2206NNH3 values between 23.6 and 29.3 mmol/gm, potentially surpassing those that MOFs previously experimentally tested for NH3 adsorption would have at the proposed operation conditions, ii) be thermally stable at the operation conditions and iii) require only ca. 10% of the energy content in NH3 to release the stored molecule from the MOF. Finally, the analysis of the generated simulation data during the search indicates that a pore size of around 10 \u00c5, a heat of adsorption around 33 kJ/mol, and the presence of Ca could be part of MOF design rules that could help optimize NH3 working capacity at the proposed operation conditions", "date": "2024-04-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

SARS-CoV-2 manipulates both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN for enhanced infection, leading to interest in developing receptor antagonists. Despite their structural similarity (82% sequence identity), they function differently. DC-SIGN, found in dendritic cells, shapes the immune response by recognizing pathogen-associated carbohydrate patterns. In contrast, L-SIGN, expressed in airway epithelial endothelial cells, is not directly involved in immunity. COVID-19\u2019s primary threat is the hyperactivation of the immune system, potentially reinforced if DC-SIGN engages with exogenous ligands. Therefore, L-SIGN, co-localized with ACE2-expressing cells in the respiratory tract, is a more suitable target for anti-adhesion therapy. However, designing a selective ligand for L-SIGN is challenging due to the high sequence identity of the Carbohydrate Recognition Domains (CRDs) of the two lectins. We here present Man84, a mannose ring modified with a methylene guanidine triazole at position 2. It binds L-SIGN with a KD of 12.7 \u03bcM \u00b1 1 \u03bcM (ITC) and is the first known L-SIGN selective ligand, showing 50-fold selectivity over DC-SIGN (SPR). The X-ray structure of the L-SIGN CRD/Man84 complex reveals the guanidinium group\u2019s role in achieving steric and electrostatic complementarity with L-SIGN. This allows us to trace the source of selectivity to a single amino acid difference between the two CRDs. NMR analysis confirms the binding mode in solution, highlighting Man84\u2019s conformational selection upon complex formation. Dimeric versions of Man84 achieve additional selectivity and avidity in the low nanomolar range. These compounds selectively inhibit L-SIGN dependent trans-infection by SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus.

In this study, we introduce an electrode modification strategy for DNA detection that uses block copolymer-directed nanoporous thin films for nanopore blockage (NB)-based electrochemical biosensors. This approach enables rapid, label-free DNA detection and quantification at femtomolar levels. Deploying a bottom-up fabrication process that leverages on the self-assembly of high molecular weight block copolymers with inorganic sol-gel precursors, we create a highly scalable nanoporous thin film architecture with tailored pore size and arrangement. Crucially, we eliminate the need for complex fabrication including stacking brittle porous membranes, a constraint in existing NB-based DNA sensors. The rapid performance of this sensor is demonstrated by detecting specific single-stranded DNA sequences derived from the 16S rRNA gene fragment of the E. coli genome within 20 minutes, achieving a limit of detection of 30 fM and a limit of quantification of 500 fM. The development of this DNA biosensor represents a significant advancement towards a portable, user-friendly, rapid, cost-effective, and highly accurate DNA detection platform, promising to overcome current limitations of conventional detection methods and broadening the applicability of DNA diagnostics across diverse use cases.", "date": "2024-04-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Electrochemical Analysis; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Detailed structural analyses reveal the presence of three distinct atomic-scale defects, that is pores, concave surfaces, and surface-anchored individual WOx and MoOx sites. The presence of this combination of defects results in excellent catalytic ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE and a mass activity of 1.3 A\u00b7mgPd-1 at 0.9 V vs. RHE, outperforming the commercial references Pt/C and Pd/C by factors of 6.5 and 3.9, respectively.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand at which potentials such reactions start, and which chemical species are present in the subsequently formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a new operando experimental approach is introduced to investigate such reactions by employing hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). This approach enables the examination of the SEI formed below a thin metal film (e.g., 6 nm nickel) acting as the working electrode. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated using a sulfide-based Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte (lithium argyrodite). It is shown that electrolyte reduction reactions start upon polarization of the working electrode to voltages below 1.75 V (vs. Li+/Li) and result in considerable Li2S formation, particularly in the voltage range of 1.5 \u2013 1.0 V. The overall intensity trends confirm the heterogeneous/layered microstructure of the SEI (e.g., preferential Li2O and Li2S deposition near the current collector). The reversibility of side reactions is also observed, as Li2O and Li2S decompose in the 2\u20134 V potential window, generating oxidized sulfur species, sulfites and sulfates.

Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy.

Owing to its signal-stress duality, cells have evolved multiple clearance mechanisms to maintain FA homeostasis, acting to avoid the established genotoxicity of FA while also redirecting FA-derived carbon units into the biosynthesis of essential nucleobases and amino acids. The highly compartmentalized nature of FA exposure, production, and regulation motivates the development of chemical tools that enable monitoring of transient FA fluxes with subcellular resolution. Here we report a mitochondrial-targeted, activity-based sensing probe for ratiometric FA detection, MitoRFAP-2, and apply this reagent to monitor endogenous mitochondrial sources and sinks of this 1C unit. We establish the utility of subcellular localization by showing that MitoRFAP-2 is sensitive enough to detect changes in mitochondrial FA pools with genetic and pharmacological modulation of enzymes involved in 1C and amino acid metabolism, including the pervasive, less active genetic mutant aldehyde dehydrogenase 2*2 (ALDH2*2), where previous, non-targeted versions of FA sensors are not. Finally, we used MitoRFAP-2 to comparatively profile basal levels of FA across a panel of breast cancer cell lines, finding that FA-dependent fluorescence correlates with expression levels of enzymes involved in 1C metabolism.

In contrast to previous investigations, the present experiments characterize the full course of a catalytic chemical reaction, addressing key questions about if and where reaction species build up, and correlating these microscale behaviors with bench-scale product yields. At low concentrations of (active) catalyst, droplet environments are stable; however, at higher concentrations, emulsion droplet environments change markedly, as indi-cated by the rise and fall of fluorescence lifetimes. These changes are consistent with buildup and consumption of reaction species inside the droplets. A combination of FLIM and brightfield imaging pinpoint limitations in catalyst solubility as controlling the rate and degree of buildup of species in droplets. These solubility limitations are also identified as the cause of a reaction induction period, and an origin of the rate-and-reproducibility advantage obtained by adding a THF as a cosolvent. The subsequent mechanistic model from these data led to a bench-scale reaction optimization, wherein premixing the catalyst components bypasses the catalyst induction period, resulting in a faster reaction at otherwise constant catalyst load-ing. The understanding generated by FLIM thus provides an early example of how understanding changes in droplet compo-sitions on the microscale during ongoing aqueous\u2013organic reactions can be leveraged for enhancing efficiencies in bench-scale reactions.

Methylthio-D-ribose-1-phosphate (MTR1P) isomerase (MtnA), which functions in the methionine-salvage pathway, poses a challenge to this canon because its substrate cannot readily access such a form. In converting MTR1P to its ketose isomer, methylthio-D-ribulose 1-phosphate, MtnA must catalyze opening of the ribofuranose ring and hydrogen transfer between C-2 and C-1. Primary 2H and 13C kinetic isotope effects measured at these positions in MTR1P and ribose 1-phosphate indicate that these two events occur in a common and rate-limiting step with respect to kcat/KM. An inverse kinetic solvent viscosity effect and inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect were measured for this constant, implicating an open\u2013closed protein conformational change after substrate binding and the participation of Cys160 as the catalytic base responsible for shuttling the proton between C-1 and C-2.

However, the organization and prioritization of metabolite features remains a laborious process. Organizing metabolomics data is often done through mass fragmentation-based spectral similarity grouping, resulting in feature sets that also represent an intuitive and scientifically meaningful first stage of analysis in untargeted metabolomics. Exploiting such feature sets, feature-set testing has emerged as an approach that is widely used in genomics and targeted metabolomics pathway enrichment analyses. It allows for formally combining groupings with statistical testing into more meaningful pathway enrichment conclusions. Here, we present msFeaST (mass spectral Feature Set Testing), a feature-set testing and visualization workflow for LC-MS/MS untargeted metabolomics data. Feature-set testing involves  statistically assessing differential abundance patterns for groups of features across experimental conditions.  We developed msFeaST to make use of spectral similarity-based feature groupings generated using k-medoids clustering, where the resulting clusters serve as a proxy for grouping structurally similar features with potential biosynthesis pathway relationships. Spectral clustering done in this way allows for statistical testing on the scale feature-sets using the globaltest package, which provides high power to detect small concordant effects via joint modeling and reduced multiplicity adjustment penalties. Hence, msFeaST provides interactive integration of the semi-quantitative experimental information with mass-spectral structural similarity information, enhancing the prioritization of features and feature sets during exploratory data analysis.

Here we present a reparameterized GFN1-xTB model based on the Clusteromics I\u2013V datasets for studying atmospheric molecular (AMC) clusters, denoted AMC-xTB. The AMC- xTB model reduces the mean of electronic binding energy errors from 7\u201311.8 kcal/mol to roughly 0 kcal/mol and the root mean square deviation from 7.6\u201312.3 kcal/mol to 0.81\u20131.45 kcal/mol.

We employ the new parameterization in two new configurational sampling workflows that include an additional meta-dynamics sampling step using CREST with the AMC-xTB model. The first workflow, denoted the \u201cindependent workflow\u201d, is a commonly used funneling approach with an additional CREST step, and the second, the \u201cimprovement workflow\u201d, where the best configuration currently known in the literature is improved with a CREST+AMC-xTB step.

Despite extensive studies conducted in the past, the impact of microscopic structure of interfacial water molecules on photo-catalytic reactivity has not been directly examined. In this study, using real-time mass spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, we demonstrated the crucial role of hydrogen bond (H-bond) networks on the photo-catalytic hydrogen evolution in thickness-controlled water adsorption layers on various TiO2 photocatalysts. Under controlled water vapor environments with a relative humidity (RH) below 70%, we observed a monotonic increase in the H2 formation rate with increasing RH, indicating that reactive water molecules were present not only in the first adsorbed layer but also in several overlying layers. In contrast, at RH > 70%, when more than three water layers covered the catalyst surface, the H2 formation rate turned to decrease dramatically because of the structural rearrangement and hardening of the interfacial H-bond network induced during further water adsorption. This unique many-body effect of interfacial water was consistently observed for various TiO2 particles with different crystalline structures, including brookite, anatase, and a mixture of anatase and rutile. Our results demonstrated that depositing several water layers in a water vapor environment with RH ~70% is optimal for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rather than liquid-phase reaction conditions in aqueous solutions.

More recently generative models have emerged as sources of inspiration for chemists. We introduce a multi-target model, PCMol, that leverages the latent embeddings derived from AlphaFold as a means of conditioning the de novo generative model on target proteins. It is known that the addition of protein descriptors is an effective strategy to extend the applicability domain and prediction capability of quantitative structure-activity relation (QSAR) models, a strategy we refer to as proteochemometrics (PCM). Similarly, the use of AlphaFold latent embeddings within a generative model for small molecules allows it to leverage structural relationships between proteins. This opens up new possibilities such as interpolation within the chemical space of known highly active compounds and extrapolation on the target side based on their similarities to other proteins, which is especially relevant for understudied or novel targets. Our results indicate that PCMol can generate diverse, potentially active molecules for a wide array of proteins, including those with sparse ligand bioactivity data. We also benchmark against existing target-conditioned trans-former models to illustrate the validity of using AlphaFold protein representations to steer the molecular generation process and increase the generalization capabilities to unseen targets.

Arp", "abstract": "Background: Persistent, Mobile and Toxic (PMT), or very Persistent and very Mobile (vPvM) substances are a wide class of chemicals that are recalcitrant to degradation, easily transported, and potentially harmful to humans and the environment. Due to their persistence and mobility, these substances are often widespread in the environment once emitted, particularly in water resources, causing increased challenges during water treatment processes. Some PMT/vPvM substances such as GenX and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid have been identified as substances of very high concern (SVHCs) under the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation. With hundreds to thousands of potential PMT/vPvM substances yet to be assessed and managed, effective and efficient approaches that avoid a case-by-case assessment and prevent regrettable substitution are necessary to achieve the European Union's zero-pollution goal for a non-toxic environment by 2050. \nMain: Substance grouping has helped global regulation of some highly hazardous chemicals, e.g., through the Montreal Protocol and the Stockholm Convention. This article explores the potential of grouping strategies for identifying, assessing and managing PMT/vPvM substances. The aim is to facilitate early identification of lesser-known or new substances that potentially meet PMT/vPvM criteria, prompt additional testing, avoid regrettable use or substitution, and integrate into existing risk management strategies. Thus, this article provides an overview of PMT/vPvM substances and reviews the definition of PMT/vPvM criteria and various lists of PMT/vPvM substances available. It covers the current definition of groups, compares the use of substance grouping for hazard assessment and regulation, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of grouping substances for regulation. The article then explores strategies for grouping PMT/vPvM substances, including read-across, structural similarity and commonly retained moieties, as well as the potential application of these strategies using cheminformatics to predict P, M and T properties for selected examples. \nConclusion: Effective substance grouping can accelerate the assessment and management of PMT/vPvM substances, especially for substances that lack information. Advances to read-across methods and cheminformatics tools are needed to support efficient and effective chemical management, preventing broad entry of hazardous chemicals into the global market and favouring safer and more sustainable alternatives.

In this study, we report the synthesis of M site T1-xWx solid solution MAX phases, specifically (Ti1-xWx)2AlC and (Ti1-xWx)3AlC2. The 211-type phase exhibited a disordered solid solution, whereas the 312-type phase displayed a more ordered structure, resembling an o-MAX arrangement, with W atoms preferentially occupying the outer planes. This specific ordering in the 312-type MAX phase is attributed to the unique electronic structure and atomic radius of W, indicating that these characteristics are crucial for the preferential occupation of the outer planes.\nMoreover, corresponding solid-solution MXenes, Ti2.4W0.6C2Tz and Ti1.6W0.4CTz, were synthesized via selective etching of MAX powder precursors containing 20% W. These MXenes were evaluated as sodium-ion battery anodes, with Ti1.6W0.4CTz showing exceptional capacity, outperforming existing multilayer MXene chemistries. This work not only demonstrates the successful integration of W in meaningful quantities into a double transition metal solid solution MAX phase, but also paves the way for the development of cost-effective MXenes containing W. Such advancements significantly widen their application spectrum by fine-tuning their physical, electronic, mechanical, electrochemical, and catalytic properties.\n", "date": "2024-04-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Ceramics; Materials Processing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This skill can involve electron-pushing formalism (EPF) and reaction coordinate diagrams (RCDs). These representations can be important for evaluating whether product formation is driven by kinetic or thermodynamically favored rationale. For this research, students in organic chemistry were given a two-stage investigation. First, they were given an online multiple-choice assessment surrounding three distinct types of reactions for elucidating understanding of product\nformation: the Markovnikov addition of HBr to an alkene, an E2 elimination favoring the Zaitsev product, and an E2 elimination favoring the Hoffman product. This task was followed up with a semi-structured interview involving these same three reaction contexts to identify what resources were activated in their rationale for determining major and minor products, and how these resources were applied to create RCDs. Our findings indicate that these\nstudents focus predominately on resources associated with intermediate stability for the stepwise Markovnikov addition, with limited activation of resources regarding product stability. Conversely, resources focusing on product stability were activated more often with concerted eliminations. When provided with possible RCDs, activation of additional resources was observed. These data highlights the need for the integrated use of RCDs and creates the impetus for future studies on scaffolding these resources to encourage their activation during\nanalyses of novel reactions.", "date": "2024-04-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We used a combination of multiple techniques, including variable-temperature continuous wave EPR, pulsed proton electron\u2013nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), transient EPR, and optical spectroscopy. The conclusions are further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison to reference compounds. The low-temperature cw-EPR and room-temperature near-IR spectra of the dimer monocation demonstrate that the radical cation is spatially localized on one side of the dimer at any point in time, while the EPR spectra at 298 K reveal rapid hopping of the radical spin density between both sites of the dimer via reversible intramolecular electron transfer. The hyperfine interactions are modulated by electron transfers and can be quantified using ENDOR spectroscopy. This allowed simulation of the variable- temperature cw-EPR spectra with a two-site exchange model and provided information on the temperature-dependence of the electron transfer rate. The electron-transfer rates range from about 10.0 MHz at 200 K to about 53.9 MHz at 298 K.

The reaction time also specifies the time scale on which the medium dynamics can affect the reaction dynamics, thus imposing a nonergodic cutoff of the medium relaxation spectrum. The model presented here considers the effects of both the complex medium dynamics and the nonergodic dynamical constraints on the distance dependence of the reaction rate.

Following the MvK mechanism, the formation and conversion of surface oxygen vacancy (VO) are considered as the key steps.

They have the unique property of hosting remarkable amount of VO without significant change in lattice structure, offering O storage and release capability that maintains the required concentration of active O on the catalytic surface. In this regard, the rate of VO formation and conversion directly affect their catalytic performance. In this work, we obtained the VO formation and conversion kinetics by measuring the rate of the Ce4+ reduction and oxidation via operando energy dispersive Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EDE). The main conclusions are: 1) VO formation is 10 times faster than VO conversion; 2) VO formation rates are comparable with the CO oxidation rates, thereby serving as the rate-determining step in CO oxidation; 3) Pd and Cu serve as catalysts for VO formation by significantly improving its rate by 50 times at 250 C by weakening the metal-O bonding strength, whereas the activation energy have been reduced to 58.4 kJ/mol and 36.5 kJ/mol, respectively.

We show that the excitation energy of APC phycobilins is determined by geometric and electrostatic factors, and is tuned by the specific protein-protein interactions within the core. Our findings challenge the simple picture of a few red-shifted bilins in the PB core and instead suggest that the red-shifts are established by the entire TE-containing APC trimers. Our work provides a theoretical microscopic basis for the interpretation of energy migration and time-resolved spectroscopy in phycobilisomes.", "date": "2024-04-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study focuses on the inner-sphere electron transfer for the Ce(IV)-driven oxidation of the Ru(IV)=O species into the Ru(V)=O species. The approach to this step became possible by inventing a feasible method to isolate an air-stable Ru(IV)=O powder sample in this work. Importantly, by mixing the thus-obtained Ru(IV)=O sample with CAN (cerium ammonium nitrate), the inner-sphere adduct [Ru(IV)(=O)(terpy)(bpy)][Ce(IV)(NO3)5(OH)] was successfully isolated. The IR spectrum of the isolated adduct exhibits a strong band at 774 cm-1 attributable to the Ru(IV)=O-Ce(IV) stretching vibration, proving the covalent bonding of the oxo to the Ce(IV) center. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of this greenish black powder shows a broad absorption band at 600 nm, suggesting a charge transfer transition from the \u03c0* orbital of the Ru(IV)=O to the 4f orbital of Ce(IV), as supported by TD-DFT calculations. The addition of one equivalent CAN to the Ru(IV)=O solution induces the spectral change due to formation of the 1:1 adduct identical to the isolated adduct.

Bacterial PEtN transferases like MCR comprise periplasmic catalytic and integral membrane domains, with mechanistic understanding largely based on studies of the former with limited information on the full-length enzyme.

Herein, we present a small-molecule organic cathode material, 1,3,5-tris(3-vinyl-10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)benzene (V3PXZ), that overcomes this limitation by in situ electrochemical crosslinking in the cell after electrode fabrication using soluble small-molecule.

The reaction sequence involves: (i) the reduction of CO2 to formate by the electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (bpy = 2,2\u2019-bipyridine), (ii) Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and (iii) thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H-PNP)Ir(H)3 (H-PNP = bis[(2-diisopropyl-phosphino]ethyl)amine).

Light-driven variants use an easy to provide, easy to dose, and waste free fuel with high energy content, which makes them particularly interesting for many applications. Typically, light-driven molecular motors work via rotations around dedicated chemical bonds (e.g. double bonds) where directionality of the rotation is dictated by the steric effects of asymmetry in close vicinity to the rotation axis. In this work we show how unidirectional rotation around a virtual axis can be realized by reprogramming a molecular motor. To this end, a classical light-driven motor is restricted by macrocyclization and its intrinsic directional rotation is transformed into a directional rotation of the macrocyclic chain in the opposite direction. Further, solvent polarity changes allow to toggle the function of this molecular machine between a directional motor and a non-directional photoswitch. In this way a new concept for the design of molecular motors is delivered together with an elaborate control over their motions and functions by simple solvent changes. The possibility of sensing the environmental polarity and correspondingly adjusting directionality of motions opens up a next level of control and responsiveness to light-driven nanoscopic motors.", "date": "2024-04-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Stereochemistry; Nanodevices; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Therefore, fuel cells are a critical technology during pre-combustion capture, hence, this paper will focus on fuel cells. Fuel cells are like batteries, which produce electricity through fuels such as hydrogen and oxygen. Within the fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen are fed though the anode and cathode respectively. During this process, electrocatalysts stand up as a crucial component by accelerating the seperation of molecules into proton and electrons at the anode and combining them into water at the cathode, enhancing the efficiency of converting fuel into electricity by facilitating faster reactions. Consequently, this paper\u2019s principal objective will be to investigate how different electrocatalysts affect the reaction rate during CO2 capture when passing through a fuel cell. In this paper, the criteria for electrocatalysts will first be evaluated by examining prior research works, covering the kinetics and efficiency of the catalysts, it will also examine methods for assessing these aspects. Then, a comparison between noble metal catalysts and non-noble metal catalysts will be made due to their high demands in the current catalyst market. This is achieved by carrying on the established criteria from the previous section and a conclusion will be drawn as to what type of catalyst will be suited for different uses. As a result of this comparison, researcher may decides to use noble metal catalysts for efficiency, while non-noble metal catalysts are more favored for their cost-effective due to their ability to be engineered into different catalysts.

Such battery solidification can greatly influence the properties of battery components, as exemplified by a recent report suggesting that the (dis)charge behaviour of Fe2(MoO4)3 (FMO), a promising two-phase electrode material, differs on solid electrolytes compared to liquid electrolytes. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we examined the (de)lithiation behaviour of FMO thin films on solid electrolytes using operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) to gain insights into the influence of the solidification on the (dis)charge mechanism of electrode materials. The XRD results revealed that FMO on solid electrolytes exhibits a monotonic peak shift over a wide capacity range, accompanied by a temporary peak broadening. This suggests that FMO possesses an expanded solid-solution reaction region and a narrower two-phase reaction region in solidified batteries compared to liquid-based LIBs. The altered (dis)charge behavior was suggested to be thermodynamically driven, as it remained largely unchanged with varying rates and under open circuit conditions. Qualitative analysis considering stress-induced variations in Gibbs free energy curves demonstrated that external stress, potentially caused by the constraint of chemo-mechanical expansion, can thermodynamically narrow the two-phase region when the chemical expansion coefficients of the two phases of FMO differ. These findings highlight the significant impact of the battery solidification on electrode material properties, emphasizing the importance of considering these unique issues in the design of ASSLIBs.

As one of the few representative TAT nuclides, 212Pb has shown good efficacy in cancer treatment; however, the amount remains scarce. Separating 228Ra and 224Ra from 232Th is expected to fundamentally solve this issue. In this work, a novel and effective method for trace radium isolation from bulk thorium was proposed and verified through a systematic investigation of the adsorption behaviors of an anion exchanger denoted IRA900 toward thorium and barium/radium. Batch experiments suggested that IRA900 had unique selectivity for thorium in nitric acid solution, with almost no barium adsorbed. The thorium adsorption performance kept improving with increasing concentration of nitric acid and decreasing temperature. The IRA900 resin required about 8 h to reach adsorption equilibrium, and the estimated maximum adsorption capacity toward thorium was about 254 mg/g. The adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir model, respectively. Column experiments suggested that thorium could be effectively immobilized by a column packed with IRA900, while barium was directly penetrated. For desorbing the fixed thorium, 0.1 M HNO3 was optimal. A final hot test demonstrated the successful radium isolation from bulk thorium, with high chemical yield and purity. The selective separation mechanism was attributed to the formation of an anionic [Th(NO3)5]\u2212 complex, while barium or radium existed in the cationic form in any nitric acid concentration.

Batch crystallization kinetic experiments were conducted with synthetic wastewater with varying concentrations of microplastics and humic acid.

Here we leverage infrared thermography to quantify the freezing and drying behavior of all vials, hence enabling comprehensive studies of batch heterogeneity.  Surprisingly, the stochasticity of nucleation, commonly considered the main driver of batch heterogeneity, only causes little heterogeneity. Instead, heterogeneity originates from heat transfer between vials: when ice is formed in one vial, the release of latent heat governs the freezing behavior of its neighboring vials. Guided by a mechanistic model and confirmed by experiments, the cooling rate and geometrical arrangement of the vials are identified as main drivers of batch heterogeneity. In conclusion, this contribution reports transformational insights into freeze-drying and supports practitioners in process design and optimization.

Compared to the previously studied phase-changing DAC processes involving initial CO2 absorption by an aqueous alkaline solvent followed by carbonate crystallization in a second step, RC-DAC combines the CO2 absorption and carbonate crystallization into a single step. Thus, as the insoluble carbonate salts are removed from solution by crystallization, more CO2 is pulled from the air into solution, further driving the DAC process. The RC-DAC was performed in a household humidifier as the air-liquid contactor, which can handle solid-liquid slurries effectively. The crystallization was monitored in situ by pH measurements, real-time imaging with a microscope probe, and by Raman spectroscopy, and ex situ by NMR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and total inorganic carbonate analysis.

Electrolyte requirements are complex (conductivity, stability, safety) and the chemical design space (salts, solvents, additives, composition) is practically infinite; hence discovery is primarily guided through trial-and-error which slows the deployment of new battery chemistries.

However, some [NiFe] hydrogenases are inhibited by gas molecules present in the environment, such as O2 and CO. One strategy to engineer [NiFe] hydrogenases and achieve O2 and CO-tolerant enzymes is by introducing point mutations to block the access of inhibitors to the catalytic site. In this work, we characterized the unbinding pathways of CO in complex with the wild type and 10 different mutants of [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans using \u03c4-Random Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (\u03c4RAMD) to enhance the sampling of unbinding events. The ranking provided by the relative residence times computed with \u03c4RAMD is in agreement with experiments. Extensive data analysis of the simulations revealed that, from the two bottlenecks proposed in previous studies for the transit of gas molecules (residues 74 and 122, and residues 74 and 476), only one of them (residues 74 and 122) effectively modulates diffusion and residence times for CO. We also computed pathway probabilities for the unbinding of CO, O2 and H2 from the wild type [NiFe] hydrogenase and we observed that, while the most probable pathways are the same, the secondary pathways are different. We propose that introducing mutations to block the most probable paths, in combination with mutations to open the main secondary path used by H2, can be a feasible strategy to achieve CO and O2 resistance in the [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans.", "date": "2024-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Consequently, it is useful to predict whether a MOF is water-stable before investing time and resources into synthesis. Existing heuristics for designing water-stable MOFs lack generality and artificially limit the diversity of explored chemistry due to narrowly defined criteria. Machine learning (ML) models offer the promise to improve generality of predictions but require diverse experimental MOF stability data to be trained. In an improvement on previous efforts, we enlarge the available training data for MOF water stability prediction by over 400%, adding 911 MOFs with water stability labels assigned through semi-automated manuscript analysis to curate the new data set WS24. The additional data is shown to improve ML model performance (test ROC-AUC > 0.8) over diverse chemistry for the prediction of both water stability and stability in harsher acidic conditions. We illustrate how the expanded data set and models can be used with previously developed activation stability models to carry out genetic algorithms to quickly screen ~10,000 MOFs from a space of hundreds of thousands for candidates with multivariate stability (i.e., for activation, in water, and in acid). Model analysis and genetic algorithm results uncover metal- and geometry-specific design rules for robust MOFs.

For amine-based CO2 capture, increasing CO2 capture fractions requires maintaining sufficient driving force of absorption at the top of the absorber column by reducing lean solvent loadings. To produce low lean loadings without excessively increasing the specific thermal energy input, increased operational pressures are required in the CO2 stripper, inevitably leading to higher temperatures, which may increase the specific thermal degradation rate of the solvent. Concurrently, for solvents that react rapidly with dissolved O2, increased residence time in the absorber due to the increased packing heights also associated with high capture fractions may increase the specific oxidative degradation rate as the direct contact with O2 in the flue gas is extended.\n\nThrough process modelling and the application of a newly developed monoethanolamine (MEA) degradation framework, we investigate the effect on solvent degradation rates of increasing CO2 capture rates up to those that result in no net CO2 addition to the atmosphere. We do this for three key energy-producing processes: a combined cycle gas turbine, an energy-from-waste facility, and a steam methane reformer. In a first-of-a-kind study, we demonstrate that for a 35% wt. MEA-based solvent under steady-state conditions, solvent degradation is predicted to increase by 24% to 138% as a result of decreasing lean loadings and increased absorber residence time (process modifications that are thought to be beneficial when increasing CO2 capture fractions) from 53 - 208 gMEA/tCO2  when a 95% CO2 gross capture fraction is achieved to 125 \u2013 257 gMEA/tCO2 when 99.2 - 99.8% is achieved (i.e. when 100% of the added CO2 is captured). Further analysis provides evidence that process modifications, such as intercooling of the absorber column and reduced stripper sump residence times, may be useful in reducing the rates of solvent degradation, providing critical insights to future test campaigns and project developments.  \n\nHowever, limitations of this study remain; the degradation framework provides the instantaneous predicted MEA consumption rate of the system at a point in time and does not consider the catalytic effects that many impurities present in an operation plant will have on the reactions, potentially impacting degradation rates. Nonetheless, this serves as the first step towards understanding the effect of increasing CO2 capture fractions in post-combustion CO2 capture plants. Long-term tests with appropriate solvent management practices are required to fully quantify solvent degradation rates when operating at 100% added CO2 capture fractions.\n", "date": "2024-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the three Pd analogues Eu2Pd2Al, Eu2Pd2Ga, and Eu2Pd2Ge crystallize isostructural to Ca2Pd2Ge, a ternary ordered variant of the Zr2Al3-type (orthorhombic Fdd2). In contrast, Eu2Pt2Al adopts the Ca2Ir2Si type rival structure (monoclinic C2/c). The two structure types are closely related as they both feature linear chains of the noble metals, with the X atoms bridging the metal chains from adjacent layers. However, a striking difference is noticeable within the metal chains: The Pd linear chains consist of equidistant PdPd atoms (2.96 \u00c5), whereas in the Pt chains are pairwise distorted with alternating shorter (Pt\u2013Pt = 2.80 \u00c5) and longer (2.98 \u00c5) contacts. The pairwise distortion is, at first glance, attributed to stronger relativistic influence on Pt atom.

Both osmolytes are found to prevent salt-induced aggregation of the charged entities, yet their mode and degree of relative modulation depend on their intricate interplay with specific salt-cations. Betaine's ion-mediated surface interaction maintains Hofmeister ion ordering, whereas glycine alters the relative Hofmeister order of cation by salt-specific ion desorption from the surface. Experimental validation through surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy supports these findings, elucidating osmolyte-mediated alterations in interfacial water structures. These observations based on an inorganic interface are reciprocated in amyloid beta 40 (Abeta40) dimerization dynamics, highlighting osmolyte efficacy in mitigating salt-induced aggregation.", "date": "2024-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While a number of research group have looked at nanodiamond, graphite and other carbon and non-carbon-based materials (especially clays) as possible solid templates for early life, we propose that diamond-like carbon (DLC, also known as amorphous diamond or aD) may have been a plausible ideal template.  This is due largely to the fact that DLC is a heterogeneous material, essentially an aggregation of various constituent carbon species (for instance, graphene, graphite, CNT, etc.), depending on formation conditions.  Further, DLC exhibits a range of superlative material properties shared by diamond and graphitic materials  It possesses high thermal diffusivity and conductivity along all planes due to its inherent anisotropism. Internal and surface structure variability could have played a crucial role in facilitating the molecular interactions that accelerated the abiotic formation of RNA oligomers, potentially supporting the RNA World hypothesis.  Significant outside energy is not needed to enable oligomer formation. Entropy, in the form of heat,  is a driving force that provides conditions necessary for oligomer formation.  To reduce computational and financial costs, we investigate artificial intelligence-driven methodologies to inform optimal MD  input parameters with the goal of generating key qualitative endpoints. As MD simulations are extremely computationally expensive due to the large quantity of electronegativity and force field interactions for trajectory calculations, we initially used a lightweight MD system combined with a transformer model to better predict the likelihood of achieving collisions between target molecules, and thus increase the chance of observing exemplar endpoints.  Various key endpoints were observed, including Van der Waals oligomer-template attachment, translocation/rotation potentially leading to more complex configurations, quasi-elongation and bridging, as well as detachment).  The observations of these endpoints suggest that carbonaceous materials such as DLC could plausibly have served as templates for the formation of early nucleic acid oligomers.

However, typical strategies for these analyses largely rely on regression approaches, which often requires many experimental data to understand non-intuitive trends.

Flavour notes for each lot were provided by a commercial coffee roaster based on sensory evaluations, which were binarized as present or absent labels.

The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is observed to be significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity between them. The cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene can spontaneously assemble into non-covalent complexes characterized by - stacking in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. From C18 to C34, the binding strength with C60 fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C34@C60 dimer exhibits a perfect nano-Saturn structure. By studying the trimers of 2:1 form between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene, it is observed that as the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons gradually decreases. In the largest trimer we studied, C60@2C34, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C60 fullerenes in a 1:2 ratio showed when the size of the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell-like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one.

These lattice reorientations are sufficiently large to bring reflections entirely in or out of excitation, occur as early events in the decay of diffracted signal due to radiolytic damage, and coincide with beam-induced migrations of crystal bend contours within the same fluence regime and at the same illuminated location on a crystal. These effects are observed in crystals of biotin, a series of amino acid metal chelates, and a six-residue peptide, suggesting that incident electrons inevitably warp molecular lattices.

Often, reorientations can tilt a crystal lattice several degrees away from its initial position, and for an especially beam-sensitive Zn(II)-methionine chelate, are associated with dramatic crystal quakes prior to 1 e-/\u00c52 exposure.

Well-known transformation products may exceed UDMH itself in their toxicity, but most of the products are poorly investigated, while posing a huge environmental threat. Experimental RIs for the stationary phases, RIs from the NIST database, and predicted RIs are presented in this paper. It is shown that there are virtually no RIs for UDMH transformation products in the NIST database. In addition, even among those compounds for which RIs were known, inconsistencies were identified. Adding RIs to the database and eliminating erroneous data would allow for more reliable identification when standards are not available. The discrepancies identified between experimental RI values and predicted values will allow for adjustments to the machine learning models that are used for prediction. Previously proposed compounds as possible transformation products without the use of standards and NMR method were confirmed.", "date": "2024-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Analytical Chemistry - General; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we applied an integrated multiscale strategy of (QM/)MM molecular dynamics simulations and excited-state QM/MM nonadiabatic dynamics with enhanced sampling techniques to the Agrobacterium fabrum bathy phytochrome and compared the results with those obtained for the canonical phytochrome Deinococcus radiodurans. Contrary to what recently suggested, we found that the photoactivation of both phytochromes is directly triggered by the same photoisomerization process involving an hula-twist motion. However, only in the bathy phytochrome the photoproduct evolves into a heterogeneous and dynamic intermediate, Lumi-F, in which the bilin has reached the final (Pr) configurational state. Moreover, the protein pocket of the bathy phytochrome responds in a microsecond timescale, by reorienting several aminoacidic residues and causing the spine to tilt.

Here we show that the quantum coherence of quintet multiexcitons can be achieved at room temperature by arranging two pentacene chromophores in parallel and close proximity within a macrocycle. By making dynamic covalent Schiff-base bonds between aldehyde-modified pentacene derivatives, macrocyclic parallel dimer-1 (MPD-1) can be selectively synthesized in a high yield. MPD-1 exhibits fast sub-picosecond SF in polystyrene film and generates spin-polarized quintet multiexcitons. Furthermore, the coherence time T2 of the MPD-1 quintet is as long as 400 ns even at room temperature.

Among the peptides, WWWKYE21-coated nanoparticles displayed higher nanoparticle binding to both LPS and bacteria-like membranes, as well as photocatalytic degradation, although saturation effects were found at high nanoparticle binding. Elucidating structural aspects, neutron reflectometry showed that binding of peptide-coated nanoparticles to bacteria-like membranes resulted in partial lipid removal also in the absence of UV, but that UV illumination caused additional layer degradation, demonstrated by increases in the hydration of both headgroup and acyl chain regions. For LPS, UV illumination induced removal of its outer O-antigen region. Analogous to these findings in model systems, antimicrobial effects of the peptide-coated nanoparticles against Escherichia coli bacteria on illumination were pronounced, while toxicity against human monocytes remained low.

Such limitations have sparked interest in developing novel isoporous mem- brane materials and fabrication techniques to overcome the selectivity-permeability upper bound. Among several promising candidates, block copolymer membranes pro- duced via the self-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation (SNIPS) method offer distinct advantages, such as customisable pore size, narrow dispersity, high poros- ity and mechanical flexibility. However, achieving the desired structure formation in SNIPS remains a complex optimisation procedure, rendering this approach unsuitable for the rapid screening of new block copolymer candidates. This study explores a direct spin coating method to fabricate a poly(styrene)-block- poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) thin film composite membrane, integrating a block copolymer layer with rigid anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) support. The pro- cess involves depositing the polymer solution onto a water-filled AAO substrate via spin coating. Compared with the SNIPS method, this fabrication process greatly re- duces the complexity of optimisation to yield an isoporous membrane structure for filtration purposes. We present this approach as a straightforward and reliable plat- form method for the rapid screening and evaluation of block copolymer membranes in their initial development stages.

Higher injection efficiencies were found in mixed solvent electrolytes for dye-sensitized SnO2/TiO2 core/shell electrodes, whereas the injection efficiency of dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes decreased with the increasing acetonitrile concentration. The trend in injection efficiency for the TiO2 electrodes was consistent with the solvent-dependent trend in the semiconductor flat-band potential. Photoinduced electron injection in core-shell electrodes has been understood as a two-step process involving ultrafast electron trapping in the TiO2 shell followed by slower electron transfer to the SnO2 core. The driving force for shell-to-core electron transfer increases as the flat band potential of TiO2 shifts negatively with increasing concentration of acetonitrile. In acetonitrile-rich electrolytes, despite the larger driving force, electron injection is suppressed. Interestingly, a net negative photoconductivity in the SnO2 core is observed in mixed solvent electrolytes by OPTP. We hypothesize that an electric field is formed across the TiO2 shell from the oxidized dye molecules after injection. The intrinsic conduction band electrons in SnO2 are trapped at the core-shell interface by the electric field, resulting in a negative photoconductivity transient. The overall electron injection efficiency of the dye- sensitized SnO2/TiO2 core/shell photoanodes, measured on longer timescales, is optimized in mixed solvents.

In the case of proteins, much progress in these areas has been made by complementing experiments with atomistic simulations, but RNA simulation methods and force fields are less mature. It remains challenging to generate stable RNA simulations, even for small systems where well-defined, thermostable structures have been established by experiments. Many different aspects of RNA energetics have been adjusted in force fields, seeking improvements that are transferable across a variety of RNA structural motifs. In this work, we explore the role of weak CH\u2026O interactions, which are ubiquitous in RNA structure but have received less attention in RNA force field development. By comparing data extracted from high-resolution RNA crystal structures to energy profiles from quantum mechanics and force field calculations, we demonstrate that CH\u2026O interactions are overly repulsive in the widely-used Amber RNA force fields. We developed a simple, targeted adjustment of CH\u2026O repulsion that leaves the remainder of the force field unchanged. We then tested the standard and modified force fields using MD simulations with explicit water and salt, amassing over 300 \u03bcsec of data for multiple RNA systems containing important features such as presence of loops, base stacking interactions as well as canonical and non-canonical base pairing.

The two fluorophores have the same number of functional groups and molecular charge and vary only by a single vinylene unit in the polymethine chain which produces a predictable difference in spectral and physicochemical properties. We find that the two dyes can be employed as a complementary pair in diverse types of fundamental and applied fluorescence imaging experiments. A fundamental fluorescence spectroscopy study used ICB and ICG to test a recently proposed FRET mechanism for enhanced fluorescence brightness in heavy water (D2O). The results support two important corollaries of the proposal, (a) the strategy of using heavy water to increase the brightness of fluorescent dyes for microscopy or imaging is most effective when the dye emission band is above 650 nm, and (b) the magnitude of the heavy water florescence enhancement effect for near-infrared ICG is substantially diminished when the ICG surface is dehydrated due to binding by albumin protein. Two applied fluorescence imaging studies demonstrated how deep-red ICB can be combined with a near-infrared fluorophore for paired agent imaging in the same living subject. One study used dual-channel mouse imaging to visualize increased blood flow in a model of inflamed tissue, and a second mouse tumor imaging study simultaneously visualized the vasculature and cancerous tissue in separate fluorescence channels.

However, carrier lifetimes vary by orders of magnitude between photoabsorbers and there is no blueprint for the targeted design of materials with intrinsically long lifetimes. Here, we establish a fundamental link between the carrier lifetime and the electronic configuration of transition metal oxides (TMOs). By comparing their deactivation pathways across a range of electronic configurations, we identify a sub-ps relaxation mechanism via metal-centred ligand field (LF) states. These LF states open localised recombination channels that compromise charge and quantum yields in open d-shell TMOs (e.g., Fe2O3, Co3O4, Cr2O3, NiO), which is more reminiscent of molecular complexes than crystalline semiconductors. In contrast, in TMOs with d0 or d10 electronic configurations (e.g., TiO2, BiVO4), the absence of LF states enables larger yields of long-lived charges and thus more efficient photocatalysis. Notably, our results suggest that charge localisation in the form of polarons can mitigate rapid LF deactivation. These trends translate to other metal-containing semiconductors and open a new pathway to design absorbers with well-controlled non-radiative recombination channels for applications including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and communication devices.", "date": "2024-04-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Chemical Kinetics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Enhancing retrosynthetic efficacy requires overcoming the vast complexity of chemical space, the limited known interconversions between molecules, and the challenges posed by limited experimental  datasets. In this study, we introduce generative machine learning methods for retrosynthetic planning that generate reaction templates. Our approach features three key innovations. First, the models generate complete reactions, known as templates, instead of reactants or synthons. Through this abstraction, novel chemical transforms resembling those in the training dataset can be generated. Second, the approach optionally allows users to select the specific bond or bonds to be changed in the proposed reaction, enabling human interaction to influence the synthetic approach. Third, one of our models, based on the conditional kernel-elastic autoencoder (CKAE) architecture, employs a latent space to measure the similarity between generated and known reactions, providing insights into their chemical viability. Together, these features establish a coherent framework for retrosynthetic planning, as validated by our experimental work. We demonstrate the application of our machine learning methodology to design a synthetic pathway for a simple yet challenging small molecule of pharmaceutical interest. The pathway was experimentally proven viable through a 3-step process, which compares favorably to previous 5-9 step approaches.

Although widely investigated numerically, the fabrication of tailor-made metamaterials is very complex or often beyond range using current technology. For wire metamaterials composed of aligned metallic nanowires in a dielectric matrix, since the free carrier concentration in metals is fixed, light-matter interaction cannot be adjusted/ changed anymore after fabrication.

Herein, several nonconjugated luminogens are constructed by employing biphenyl as the building unit to reveal the structure-property relationship and solve current challenges.

To isolate the effects of non-covalent interactions on SCNP structure and conformational dynamics, we synthesized a series of amphiphilic copolymers containing dimethylacrylamide and monomers capable of forming these different interactions: 1) di(phenylalanine) acrylamide that forms intramolecular \u03b2-sheet-like crosslinks, 2) phenylalanine acrylamide that forms hydrogen-bonds, but lacks a defined local structure, and 3) benzyl acrylamide that has lowest propensity for hydrogen-bonding.

CeO2 nanocrystals have been well-studied for dephosphorylation via hydrolysis owing to the accessible and tunable distribution of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions. However, there remains uncertainty in the literature regarding which surface defect properties direct catalytic activity, such as the Ce3+/Ce4+ distribution, oxygen vacancies, faceting, and dopants, and to what degree they contribute to efficient hydrolysis. Trivalent (M3+) dopants serve as a tool for manipulating defects, including the concentration of Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies, thereby influencing the hydrolytic activity of CeO2. Herein, trivalent metal ions (M = Y3+, Cr3+, In3+, and Gd3+) were employed to modulate the active sites on the CeO2 nanocrystal surface, and the effects of each metal dopant on the cerium oxide active sites for organophosphate hydrolysis were investigated. M-doped CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized via hydrothermal methods, followed by annealing to remove ligands and prime the nanocrystal surface for catalysis.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy revealed successful doping of CeO2 in all cases, albeit with distinctive characteristics demonstrating how M3+ dopants affect catalysis. We show that CeO2 exhibits high sensitivity to dopants that generate lattice strain, Ce3+ ions, and oxygen vacancy defects.

Here, a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method for the direct analysis of oxylipins bound to PL was developed. Optimized reversed phase LC separation enabled the separation of isobaric and isomeric PL from different lipid classes bearing oxylipin positional isomers, by both the polar head groups as well as the fatty acyl chains. Each individual PL bearing oxylipins was tentatively identified based on the combination of retention time, precursor ion and specific product ions.

Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 15, 323], we investigate approximate FEs and DEs in neutral water clusters containing up to 20 monomers, charged water clusters, and alkali- and halide-water clusters. Our proxy for the exact density is r2SCAN50, a 50% global hybrid of exact exchange with r2SCAN, which may be less correct than r2SCAN for the compact water monomer but importantly more correct for long-range electron transfers in the non-compact water clusters. We show that SCAN makes substantially larger FEs for neutral water clusters than r2SCAN, while both make essentially the same DEs. Unlike the case for barrier heights, these FEs are small in a relative sense, and become large in an absolute sense only due to an increase in cluster size. SCAN@HF produces a cancellation of errors that makes it chemically accurate for predicting the absolute binding energies of water clusters. Likewise, adding a long-range dispersion correction to r2SCAN@HF, as in the composite method HF-r2SCAN-DC4, makes its FE more negative than in r2SCAN@HF, permitting a near-perfect cancellation of FE and DE. r2SCAN by itself (and even more so, r2SCAN evaluated on the r2SCAN50 density), is almost perfect for the energy differences between water hexamers, and thus probably also for liquid water away from the boiling point. Thus the accuracy of composite methods like SCAN@HF and HF-r2SCAN-DC4 is not due to the HF density being closer to the exact density, but to a compensation of errors from its greater degree of localization. We also give an argument for the approximate reliability of this unconventional error cancellation for diverse molecular properties. Finally, we confirm this unconventional error cancellation for the SCAN description of the water trimer via Kohn-Sham inversion of the CCSD(T) density.

We focus on two competing factors that may affect the aggregation kinetics of B9-23 variants: (a) the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds by C19 which stabilizes parallel \u03b2-sheet assembly, and (b) the aggregation of B12-17 (VEALYL) which favors anti-parallel sheets. Their interplay likely contributes to the observed variations in aggregation kinetics and morphologies. Our findings indicate that Ins1 B9-23 and the Ins2 Y16A mutant exhibit rapid fibril formation, whereas Ins2 B9-23 and the Ins2 C19S mutant show slower fibrilization and a structural rearrangement from globular protofibrils to fibrillar aggregates. The Y16A mutation decreases the amyloidogenicity of the VEALYL sequence and, thus, indirectly promotes parallel \u03b2-sheet arrangements. The weak or lack of disulfide bond formation in Ins2 B9-23 and C19S, respectively, weakens the overall propensity of parallel \u03b2-sheet assembly. These differences in aggregation behaviors also manifest in interactions with (-)epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a canonical amyloid inhibitor. EGCG effectively disrupts the fibrils formed by Ins1 B9-23 and the Y16A mutant. However, it proves ineffective in preventing fibril formation of Ins2 B9-23 and the C19S mutant.

As a result of the effective delocalization and the absence of orthogonally oriented bulky substituents, the cationic pai-conjugated skeletons formed a pai-stacked array with short interfacial distances. A derivative with SbF6 as a counter anion formed a charge-segregated assembly in the crystalline state, rather than the generally favored charge-by-charge arrangement of oppositely charged species based on electrostatic interactions. Theoretical calculations suggested that the destabilization caused by electrostatic repulsion between two positively charged pai-conjugated skeletons is compensated by the dispersion forces. In addition, the counter anion SbF6 played a role in regulating the molecular alignment through F\u2026H-C and F\u2026S interactions, which resulted in the charge-segregated alignment of the cationic pai-skeletons.

LC-HRMS combines liquid chromatography's separation capabilities with mass spectrometry's high-resolution mass analysis. MS1 spectra, acquired in LC-HRMS, provide detailed mass-to-charge ratio information for detected ions, enabling simultaneous profiling of metabolites without prior knowledge of their structures or retention times. Pre-processing steps and feature detection algorithms are applied to raw MS1 spectra, facilitating downstream analysis, including statistical analysis, metabolite annotation, and pathway mapping. The choice between profile and centroid scans for MS1 data acquisition entails trade-offs in resolution, data complexity, and processing requirements.

Although persul-fides are stronger nucleophiles than their thiol counterparts, persulfides can also act as electrophiles in their neutral, proto-nated form in specific environments. Moreover, persulfides are electrophilic at both sulfur atoms, and reaction with a thiolate can lead to either H2S release with disulfide formation or alternatively result in transpersulfidation. Despite the broad ac-ceptance of these reaction pathways, the specific properties that control whether persulfides react through the H2S releasing or transpersulfidation pathway remains elusive. Herein, we use a combined computational and experimental approach to directly investigate the reactivity between persulfides and thiols to answer these questions.

The performance and suitability of nanoporous materials for each specific application are directly related to both its physical and chemical properties, and their determination is crucial for process engineering and optimization of performances. In this Account, we focus on some recent developments in the multi-scale modeling of physical properties of nanoporous frameworks, highlighting the latest advances in three specific areas: mechanical properties, thermal properties, and adsorption. For the study of the mechanical behavior of nanoporous materials, the last few years have seen a rapid acceleration of research. For example, computational resources have been pooled to created public large-scale databases of elastic constants: those can serve as a basis for data-based discovery of materials with targeted properties, as well as the training of machine learning predictor models. The large-scale prediction of thermal behavior, in comparison, is not yet routinely performed at such large scale. Tentative databases have been assembled at the DFT level on specific families of materials, like zeolites, but prediction at larger scale currently requires the use of transferable, classical force fields, whose accuracy can be limited. Finally, adsorption is naturally one of the most studied physical properties of nanoporous frameworks, as fluid separation or storage is often the primary target for these materials. We highlight the recent achievements and open challenges for adsorption prediction at large scale, focusing in particular on the accuracy of computational models and the reliability of comparisons with experimental data available. We detail some recent methodological improvements in the prediction of adsorption-related properties, including thermodynamic quantities and transport properties. Finally, we stress the importance for data-based methods of addressing all sources of uncertainty.

This potential primarily stems from the ability to deliberately customize their structure and functionalities to enhance interactions with guest molecules. In this study, we explore the use of MOF-525, a porphyrin-based MOF, as a nanofiller in a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) composed of 6FDA-DAM (6FDA: 2,2-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane dianhydride; DAM: 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3-diaminobenzene) polymer for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separations. This particular MOF is chosen because of the possibility to metalate its porphyrin ring to tailor the interaction between the CO2 molecule and the MOF framework. As a result, the CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance of the MMM loaded with metalated MOF-525 can be significantly improved without the necessity to use a very high nanoparticle loading. When compared to the bare polymeric membrane and 2 wt% non-metalated MOF-525 MMM, around 20% improvement in the membrane permeability and selectivity can be observed for the 2 wt% metalated MOF-525 MMM. Further analysis on the gas transport property of the MMM showed that the improvement mainly results from the enhanced CO2 solubility in the MMMs and improved interaction between the metalated MOF-525 and the CO2 molecule. However, it is also found that 2 and 5 wt% are the optimum loading value, above which the interfacial defects between the MOF nanoparticles and the polymers caused by the particle agglomeration starts to appear and thus deteriorating the membrane performance. This is also confirmed through the molecular simulations where some overestimations from the Maxwell model on the membrane permeability is observed particularly at high particle loading, indicating the agglomeration and the build-up of non-selective voids. Despite this, we have successfully shown in this study the high efficacy and efficiency of using metalated porphyrin MOFs for CO2 separation in a MMM since only relatively low particle loading (around 2 wt%) is required to improve the membrane performance.

In this work, a suite of multi-color long-lived RTP materials featuring distinct afterglow emissions was constructed using an ion-radical mediated approach. b[c]p/MeBPO emitted a vivid yellow afterglow centered at 560 nm with an impressively long lifetime of 860.01 ms. While compound b[a]a exhibited a near-infrared (NIR) afterglow (\u03c4 = 215.96 ms) after doping into the matrix. The transient absorption spectroscopy investigations disclosed that the observed afterglow phenomenon was fundamentally tied to the generation of radical ions rather than the exciplex. These radical ions resulted from the reduction quenching process of the triplet excited state of compound BPO by the ground state of the doping agent. A novel evaluation methodology was devised, rooted in Marcus theory, to gauge the potential of a specific dopant-matrix combination towards generating pronounced afterglow. According to this framework, the enhancement of the afterglow is directly proportional to the decrease in the activation energy (\u0394G\u2260) associated with the electron transfer reaction occurring between the dopant and the matrix. Notably, when the \u0394G\u2260 surpasses 30 kcal/mol, no observable afterglow occurs, as higher \u0394G\u2260 values significantly impede the electron transfer reaction between the two components. Furthermore, the system exhibits exceptional sensitivity, with the dopant as low as 0.02\u2030 molar ratio between the dopant and the host material.

Many researchers focusing on the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 have revealed that the Ag nanoparticle was an effective co-catalyst for the selective conversion of CO2 to CO in water. To improve the activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in water, it is important to modify the surface of the photocatalysts to load small Ag nanoparticles with high dispersity, which is difficult when using conventional methods. In this study, the ultrasonic reduction (USR) method was used as an advanced modification method of photocatalysts with the Ag co-catalyst. We found that Ag/ZnTa2O6 prepared by the USR method showed good selectivity toward CO (> 90 %) evolution and a higher formation rate of CO than those by conventional modification methods. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) images of the Ag co-catalyst clarified that Ag nanoparticles with the size of a single nanometer were loaded on the surface of ZnTa2O6 by the USR method, whereas much bigger Ag particles were observed in the case of the other methods. Accordingly, it can be noted that a small Ag co-catalyst with a single nanometer exhibits superior activity toward selective conversion of CO2 to CO.

DNA adducts have been known for long, but the old methods allowed to target only a few known DNA adducts at a time, not providing a global picture of the \u201cDNA adductome\u201d. DNA adductomics is a new research field, aiming to screen for unknown DNA adducts by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). However, DNA adductomics presents several analytical challenges such as the need for high sensitivity and for the development of effective screening approaches to identify novel DNA adducts. \nResults: In this work, a sensitive untargeted DNA adductomics method was developed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled via an ESI source to a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometric instrumentation. Mobile phases with ammonium bicarbonate gave the best signal enhancement. The MS capillary voltage, cone voltage, and detector voltage had most effect on the response of the DNA adducts. A low adsorption vial was selected for reducing analyte loss. Hybrid surface-coated analytical columns were tested for reducing adsorption of the DNA adducts. The optimized method was applied to analyse DNA adducts in calf thymus, cat colon, and human colon DNA by performing a MSE acquisition (all-ion fragmentation acquisition) and screening for the loss of deoxyribose and the nucleobase fragment ions. Fifty-four DNA adducts were tentatively identified, hereof 38 never reported before. \nSignificance: This is the first untargeted DNA adductomics study on human colon tissue, and one of the few untargeted DNA adductomics studies in the literature reporting the identification of such a high number of unknowns. This demonstrates promising results for the application of this sensitive method in future human studies for investigating novel potential cancer-causing factors.\n", "date": "2024-04-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recent developments have led to the application of both experimental screening approaches and in silico modeling methods to identify synergistic drug combinations and expand the therapeutic options for multiple diseases. Here we conduct a study to compare different predictive approaches for identifying new treatment combinations for pancreatic cancer using cell line growth as an initial proxy for clinical utility.

As a result of this collaboration, 88 proposed combinations were tested in a cell-based assay; 53 of them were synergistic (hit rate ~60%). While all machine learning approaches demonstrate advances in the direction of predicting synergistic drug combinations, graph convolutional networks resulted in the best performance with a hit rate ~83%, and Random Forest delivered the highest precision of 65%.

Here we show the application of luminescent O2 sensor nanoparticles (~40-50 nm) composed of the O2 indicator platinum(II) tetra(4-fluoro)phenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PtTPTBPF) immobilized in poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA-MA). We injected the sensor nanoparticles into the gastrovascular system of intact colony fractions of reef-building, tropical corals that harbor photosynthetic microalgae in their tissues. The sensor nanoparticles are ex-cited by red LED light (617 nm) and emit in the near-infrared (780 nm), which enhances transmission of excitation and emission light through biological materials. This enabled us to map the internal O2 concentration via time-domain luminescence lifetime imaging through the outer tissue layers across several coral polyps in flowing seawater. After injection, nanoparticles dispersed within the coral tissue over several hours. While luminescence intensity imag-ing showed some local aggregation of sensor particles, lifetime imaging showed a more homogenous O2 distribution across a larger area of the coral colony. Local stimulation of symbiont photosynthesis in corals induced oxygenation of illuminated tissue areas and formation of lateral O2 gradients toward surrounding respiring tissues, which were dissi-pated rapidly after onset of darkness. Such measurements are key to improve our understanding of how corals regulate their internal chemical microenvironment and metabolic activity and how they are affected by environmental stress such as ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation. Our experimental approach can also be adapted for in vivo O2 imaging in other natural systems such as biofilms, plant and animal tissues, as well as in organoids and other cell con-structs, where imaging internal O2 conditions are relevant and challenging due to high optical density and back-ground fluorescence.", "date": "2024-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Analysis; Imaging", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Mendes; Peter Matvija; Angela E.M. Melcherts; Chunning Sun; Xinwei Ye; Bert M. Weckhuysen; Matteo Monai", "abstract": "ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts have shown excellent activity in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol compared with single component counterparts, but the interaction between ZnO and ZrO2 is still poorly understood. In particular, the effect of the ZrO2 support phase (tetragonal vs. monoclinic) was not systematically explored. Here, we have synthesized ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst materials supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (ZnO/ZrO2-t) and monoclinic ZrO2 (ZnO/ZrO2-m), which resulted in the formation of different ZnOx species, consisting of sub-nanometer ZnO moieties and large-sized ZnO particles, respectively. ZnO/ZrO2-t exhibited much higher methanol selectivity (81 %) and methanol yield (1.25 mmol/g/h) compared with ZnO/ZrO2-m (39 % and 0.67 mmol/g/h). The difference in performance was attributed to the redox state and degree of dispersion of Zn, based on spectroscopy and microscopy results. Operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and in situ near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) showed that ZnO/ZrO2-t had a high density of ZnO-ZrO sites, which favored the formation of active HCOO* species and enhanced the yield and selectivity of methanol along the formate pathway. Operando UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) together with Raman spectroscopy and high-angle angular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis revealed that on ZnO/ZrO2-t, ZnO clusters were further dispersed during catalysis at 320 \u00b0C, forming high density of ZnO-ZrO sites, and facilitating the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, while larger ZnO particles on ZnO/ZrO2-m remained stable throughout the reaction. This study shows that the phase of ZrO2 supports can be used to control the dispersion of the active phase and lead to enhanced catalytic performance. We believe the insights are relevant for other methanol synthesis catalysts, where metal-support interactions are pivotal for catalyst activity and stability.

However, the rapid synthesis of these materials with high yield and quality poses a challenge, hindering their practical application advancements. In this study, we report the synthesis of highly crystalline BNNTs and BNNSs through a solid-state catalytic flash Joule heating (FJH) method, using ammonia borane as the precursor. The catalytic growth process was achieved under atmospheric conditions at easily attained FJH temperatures (~1500 \u00b0C) within seconds. By adjusting the reaction temperature and variety of catalysts, the selectivity to BNNTs can reach ~30% of the total product composition. Furthermore, the nucleated growth of BNNT on iron(0) is mediated by the introduction of carbon and sulfur. This study demonstrates a convenient and scalable synthesis pathway for BNNTs and BNNSs and provides critical insights into the mechanism of rapid synthesis techniques enabled by electrical heating.", "date": "2024-04-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

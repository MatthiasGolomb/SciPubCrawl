This switchable optical propertyenables their utilization in many technological applications, such as smart windows, sensors, goggles, medical devices, etc. However, how the composition of the films affects their optical properties is not fully clear and therefore demands a straightforward investigation. In this work, the composition of YHO films manufactured by reactive magnetron sputtering under different conditions is deduced in a ternary diagram from Time-of-Flight Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ToF-ERDA).

We here present our implementation in the Amber biomolecular package of a SEBOMD module that provides a way to run SemiEmpirical Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics.

Specific ways of handling periodic boundary conditions using mechanical embedding or electrostatic embedding through a tailored quantum Ewald summation is developed. The parallel performance of SEBOMD simulations using the D&C scheme are presented for liquid water systems of various sizes, and a comparison between the traditional full diagonalization scheme and the D&C approach for the reproduction of the structure of liquid water illustrates the potentiality of SEBOMD to simulate molecular systems containing several hundreds of atoms for hundreds of picoseconds with a quantum mechanical potential in a reasonable amount of CPU time.</div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The molecular engineering of novel high-performant biogas upgrading alkanolamine compounds requires detailed information about their properties in mixed solution. The liquid structure properties of four representative alkanolamine molecules (monoethanolamine (MEA) as a reference and standard, 3-aminopropanol (MPA), 2-methylaminoethanol (MMEA) and 4-diethylamino-2-butanol (DEAB)) in the presence of CO2 were investigated over a wide range of solvent alkanolamine/water mixture compositions and temperature. In aqueous solution, hydrogen bonding with solvent water molecules are dominating over CO2 interactions for MEA, MPA and MMEA. Analysis of the liquid structure reveals that carbon dioxide shows no preference of approaching the alkanolamine but is rather displaced by water molecules. CO2 dissolved in aqueous DEAB, however, accumulates within clusters of DEAB molecules devoid of water. The carbon dioxide diffusion coefficients for all four molecules agree well with experiment for where available and are obtained for all mixture compositions and as a function of temperature. The solute diffusion correlates with the mobility of the alkanolamines in water at various ternary mixture compositions. Kinetic aspects of the CO2-alkanolamine interactions are described by characteristic residence times of CO2. The hydrophic interaction of carbon dioxide with the alkanolamine has a lifetime of the order of tens of picoseconds whereas polar interactions are about one order of magnitude shorter.

Here, we report a DNA-based microcapsule composed of a water-in-oil microdroplet stabilised with amphiphilised DNA origami nanoplates. By utilising function programmability achieved by DNA nanotechnology, the DNA nanoplates were designed as a nanopore device for ion transportation as well as the interface stabiliser. Microscopic observations showed that the microcapsule formed by amphiphilic DNA nanoplates accumulated at the oil-water interface. Ion current measurements demonstrated that pores in the nanoplates functioned as ion channels. These findings provide a general strategy for programmable designing of microcapsules for engineering artificial cells and molecular robots.<br />", "date": "2018-09-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biopolymers; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Interfaces; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Since then several groups have examined two-level (S = \u00bd) molecular spin systems as possible qubits (3-12). There has also been a report of the implementation of the Grover algorithm in a four-level molecular qudit (13). A major challenge is to protect the spin qubit from noise that causes loss of phase information; strategies to minimize the impact of noise on qubits can be categorized as corrective, reductive, or protective. Corrective approaches allow noise and correct for its impact on the qubit using advanced microwave pulse sequences (3). Reductive approaches reduce the noise by minimising the number of nearby nuclear spins (7-11), and increasing the rigidity of molecules to minimise the effect of vibrations (which can cause a fluctuating magnetic field via spin-orbit coupling) (9,11); this is essentially engineering the ligand shell surrounding the electron spin. A protective approach would seek to make the qubit less sensitive to noise: an example of the protective approach is the use of clock transitions to render spin states immune to magnetic fields at first order (12). Here we present a further protective method that would complement reductive and corrective approaches to enhancing quantum coherence in molecular qubits. The target is a molecular spin qubit with an effective 2S ground state: we achieve this with a family of divalent rare-earth molecules that have negligible magnetic anisotropy such that the isotropic nature of the electron spin renders the qubit markedly less sensitive to magnetic noise, allowing coherent spin manipulations even at room temperature. If combined with the other strategies, we believe this could lead to molecular qubits with substantial advantages over competing qubit proposals.<br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Magnetism; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Inorganic; Quantum Computing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This is particularly relevant for materials that are difficult or dangerous to handle or compounds that have not yet been created. Progress towards this goal has been limited as most work has concentrated on just one phase, often determined by particular applications. In the framework of the development of the Alexandria force field we present here new polarizable force fields for alkali halides with Gaussian charge distributions for molecular dynamics simulations. We explore different descriptions of the Van der Waals interaction, like the commonly applied 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ), and compare it to \\softer\" ones, such as 8-6 LJ, Buckingham and a modified Buckingham potential. Our results for physico-chemical properties of the gas, liquid and solid phase of alkali halides, are compared to experimental data and calculations with reference polarizable and non-polarizable force fields. The new polarizable force field that employs a modified Buckingham potential predicts the tested properties for gas, liquid and solid phases with a very good accuracy. In contrast to reference force fields, this model reproduces the correct crystal structures for all alkali halides at low and high temperature. Seeing that experiments with molten salts may be tedious due to high temperatures and their corrosive nature, the models presented here can contribute significantly to our understanding of alkali halides in general and melts in particular.<br />", "date": "2018-09-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The formation\nof MB aggregates can lead to an appearance of additional bands in the MB\nvisible absorption spectrum. This phenomenon is called metachromasy. In this\npaper, chitosan was used as adsorbent to study the kinetics and thermodynamic\nparameters related to the elimination of MB as single molecules (Sng-MB) and\naggregates (Agg-MB) species from simulated wastewater. It was found that, for\nMB single molecules or aggregates, the adsorption process follows the pseudo\nsecond order adsorption kinetics model. For each temperature studied, Agg-MB\nalways presented higher rate constant than Sng-MB, indicating a faster\nadsorption of Agg-MB in comparison to Sng-MB. \nAdditionally, the adsorption process presented a lower activation energy\nfor Agg-MB, indicating Agg-MB adsorption is favored in relation to Sng-MB. The\nthermodynamic studies indicated the adsorption process for both MB species is\nendothermic and spontaneous from 298 to 348 K. The adsorption isotherms could\nbe properly fitted and interpreted according to Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich\nmodels.

The surface charge in the monolayer was experimentally determined by monitoring the hydrated carboxylate stretching modes.

We examine a series of isoreticular, flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) of the type M(bim)<sub>2</sub> (SOD; M = Zn<sup> </sup>(ZIF-7), Co (ZIF-9), Cd (CdIF-13); bim<sup>\u2013</sup> = benzimidazolate), and elucidate the effects of metal substitution on the pressure-responsive phase changes and the resulting CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> step positions, pre-step uptakes, and step capacities. Using ZIF-7 as a benchmark, we reexamine the poorly understood structural transition responsible for its adsorption steps and, through high-pressure adsorption measurements, verify that it displays a step in its CH<sub>4 </sub>adsorption isotherms. The ZIF-9 material is shown to undergo an analogous phase change, yielding adsorption steps for CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> with similar profiles and capacities to ZIF-7, but with shifted threshold pressures. Further, the Cd<sup>2+</sup> analogue CdIF-13 is reported here for the first time, and shown to display adsorption behavior distinct from both ZIF-7 and ZIF-9, with negligible pre-step adsorption, a ~50% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> capacity, and dramatically higher threshold adsorption pressures. Remarkably, a single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase change to a pore-gated phase is also achieved with CdIF-13, providing insight into the phase change that yields step-shaped adsorption in these flexible ZIFs. Finally, we show that the endothermic phase change of these frameworks provides intrinsic heat management during gas adsorption. </p>", "date": "2018-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Inorganic Acid/Base Chemistry; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.); Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Independently from the relative solubilities of those solutes and complexes which determine their distribution between phases, the kinetics of phase transfer is impacted by the molecular interactions and structure of those species at the interface. A simple example includes the formation and extraction of water-extractant adducts observed in the ternary water/organic/tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) system. Despite its implications for LLE, a detailed description of the structural and dynamic mechanisms by which such adducts are formed at the interface is not established. Describing that process requires connecting the evolving interfacial molecular organization in the presence of surfactants to dynamic surface fluctuations and interfacial heterogeneity. Herein, molecular dynamics simulation is combined with state of the art network theory analysis to reveal features of interfacial structure and their relationship to the extraction of water in the water/n-hexane/TBP system. Surfactant adsorption enhances interfacial roughness which in turn causes directly interfacial water to become less connected through hydrogen bonding to subjacent layers, particularly upon formation of the water bridged TBP dimer adduct. Further, heterogeneity within the interface itself is enhanced by surfactant adsorption, and serves as the basis for the formation of protrusions of water into the organic phase at the extremes of surface fluctuations. These features disproportionately incorporate the water bridged TBP dimer and are the primary means by which water is transferred to the organic phase. This work presents for the first time a holistic understanding of how interfacial heterogeneity and spatial fluctuations become amplified in the presence of surfactants, enabling water extraction into the organic phase. It further affords the opportunity to study how solution conditions can control interfacial behavior to create more efficient solvent extraction systems.", "date": "2018-09-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An atomistic computational scheme needs treat at least part of the system quantum mechanically to include adsorption and reactions while the entire system is in thermal equilibrium. The experimentally relevant macroscopic control variables are temperature, electrode potential, choice of the solvent and ions and these need to be explicitly included in the computational model as well; this calls for an thermodynamic ensemble with fixed ion and electrode potentials. In this work a general framework within density functional theory with fixed electron and ion chemical potentials in the grand canonical ensemble is established for modelling electrocatalytic and electrochemical interfaces. Starting from a fully quantum mechanical description of nuclei and electrons, a systematic coarse-graining is employed to establish various computational schemes including i) the combination of classical and electronic density functional theories within the grand canonical ensemble and ii) on the simplest level a chemically and physically sound way to obtain the (modified) Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) implicit solvent model. The detailed and rigorous derivation clearly establishes which approximations are needed for coarse-graining as well as highlights which details and interactions are omitted in vein of computational feasibility. The transparent approximations also allow removing some the constraints and coarse-graining if needed. We implement various mPB models in the GPAW code and test their capabilities to model capacitance of electrochemical interfaces as well as study different approaches for modelling partly periodic charged systems.

The fluidity and conformational flexibilities of different MAs in the bacterial cell wall significantly influence its properties, function, and observed pathogenicity, thus a proper conformational description of different MAs in different environments (e.g. in vacuum, in solution, in monolayers) can inform about their potential role in the complex setup of the bacterial cell wall. Previously, we have shown that molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of MA folding <i>in vacuo</i>can be used to characterise MA conformers in seven groupings relating to bending at the functional groups (W, U and Z-conformations). Providing a new OPLS-based forcefield parameterisation for the critical cyclopropyl group of MAs and extensive simulations in explicit solvents (TIP4P water, hexane) we now present a more complete picture of MA folding properties together with improved simulation analysis techniques. We show that the \u2018WUZ\u2019 distance-based analysis can be used pinpoint conformers with hairpin bends at the functional groups, with these conformers constituting only a fraction of accessible conformations. Applying principle component analysis (PCA) and refinement using free energy landscapes (FELs), we are able to discriminate a complete and unique set of conformational preferences for representative alpha-, methoxy-, and keto-MAs, with overall preference for folded conformations. A control backbone-MA without any mero-chain functional groups showed significantly less folding in the mero-chain, confirming the role of functionalisation in directing folding. Keto-MA showed the highest percentage of WUZ-type conformations and, in particular, a tendency to fold at its alpha-methyl trans-cyclopropane group, in agreement with results from Villeneuve <i>et al.</i>MAs demonstrate similar folding in vacuum and water, with a majority of folded conformations around the W-conformation, although the molecules are more flexible in vacuum than in water. Exchange between conformations, with a disperse distribution that includes unfolded conformers, is common in hexane for all MAs, although with more organisation for Keto-MA. Globular, folded conformations are newly defined and may be specifically relevant in biofilms.</p>", "date": "2018-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Cell and Molecular Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Usually, the kinetics of enzyme reactions is simplified with singular perturbation analysis to derive rate or time course expressions valid under the quasi-steady-state and reactant stationary state assumptions. In this paper, the dynamical behavior of coupled enzyme catalyzed reaction mechanisms is studied by analysis of the phase-plane. We analyze two types of time-dependent slow manifolds - Sisyphus and Laelaps manifolds - that occur in the asymptotically autonomous vector fields that arise from enzyme coupled reactions. Projection onto slow manifolds yields various reduced models, and we present a geometric interpretation of the slow/fast dynamics that occur in the phase-planes of these reactions. <br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemical Analysis; Biophysical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We report the successful application of renewable, modified lignin-containing photopolymer resins in a commercial stereolithography system. Resins were fabricated within operable ranges for viscosity and cure properties, using up to 15% modified lignin by weight with the potential for higher amounts. A four-fold increase in ductility in cured parts with higher lignin concentration is noted as compared to commercial SLA resins. Excellent print quality was seen in modified lignin resins, with good layer fusion, high surface definition, and visual clarity. These materials can be used to generate new products for additive manufacturing applications and help fill vacant material property spaces, where ductility, sustainability, and application costs are critical.", "date": "2018-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biopolymers; Cellulosic materials; Polymer blends; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

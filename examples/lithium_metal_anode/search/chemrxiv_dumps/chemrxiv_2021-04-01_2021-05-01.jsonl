Here, we scrutinise the effects of thermally coupled solar water splitting on device efficiencies and catalyst footprint for sub-freezing ambient temperatures of -20C.

One solution is to provide students a customized operating system (e.g., Linux) that includes open-source software for supporting your teaching goals.

The approach involves affinity labeling of DNA-linked ligands to a protein target. Critically, the labeling event assesses ligand binding and enables subsequent pooling of several samples. Application of a purifying selection on the pool for protein-labeled DNAs allows detection of ligand binding by quantification of DNA barcodes.

First, we look at the enthalpic consequences and activation barriers of the first two steps of oligomerization by a Diels-Alder mechanism. The ca. 20 GPa difference in the synthetic pressures (furan lower) is explainable in terms of greater loss of aromaticity by the thiophene. Subsequent steps have understandably lower barriers.  We show explicitly how pressure affects the reaction profiles, operating through the volume decrease in the transition state and onward to the product molecule. The interesting option of polymerization proceeding in one or two directions opens up the possibility of polymers with two opposing and cumulative dipole moments.  The computed activation volumes are consistently more negative for likely initial furan (compared with thiophene) polymerization steps, in accord with the lower onset pressure of furan polymerization. In the second part of our study we examine the energetics of the likely polymers. Three ordered polymer structures compete in enthalpy -- a <i>syn</i> one, with all O/S on the same side, an <i>anti </i>one, S/O alternating, and a<i> syn-anti</i> isomer, with segments of four monomers repeating. The <i>syn</i> polymer, if not allowed to distort, is at high enthalpy relative to the other two. The origin of the destabilization is apparent, being S/O lone-pair repulsion, understandably greater for S than O at the 2.8/2.6\u00c5 separation. Set free, the <i>syn</i> isomers curve or arc, in two- or three-dimensional (helical) ways, whose energetics are traced in detail. The <i>syn</i> polymer can also stabilize itself by the thread twisting into zig-zag or helical enthalpic minima. Release of strain in a linear thread as the pressure is relaxed to 1 atm, with consequent thread curving, is a likely mechanism for the observed loss of crystalline order in the polymer as it is returned to ambient pressure.<br /></p>", "date": "2021-04-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Carbon-based Materials; Organic Polymers; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The orthogonal substitutions of a non-catalytic residue in the WPD-loops of YopH and PTP1B results in shifted pH-rate profiles, from an altered kinetic p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the nucleophilic cysteine. Compared to WT, the G352T YopH variant has a broadened pH-rate profile, similar activity at optimal pH, but significantly higher activity at low pH. Changes in the corresponding PTP1B T177G variant are more modest and in the opposite direction, with a narrowed pH profile and less activity in the most acidic range. Crystal structures of the variants show no structural perturbations, but suggest an increased preference for the WPD-loop closed conformation. Computational analysis confirms a shift in loop conformational equilibrium in favor of the closed conformation, arising from a combination of increased stability of the closed state and destabilization of the loop-open state. Simulations identify the origins of this population shift, revealing differences in the flexibility of the WPD-loop and neighboring regions.

Simultaneously, the SARS-COV-2 virus has a rapid mutation phenomenon, and somegene coding regions by mutation and recombination may be related to the drug resistance of the virus. Therefore, studying the relationship between the co-infection of bacteria and fungi and the evolution of SARS-COV-2 has important guiding significance for preventing a pandemic. We found that the SARS-COV-2 virus's nsp3 protein had a CRISPR/Cas 9 (II-B)-like function by searching for conserved domains. The system could target and edit the negative-strand RNA of SARS-COV-2. We speculated that the crRNA (CRISPR RNA) produced by the CRISPR/Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried the genetic information of the conserved domains of bacteriophages and Pseudomonas, including drug resistance. After the phage lysed the Pseudomonas, the crRNA was released and attached to the fungal spores, and then invaded the patient's cells along with the spores or hyphae. nsp3 synthesized and assembled 4Fe-4S, iron-containing molecules bound to the cas4 domain, in the mitochondria of phagocytes. The iron came from hemoglobin attacked by the SARS-COV-2 virus protein. The nsp3 protein bound the crRNA in the phagocytic cytoplasm. It targeted the negative-strand RNA of SARS-COV-2, inserting conserved domain gene fragments into the negative-strand RNA through editing and splicing. Since the Cas protein had no codon checking function, the cutting and splicing would destroy the protein-coding information in the original RNA coding region, causing mutation and recombination of the SARS-COV-2 virus genome. If crRNA carried the drug resistance gene fragments of bacteria or phage, SARS-COV-2 would have similar drug resistance. Because of the growing problem of drug resistance in COVID-19 patients, we should pay attention to preventing fungi and bacteria co-infection.

In the presence of multiple competitive reactions, it is possible to preferentially cage a reaction coordinate when the barrier frequencies for competing reaction paths are different.

Fundamental advances in this area are vital and present an unprecedented opportunity to both address disease states that have been resistant to other common modalities and improve the significant sustainability challenges associated with production of these complex molecules on a commercial scale. The advent of phosphoramidite coupling chemistry and solid-phase synthesis 40 years ago democratized oligonucleotide synthesis to the scientific community, paving the way for many of these stunning developments. The reliability and generality of this approach for the preparation of native phosphate-diesters is attributed to the high reactivity of phosphorus when in the P(III)-oxidation state versus the desired P(V), as it enables rapid P-heteroatom bond formation. However, the growing demand for more diverse phosphorus-based linkages has challenged the limits of this technology. For example, the phosphorothioate (PS) linkage, which stabilizes oligonucleotides towards nuclease cleavage, is universally employed in current oligonucleotide therapeutics but is generally incorporated in racemic form. Stereodefined PS oligonucleotides may have desirable biological and physical properties but are accessed with difficulty using phosphoramidite chemistry. Here we report a flexible and efficient [P(V)]-based platform that can install a wide variety of phosphate linkages at will into oligonucleotides. This approach uses readily accessible reagents and can efficiently install not only stereodefined or racemic thiophosphates, but can install any combination of (S, R or rac)-PS with native phosphodiester (PO2) and phosphorodithioate (PS2) linkages into DNA and other modified nucleotides. Importantly this platform easily accesses this diversity under a standardized coupling protocol with sustainably prepared, stable, P(V) reagents.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2021-04-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Importantly, the free energy difference is directly related to experimentally measurable quantities such as partition and adsorption coefficients, water activity and binding affinities. Among several techniques aimed at predicting the free-energy differences, perturbation approaches, involving alchemical transformation of one molecule into another through intermediate states, stand out as rigorous methods based on statistical mechanics. However, despite the importance of efficient and accurate free energy predictions, applicability of the perturbation approaches is still largely impeded by a number of challenges. This study aims at addressing two of them: 1) the definition of the perturbation path, i.e., alchemical changes leading to the transformation of one molecule to the other, and 2) determining the amount of sampling along the path to reach desired convergence. In particular, an automatic perturbation builder based on a graph matching algorithm is developed, that is able to identify the maximum common substructure of two molecules and provide the perturbation topologies suitable for free-energy calculations using GROMOS and GROMACS simulation packages. Moreover, it was used to calculate the changes in free energy of a set of post-translational modifications and analyze their convergence behavior. Different methods were tested, which showed that MBAR and extended thermodynamic integration (TI) in combination with MBAR show better performance as compared to BAR, extended TI with linear interpolation and plain TI. Also, a number of error estimators were explored and how they relate to the true error, estimated as the difference in free energy from an extensive set of simulation data. This analysis shows that most of the estimators provide only a qualitative agreement to the true error, with little quantitative predictive power. This notwithstanding, the preformed analyses provided insight into the convergence of free-energy calculations, which allowed for development of an iterative update scheme for perturbation simulations that aims at minimizing the simulation time to reach the convergence, i.e., optimizing the efficiency.

Notably, the primary method to obtain CMCs experimentally\u2014tensiometry\u2014is laborious and expensive. In this work, we show that graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) can predict CMCs directly from the surfactant molecular structure. Specifically, we developed a GCN architecture that encodes the surfactant structure in the form of a molecular graph and trained it using experimental CMC data. We found that the GCN can predict CMCs with higher accuracy than previously proposed methods and that it can generalize to anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, and nonionic surfactants. Molecular saliency maps revealed how atom types and surfactant molecular substructures contribute to CMCs and found this to be in agreement with physical rules that correlate constitutional and topological information to CMCs. Following such rules, we proposed a small set of new surfactants for which experimental CMCs are not available; for these molecules, CMCs predicted with our GCN exhibited similar trends to those obtained from molecular simulations. These results provide evidence that GCNs can enable high-throughput screening of surfactants with desired self-assembly characteristics.", "date": "2021-04-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we prepared As/P-based Zintl compounds, EuIn2As2-xPx (x = 0 to 2) and SrSn2As2, and examined their potential for use as thermoelectric materials. These compounds show hole carrier concentrations of ~10^19 /cm3 for EuIn2As2-xPx and ~10^21 /cm3 for SrSn2As2 at 300 K. The high carrier concentration of SrSn2As2 is likely owing to self-doping by hole-donating Sn vacancies. The electrical power factor reaches ~1 mW/mK2 at ~600 K for EuIn2As2-xPx with x = 0.1 and 0.2.

Here we report that irradiation of heptamethine cyanines provides pentamethine cyanines, which, in turn, are photoconverted to trimethine cyanines. We detail an examination of the mechanism and substrate scope of this remarkable two-carbon phototruncation reaction. Supported by computational analysis, we propose that this reaction involves a singlet oxygen-initiated multi-step sequence involving a key hydroperoxycyclobutanol intermediate. Building on this mechanistic framework, we identify conditions to improve the yield of photoconversion by over an order of magnitude. We then demonstrate that cyanine phototruncation can be applied to super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy, leading to improved spatial resolution with shorter imaging times.

Herein, we introduce one-dimensional (1D) SnO2-SiO2 core-shell nanowires (CSNWs). SnO2 nanowires (NWs) are synthesized by vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid deposition and the amorphous SiO2-shell layer with varying thicknesses (1.8-10.5 nm) was grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). SiO2-coated SnO2 CSNWs show lower baseline conductance as compared to the Pristine SnO2 NWs, due to an enhancement of the electron depletion layer. The SnO2-SiO2/N CSNWs (N representing the number of SiO 2 ALD cycles) sensors show a dramatic improvement of the selectivity towards hydrogen. Moreover, the sensing-response markedly depends on the thickness of the SiO2-shell layer and the working temperature. The SnO2-SiO2/60 CSNWs sensor (ca. 4.8 nm SiO2 shell thickness) was the best performing sensor in terms of selectivity and sensitivity exhibiting a response of 160 (ca. 7-folds higher than the pristine SnO2 NWs) towards 500 ppm of hydrogen at 500 \u00b0C with a lower detection limit at ppb-level (0.082 ppm). The selectivity and enhanced sensing-response are related to the masking effect of the SiO2 shell and an increased in the width of the electron depletion layer due to the strong electronic coupling between the SnO2 core and SiO2-shell layer, respectively. The remarkable sensing performances of the SnO2-SiO2/N CSNWs can be attributed to the homogeneous and conformal SiO2 shell layer by ALD,<br />electronic coupling between the core and the shell, the optimized shell thickness and high surface area provided by the 1D SnO2 NWs network.<br />", "date": "2021-04-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Sensors; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It has been shown computationally that this ring strain can be alleviated through the addition of two or more cyclopropane rings to the periphery, thereby creating theoretically aromatic structures. An alternative strategy to eliminating the issue of ring strain was demonstrated experimentally with the successful preparation of the highly aromatic 1,6-didehydro[10]annulene.

An atomic-level understanding of phosphate ester tribofilm formation mechanisms is required to improve their tribological performance. A process of particular interest is the thermal decomposition of phosphate esters on steel surfaces, since this initiates polyphosphate film formation. In this study, reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the thermal decomposition of phosphate esters with different substituents on several ferrous surfaces. The ReaxFF parameterisation was validated for a representative system using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. During the MD simulations on Fe 3 O 4 (001) and \u03b1-Fe(110), chemisorption interactions between the phosphate esters and the surfaces occur even at room temperature, and the number of molecule-surface bonds increases as the temperature increases from 300 to 1000 K. Conversely, on hydroxylated, amorphous Fe 3 O 4 , most of the molecules are physisorbed and some desorption occurs at high temperature. Thermal decomposition rates were much higher on Fe 3 O 4 (001) and particularly \u03b1-Fe(110) compared to hydroxylated, amorphous Fe 3 O 4. This suggests that water passivates ferrous surfaces and inhibits phosphate ester chemisorption, decomposition, and ultimately polyphosphate film formation. For the alkyl phosphates, thermal decomposition proceeds mainly through CO and C-H cleavage on Fe 3 O 4 (001). Aryl phosphates show much higher thermal stability, and decomposition on Fe 3 O 4 (001) only occurs through P-O and C-H cleavage, which require very high temperature. The onset temperature for CO cleavage on Fe 3 O 4 (001) increases as: tertiary alkyl < secondary alkyl < primary linear alkyl \u2248 primary branched alkyl < aryl. This order is consistent with experimental observations for the thermal stability of antiwear additives with similar substituents. The simulation results clarify a range of surface and substituent effects on the thermal decomposition of phosphate esters on steel that should be helpful for the design of new molecules with improved tribological performance.<br /></p><p></p>", "date": "2021-04-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A stable core with a fully accessible surface is of interest in fields such as catalysis and sensing. However, the stability of a charged nanoparticle core within the cavity of a charged thin shell remains largely unexplored. Liquid-cell (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (LC(S)TEM) is an ideal technique to probe the core-shell interactions at nanometer spatial resolution. Here we show by means of calculations and experiments that these interactions are highly tunable. We found that in dilute solutions adding a monovalent salt led to stronger confinement of the core to the middle of the geometry. In deionized water the Debye length becomes comparable to the shell radius R<sub>shell</sub>, leading to a less steep electric potential gradient and a reduced core-shell interaction, which can be detrimental to the stability of nanorattles. For a salt concentration range of 0.5-250mM the repulsion was relatively long-ranged due to the concave geometry of the shell. At salt concentrations of 100 and 250mM the core was found to move almost exclusively near the shell wall, which can be due to hydrodynamics, a secondary minimum in the interaction potential or a combination of both. The possibility of imaging nanoparticles inside shells at high spatial resolution with liquid-cell electron microscopy makes rattle particles a powerful experimental model system to learn about nanoparticle interactions. Additionally, our results highlight the possibilities for manipulating the interactions between core and shell that could be used in future applications.</div>", "date": "2021-04-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Several ion force field parameters are used in the simulations and new parameters are proposed for some ions to better describe their hydration free energy. Such a theoretical framework enables the calculation of some single-ion properties, such as heat of transport, Soret coefficient and mass current density, as well as properties of salts, such as effective mass and thermal diffusion, Soret and Seebeck coefficients. These calculated properties are compared with experimental data available from optical measurements and showed good agreement revealing an excellent theoretical predictability of salt thermodiffusion properties. Differences in single-ion Soret and self-diffusion coefficients of anions and cations give rise to a thermoelectric field, which affects the system response that is quantified by the Seebeck coefficient. The fast and slow Seebeck coefficients are calculated and discussed, resulting in values with mV/K order-of-magnitude, as observed in experiments involving several salts, such as K+Cl\u2212, Na+Cl\u2212, H+Cl\u2212, Na+OH\u2212, TMA+OH\u2212 and TBA+OH\u2212.

By mechanistic investigations into the KAT ligation, including kinetic studies, X-ray crystallography, and DFT calculations, we have identified a key role for a proton in accelerating the ligation. We applied this knowledge to the design and synthesis of 8-quinolyl acyltrifluoroborates, a new class of KATs that ligates with hydroxylamines at pH 7.4 with rate constants >4 M-1 s-1. We trace the enhanced rate at physiological pH to unexpectedly high basicity of the 8-quinoline-KATs, which leads to their protonation even under neutral conditions. This proton assists the formation of the key tetrahedral intermediate and activates the leaving groups on the hydroxylamine towards a concerted 1,2-BF3shift that leads to the amide product.

We carried out a backbone residue scan and show that amide N-amination completely abolishes the tendency of these peptides to self-aggregate, rendering them soluble mimics of ordered b-strands from the tau R2 and R3 domains.

The release of DA from liposomes presents a longer release time compared to 5-HT. Modelling the release time showed that DA filled vesicles had a higher percentage of events where the time for the peak fall was better fit to a double exponential (DblExp) decay function, suggesting multiple kinetic steps in the release. By fitting to a desorption-release model, where the transmitters adsorbed to the vesicle membrane, the dissociation rates of DA and 5-HT from liposome membrane were estimated. DA has a lower desorption rate constant, which leads to slower DA release than that observed for 5-HT, whereas there is little difference in pore size.

Understanding the mechanisms of protein oligomerization/dimerization would allow one to elucidate how these complexes participate in biological activities and could ultimately lead to new approaches in designing novel therapeutic agents. However, determining the exact association pathways and structures of such complexes remains a challenge. Here, we use parallel tempering metadynamics simulations in the well-tempered ensemble to evaluate the performance of Martini 2.2P and Martini open-beta 3 (Martini 3) force fields in reproducing the structure and energetics of the dimerization process of membrane proteins and proteins in an aqueous solution in reasonable accuracy and throughput. We find that Martini 2.2P systematically overestimates the free energy of association by estimating large barriers in distinct areas, which likely leads to overaggregation when multiple monomers are present. In comparison, the less viscous Martini 3 results in a systematic underestimation of the free energy of association for proteins in solution, while it performs well in describing the association of membrane proteins. In all cases the near-native dimer complexes are identified as minima in the free energy surface albeit not always as the lowest minima. In the case of Martini 3 we find that the spurious supramolecular protein aggregation present in Martini 2.2P multimer simulations is alleviated and thus this force field may be more suitable for the study of protein oligomerization. We propose that the use of enhanced sampling simulations with a refined coarse-grained force field and appropriately defined collective variables is a robust approach for studying the protein dimerization process, although one should be cautious of the ranking of energy minima.</p>", "date": "2021-04-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Normally, the initial gel formation by rapid gelation leads to a kinetically trapped structure with low controllability. Through a controlled post-synthetic aging process, we show that it is possible to tune the network of the linked MOP gel over multiple length scales. This process allows control on the molecular-scale rearrangement of interlinking MOPs, mesoscale fusion of colloidal particles and macroscale densification of the whole colloidal network. In this work we elucidate the relationships between the gel properties, such as porosity and rheology, and their hierarchical structures, which suggest that porosity measurement can be used as a powerful tool to characterize the microscale structural transition of the amorphous gels.

However, the efficient chemical synthesis of LA modules and derivatives is hindered by complications, many arising from the high abundance of aspartic acid and consequent aspartimide formation. Here, we report a robust, efficient and general applicable chemical synthesis route for accessing such LA modules, demonstrated by the synthesis and folding of the LA3 and LA4 modules of the Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor, as well as a heterodimeric LA3-LA4 constructed by chemical ligation.

As a result, low-energy electronic spectra of solution-phase chromophores often contain tens to hundreds of spurious charge-transfer states, making LR-TDDFT needlessly expensive in bulk solution.   Intensity borrowing by these spurious states can affect intensities of the valence excitations, altering electronic bandshapes. At higher excitation energies, it is difficult to distinguish spurious charge-transfer states from genuine charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) excitations. In this work, we introduce an automated diabatization that enables fast and effective screening of the CTTS acceptor space in bulk solution. Our procedure introduces ``natural charge-transfer orbitals'' that provide a means to isolate orbitals that are most likely to participate in a CTTS excitation. Projection of these orbitals onto solvent-centered virtual orbitals provides a criterion for defining the most important solvent molecules in a given excitation and be used as an automated subspace selection algorithm for projection-based embedding of a high-level description of the CTTS state in a lower-level description of its environment.  We apply this method to  an <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics trajectory of I<sup>-</sup>(aq) and report the lowest-energy CTTS band in the absorption spectrum.

The use of these innovative solvents has shown to improve the reaction effectiveness, giving excellent yields. NADESs proved to be \u201cactive\u201d in these transformations for the absence of added bases in all the performed reactions and in several cases, for their reducing capabilities. The reactions outcomes were rationalized by DFT calculations which demonstrated the involvement of H-bonds between DESs and alkynes as well as a stabilization of copper catalytic intermediates. The green experimental conditions, namely the absence of a base, the low temperatures, the lowering of reagents and the possibility of recycling of the green solvents, outline the great potential of NADESs for CuAAc and in general, for green organic synthesis. </p>", "date": "2021-04-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Natural Products; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We used FrD-LVC parametrized with TD-DFT calculations, adopting either CAM-B3LYP or \u03c9B97X-D functionals, to study the ultrafast photoexcited QD of a Guanine-Cytosine (GC) hydrogen bonded pair, within a Watson-Crick arrangement, considering up to 12 coupled diabatic electronic states and the effect of all the 99 vibrational coordinates. The bright excited states localized on C and, especially, on G are predicted to be strongly coupled to the G->C CT state which is efficiently and quickly populated after an excitation to any of the four lowest energy bright local excited states. Our QD simulations show that more than 80% of the excited population on G and ~50% of that on C decays to this CT state in less than 50 fs. We investigate the role of vibronic effects in the population of the CT state and show it depends mainly on its large reorganization energy so that it can occur even when it is significantly less stable than the bright states in the Franck-Condon region.

Calculated adsorption energies, competitive adsorption with co-existing species, energy decomposition analyses (ALMO-EDA),  implicitly/explicitly solvated geometries, and adsorption free energies provide deep insights  into the adsorption mechanism as well as the origin of the strong selectivity sorption ability. The PhosO nanoadsorbents establish inner-sphere surface complexes with arsenicals even under competition with water molecules. These proposed structures also show a strong affinity with the highly mobile As(III), where energy saving is achieved by avoiding the pre oxidation process to convert As(III) into As(V) as requested in related materials. Results show that electrostatic driving forces govern the adsorption of neutral arsenicals, while the interplay between electrostatic and polarization phenomena drives the uptake of anionic arsenicals. By computing the adsorption strength as a function of the oxidation degree, the optimum adsorption efficiency is reached with a 25% in the content of oxidizing groups. In this oxidation degree, the strong repulsive surface charge at high pH turns the PhosO nanoadsorbents convenient to recycle via simple treatment with alkaline eluents. Finally, the adsorption ability remains thermodynamically allowed in a wide range of ambient temperatures (enthalpically governed reaction).

Titanium osseointegration is partially related to its capability to form a TiO<sub>2</sub> surface layer and its ability to interact with key endogenous proteins immediately upon implantation, establishing the first bone-biomaterial interface. Surgical trauma caused by implantation results in the release of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein, which is a prototypic DAMP (Damage Associated Molecular Pattern) with multiple roles in inflammation and tissue healing. To develop different surface strategies that improve the clinical outcome of titanium-based implants by controlling their biological activity, a molecular-scale understanding of HMGB1-surface interactions is desired. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations to provide direct insight into the HMGB1 interactions and the possible molecular arrangements of HMGB1 on fully hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated rutile (110) TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces. The results establish that HMGB1 is most likely to be adsorbed directly onto the surface regardless of surface hydroxylation, which is undesirable because it could affect its biological activity by causing structural changes to the protein.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov State Model (MSM) approaches provide a powerful way to understand complex conformational change that occurs over long timescales. Consideration of such dynamics are important for the design of therapeutic peptidomimetic ligands, whose affinity and binding mechanism are dictated by a combination of folding and binding. To examine the role of preorganization in peptide binding to protein targets, we performed massively parallel explicit-solvent MD simulations of cyclic \u03b2-hairpin ligands designed to disrupt the MDM2-p53 interaction. MSM analysis of over 3 ms of aggregate trajectory data enabled us to build a detailed mechanistic model of coupled folding and binding of four cyclic peptides which we compare to experimental binding affinities and rates. The results show a striking relationship between the relative preorganization of each ligand in solution and its affinity for MDM2. Specifically, changes in peptide conformational populations predicted by the MSMs suggest that entropy loss upon binding is the main factor influencing affinity. The MSMs also enable detailed examination of non-native interactions which lead to misfolded states, and comparison of structural ensembles with experimental NMR measurements. In contrast to an MSM study of p53 TAD binding to MDM2, MSMs of cyclic \u03b2-hairpin binding show a conformational selection mechanism.

Although deep learning has achieved breakthrough in drug discovery, most of its applications only focus on a single drug target to generate drug-like active molecules in spite of the reality that drug molecules often interact with more than one target which can have desired (polypharmacology) or undesired (toxicity) effects. In a previous study we proposed a new method named <i>DrugEx</i> that integrates an exploration strategy into RNN-based reinforcement learning to improve the diversity of the generated molecules. Here, we extended our <i>DrugEx</i> algorithm with multi-objective optimization to generate drug molecules towards more than one specific target (two adenosine receptors, A<sub>1</sub>AR and A<sub>2A</sub>AR, and the potassium ion channel hERG in this study). In our model, we applied an RNN as the <i>agent</i> and machine learning predictors as the <i>environment</i>, both of which were pre-trained in advance and then interplayed under the reinforcement learning framework. The concept of evolutionary algorithms was merged into our method such that <i>crossover</i> and <i>mutation</i> operations were implemented by the same deep learning model as the <i>agent</i>. During the training loop, the agent generates a batch of SMILES-based molecules. Subsequently scores for all objectives provided by the <i>environment</i> are used for constructing Pareto ranks of the generated molecules with non-dominated sorting and Tanimoto-based crowding distance algorithms. Here, we adopted GPU acceleration to speed up the process of Pareto optimization. The final reward of each molecule is calculated based on the Pareto ranking with the ranking selection algorithm. The agent is trained under the guidance of the reward to make sure it can generate more desired molecules after convergence of the training process. All in all we demonstrate generation of compounds with a diverse predicted selectivity profile toward multiple targets, offering the potential of high efficacy and lower toxicity.</p>", "date": "2021-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ortega", "abstract": "Hybrid materials formed by carbon fullerenes and layered materials have emerged due to their advantages for several technological applications, and phosphorene arises as a promising two-dimensional semiconductor for C60 adsorption. However, the properties of phosphorenefullerene hybrids remain mainly unexplored. In this work, we employed density functional theory to obtain structures, adsorption energies, electronic/optical properties, binding (AIM, NBO), and energy decomposition analyses (ALMO-EDA) of nanostructures formed by phosphorene and fullerenes (C24 to C70). We find fullerenes form covalent and non-covalent complexes with phosphorene depending on the molecular size, showing remarkable stability even in solution. Two classes of covalent complexes arise by cycloaddition-like reactions: the first class, where short-range effects (charge-transfer and polarization) determines the stability; and the second one, where short-range effects decay to avoid steric repulsion, and balanced longrange forces (electrostatics and dispersion) favors the stability. Otherwise, high-size fullerenes (C50 to C70) only form non-covalent complexes due to strong repulsion at shorter intermolecular distances and lack of dissociation barriers. In terms of electronic properties, fullerenes act as mild p-dopants for phosphorene, increasing its polar character and ability to acquire induced dipole moments (polarizability). Also, small energy-bandgap fullerenes (<0.8 eV) largely increase the phosphorene metallic character. We also note fullerenes retain their donor/acceptor properties upon adsorption, acting as active sites for orbital-controlled interactions and maximizing the phosphorene light absorbance at the UV-Vis region. Finally, we strongly believe our study will inspire future experimental/theoretical studies focused on phosphorene-fullerene uses for storage, anode materials, sensing, phosphorene bandgap engineering, and optoelectronics.<br />", "date": "2021-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Aggregates and Assemblies; Alloys; Carbon-based Materials; Composites; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Optical Materials; Photosensitizers; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Previously reported analyses in the literature of the kinetics of the various processes occurring in a TADF material rely on several a priori assumptions to estimate the rate constants for forward and reverse intersystem crossing (ISC and RISC, respectively). In this report, we demonstrate a method to determine these rate constants using a three-state model together with a steady-state approximation and, importantly, no additional assumptions.

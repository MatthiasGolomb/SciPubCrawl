Computer simulations that investigate the structure and dynamics of these molecules are powerful tools for understanding and manipulating their physical properties. Despite the progress made towards predictive modeling, many physicochemical aspects remain elusive. Modeling the structural dynamics of RNA is particularly challenging, owing mostly to the flexible, polyanionic backbone and the many polarizable moieties. Several empirical all-atom RNA force fields (FFs) have been developed over the last two decades to address this challenge, albeit with limited reported success. In addition, the sampling profile of such FFs has rarely been explored in detail for RNAs larger than tetranucleotides. This study addresses this issue by benchmarking four state-of-the-art FFs against four full-sequence RNA hairpins, of varying conformational stability, that incorporate a wide range of structural characteristics. Mutli-\u03bcs enhanced sampling simulations, starting from distinct and independent conformations, generated well-converged ensembles of loop conformations, enabling an accurate assessment of FF performance. Beyond the robust description of loop conformations, backbone dihedrals, sugar puckers, and contact profiles were thoroughly analyzed and compared to experimental data. Overall, none of the studied FFs was found to quantitatively agree with the available NMR ensembles. Despite this discrepancy, we propose that some FFs might be more appropriate when non-canonical base-pairing or base-backbone interactions are involved. Lastly, we note that different FFs sample significantly different conformational spaces for most cases, making the choice of an appropriate RNA FF non-trivial.", "date": "2023-11-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, achieving high conversion over a wide operating temperature range while avoiding over-oxidation to NOx is a significant challenge. Commercial Pt catalysts have full NH3 conversion at low temperatures but suffer from low N2 selectivity. To mitigate this challenge, it is crucial to limit the over-oxidation of NH3. In this study, we developed a bi-metal surface catalyst with improved Pt atom efficiency. The PtSCuO/Al2O3 catalyst consists of Pt atoms on the surface of CuO nanoparticles. It achieves full NH3 conversion at 250 \u00b0C with WHSV of 600 mlNH3h-1g-1 which is 50 \u00b0C lower than the commercial Pt/Al2O3, and maintains high N2 selectivity through all temperature window (150-450 \u00b0C). At 200 \u00b0C, PtSCuO/Al2O3, exhibited a staggering 30-fold increase in activity compared to the commercial Pt/Al2O3. Operando XAFS studies reveal that the surface Pt atoms in PtSCuO/Al2O3 not only enhance the redox ability of Cu species but also alter the redox rate of Cu species, which improves the while reaction rate of the NH3-SCO reaction. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Pt sites and Cu sites in PtSCuO/Al2O3 contributes to improved selectivity via the internal selective catalytic reduction (i-SCR) route.

Cyclic amines/amides/imides are effective precursor of N-halogenated amines/amides/imides. Such N-halogenated compounds are found to be effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria such as, E. coli and S. aureus. Henceforth cyanuric acid and 5,5-dimethyl hydantoin were selected as representative precursor of such amide/imides that could be halogenated and provide antimicrobial performance. The polymer PES was introduced with side chain of primary amine. Further this primary amine was converted to secondary amine with novel modification containing cyanuric chloride. It was further modified to cyanuric acid as a desired precursor of N-halamide/imide. The PES-modified -cyanuric acid (PESmCA) was characterized using IR, NMR, XRD and SEM. While two novel monomers containing hydantoin as a branch extending from the ethyl group chain; belonging to norbornene dicarboximide and oxonorbornene dicarboximide, were successfully synthesize and characterized using IR, NMR and HRMS techniques. Further these monomers were polymerized via ring opening metathesis polymerization reaction into novel polymers of P(NDH) and P(ONDH). The polymer\u2019s olefinic bonds were saturated to s-P(NDH) and s-P(ONDH). The unsaturated and saturated polymers were characterized through IR, NMR, and SLS techniques. The saturated polymers and the modified PES were fabricated into membranes and characterized via SEM and contact angle measurement. The membrane performance tests were conducted using pure water permeance and BSA protein rejection tests. The membranes were chlorinated and rinsed to remove adsorbed active chlorine. The rinsed membranes were characterized with IR providing respective N-Cl peak in range of 721-719 cm-1. The unwanted chlorine release into the water assembly was not observed provided that the respective polymers had covalently stable cyclic N-Cl moieties. Membranes were challenged against 106CFU/ml of bacteria (E.coli and S.aureus) in static agar test and dead end filtration tests. The membranes provided 100% inhibition of bacteria E. coli and S. aureus upon surface contact in agar plate test. The respective membranes were also suitable for dead end filtration pressure assisted bacterial flow test. The test provided 99-100 % kill of both bacteria.

A variety of methods were used by participants to submit binding free energy predictions. A machine learning approach based on molecular descriptors achieved the highest accuracy (RMSE of 2.04 kcal/mol) among ranked methods in the WP6 dataset. Interestingly, predictions for WP6 obtained via docking tended to outperform all methods (RMSE of 1.70 kcal/mol), most of which are MD based and computationally more expensive. In general, methods applying force fields achieved better correlation with experiments for WP6 opposed to the machine learning and docking models. In the cyclodextrin-phenothiazine challenge, the ATM approach emerged as the top performing method with RMSE less than 1.86 kcal/mol. Correlation metrics of ranked methods in this dataset was relatively poor compared to WP6. We also highlight several lessons learned to guide future work and help improve studies on the systems discussed. For example, WP6 may be present in other microstates other than its -12 state in the presence of certain guests. Machine learning approaches can be used to fine tune or help train force fields for certain chemistry (i.e WP6-G4). Certain phenothiazines occupy distinct primary and secondary orientations, some of which were considered individually for accurate binding free energies. The accuracy of predictions from certain methods while starting from a single binding pose/orientation demonstrate the sensitivity of calculated binding free energies to the orientation, and in some cases the likely dominant orientation for the system. Computational and experimental results suggest that guests phenothiazine core traverses both secondary and primary faces of the cyclodextrin hosts, bulky catioinic side chain will primarily occupy the primary face, and the phenothiazine core substituent resides at the larger secondary face.", "date": "2023-11-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In addition, this formulation has the capacity to inhibit the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cascade namely the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) pathways. This not only provides new avenue for nanotherapy of inflammatory diseases but enhances our fundamental knowledge of the role of nanoMOF based nanomedicine in the regulation of innate immune signaling.

To measure the presence of an analyte, they are conjugated to a recognition unit and convert a substrate into a (colored) product that is detectable by visible (VIS) light. Thus, the lowest enzymatic turnover that can be detected sets a limit on sensitivity. Here, we report that substrates and products of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and \u03b2-galactosidase change the near-infrared (NIR, 800-2400 nm) fluorescence of (bio)polymer modified single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Therefore, SWCNTs translate a VIS signal into a beneficial NIR signal. Moreover, the affinity of the nanosensors cause a higher effective local concentration of the reactants for the optical measurement. This leads to a non-linear sensor-based signal amplification and translation (SENSAT). We find signal enhancement up to \u2248 120x for the HRP substrate p-phenylenediamine (PPD), which means that reactions below the limit of detection in the VIS can be followed in the NIR (\u2248 1000 nm). The approach is also applicable to other substrates such as 3,3\u2019-5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and direct observation of the HRP reaction.  An adsorption-based theoretical model fits the observed signals and corroborates the sensor-based enhancement mechanism. This approach amplifies signals, translates them into the NIR and increases sensitivity of biochemical assays.", "date": "2023-11-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Biochemical Analysis; Spectroscopy (Anal.

This study proposes an innovative alchemical path that utilizes an advanced polarizable atomic multipole force field to predict crystal structures based on sampling from the NPT ensemble. The use of alchemical (i.e., nonphysical) intermediates, a novel Monte Carlo barostat, and an orthogonal space tempering bias combine to enhance sampling of the deposition/sublimation phase transition and promote an efficient search.

In this work, we introduce an active learning (AL) framework for our recently developed machine-learning based adaptable bond topology (MLABT) model that uses datasets generated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations that are both minimalistic and informative. Employing MLABT integrated with AL and DFT, we explore fracture behavior in highly crosslinked thermosets, assessing the variations in fracture behavior induced by system temperature, temperature fluctuations, strain rate, cooling rate, and degree of crosslinking. Notably, we discover that while fracture is minimally affected by temperature, it is strongly influenced by strain rate, suggesting the absence of the time-temperature superposition in thermoset plasticity. Furthermore, while the structural disparities introduced by different network annealing rates influence the elastic properties, they are inconsequential for thermoset fracture. In contrast, network topology emerges as the dominant determinant of fracture, influencing both the ultimate strain and stress.

Illuminating the interactions between MPs and heavy metals (HMs) is crucial for understanding the transport and fate of HM-loaded MPs in specific environmentally relevant scenarios.  Herein, the adsorption of copper (Cu2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions over poly-ethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particulates before and after heat persulfate oxidation (HPO) treatment was comprehensively evaluated in simulated swine wastewater.  The effects of intrinsic properties (i.e., degree of weathering, size, type) of MPs and environmental factors (i.e., pH, ionic strength, and co-occurring species) on adsorption were investigated thoroughly.  It was observed that HPO treatment expedites the fragmentation of pristine MPs, and renders MPs with a variety of oxygen-rich functional groups, which are likely to act as new active sites for binding both HMs.  The adsorption of both HMs is pH- and ionic strength-dependent at a pH of 4 to 6.  Co-occurring species such as humic acid (HA) and tetracycline (TC) appear to enhance the affinity of both aged MPs for Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions via bridging complexation.  However, co-occurring nutrient species (e.g., phosphate and ammonia) demonstrate different impacts on the adsorption, improving uptake of Cu2+ by precipitation while lowering affinity for Zn2+ owing to the formation of soluble zinc-ammonia complex.  Spectroscopic analysis indicates that the dominant adsorption mechanism mainly involves electrostatic interactions and surface complexation.  These findings provided fundamental insights into the interactions between aged MPs and HMs in an environmentally rele-vant scenario (i.e., simulated swine wastewater).", "date": "2023-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Hydrology and Water Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Subsequently, the distinct GAFF (General AMBER Force Field) descriptors and RDkit descriptors of the compounds were generated and then applied to train various prediction models with a variety of machine learning algorithms for both properties respectively. As a result, both GAFF and RDkit descriptors yielded various robust models with low average percent errors (APE), low root-mean-square errors (RMSE) and high correlation coefficients R-square, while RDkit showed slightly better performance for predicting both properties. We further optimized top models and conducted parallel feature analysis (PFA) to identify specific features in each descriptor which outstandingly contributed to model robustness. The final model RMSE is 0.071 g/cm3 for density prediction and 0.014 for nD prediction, the APE value is as low as 2.845% for density and 0.531% for nD, and R-square is 0.950 for density and 0.954 for nD.

At the heart of this phenomenon is the light-induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri-aryloxy-substituted quinones resulting in ana-quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana-isomer.

An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner (3\u20137). The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons (8). This process has already been used widely for catalytic reductions; however, limitations towards strong bonds and electron rich substrates remain (9,10). Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant. Here, we introduce triple-photoinduced electron transfer catalysis, termed tri-PET, enabled by the three-photon uptake of a dye molecule leading to an excited dianionic super-reductant which is more potent than Li metal (11) \u2013 one of the strongest chemical reductants known. Irradiation of the metal-free catalyst by violet light enables the cleavage of strong carbon-fluoride bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron-rich substrates.

To fill this gap, we investigated the effects of conjugating Cyt c and a zinc(II) porphyrin (Zn Porph) to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to detect structural conformational changes in Cyt c upon conjugation and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to identify protein orientation. Cyt c was predicted to have different orientations depending on the size of AuNPs and methods used to conjugate the protein, it was hypothesised that the orientation of Cyt c may influence the redox properties of the protein. The electrochemical properties of Cyt c were assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).  We used DPV-based  to determine the heterogeneous rate constant (k0). The results show a lower k0 for conjugated Cyt c than free Cyt c, likely due to structural changes in the protein. The spatial orientation of Cyt c had minimal influence on k0, while ligand density and AuNP size had an effect. The k0 value of Zn Porph did not decrease on conjugation. Despite these changes, Cyt c and Zn Porph maintained their electrochemical capabilities after conjugation.", "date": "2023-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Scale-up and use in natural waters with high PFAS concentrations has hitherto posed a problem.

Finding innovative materials is key to advancing research areas for sustainable energy conversion, such as electrocatalysis. Artificial intelligence (AI)-guided optimization bears great potential to autonomously learn from data and plan new experiments, identifying a global optimum significantly faster than traditional design of experiment approaches. Furthermore, it is vital to incorporate essential electrocatalyst features such as activity and stability into the optimization campaign to screen for a truly high-performing material. In this study, a multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) was used in conjunction with an experimental high-throughput (HT) pipeline to refine the composition of a non-noble Co-Mn-Sb-Sn-Ti oxide toward its activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid. The viability of the MOBO algorithm was verified on a gathered data set, and an acceleration of 17x was achieved in subsequent experimental screening compared to a hypothetical grid search scenario. During the ML-driven assessment, Mn-rich compositions were critical to designing high-performing OER catalysts, while Ti incorporation into MnOx triggered an improved activity after short accelerated stress tests. To examine this finding further, an operando mass spectrometry technique was used to probe the evolution of activity, metal dissolution, and surface area over 3 h of operation. This work demonstrates the importance of respecting the multiobjective nature in electrocatalyst performance during HT campaigns.

However recently, several groups have popularized the idea of predicting activation energies directly, based on nothing more than the reactant and product graphs, a sufficiently complex neural network, and a broad enough dataset. Here, we have revisited this task using the recently developed Reaction Graph Depth 1 (RGD1) transition state dataset and several newly developed graph attention architectures.

However, in pristine ZGNRs, the spin polarized transmission is not observed due to symmetric anti-parallel distributions of the spin densities between the edges. Here, the hypothesis is, any physical or chemical process that breaks such anti-parallel spin-symmetry can induce spin-polarized transmission in the ZGNRs. In this work, we have established this proof-of-concept by depositing the trimethylenemethane (TMM) radical on 6ZGNRH and investigating the quantum transport properties by employing the density functional theory in conjunction with nonequilibrium Green\u2019s function (DFT-NEGF) method. Although TMM has a high magnetic moment (2 \u00b5B ), it does not induce magnetization in 6ZGNRH when TMM is physisorbed. But, during the chemisorption of TMM, it forms the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 bond with the 6ZGNRH in a particular geometric configuration where the pz orbitals of carbon atoms of TMM have maximum overlap with the pz orbitals of carbon atoms of 6ZGNRH. The chemisorption of TMM transfers the spin moment to 6ZGNRH, which breaks the edge spin-symmetry of pristine 6ZGNRH. The adsorption of TMM radical results in transmission dips in the transmission spectra due to interference between localized states of TMM and 6ZGNRH states.

However, assessment of processes involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenchers and sensitizers indicated that singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical do significantly contribute to the degradation of 6PPDQ. Investigation of these processes in natural lake waters indicated no difference in attenuation rates for direct photochemical processes at 20 \u00b0C. This suggests that direct photochemical degradation will dominate in warm waters while indirect photochemical pathways will dominate in cold waters, involving ROS mediated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Overall, the aquatic photodegradation rate of 6PPDQ will be strongly influenced by the compounding effects of environmental factors such as light screening and temperature on both direct and indirect photochemical processes. Transformation products were identified via UHPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry, revealing four major processes: 1) oxidation and cleavage of the quinone ring in the presence of ROS, 2) dealkylation, 3) rearrangement, and 4) deamination. These data indicate that 6PPDQ can photodegrade in cool, sunlit waters under the appropriate conditions: t1/2 = 17.4 h \u2013 no observable decrease (direct); t1/2 = 5.2 \u2013 11.2 h (indirect, CDOM)", "date": "2023-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Hydrology and Water Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previous studies reported that OC patients have significantly higher levels of La protein expression in their serum than healthy individuals, which is related to the poor response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Inhibiting La protein could control the expression of the potential downstream genes involved in promoting proliferation and chemotherapy resistance to OC, which could serve as a therapeutic intervention in treating OC.

One challenge in the manufacture of plasma protein therapies is the removal of salt ions (e.g., sodium, phosphate, and chloride) from the protein solution. The conventional approach to remove salt ions is the use of diafiltration membranes (e.g., tangential flow filtration) and ion-exchange chromatography. However, the ion-exchange resins within the chromatographic column, as well as filtration membranes, are subject to fouling by the plasma protein. In this work, we investigate membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) as an alternative separation platform for removing ions from plasma protein solutions with negligible protein loss. MCDI has been previously deployed for brackish water desalination, nutrient recovery, mineral recovery, and removing pollutants from water. However, this is the first time this technique has been applied for removing 28% of ions (sodium, chloride, and phosphate) from human serum albumin solutions with less than 3% protein loss from the process stream. Furthermore, the MCDI experiments utilized highly conductive poly(phenylene alkylene) based ion exchange membranes (IEMs). These IEMs combined with ionomer coated nylon meshes in the spacer channel ameliorate ohmic resistances in MCDI improving energy efficiency. Overall, we envision MCDI as an effective separation platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing for deionizing plasma protein solutions and other pharmaceutical formulations without loss of active pharmaceutical ingredients.

In contrast, family 1 glycosyltransferase (GT1) enzymes can glycosylate virtually any given nucleophilic group with perfect control over stereochemistry and regioselectivity. However, the appropriate catalyst for a given reaction needs to be identified among the tens of thousands of available sequences. Here, we present the Glycosyltransferase Acceptor Specificity Predictor (GASP) model, a data-driven approach to the identification of reactive GT1:acceptor pairs. We trained a random forest-based acceptor predictor on literature data and validated it on independent in-house generated data on 1001 GT1:acceptor pairs, obtaining an AUROC of 0.79 and a balanced accuracy of 72%. GASP is capable of parsing all known GT1 sequences, as well as all chemicals, the latter through a pipeline for the generation of 153 chemical features for a given molecule taking the CID or SMILES as input (freely available at https://github.com/degnbol/GASP). GASP had an 83% hit rate in a comparative case study for the glycosylation of the anti-helminth drug niclosamide, significantly outperforming a hit rate of 53% from a random selection assay. However, it was unable to compete with a hit rate of 83% for the glycosylation of the plant defensive compound DIBOA using expert-selected enzymes, with GASP achieving a hit rate of 50%. The hierarchal importance of the generated chemical features was investigated by negative feature selection, revealing properties related to cyclization and atom hybridization status to be the most important characteristics for accurate prediction.

Among them, ABCB1, also known as MDR-1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is the most characterized. By exporting xenobiotics out of the cell, P-gp activity can affect the ADME properties of several drugs. Moreover, P-gp has been found to mediate multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Thus, the inhibition of P-gp activity may lead to increased absorption and/or intracellular accumulation of co-administered drugs, enhancing their effectiveness. Using the human cryoEM 3D structure of the P-gp in the inhibitor-bound intermediate form (PDBID: 6qee), approximately 200'000 commercially available natural compounds from the ZINC database were virtually screened. To build a model able to discriminate between substrate and inhibitors, two datasets of compounds with known activity, including P-gp inhibitors, substrates, and inactive molecules were also docked. The best docking pose of selected substrates and inhibitors were used to generate 3D common feature pharmacophoric models that were combined with the Autodock Vina binding energy values to prioritize compounds for visual inspection. With this consensus approach, 13 potential candidates were identified and then tested for their ability to inhibit P-gp, using zosuquidar, a P-gp inhibitor of clinical use, as a reference drug. Eight compounds were found to be active with 6 of them having an IC50 lower than 5 \u00b5M in a membrane-based ATPase activity assay. Moreover, the P-gp inhibitory activity was also confirmed by two different cell-based in vitro methods. These results demonstrate the ability of the combined structure-based pharmacophore modeling and docking-based virtual screening approach to predict novel hit compounds with inhibitory activity toward P-gp.

We postulated that amorphous intermediates with controlled composition can be made by avoiding the formation of regions with compositions close to that of the known compounds. Specifically, we demonstrated that we\ncould avoid the formation of PbSe and MoSe2 by sequentially depositing nonstoichiometric ultrathin sub-monolayer thickness layers on a nominally room temperature substrate. The substrate temperature needs to be low enough to minimize surface diffusion, preventing agglomeration of elements and resultant concentration gradients. The amount of diffusion required to form nucleation embryos can be controlled by changing the difference between the composition of the film and the stoichiometry of the compound in question. Large enough differences should result in amorphous intermediates in most systems.

The unusual nature of such water micro-structure can influence both translational and reorientational dynamics, as well as the water hydrogen bond network near propofol. We have carried out the all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of five different compositions of propylene glycol (PG): water binary mixture containing propofol (PFL) molecules to investigate the differential behavior of water micro-solvation shells around propofol, which is likely to control the propofol solubility. It is evident from the simulation snapshots for various composition that the PG at high molecular ration favors the water cluster and extended chainlike net- work that percolates within the PG matrix, where the propofol is in the disperse state. We estimated the radial distribution function indicates higher ordered water micro- structure around propofol for high PG content, as compared to the lower PG content 1in the PG:Water mixture. So, the hydrophilic propylene glycol regulates the stability of water micro-network around propofol and their solubility in the binary mixture. We observed the translational and rotational mobility of water belonging to the propofol micro-solvation shell is hindered for high propylene glycol content, and relaxed towards the low propylene glycol molecular ration in the PG:Water mixture. It has been noticed that the structural relaxation of the hydrogen bond formed between the propofol and the water molecules present in the propofol micro-solvation shell for all five compositions, is found slower for high PG content, and becomes faster on the way to low PG content in the mixture. Simultaneously, we calculated the intermittent residence time correlation function of the water molecules belonging to the micro-solvation shell around the propofol for five different compositions, and found a faster short time decay followed up with a long time components. Again, the origin of such long time decay primarily from the structural relaxation of the micro-solvation shell around the propofol, where the high propylene glycol content shows the slower structural relaxation that turns faster as the propylene glycol content approaches to the other end of the compositions. So, our studies showed that the slower structural relaxation of the micro-solvation shell around propofol for high propylene glycol molecular ration in the PG:Water mixture, correlate well with the extensive ordering of water micro-structure and restricted water mobility, facilitates the dissolution process of propofol in the binary mixture.", "date": "2023-11-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we probe the enzyme Alcohol Dehydrogenase 2 from the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii in thirteen different ion combinations for relative specific activity and analyse the results against MD simulations of the same IL systems. We probe the ionic liquid property space based on ion polarizability and molecular electrostatic potential. Using radial distribution functions, survival probabilities and spatial distribution functions of ions we show that cooperative ion-ion interactions determine ion-protein interaction, specifically, strong ion-ion interactions equate to higher enzymatic activity if neither of the ions interact strongly with the protein surface. We further demonstrate a tendency for ions interacting with the protein surface to be least detrimental to enzymatic activity if they show a low polarizability and a small range of molecular electrostatic potential. We also find that the IL ion influence is not mitigated by the surplus of negatively charged residues of the halophilic enzyme. This is shown by free energy landscape analysis in root mean square deviation and distance variation plots of active site gating residues (Trp43 and His273) demonstrating no protection of specific structural elements relevant to preserving enzymatic activity.

We introduce the TORO (TOrch-powered Robust Optimization) Indexer, a robust and adaptable indexing algorithm developed using the PyTorch framework.  TORO Indexer is capable of operating on GPUs, CPUs, and other hardware accelerators supported by PyTorch, ensuring compatibility with a wide variety of computational setups.  In our tests, TORO outpaces existing solutions indexing thousands of frames per second when running on GPUs, positioning it as an attractive candidate to produce real-time indexing and user feedback. Our algorithm streamlines some of the ideas introduced by previous indexers like DIALS real grid search and XGandalf, and refines them using faster and principled robust optimization techniques which result in a concise codebase consisting of less than 500 lines.   Based on our evaluations across four proteins, TORO consistently matches and, in certain instances, outperforms established algorithms such as XGandalf and MOSFLM, occasionally amplifying the quality of the consolidated data while achieving indexing rates that are orders of magnitude higher. The inherent modularity of TORO, and the versatility of Pytorch code bases, facilitate its deployment into a wide array of architectures, software platforms and bespoke applications, highlighting its prospective significance in SX.

The conventional route to inhibit flammability involves blending the polymer with additives, an approach that comes with significant trade-offs on the mechanical properties of the final product compared to the parent polyamide. Herein, we address this limitation through synthesis of a novel multifunctional comonomer derived from renewably sourced trans-3-hexenedioic acid (t3HDA). t3HDA was subjected to a one-pot isomerization and functionalization strategy where the double bond migrates to render this molecule active for phospha-Michael-addition (MA) with 6-oxide6H-dibenz(1,2)oxaphosphorin (DOPO), a prominent halogen-free flame-retardant (FR). This monomer was introduced in the polyamide\u2019s backbone through copolymerization and the obtained polymer was compared to physical mixtures containing proportionate amounts of DOPO and Nylon-6,6. Thermal and mechanical properties of the blends and the FR-grafted polymers were characterized through a suite of techniques that revealed superior crystallinity, thermal, and mechanical properties for the DOPO-tethered bio-advantaged polyamides relative to blends with comparable flame retardance.

This paper describes the expansion of the utility of a class of unique S, N, and O-containing heterocyclooctynes (SNO-OCTs), which show chemoselective reactivity with Type I and II dipoles and exhibit divergent reactivities in response to electronic tuning of the alkyne. Currently, bioconjugation of SNO-OCTs to a desired target is achieved through an inconvenient aryl- or amide-linker at the sulfamate nitrogen. Herein, a new synthetic approach towards general SNO-OCT scaffolds is demonstrated that enables installation of functional handles at both propargylic carbons of the heterocycloalkyne. This capability increases the utility of SNO-OCTs as labeling reagents through the design of bifunctional bioorthogonal probes with expanded capabilities.

However, the methodology has been mostly applied to natural proteins/enzymes and limited to reactions promoted by synthetic molecules due to structure determination challenges. This work demonstrates the applicability of TR-SFX for investigations of chemical reaction mechanisms of synthetic metal complexes.

By controlling light exposure and time, we succeeded in capturing the real-time formation of Mn-carbonyl intermediates during the CO release reaction. The asymmetric protein environment was found to influence the order of CO release. The experimentally-observed reaction path agrees with quantum mechanical calculations.

The complexes have a carbene-metal-amide (cMa) structure where an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand acts as an electron acceptor and the amide ligand serves as an electron donor.  The donor-metal-acceptor motif leads to strong interligand charge transfer (ICT) absorption and emission transitions in the cMa complexes.  The energy of the ICT transition is determined by the ionization potential of the amide and electron affinity of the carbene and can be varied over the entire visible spectrum by proper choice of the ligands.  The highly efficient luminescence is characterized as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).  Emission lifetimes are fast, typically in the 1-2 microsecond range, that are facilitated by strong spin-orbit coupling of the metal center which promotes rapid intersystem crossing between the lowest singlet and triplet states. The complexes have large permanent dipole moments in the ground state that reverse direction in the excited state.  This change dipole orientation upon excitation leads to strong negative solvatochromism with increasing solvent polarity in absorption and emission.  The radiative rate for the complexes is determined by the extent of overlap between the valence orbitals on the ligands mediated by the small contributions from the metal center.  The radiative rate is also correlated to the distance separating the hole and electron in the excited state.  The cMa complexes have been employed as luminescent dopants in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).  OLEDs fabricated using the cMa complexes are highly efficient devices that rival the performance of devices that use precious metal phosphorescent dopants.  The cMa complexes have also been used as photosensitizers to catalytically produce H2.

Therefore, a marine algae extract library, and two distinct biochemical assays were used to screen for natural products that could inhibit two well-defined and validated COVID-19 drug targets, disruption of the Spike protein/ACE-2 interaction and the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Upon initial screening of 86 crude extracts, we counter-screened and performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis of 16 cyanobacterial extracts. This orthogonal approach revealed three extracts with similar metabolomic and biological profiles, all from similar collection sites, leading to the isolation of an unusual saturated fatty acid, jobosnoic acid (1).

Hydrogenation based on radical, metal-catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (mHAT) mechanisms offers an outstanding opportunity to overcome these difficulties, enabling mild reduction of these challenging olefins with selectivity that is complementary to traditional hydrogenations with H2. Further, mHAT presents an opportunity for asymmetric induction through cooperative hydrogen atom transfer (cHAT) using chiral thiols. Here, we report insights from an in-depth mechanistic study of an iron-catalyzed achiral cHAT reaction and leverage these insights to deliver stereocontrol from chiral thiols. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic analysis and variation of silane structure, point to the transfer of hydride from silane to iron as the likely rate-limiting step. The data indicate that the selectivity-determining step is quenching of the alkyl radical by thiol, which becomes a more potent H-atom donor when coordinated to iron(II). The resulting iron(III)-thiolate complex is in equilibrium with other iron species, including FeII(acac)2, which is shown to be the predominant off-cycle species. The enantiodetermining nature of the thiol trapping step enables enantioselective net hydrogenation of olefins through cHAT using a commercially available glucose-derived thiol catalyst, with up to 80:20 enantiomeric ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of asymmetric hydrogenation via iron-catalyzed mHAT.

Here, a machine-learning framework is developed that predicts stressor-specific stability scores from computationally generated reaction data.

Using a hinge-loss function, this half-life data was used to train machine learning models to predict a scalar representing the relative stability based only on the molecular graph. These models were successful in transferability case-studies using distinct train:test splits to recapitulate known stability trends with respect to the degree of branching and alkane size. Even the simplest models showed excellent performance in these case studies, demonstrating the relative ease with which thermal stability can be learned. The stability score is also shown to be useful in a design study, where it is used as part of the objective function of a genetic algorithm to guide the search towards more stable species.

Firstly, we investigated the cytotoxic potential of all the synthesized derivatives in RAW 264.7 cells. The results of the study suggested that UA and its derivatives were non-cytotoxic to macrophages up to concentrations of 10.0 \u00b5M.  In the present study we used Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent activator of immune cells including macrophages consequently activating the inflammatory cascade. The nitric oxide (NO) inhibition was assessed for potential of these derivatives in LPS induced RAW 264.7 macrophages wherein the results demonstrated that among all, indole derivatives significantly reduced the levels of inorganic nitric oxide in cell culture supernatant in comparison to the parent molecule (UA) and as well as amide derivatives.

The effect of these derivatives was also access on principal inflammatory mediators including iNOS, COX-2 and ROS. The results showed a reduction in the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 indicating their potential role in dampening inflammation.

This configuration allows for high repetition rates (> 100 Hz) and sensitivities, enabling data acquisition at a high scanning speed and small laser beam size (3-4 \u00b5m). Notably, this approach requires just about 1/30 of the sample volume typically utilized in conventional spot ablation mode, while achieving similar levels of precision and accuracy. Line scan ablation is tested and compared to spot ablation on age-homogeneous crystalline muscovite and biotite, for which reference Rb-Sr age data is acquired through ID-TIMS. Results show that a key requirement for accurate Rb-Sr ages based on line scan analyses is matrix correction using chemically matched crystalline mica.

The flow rates of water within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are significantly influenced by the nanoconfined density, viscosity and the slip length.  Despite considering substantial slip effects, there are unresolved findings of massive enhancements in flow rates. Recently, using a linear pressure-area relationship for the deformable tube walls, Garg (2023) derived a model for the flow rates. In contrast to that, this paper takes a different approach, utilizing a small displacement structural mechanics framework with a linear pressure-diameter relationship, to incorporate the deformable nature of carbon nanotubes and derive another deformable model. We compare predicted flow rates with previous findings. The rigid-wall model with slips accurately predicted the outcomes of numerous studies. Nonetheless, we observed that in many studies featuring high porosity and thin-walled tubes, the inclusion of tube elasticity or deformability is crucial for accurate modeling. In such cases, our deformable-wall model with slips performed exceptionally well in predictions. We also compare and contrast the flow physics and flow rate scaling of the current model with the predictions from the Garg (2023)  deformable model. We also find that as the deformability $1/\\beta$ increases, the flow rate also increases. Although the scaling for how the flow rate and flow physics varies are different than reported by Garg (2023) with pressure-area model. We find that the flow rate in deformable tubes scales as $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  1/\\beta^0 $ for $\\Big ( \\Delta p/\\beta \\sqrt{A_o} \\Big )  \\ll 1$, $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  1/\\beta $ for $\\Big ( \\Delta p/\\beta \\sqrt{A_o} \\Big )  \\sim O(10^{-1})$ and $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim 1/ \\beta^4 $ for $\\Big ( \\Delta p/\\beta \\sqrt{A_o} \\Big ) \\sim O(1)$. Further, for a given deformability factor $\\beta$, the flow rate in the smaller diameter of the tube is much larger than the larger diameter where the flow rate increases with $D_o^{-1}$ followed by $D_o^{-4}$ as diameter decreases. We also find that for the rigid tube, the mass flow rate varies linearly with pressure, whereas for the deformable tubes, the flow rate scales as $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  \\Delta p^2 $ for $ \\Big ( \\Delta p/\\beta \\sqrt{A_o} \\Big )  \\sim O(10^{-1})$ during transition from $\\dot{m}_{\\text{rigid}} \\sim  \\Delta p $ to $\\sim  \\Delta p^5 $, and finally to $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  \\Delta p^5 $ for $ \\Big  ( \\Delta p/\\beta \\sqrt{A_o} \\Big )  \\sim O(1)$.

We then discuss cluster modeling of \\ce{H2} ligation at MOF binding sites using state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and how the binding can be understood using energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Employing these tools, we illustrate the connections between the character of the MOF binding site and the associated adsorption thermodynamics using four experimentally characterized MOFs, highlighting the role of open metal sites (OMSs) in accessing binding strengths relevant to room temperature storage.

The most oxidized form of nitrogen, nitrate (NO3-) can be reduced to NH3 via the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), which has been demonstrated at high selectivity. However, to make NH3 synthesis cost-competitive with current technologies, high NH3 partial current densities (jNH3) must be achieved to reduce the levelized cost of NH3. Here, we leverage the high NO3RR activity of Fe-based materials to synthesize a novel active particle-active support system with Fe2O3 nanoparticles supported on atomically dispersed Fe-N-C. By synergizing the activity of both nanoparticles and single atom sites, the optimized 3xFe2O3/Fe-N-C catalyst demonstrates an ultrahigh NO3RR activity, reaching a maximum jNH3 of 1.95 A cm-2 at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 100% and an NH3 yield rate over 9 mmol hr-1 cm-2. Operando XANES and post-mortem XPS reveal the importance of a pre-reduction activation step, reducing the surface Fe2O3 (Fe3+) to highly active Fe0 sites, which are maintained during electrolysis, to realize the ultrahigh NO3RR activity. Durability studies demonstrate the robustness of both the Fe2O3 particles and Fe-Nx sites at highly cathodic potentials, maintaining a current of -1.3 A cm-2 over 24 hours, a near unity FENH3.

However, their potential in large-scale synthesis is currently constrained by their suboptimal chemical selectivity. Improving the selectivity of UPOs requires a deep understanding of the molecular basis of their catalysis. Recent molecular simulations have sought to unravel UPO\u2019s selectivity and inform their design principles. However, most of these studies focused on the substrate binding poses. Few have investigated how the reactivity of CpdI, the principal oxidizing intermediate in the catalytic cycle, influences selectivity in a realistic protein environment. Moreover, the influence of protein electrostatics on the reaction kinetics of CpdI has also been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, we used multiscale simulations to interpret the regio- and enantioselective hydroxylation of the n-heptane substrate catalyzed by Agrocybe aegerita UPO (AaeUPO). We comprehensively characterized the energetics and kinetics of the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step, initiated by the CpdI, and the subsequent oxygen rebound step forming the product. Notably, our approach involved both free energy and potential energy evaluations in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) setting, mitigating the dependence of results on the choice of initial conditions. These calculations illuminate the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HAT and oxygen rebound steps. Our findings highlight that both the conformational selection and the distinct chemical reactivity of different substrate hydrogen atoms together dictate the regio- and enantioselectivity. Building on our previous study on CpdI\u2019s formation in AaeUPO, our results indicate that the HAT step is the rate-limiting step in the overall catalytic cycle. The subsequent oxygen rebound step is swift and retains the selectivity determined by the HAT step. We also pinpointed several polar and charged amino acid residues whose electrostatic potentials considerably influence the reaction barrier of the HAT step. Notably, the Glu196 residue is pivotal for both the CpdI\u2019s formation and participation in the HAT step.

However, mechanical metamaterials have yet to be majorly implemented at a large scale to solve our crucial problems. A major problem the world faces today is producing stronger construction materials to prevent events such as Earthquake collapses, while still maintaining scalability and cost-effectiveness for earthquake prone regions such as Syria and Turkey. This is where ISMER (Internal Structural Modification for Earthquake Resistance), a novel metamaterial design, finds its place in the world of lost-cost earthquake resistance.

Existing catalysts commonly used for pollutant degradation in wastewater can demonstrate a low percent degradation of pollutants within certain time periods, have long reaction times, only work under limited conditions, work on a large or small scale, or possess a combination of these limitations. In recent advances, some piezoelectric materials and certain paraelectric materials have been shown to have catalytic activity in degrading pollutants. Lead zirconate (piezoelectric) and strontium titanate (paraelectric) are examples of materials that possess these properties. The purpose of this study was to utilize multiple piezoelectric materials and other catalysts with favorable properties, such as lead zirconate and strontium titanate, to develop a novel catalyst to degrade pollutants in wastewater. In the experiment, catalysts were created by mixing various ratios of lead zirconate, strontium titanate, and titanium dioxide powders\u2013the latter being the currently most used photocatalyst for wastewater purification. These catalysts were added to four different wastewater samples obtained from different sources: three were industrial wastewater samples containing inorganic and organic pollutants with one sample being mixed with dye pollutants in addition. The other wastewater sample was a lab-created solution of methylene blue and water. Each sample of wastewater and catalyst mixed together was subjected to controlled conditions and specified durations of visible and UV light exposure. Spectroscopy was used to analyze the effectiveness of the different catalysts. The absorption of each mixture of wastewater and catalyst was recorded at both the beginning and end of the reaction period and compared, and the percent difference in absorption at peak length between the beginning and end of the reaction period was used to calculate the photodegradation efficiency. The catalyst that was created using a 1:1 ratio of strontium titanate to lead zirconate sample had a 19.57% greater percent degradation efficiency compared to the traditionally used catalyst (titanium dioxide) when both were used on the third industrial wastewater sample under the study\u2019s experimental conditions. A higher percent degradation efficiency signifies a greater a reduction in the initial pollutants. This decrease could potentially signify the breakdown of pollutants into smaller particles, which may be less harmful. The findings in this study underscore the potential of the catalyst, strontium titanate and lead zirconate in a 1:1 ratio, for the use of wastewater treatment and hence to protect the environment from wastewater pollution, possibly with a higher percent degradation efficiency than the currently used catalyst for this application.

However, data on their biodegradation rates and environmental lifetimes in the coastal ocean are lacking, limiting informed engineering and regulatory decisions. Single-use drinking straws, a common marine litter relevant to key stakeholders, exemplify this. To fill this knowledge gap, commercial drinking straws made of cellulose diacetate (CDA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), paper, polylactic acid (PLA), and polypropylene (PP) were incubated for 16 weeks in a flow-through seawater mesocosm and monitored for degradation and microbial community composition. CDA, PHA, and paper straws reduced in mass by up to 50%, projecting environmental lifetimes of 7-15 months in the coastal ocean. PP and PLA showed no measurable mass loss. Lifetimes depended on the material and dimensions of the straw, demonstrating the need to balance function and degradation properties. The materials that biodegraded exhibited unique microbial communities driven by chemical structure, whereas those materials that were persistent exhibited similar communities despite substantial differences in chemical structure. To reduce the persistence of drinking straws, we hypothesized that changing product form (i.e., surface area), not just material, can reduce their environmental lifetimes. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the biodegradation of a prototype foamed CDA straw. Its specific surface degradation rate was 190% faster than its solid counterpart, resulting in a shorter projected environmental lifetime than the paper straws.

However, to determine even the simplest structures now and a hundred years ago, one needs to overcome a mathematical hurdle for which the solution is not known even to this day. To reconstruct the 3-dimensional electron density map, from which the structure can be inferred, the complex structure factors F = |F| exp(i\u03c6) of a sufficiently large number of diffracted reflections must be known. In a conventional diffraction experiment, only the amplitudes |F| are obtained, while the phases \u03c6 are lost. This is the crystallographic phase problem.

However, despite their promising attributes, this system faces certain challenges including limited solubility, poor electrochemical stability of radicals, low redox potential, and inadequate ionic conductivity, hampering their widespread commercial utilization. In recent years, molecular engineering has emerged as a transformative tool for designing and synthesizing of high-performance redox-active molecules for NAORFBs. These molecules, such as quinone, nitroxyl radicals, dialkoxybenzenes, phenothiazine, phenazine, pyridiniums, and viologen derivatives, offer precise control over solubility, stability, and redox potential through the strategic introduction or removal of functional groups. \nOur team has focused extensively on molecular engineering, with a specific focus on the phenothiazine core. Through a concise synthesis process, we have successfully synthesized a series of finely tuned phenothiazine derivatives with adjustable redox potentials, solubility, and stability. These tailored derivatives have demonstrated remarkable longevity when applied in NAORFBs. The selection of appropriate supporting electrolytes and membranes plays a significant role in achieving high performance RFBs. In this account, we commence by summarizing the results of our comprehensive examination of various supporting electrolytes and commercially available membranes, assessing their effects to stability, electrochemical reversibility, and crossover rates of redox-active molecules such as N-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl]phenothiazine (MEEPT). This comprehensive analysis provides a fundamental framework for evaluating the supporting materials for novel catholytes or anolytes. In efforts to fine-tune the solubility and redox potential of phenothiazines, we have employed molecular tailoring techniques. For instance, the introduction of alkyl or alkoxy groups on the nitrogen atom of phenothiazine has significantly improved solubility and electrochemical stability. These modifications have provided neutral molecules miscible with the commonly used organic solvents and allowed their radicals to reach concentrations of up to 0.5 M. However, monosubstituted phenothiazines still exhibit a relatively low usable oxidation potential, at 0.3 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). To address this limitation, we further modified the phenothiazine core by introducing substituents at positions 3 and 7. This alteration resulted in a notable increase in the stable oxidation potential. Notably, N-ethyl-3,7-bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phenothiazine (B(MEEO)EPT) exhibited an oxidation potential of 0.65 V vs. Fc/Fc+. In pursuit of cost-effective NAORFBs, we developed a novel ionic compound named ethylpromethazine bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EPRT-TFSI). Through a concise three-step synthesis, EPRT-TFSI compound displayed a high redox potential of 1.12 V vs Fc/Fc+, a solubility of up to 1.3 M, and an ionic conductivity as high as 25 mS cm-1. The utilization of such ionic compounds eliminates the necessity for additional supporting salts in the electrolytes. Furthermore, we conducted investigations into the stability of radicals at various concentrations, employing different counter anions while maintaining controlled moisture levels in ambient environments. These stability tests provide valuable insights and guidelines for synthesizing other stable redox-active molecules.  Our dedicated research efforts have been instrumental in advancing the development of high-performance NAORFBs, bringing us closer to realizing their potential as a prominent energy storage technology.\n", "date": "2023-11-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Energy; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we collect the most relevant mechanistic proposals from the recent literature and organize them into a single reaction network. The transition structures (TSs) and intermediates are characterized using high level ab initio methods that predict relative energies within chemical accuracy. The reaction pathways are assessed in terms of the Gibbs free energy differences of the TSs and intermediates with respect to \u03b2-glucopyranose, selecting a 2D ideal-gas standard state at 773K to represent the usual pyrolysis conditions. After having scored all the possible pathways throughout the network assuming reversible reaction steps, several pathways, which present various changes with respect to the former proposals, can lead to the formation of both HMF and FF passing through rate-determining TSs that have \u2206G\u2021 values of ~ 49-50 kcal/mol. Interestingly, the catalysis by auxiliary water molecules and the non-specific environmental effects as modelled by solvent continuum methods, have only a minor impact on the Gibbs free energy profiles of the most favoured routes. Since the HMF fragmentation (HMF\u2192FF+CH2O) is predicted to have a small \u2206rxnG value and an accessible \u2206G\u2021 barrier, the HMF/FF molecular ratio may be partly determined by equilibrium conditions. In addition, the benchmark energies and structures are employed to study the performance of density functional methodologies. Finally, we show that the computational results are in consonance with the kinetic parameters derived from lumped models, the results of isotopic labelling experiments and the reported HMF/FF molecular ratios. Eventually, they could be useful in future computational studies focused on the kinetic modelling of the pyrolysis mechanisms including non-equilibrium kinetic effects, which could render much more detailed information about product yields and the importance of the various pathways.

If their thicknesses are less than their CNTs, heptane and hexadecane liquids are no longer in the form of macroscopic liquid but in a state of microscopic world. Thus, the size of CNT defines the boundary between microscopic and macroscopic liquids. This is the most significant finding in present study. The CNTs of pure heptane and hexadecane liquids have been determined. We also find that the phase transition of heptane and hexadecane liquids from bulk to surface is exothermic.

Up until now, when it is at all considered, fluxionality has been treated primarily thermodynamically, representing relevant isomer populations as their Boltzmann populations. Previous work supported this, suggesting that the Pt7/Al2O3 ensemble should be kinetically accessible within ns, based on the barrier heights for isomerization. In the current work, we explore the isomerization kinetics of gas-phase and surface-supported Pt4Hx clusters, using kMC to explore the evolution of isomer populations with time as a function of temperature. We additionally revisit the previously-obtained Pt7/Al2O3 network. This allows us to determine the temperature- dependent timescales at which the ensembles of these subnanoclusters reach thermal equilibirum. Gas-phase clusters readily thermalize by 350 K, while surface-supported clusters require temperatures between 500-700 K. These thermalization timescales de- pend on how structurally distinct the cluster isomers are within their ensemble. The greater the structural difference there is between low-energy structures, the longer it requires to reach thermal equilibrium. We show that it is essential to compute the barriers for isomerization between low-lying isomers in order to accurately determine either thermalization timescales, or non-equilibrium steady-state populations. Finally, we find that these thermalization timescales can extend to longer than catalytically- relevant timescales, depending on the reaction in question, indicating that isomerization is an essential feature of the reaction coordinate of a catalytic reaction", "date": "2023-11-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

VOCs are often present at concentrations that cannot be detected through human odor perception.

However, current chemiresistive VOC sensors typically require high-energy fabrication processes with large environmental footprints, significant mass-loadings of critical raw materials and/or elevated operating temperatures, which hamper widespread, sustainable deployment. We demonstrate a simple, low-energy hybrid fabrication route for chemiresistive VOC sensors, comprising additively-produced laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes on plastic substrates, decorated with SnO nanoflowers. The SnO nanoflowers were synthesized below 100C at ambient pressure and offer a low-energy alternative to conventional SnO2 or other metal-oxide nanoparticle devices. These chemiresistive sensors can detect methanol vapor at room temperature (\u223c18C) and typical humidity levels (\u223c55% RH), with a limit of detection (170\u00b140 ppm) below 8-hour worker safety exposure levels (200 ppm). The sensors also demonstrated stable DC resistance responses DeltaR/R = 9\u00b12% to 710 ppm of methanol for over 21 days in ambient laboratory conditions. First principles density functional theory simulations are used to elucidate the origin of the performance of the LIG-SnO sensors.

Conversely, the ChEMBL database contains a wealth of chemical activity information but includes no information about binding poses. We introduce BigBind, a dataset that maps ChEMBL activity data to proteins from the CrossDocked dataset.

Here, we present a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis approach allowing to simultaneous control MoS2 structure over several length scales. Lowering the pH of the hydrothermal precursor solution leads to smaller crystallite sizes of the pristine MoS2 formed. Moreover, the addition of alkyldiamines to the same precursor solution leads to their physical confinement between the forming MoS2 layers without the formation of covalent bonds, yielding interlayer-expanded MoS2. Controlling alkyldiamine precursor concentration can vary the number of confined structural pillars in interlayer-expanded MoS2. Electrochemical lithium intercalation is tested as a function of MoS2 structural properties. It is revealed that both smaller crystallite sizes and expanded interlayer-spacing lead to an increasingly pseudocapacitive lithium intercalation signature. The number of lithium that is reversibly stored in interlayer-expanded MoS2 is increased to almost 1.5 per formula unit.

As one of the main contributors to the overall internal resistance, porous electrodes with properly designed microstructure and optimized physiochemical properties are preferable for boosting electrochemical and fluid dynamic performance. The present study aims to unveil the relationship between electrode morphology and electrochemical performance under varying electrode compression. Three representative, commercially available, carbon-fiber electrodes (i.e., paper, felt, and cloth) with distinct microstructures were selected here, and a comprehensive study was conducted to compare morphology, hydraulic permeability, mechanical behavior, electrochemical properties including decoupled kinetic and mass transfer resistances, and overall battery performance in a lab-scale vanadium redox flow battery at 0-50% compression ratios. The 3D electrode morphology was characterized through X-ray computed tomography and the extracted key microstructure parameters (e.g., surface area and tortuosity) were compared with corresponding electrochemically determined parameters. It was found that the cloth possessed a bimodal pore size distribution due to its distinct woven microstructure and that it was sensitive to the applied compression. The large pores formed at the intersections between fiber bundles collapsed under excessive compression, which greatly reduced the advantageous high permeability and low mass transfer resistances characteristic of the uncompressed cloth. The paper electrodes exhibited a strongly growing compression force accompanied by increased in-plane tortuosity and mass transfer resistance even at low compression (<20%). During battery operation, the cloth maintains a good balance between performance and pressure drop at moderate compression. The optimal trade-off between fluid dynamics and electrochemical performance occurred at the compression ratios of 30%, 20%, and 20% for the felt, paper, and cloth, respectively.

Additive Ca2+ ions have been shown to preferentially adsorb on CaCO3 precipitates, effectively inhibiting their growth and promoting the crystallization of pure calcite without an observable intermediate phase. This phenomenon can be adapted towards the synthesis of small calcite particles from a conventional chemical precipitation method. Complementing such effort, this study discusses the influence of additive Ca2+ ions concentration and solution pH on the extent of CaCO3 growth inhibition. Equal volumes of equimolar CaCl2 and Na2CO3 solutions were mixed in a tubular reactor at a constant flowrate. The precipitates were continuously dispersed in Ca(OH)2 solution, where Ca2+ ions irreversibly adsorb on their surfaces. Compared to conditions where additive Ca2+ ions are absent, this method can produce more than 90% decrease in particle size. The results show the degree of growth inhibition increases as the concentration of additive Ca2+ ions increase. However, it is limited by increasing volume of precipitates. This study also reveals an unusual role of media pH. Here, growth inhibition that leads to the synthesis of monodisperse submicron CaCO3 particles is only observed in high alkaline pH conditions. This is due to the hydration of additive Ca2+ ions in low pH conditions.

For this, we first identify resonance Raman spectroscopy as a general experimental method to reconstruct molecular spectral densities with full chemical complexity at room temperature, in solvent, and for fluorescent and non-fluorescent molecules. We then show how to quantitatively capture the decoherence dynamics from the spectral density and identify decoherence pathways by decomposing the overall coherence loss into contributions due to individual molecular vibrations and solvent modes.

While the US EPA does not currently regulate TFA, its chemical similarity to other PFCAs and its simple molecular structure make it a suitable model compound for studying the destruction of PFAS. We show that hydrothermal processing in compressed liquid water degrades TFA at relatively mild conditions (T = 150 \u2013 250 \u02daC, P < 30 MPa), initially yielding gaseous products, such as CHF3 and CO2, that naturally aspirate from the solution. Alkali amendment (e.g., NaOH) promotes the mineralization of CHF3, yielding dissolved fluoride, formate, and dissolved carbonate species as final products. Fluorine and carbon balances are closed using Raman spectroscopy and fluoride ion selective electrode measurements for experiments performed at alkaline conditions, where gas yields are negligible. Qualitative FTIR gas analysis allows for establishing the degradation pathways; however, the F-balance could not be quantitatively closed for experiments without NaOH amendment. The kinetics of TFA degradation under hydrothermal conditions are measured, showing little to no dependency on NaOH concentration, indicating that the thermal decarboxylation is a rate-limiting step. A proposed TFA degradation mechanism motivates additional work to generalize the hydrothermal reaction pathways to other PFCAs.", "date": "2023-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite the lack of deliberately added surface ligands, common examples of nanoMOFs exhibit multi-week colloidal stability in a range of polar solvents, in stark contrast with most conventional nanoparticles that require surface functionalization with bulky ligands. And yet, the origin of this stability remains unknown. Although nanoMOF zeta potentials exceed |\u00b120 mV|, electrostatics alone cannot explain colloidal stability. Here, we demonstrate that nanoMOFs suspend only in solvents that dissolve the constituent MOF linkers. Moreover, the maximum \u201csolubility\u201d of nanoMOFs, i.e., the concentration of saturated particle suspensions, correlates with the solubility of the linkers in the same solvent. Calorimetry measurements indicate that nanoMOF immersion enthalpies resemble the solvation enthalpies of the linkers, suggesting solvent-linker interactions dictate nanoMOF colloidal stability. As a proof-of-concept, whereas nanoMOFs generally suspend only in polar solvents, we achieve toluene nanoMOF suspensions by identifying linkers soluble in toluene. Furthermore, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that solvents best at dissolving nanoMOFs are those that pack densely into the pores and interact with the MOF linkers. These results provide a predictive tool for achieving nanoMOF colloidal stability and highlight the uniqueness of defining a MOF \u201csurface\u201d, where solvents access both interior and exterior surfaces.", "date": "2023-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses molecularly diversified tumor aggressiveness, heterogeneous illness, recurrence, and high risk of metastasis. TNBC patients have poor prognosis due to later-stage diagnosis and fewer treatment options than other subtypes. Chalcones are chemical scaffolds found in natural products, especially in plants, considered diverse and structurally privileged in medicinal chemistry for drug development. Herein, we designed and synthesized novel acetamide derivatives of chalcone to evaluate against TNBC, and characterized them using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HRMS and IR spectroscopic methods. The derivatives were screened against human cancer cells for their cytotoxicity using SRB assay. Among the derivatives, 8h with the pyrrolidine group exhibited better cell growth inhibitor activity against both TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) cells. SRB, Colony formation and fluorescent dye-based screening assays demonstrated that 8h significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. Furthermore, 8h promoted apoptosis via upregulation of the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. 8h increased the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-3) and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, inhibiting the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) protein levels in TNBC cells. The above results suggest that 8h can promote cellular death through apoptotic mechanisms in TNBC cells, and this hypothesis confirms that chalcones can be designed with potential cytotoxicity against TNBC.

Herein, the structures of concentrated solutions of anionic carbon nanotubes in two amidic solvents are measured via total neutron scattering leading to a previ-ously unattainable picture of nanoparticle solvation, revealing a far richer structure than hitherto assumed. The solvent molecules form densely-packed, concentric shells around the charged carbon nanotubes, ordered according to two distinct orientations due to competing effects. Firstly, a surface monolayer that maximizes attractive interactions between anionic surface and solvent molecular dipole moment. The second orientation extends ~40 \u00c5 into the bulk solvent, with molecules preferentially oriented perpendicularly to the first layer due to dipole interac-tions with the charged nanoparticle. This complex, long-ranged order drastically differs from the simplistic treatment of the solvent in classical models commonly employed to understand these systems. Moreover, our analysis indicates that a fraction of counterions condense on the sur-face as a Stern layer which are desolvated due to the solvent preferentially interacting with the charged surface. Ions at further distances are fully solvated, and their distribution is strongly in-fluenced by the dense solvation shells around the nanotube. Our results thus underscore the critical importance of multi-body interactions in solvated nanoscale systems, highlighting new competing ion/surface solvation effects crucial for understanding electrolyte-surface interfaces in supercapacitors, batteries, and electrolytically-gated devices.", "date": "2023-11-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Solution Chemistry; Structure; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In virtually all the cases the photosensitizer has been encapsulated in liposomes core or liposomal membrane. However, the light-triggered drug release system, where the photosensitizer is located outside of the liposomes has never been reported before. The central concept of our research revolves around the far-red light-induced release of cargo from liposomes embedded in anionic nanofibrillar cellulose (ANFC), wherein the photosensitizer resides in the hydrogel, outside of liposomes. Both the sensitizer and the liposomes bind strongly to the anionic cellulose nanofibers by simple mixing, making the system easy to fabricate. Upon light activation, this photosensitizer generates reactive oxygen species, which, in turn, induce the liposomal bilayer disruption, ultimately resulting in cargo release. The release mechanism is the generation of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent oxidation of unsaturated lipids in the liposomal membrane. We were able to achieve ca. 70 % release of model hydrophilic cargo molecule calcein with a relatively low dose of light (262 J/cm2) while employing straightforward fabrication techniques for the drug delivery system.

The underlying mechanism of its efficiency, however, is not completely understood. X-ray structures of different intermediates in the catalytic cycle reveal tetramers in a dimer of dimers configuration with two open and two closed active sites. Upon binding a substrate, this active site changes its conformation from the open to the closed state. It is challenging to predict how these coupled conformational changes will alter the CO2 binding affinity to the reaction's active site. To determine whether the open or closed conformations of Ccr affect CO2 binding to the active site, we performed all-atom molecular simulations of the various conformations of Ccr.  The open conformation without a substrate showed the highest binding affinity. The CO2 binding sites are located near the catalytic relevant Asn81 and His365 residues and in an optimal position for CO2 fixation. Furthermore, they are unaffected by substrate binding, and CO2 molecules stay in these binding sites for a longer time.   Longer times in these reactive binding sites facilitate CO2 fixation through the nucleophilic attack of the reactive enolate in the closed conformation. We have previously demonstrated that the Asn81Leu variant cannot fix CO2. Simulations of the Asn81Leu variant explain the loss of activity through the removal of the Asn81 and His365 binding sites.  Overall, our findings show that the conformational dynamics of the enzyme control CO2 binding. Conformational changes in Ccr increase CO2 in the open subunit before the substrate is bound, the active site closes, and the reaction starts. The full catalytic Ccr cycle alternates between CO2 addition, conformational change, and chemical reaction in the four subunits of the tetramer coordinated by communication between the two dimers.

One of its main limitations, if not the main one, is that choosing the right functional to employ is a non-trivial task left for human experts. The choice is particularly hard for excited states calculations, when using the time-dependent formulation of DFT (TD-DFT). This is not only due to the approximations and limitations of the method, but also because the photophysical properties of a molecule are defined by a manifold of states that all need to be properly described in a balanced manner to obtain an accurate photochemical picture. This includes not only the relative energy of the states, but also capturing the correct character, order and intensity of the transitions. In this work, we developed a scoring system to quantitatively define the accuracy of an excited states calculation by simultaneously considering at the same time all these properties of a manifold of states. The scoring system is generalizable to any level of theory, we here applied it to a large dataset of organic molecules, calculating 38 scores for as many common functionals of different type and rung, against a higher accuracy method for a total of more than 820.000 single point calculations. The results of these calculations are collected in a database that we released and made it open, providing 4 million datapoints to be used by the community for future applications. We used the scores we extrapolated to train a graph attention neural network that is used to predict the 38 scores for molecules represented as 2D graphs. We call this oracle DELFI (Data-driven EvaLuation of Functionals by Inference), which can be used to quickly screen and predict the ranking of functionals to calculate optical properties of organic molecules. A corresponding web application allows to easily run DELFI and analyze the results, alleviating the hurdle of choosing the right functional for TD-DFT calculations.", "date": "2023-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Electrochemical strains were recorded during either cyclic voltammetry or galvanostatic cycling. The electrode undergoes significant irreversible mechanical deformations in the initial cycle, and irreversibility decreases in the subsequent cycles. During desodiation and sodiation, the electrode initially undergoes volume contraction followed by expansion.   The strain derivative peaks align well with the peak of the capacitive derivatives, indicating the phase-transition-induced deformations in the electrode. Cumulative irreversible strains demonstrate a linear relationship with the square root of cycling time, indicating irreversibility arising from forming a cathode-electrolyte interphase layer.

For this we have chosen a well-defined system of model materials, i.e., the highly ordered mesoporous silica molecular sieve SBA-15 in its pristine state and functionalized with different amounts of trimethylsilyl groups allowing one to accurately tailor the surface chemistry while maintaining the well-defined pore structure. For an absolute quantification of the trimethylsilyl group density, quantitative 1H solid-state NMR spectroscopy under Magic Angle Spinning was employed. A full textural characterization of the materials was obtained by high-resolution argon 87 K adsorption, coupled with the application of dedicated methods based on non-local-density functional theory (NLDFT). Based on the known texture of the model materials, we developed a novel methodology  allowing one to determine the effective contact angle of water adsorbed on the pore surfaces from complete wetting to non-wetting, constituting a powerful parameter for the characterization of the surface chemistry inside porous materials. The surface chemistry was found to vary from hydrophilic to hydrophobic with increasing TMS functionalization. For wetting and partial wetting surfaces, pore condensation of water is observed at pressures P smaller than the bulk saturation pressure P0 (i.e., at P/P0 < 1) and the effective contact angle of water on the pore walls could be derived from the water sorption isotherms. However, for non-wetting surfaces, pore condensation occurs at pressures above the saturation pressure (i.e., at P/P0 >  1). In this case we investigated the pore filling of water (i.e. the vapour-liquid phase transition) by the application of a novel, liquid water intrusion/extrusion methodology, allowing one to derive the effective contact angel of water on the pore walls even in case of non-wetting. Complementary molecular simulations provide density profiles of water on pristine and TMS-grafted silica surfaces (mimicking the tailored, functionalized experimental silica surfaces) which allow for a molecular view on the adsorbed water phase. Within this context, the presented methodology can be considered a powerful toolbox for a comprehensive surface chemistry assessment for pristine and functionalized mesoporous silica surfaces, but can also be extended to any other nanoporous material.

We find that the local microenvironments formed by the various polymer conformations promote preferential EEK solubilization within specific regions of the NP.

The high energy efficiency, robustness, and intermediate-temperature operation (500-650 \u00b0C) make proton-conducting cells promising candidates for future energy conversion systems. However, the major disadvantages of these materials are the inevitable high-sintering temperatures (>1500 \u00b0C), leading to Ba-evaporation and formation of high-resistance grain boundaries, which dominate the electrochemical performance. Here, we introduce a novel processing route for proton-conducting barium zirconates, which, on the one hand, significantly lowers the maximum processing temperature and, on the other hand, overcomes the dominating influence of grain boundaries on total conductivity. The key step of this novel processing route is the cold sintering of the powder using pure water as a sintering aid to consolidate BaZr0.7Ce0.2Y0.1O3-\u03b4 (BZCY) at 350\u00b0C. We show that clean grain boundaries with a high acceptor-dopant concentration are preserved thanks to the recovery of the perovskite phase during thermal treatment at 1300 \u00b0C. This compensates the interfacial core charge, resulting in highly conductive grain boundaries, which do not limit the total conductivity. Consequently, dense BZCY electrolytes produced by our novel approach outperform the conductivity of conventionally sintered BZCY irrespective of the significantly lower maximum processing temperature and its nanocrystalline microstructure. Our presented approach opens up new possibilities for grain boundary engineering and might facilitate novel co-sintering pathways for barium zirconate-based components.", "date": "2023-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Ceramics; Materials Processing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To this end, we use X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Na K-edge to interrogate the local structure of Na during CO2 capture (MgO + CO2 \u2194 MgCO3). The analysis of Na K-edge XAS data shows that the local environment of Na is altered upon MgO carbonation when compared to NaNO3 in the as-prepared sorbent. We attribute the changes observed in the carbonated sorbent to an alteration in the local structure of Na at the NaNO3/MgCO3 interfaces and/or in the vicinity of [Mg2+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CO32\u2013] ionic pairs that are trapped in the cooled down NaNO3 melt.

These additional experiments support our interpretation of the Na K-edge XAS data.

Many of these substances are illicitly manufactured and have been associated with severe health problems, prompting a need to development analytical methods capable of characterizing both known and previously undetected compounds. This work focuses on a novel Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations (SLIM) IM-MS approach to differentiation and structural characterization of synthetic cannabinoid metabolites, specifically MDA-19/BUTINACA, JWH-018, and JWH-250 isomer groups. These different compound classes are structurally very similar, differing only in the position of one or a few functional groups; this yielded similarity in measured collision cross section (CCS) values. However, the high resolution of SLIM IM provided adequate separation of many of these isomers, such as sodiated JWH-250 metabolites N-4-OH, N-5-OH, and 5-OH which displayed CCS of 187.5, 182.5, and 202.3 \u00c52, respectively. In challenging cases where baseline separation was precluded due to nearly identical CCS, such as for JWH-018 isomer, simple derivatization by dansyl chloride selectively reacted with the 6-OH compound to provide differentiation of all isomers using a combination of CCS and m/z. Finally, the opportunity to use this method for structural elucidation of unknowns was demonstrated using SLIM IM mobility-aligned MS/MS fragmentation. Different MDA-19/BUTINACA isomers were first mobility separated and then could be individually activated, yielding unique fragments for both targeted identification and structural determination. Overall, the described SLIM IM-MS/MS workflow provides significant potential as a rapid screening tool for characterization of emerging NPS such as synthetic cannabinoids and their metabolites.", "date": "2023-11-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The thickness of the cell used controls the pathlength of the light through the sample, a value needed for instance to transform absorption spectra into molar absorption coefficient spectra, or to determine solute concentrations from absorption spectra. The most accurate way to determine the thickness of a thin empty cell (i.e., filled with air) is from the period of an interference pattern, known as interference fringes, that arises when the cell is placed perpendicular to the path of light in the spectrometer. However, this same approach is not directly applicable to determine the thickness of a cells filled with an aqueous solution, due partially to the smaller amplitude of the interference fringes but fundamentally caused by its complex waveform, with a wavenumber-dependent oscillation period.  Here, using Fresnel equations, we derived analytical expressions to model interference fringes in absorption spectra obtained by transmission, valid also for aqueous samples. We also present a novel Fourier-based analysis of the interference fringes that, in combination with the derived analytical expressions, allowed us to determine the pathlength of aqueous samples with an error below 50 nm. We implemented this novel approach to analyze interference fringes as a Live Script running in the software Matlab. As an application, we measured absorption spectra of a 97 mM solution of MES buffer (at low and high pH) using cells of various nominal thicknesses (6, 25 and 50 \u03bcm). The molar absorption coefficient spectrum for the acidic and basic forms of MES, worked out using pathlengths values determined using the present approach, were virtually identical regardless of the nominal thickness of the cells used, indicating that the thickness determined for the cells were consistent and likely very accurate. These results illustrate the performance of the presented method to determine the pathlength of aqueous samples, as well as for its utility to obtain accurate molar absorption coefficient spectra of water-soluble molecules in the mid-IR region.

Although native ion mobility/mass spectrometry is well-suited to handle proteoform heterogeneity, it characterizes protein structures in the absence of solvent. This raises long-standing, unanswered questions about the biological significance of structures identified through ion mobility/mass spectrometry. Using newly developed computational and experimental ion mobility/ion mobility/mass spectrometry methods, we investigate the structural denaturation of the protein ubiquitin in the solvent-free environment. We show that ubiquitin exists in the absence of solvent as an ensemble of kinetically stable subpopulations that are separated by substantial free energy barriers. These subpopulations unfold but do not interconvert, which indicates that the solvent-free subpopulations originate from different solution-phase conformations. The subpopulations exhibit stretched-exponential denaturation kinetics consistent with a glass transition associated with separating the C-terminal beta-strand from the N-terminal beta-hairpin occurring on the folded side of the unfolding transition state. Our data indicate that this transition state is highly polarized with significant native content in the N-terminal beta-hairpin and alpha-helix, resembling the transition state reported for the presence of a solvent.

The utility of this approach, however, hinges on the ability to control the positional and stereoisomerism to access a single product among numerous potential isomeric byproducts. Here, a positionally selective alkene isomerization in which modulation of the ligand environment of the homogeneous tungsten catalyst grants access to either the (E)- or (Z)-stereoisomer is described. Compared to previously reported alkene isomerization methods, this reaction offers exquisite chemo- and regioselectivity from a simple, commercially available precatalyst and ligand. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that tungsten\u2019s ability to adopt 7-coordinate geometry is crucial for stereoselectivity and that substrate directivity prevents over-isomerization to the conjugated alkene, as is commonly observed with other catalysts. These features allows for exclusive formation of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated carbonyl compounds that are otherwise difficult to prepare.", "date": "2023-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Stereochemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the simulation of large systems through solely ML methods (like those based on neural network potentials) is still a challenge. In this context, one of the most promising frameworks for integrating ML schemes in the simulation of complex molecular systems are the so-called ML/MM methods. These multiscale approaches combine ML methods with classical forcefields (MM), in the same spirit as the succesful hybrid quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics methods (QM/MM). The key issue for such ML/MM methods is the adequate description of the coupling between the region of the system described by ML and the region described at the MM level. In the context of QM/MM schemes, the main ingredient of the interaction is electrostatic, and the state of the art is the so called electrostatic-embedding. In this study, we analyze the quality of simpler mechanical embedding-based approaches, specifically focusing on their application within a ML/MM framework utilizing atomic partial charges derived in vacuo. Taking as reference electrostatic embedding calculations performed at a QM(DFT)/MM level, we explore different atomic charges schemes, as well as a polarization correction computed using atomic polarizabilites. Our benchmark data set comprises a set of about 80k small organic structures from the ANI-1x database, solvated in water.  The results suggest that the MBIS atomic charges yield the best agreement with the reference coupling energy.

These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids (also known as neuraminic acids) from glycan chains. Humans have four isoenzymes of NEU: NEU1, NEU2, NEU3, and NEU4, making selective inhibitors important tools to investigate the function of individual isoenzymes. A typical scaffold used for the development of NEU inhibitors is 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA), which is a general inhibitor of viral, bacterial, and human neuraminidases. Modifications at the C9 position of DANA have been critical for the potency and selectivity of inhibitors that target human NEU. For example, C9-amides bearing alkyl substituents have been used to develop inhibitors with preference for NEU1, while C9-triazoles with aromatic substituents have higher potency for NEU3 and NEU4. To design improved DANA analogs, we generated a library of compounds with either a short alkyl chain or a biphenyl substituent linked to the C9 position through one of six amide bioisosteres. Bioisostere linkers included triazole, urea, thiourea, carbamate, thiocarbamate, and sulfonamide groups. Within this library, we identified a C9-biphenyl carbamate derivative (963) that showed high potency for NEU3 (K\u00aci = 0.12 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM). Additionally, the carbamate analog had enhanced selectivity for NEU3 over all other human isoenzymes. In contrast, NEU1 and NEU4 isoenzymes preferred amide and triazole linkers, respectively.

Here, we present a streamlined hybrid workflow that combines automated high-throughput experimentation, automated data analysis, and computational modelling, to accelerate the discovery process of one particular subclass of molecular organic materials, porous organic cages. We demonstrate how the design and implementation of this workflow aids in the identification of organic cages with desirable properties.

The performance of SiOx|Ir and TiOx|Ir thin film electrodes towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox reactions were evaluated. An improvement in selectivity towards the OER was observed for all OECs. Overlayer properties, namely ionic and electronic conductivity, were assessed using a combination of electroanalytical methods and molecular dynamics simulations.

This observation is attributed to facile electronic transport between the buried interface and outer surface of the overlayer, as measured with through-plane conductivity and ionic permeability measurements of wetted overlayer materials.

Crystal\u2019s mechanical flexibility in the perpendicular direction to (001) and (010) planes can be attributed to intermolecular interactions, including C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br, N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, and \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking interactions. Through a systematic process involving step-by-step bending and subsequent optical waveguiding experiments at each bent position, a linear relationship between optical loss and mechanical strain is established. Additionally, the vertical standing and leaning of these crystals at different angles on a flat surface and the vertical stacking of multiple crystals reveal the three-dimensional aspects of organic crystal waveguides, introducing light trajectories in a 3D space. Furthermore, the integration of two axially interlocked twisted crystals enables the coupling of polarization along their long axis. These novel crystal dynamics expand the horizons of crystal behavior and have the potential to revolutionize various applications, rendering these crystals invaluable in the realm of crystal-related science and technology.\n\n", "date": "2023-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We identify the key physicochemical parameters correlated with the measured performance, out of many offered candidate parameters characterizing the material, reaction environment, and possibly relevant underlying phenomena. Importantly, these parameters are obtained by both experiments and ab initio simulations. The identified key parameters might be called \u201cmaterials genes\u201d, in analogy of genes in biology: they correlate with the property or function of interest, but the explicit physical relationship is not (necessarily) known. To demonstrate the approach, we investigate CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH catalyzed by cobalt nanoparticles supported on silica. Crucially, the silica support is modified with the additive metals magnesium, calcium, titanium, aluminum, and zirconium, which results in six materials with significantly different performances. These systems mimic hydrothermal vents, which might have produced the first organic molecules on Earth. The key parameters correlated with the CH3OH selectivity reflect the reducibility of cobalt species, adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, and the chemical nature of the additive metal. By using SISSO model trained on elemental properties of the additive metals (e.g., ionization potential), new additives are suggested.

Its high rate speed, operating at the diffusion limit, combined with its buried active site feature, has made it a subject of extensive research over the last decades. Despite several studies focused on atomistic details of its differ- ent steps, a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the entire catalytic cycle has not yet been reported. In this work, we present an intuitive workflow aiming at describing the full dynamical and reactive profiles of AChE by coupling extensive Steered Molec- ular Dynamics (SMD) simulations for ligand diffusion and hybrid Quantum Mechan- ics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) computations to decipher the complete reactivity of the substrate within the enzyme. This comprehensive approach provides a broader view of the interconnections between each step that would not be readily accessible if studied independently. Our simulations reveal that although individual steps do not indicate any strong limiting step, a solvent water molecule reorganization between the acylation and deacylation processes through the reactivity results in an energy cost of 20 kcal/mol. The observed barrier surpasses all others and discloses insights on a strong polarization effect acting on water molecules near the active site. An AMOEBA polar- izable Molecular Dynamics simulation tends to confirm this assumption by capturing a substantial dipole moment (3.10 D) on the water molecule closest to the reaction site. These results shed light on the crucial correlation between this high\u2013energy water re- organization and the polarization of confined water molecules. Consequently, carefully considering and modeling buried (polarizable) water molecules is of paramount impor- tance when modeling full enzymatic activity. Therefore, this work will also provide valuable insights for future research on related enzymes with buried active sites.

Generating amides by chemical synthesis typically relies on toxic chemicals, the use of organic solvents, and stoichiometric amounts of coupling reagents, which is associated with generation of considerable amounts of waste. While developing more sustainable amide-bond forming reactions has been in focus, significantly less attention has been given to toxicity, sustainability and environmental aspects of the underlying amine and acid substrates and their corresponding coupled products. Here, we explore biocatalytic amide bond formation from a Safer and more Sustainable by Design perspective, for which a controlled chemical space was navigated based on potential human and environmental toxicity of the substrates and related products. In silico filtering of 15374 amines and 25994 acids generated 188 amine and 54 acid building blocks that could be classified as safe by the threshold we established, referred to herein as \u201csafechems\u201d. Based on the match of the known substrate scope of the marinacarboline amide bond synthetase McbA from Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652 with the structures of safechems, we generated a panel of robust and promiscuous ancestral ATP-dependent amide bond synthetases (ABS) using McbA as template. Ancestral ABS enzymes exhibited an increased thermostability of up to 20 \u00b0C and generated complementary biocatalysts to the extant enzyme with respect to amine and acid specificities in the coupling of a representative safechem subset of 17 amines and 16 acids (responding to 272 possible amides). Out of the 272 possible amides considered experimentally from the subset of safechems that were tested in biocatalytic coupling, 38 amides were detected by UPLC-MS out of which 32 were novel structures. Finally, the pool of safechems and their corresponding amides were evaluated by USEtox (the UNEP-SETAC toxicity model), analyzing not only the intrinsic properties of the compounds but also performing a risk assessment based on fate and exposure. The amides were in general predicted as more toxic compared to the starting acids and amines, emphasizing the importance of starting from low-toxicity building blocks. Even when restricting the pool of amines and acids based on their predicted toxicity, it did not prevent the discovery of new amides with potentially potent applications as exemplified here by substructures that are part of drug candidates for e.g. cancer treatment.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs), and in particular doped graphitic SACs, have emerged as a promising family of materials due to their high atom economy and scalability, but SACs have yet to be exhaustively screened for methane-to-methanol conversion. Modulating the coordination environment near single metal sites by means of codopants, we carry out a large-scale high-throughput virtual screen of 2,048 transition metal (i.e., Mn, Fe, Co, and Ru) SACs codoped with various elements (i.e, N, O, P and S) in numerous spin and oxidation (i.e., M(II)/M(III)) states for the challenging conversion of methane to methanol.

Whereas the replication of the original computed values reported in 2010 for the gas-phase proved entirely successful, several issues were discovered when a continuum solvent model was used. These included uncertainty regarding the parameters and methods used for the calculations and coordinates for the original reactant and transition states, via their provision as data in the electronic supporting information (ESI). The original conclusions, in which a numerical mis-match between the magnitude of the computed and experimentally measured KIE was attributed to significant deviations from transition state theory, are here instead rationalised as a manifestation of basis-set effects in the computation. Transition state theory appears to be operating successfully. We now recommend the use of basis sets of triple- or quadruple-\u03b6 quality, rather than the split-valence level previously employed, that dispersion energy corrections be included and that a continuum solvent model using smoothed reaction cavities is essential for effective geometry optimisation and hence accurate normal coordinate analysis. An outlying experimental KIE obtained for chloroform as solvent is attributed to a small level of an explicit hydrogen bonded interaction with the substrate. A temperature outlier for the measured KIE at 195K is suggested for further experimental investigation, although it may also be an indication of an unusually abrupt incursion of hydrogen tunnelling, which would need non-Born-Oppenheimer methods in which nuclear quantum effects are included to be more accurately modelled. We predict KIE for new substituents, of which those for R=NMe2 are significantly larger than for R=H. This approach could be useful in designing variations of the Swern reagent that could lead to synthesis of aldehydes incorporating much higher levels of deuterium.

Surfactant C12E3 is used for its ability to spontaneously generate wire-like structures called myelins when deposited at the air/water interface. Next, we demonstrate photo-controlled drain droplets that deplete surfactants from the air-water interface and thereby generate surface tension gradients that drive Marangoni flows, which in turn attract the myelins towards the drain. At the core of our design is a liquid crystalline coating that is formed at the drain droplet surface by oleic acid (OA) and sodium oleate (NaO) when placed on water. This coating inhibits the depletion of surfactant by the droplet. UV exposure activates photo-acid generator 2-nitrobenzaldehyde in the droplet, which protonates NaO, disintegrates the coating, and increases the Marangoni flow. Thereby, localized UV exposure of selected OA/NaO droplets results in attraction of the myelins, such that they establish connections amongst the droplets. Varying the photo-acid generator concentration, NaO content and UV exposure allows for re-configurability of these connections.

Yet, the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of photocatalysts (PCs) that form the basis for the thermodynamic driving force of the photocatalysis are often acquired in a solvent different to that used in the photocatalytic reaction, despite these crucial parameters being solvent dependent. Herein, we report the detailed computational modelling and optoelectronic characterization of eight popular PCs, encompassing transition metal complexes and organic compounds, in four commonly used solvents of varying polarity. Significant variation of up to 270 mV in the experimental ground-state and excited-state redox potentials is noted as a function of solvent polarity, while experimental triplet energies are found to be dependent on solvent (up to 110 meV) when the excited state is charge transfer, rather than locally excited, in nature. A range of photocatalytic electron and energy transfer reactions were investigated using a subset of the PCs and solvents to verify the impact of the changes in optoelectronic properties on the yields of the reactions. For the photoredox reactions, the yields are not correlated with solvent polarity. Instead, when the PC could promote the formation of the target product, we observed photodegradation for all PCs across all solvents, something that is rarely investigated in the literature. This, therefore, makes it difficult to ascertain whether the parent PC and/or the photodegraded product is responsible for the photochemistry, or indeed, whether photodegradation is actually detrimental to the reaction yield. Conversely, the PCs were found to be photostable for energy transfer reactions; however, yields were not correlated to the triplet energies of the PCs, highlighting that triplet energies alone are not a suitable descriptor to discriminate the performance between PCs in photoinduced energy transfer processes.", "date": "2023-11-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Achieving this ambitious objective requires high throughput and high coverage sample preparation and LC-MS/MS analysis for hundreds to thousands of reactive compounds and chemical probes. Conducting chemoproteomic screens at this scale benefits from technical innovations that achieve increased sample throughput. Multiplexed analysis using commercially available amine-reactive isobaric reagents (e.g. tandem mass tags or TMT) is a favored strategy to decrease instrument acquisition time. These reagents are ideally suited for protein-based quantification applications, with efficient capping and pooling of peptides after sequence specific digestion. The added enrichment steps in nearly all chemoproteomic sample preparation workflows reveals a still largely untapped opportunity for isobaric labeling, namely incorporation of the TMT label into the chemoproteomic enrichment handle for early sample pooling and increased sample preparation throughput. Here we realize this vision by establishing the silane-based Cleavable Linkers for Isotopically-labeled Proteomics (sCIP)-TMT proteomic platform. sCIP-TMT pairs a custom click-compatible sCIP capture reagent that is readily functionalized in high yield with commercially available TMT tags. Synthesis and benchmarking of a 10-plex set of sCIP-TMT reveals a 1.5-fold decrease in sample preparation time together with high coverage and high accuracy quantification. By screening a focused library of cysteine-reactive electrophiles, we demonstrate the utility of sCIP-TMT for chemoproteomic target hunting, identifying 789 total liganded cysteines. Distinguished by its compatibility with established enrichment and quantification protocols, we expect sCIP-TMT will readily translate to a wide range of chemoproteomic applications.

SIC has recently attracted renewed attention as an effective mechanism for improving the mechanical properties of polymers. A polyurethane (PU) film incorporating a trace of a dual-emissive flapping force probe (N-FLAP, 0.008 wt%) exhibited a blue-to-green FL spectral change in a low stress region (< 20 MPa), resulting from conformational planarization of the probe in mechanically stretched polymer chains. Only at higher probe concentrations (~0.65 wt%), the PU film showed a second spectral change from green to yellow during the SIC growth (20\u201365 MPa) due to self-absorption of scattered FL in a short wavelength region. The reversibility of these spectral changes was demonstrated by load-unload cycles. With these results in hand, the degrees of the polymer chain stretching and SIC were quantitatively mapped and monitored by dual ratiometric imaging based on different FL ratios (I525/I470 and I525/I600). Simultaneous analysis of these two mappings revealed a spatio-temporal gap in the distribution of the polymer chain stretching and the SIC.

We herein develop an algorithm, called OLIVES, which identifies native contacts with hydrogen bond capabilities in coarse-grained proteins and use it to implement a novel Go-like model for Martini 3. We show that the protein structure instability originates, in part, from the lack of hydrogen bond energy in the coarse-grained force field representation. By using realistic hydrogen bond energies obtained from literature ab initio calculations, it is demonstrated that protein stability can be recovered by the reintroduction of a coarse-grained hydrogen bond network and that OLIVES removes the need for secondary structure restraints. OLIVES is validated against known protein complexes, and at the same time addresses the open question of whether there is a need for protein quaternary structure bias in Martini 3 simulations.

A number of investigations have employed different approaches to compute adsorption energies of small molecules like methane, ethane, or carbon dioxide in different types of zeolites (all-silica, protonated, cation-exchanged), using reference values from high-level calculations and/or experiments. Such comparative studies are lacking for the adsorption of larger functional organic molecules such as pharmaceuticals or personal care products, despite the potential relevance for applications, e.g., in contaminant removal or drug delivery. The present study aims to fill this gap by comparing adsorption energies and, for selected cases, equilibrium structures of emerging organic contaminants adsorbed in all-silica zeolites, employing a total of 13 dispersion-corrected DFT approaches. Methods using a pairwise (D3) dispersion correction as well as non-local van der Waals density functionals were included. A comparison of adsorption energies obtained for a variety of contaminants in MOR- and FAU-type zeolites showed that absolute values vary widely, whereas qualitative trends across the set of zeolite-guest combinations are not strongly dependent on the choice of functional. For selected cluster models, DFT adsorption energies were compared to reference values obtained with coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) calculations. Although all DFT approaches delivered systematically more negative adsorption energies than the coupled cluster reference, the rev-vdW-DF2 functional emerged as functional for which this tendency is least pronounced.

By comparing experimental potentials with quantum chemistry predictions, hydrogen peroxide is identified as a critical reaction intermediate, and the presence of nickel dopants in NATO catalyzes hydrogen peroxide into solution-phase hydroperoxyl radicals that can be subsequently oxidized into ozone. Isotopic analyses of products show that oxygen atoms in the generated ozone are from both water and the metal oxide lattice. The time evolution of isotopic composition indicates that as NATO catalysts corrode, lattice oxygen is not regenerated.

However, most CG force fields use pairwise non-bonded interaction potentials sets, which can limit their ability to capture complex multi-body phenomena such as the hydrophobic effect. As the hydrophobic effect primarily manifests itself due to the non-polar solute affecting the nearby hydrogen bonding network in water, capturing such effects using a simple one CG site or \u201cbead\u201d water model is a challenge. In this work, we systematically test the ability of CG one site water models for capturing critical features of the solvent environment around a hydrophobe as well as the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) of neopentane association. We study two bottom-up models: a Simple Pairwise (SP) Force-Matched water model constructed using the Multiscale Coarse-Graining method and the Bottom-Up Many-Body Projected Water (BUMPer) model, which has implicit three-body correlations. We also test the top-down monatomic (mW) and the Machine Learned mW (ML-mW) water models. The mW models perform well in capturing structural correlations, but not the energetics of the PMF.  BUMPer outperforms SP in capturing structural correlations, but also gives an accurate PMF in contrast to the two mW models. Our study highlights the importance of including three-body interactions in CG water models, either explicitly or implicitly, while in general highlighting the applicability of bottom-up CG water models for studying hydrophobic effects in a quantitative fashion.

The printing outcome largely depends on physicochemical properties of monomers and their compositions in resins, which also greatly determine the material properties, e.g., strength/toughness and phase transition temperature (Tg). Thus, a methodology for optimizing the resin formulation is of paramount importance in realizing highly printable thermoplastics with balanced strength/toughness and target Tg while remaining largely underexplored. Herein, we introduce a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) algorithm with two physics informed constraints (printability and Tg) to optimize two conflicting properties: tensile strength (\u03c3T) and toughness (UT). The two constraints are formulated as two machine learning (ML) models, which are trained with weight ratios of the six input monomers and physics informed (PI) descriptors derived from their physiochemical parameters. Dimensional reduction analysis reveals that the algorithm avoids recommendation of the monomer ratios that do not pass the two constraints. The printing failure rate is reduced from 16% in the background experiments to 3% in the recommended experiments. Within only 36 iterations (72 samples), the MOBO algorithm successfully identifies five sets of ratios leading to Pareto optimal of \u03c3T and UT. Due to the constraint in Tg they show appropriate Tg for shape memory application. The partial dependence analysis indicates that \u03c3T and UT depend on both the ratios and physiochemical features of the monomers.

Synthetic efforts have focused on reducing strong transverse ligand fields in these systems, as they are known to enhance magnetic relaxation by spin-phonon mechanisms. Here we show that equatorial coordination of the halobenzenes PhX (X = F, Cl, Br) and o-C6H4F2 to the cation of a recently reported dysprosocenium complex [Dy(Cpttt)(Cp*)][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (Cpttt = C5H2tBu3-1,2,4; Cp* = C5Me5) reduces magnetic hysteresis temperatures compared to the parent cation.

We observe unusual divergent behavior of relaxation rates at low temperature in [Dy(Cpttt)(Cp*)(PhX)][Al{OC(CF3)3}4], which we attribute to a phonon bottleneck effect.

Coacervates are commonly used as model systems that mimic the physiochemical properties of biomolecular condensates, and are simultaneously studied as protocell models. The surface of condensates plays a key role in governing the exchange of molecules between condensates and their surroundings, the accumulation of species at the interface, and the stability of condensates against coalescence. However, most important surface properties, including the surface charge, remain poorly characterized and understood. The surface potential of coacervates is often measured using laser doppler electrophoresis, which assumes a size-independent electrophoretic mobility. Here, we show that this assumption is incorrect for condensates and present an alternative method to study the electrophoretic mobility of coacervates by microelectrophoresis and single-particle tracking, using electric fields of 1-15 V/cm. Coacervates have a size-dependent electrophoretic mobility, originating from their fluid nature, from which a well-defined zeta potential is calculated. We demonstrate the performance of our methodology on several complex coacervates and condensate models, which all exhibit size-dependent mobility. Interestingly, microelectrophoresis measurements revealed that polylysine chains are enriched at the surface of polylysine/polyaspartic acid complex coacervates, which causes the negatively charged protein \u0251-synuclein to adsorb and accumulate at the interface. Addition of ATP was able to invert the surface charge and displace the adsorbed \u0251-synuclein from the surface, which could suppress its interface-catalyzed aggregation.

To this end we experimentally measured the zero-shear viscosity of mixed micelle systems comprised of cocoamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) and sodium lauryl sarcosinate (SLSar), and characterised the early stages of self-assembly of the same systems in simulation, as a function of the CAPB / SLSar mole ratio and pH.

On the one hand, novel de novo-generated molecules cannot be refuted by retrospective validation (so that this type of validation is biased); but on the other hand prospective validation is expensive and then often biased by the human selection process. In this case study, we frame retrospective validation as the ability to mimic human drug design, by answering the following question: Can a generative model trained on early-stage project compounds generate middle/late-stage compounds de novo? To this end, we used experimental data that contains the elapsed time of a synthetic expansion following hit identification from five public (where the time series was pre-processed to better reflect realistic synthetic expansions) and six in-house project datasets, and used REINVENT as a widely adopted RNN-based generative model. After splitting the dataset and training REINVENT on early-stage compounds, we found that rediscovery of middle/late-stage compounds was much higher in public projects (at 1.60%, 0.64%, and 0.21% of the top 100, 500, and 5,000 scored generated compounds) than in in-house projects (where the values were 0.00%, 0.03%, and 0.04%, respectively). Similarly, average single nearest neighbour similarity between early- and middle/late-stage compounds in public projects was higher between active compounds than inactive compounds; however, for in-house projects the converse was true, which makes rediscovery (if so desired) more difficult. We hence show that the generative model recovers very few middle/late-stage compounds from real-world drug discovery projects, highlighting the fundamental difference between purely algorithmic design and drug discovery as a real-world process. Evaluating de novo compound design approaches appears, based on the current study, difficult or even impossible to do retrospectively. \n\"Scientific Contribution\" This contribution hence illustrates aspects of evaluating the performance of generative models in a real-world setting which have not been extensively described previously and which hopefully contribute to their further future development.", "date": "2023-11-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this study, unary steam adsorption equilibrium data was measured at 110\u00b0C and up to approximately 1.0 bar partial pressure with a steam microscale dynamic column breakthrough (\u03bcDCB) apparatus using a milligram quantities of adsorbent. These partial pressures are equivalent to those used in industrial carbon capture processes.

Three adsorbents were considered in this study: an activated carbon (Calgon BPL), an amine-functionalized polymer (Lewatit VP OC 1065), and a metal-organic framework (CALF-20). It was observed that steam adsorbs strongly on all three materials at 110\u00b0C. Activated carbon and Lewatit displayed type-3 isotherm shapes, and CALF-20 displayed a type-5 isotherm shape.

We have compared Vietnam Good Agricultural Practice (VIETGAP) with an organic (ORGANIC) production technique in Thua Thien-Hue province, Vietnam. This paper reports the results of the collection and analysis of the fresh mass, the dry mass, the raw ethanol/water extracts, and the levels of the main bioactive triterpenoids: madecassic, asiatic and terminolic acids over the course of two years. We found that the ratios of the dry mass to fresh mass, and extracts to dry mass were similar in both cases, with maximum raw extracts/dry mass ratios of 37% (VIETGAP) and 33% (organic). We have monitored these changes with respect to the seasons and found that the best time to harvest for bioactive compounds in this location is June-September, when the weather is warmer and drier. These results show that switching to an organic production method is not detrimental to the accumulation of valuable bioactive compounds, and we anticipate that application of these results will contribute to increasing the economic and social value of Centella asiatica while reducing the use of agrochemicals which can be deleterious to the environment and the health of farmers.", "date": "2023-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To pave the way for understanding their sensing behavior on an atomistic scale, we ask whether their properties can be modeled by a single, flat, particle\u2013particle interface. Employing reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations and a tight-binding density functional the- ory approach to coherent tunneling, we find that for alkane dithiolates, where most molecules will typically bridge between the gold surfaces, the interparticle distances, as well as the conductivity of the assembly, can be modeled to even quantitative accuracy with a single-interface model \u2014 if comparing to sufficiently large GPNs for which the flat surface is a good approximation. For alkane monothiols, where each molecule is only attached on one side, the difficulty of estimating surface density and the resulting degree of interlacing results, in our case, in underestimating the interparticle distances by around 5 \u00c5. The increase of these distances (and the decrease of conductivity) as going to longer alkane chains, however, is still well reproduced. We discuss shortcomings of ReaxFF, such as not being able to describe thiol physisorption and producing spurious reactions between dithiolates, as well as factors influencing the validity of a single, flat, particle\u2013particle interface model. Our model reduces the system complexity significantly compared to simulating entire GNP assemblies, enabling further mechanistic investigations of sensing properties of these systems with atomistic approaches, and, potentially, screening of ligands for specific sensing applications.

Complete tumor removal is one precondition to reach this goal. A promising approach to optimize resection margins and eliminate remaining infiltrative so-called guerilla cells is photodynamic therapy (PDT) using organic photosensitizers that can pass the disrupted blood-brain-barrier and selectively accumulate in tumor tissue. Hypericin fulfills these conditions and additionally offers outstanding photophysical properties, making it an excellent choice as a photosensitizing molecule for PDT. However, the actual hypericin-induced PDT cell death mechanism is still under debate.

Hypericin PDT and FLIM image acquisition were simultaneously induced by 405 nm laser irradiation and sequences of FLIM images and fluorescence spectra were recorded to analyze the PDT progression. The reproducibly observed cellular changes provide insight into the mechanism of cell death during PDT and suggest that apoptosis is the initial mechanism followed by necrosis after continued irradiation.

This study examined the impact of pore size in agarose gels on the yield and purity of EVs isolated by Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). We systematically compared the performance of agarose gels with different degrees of crosslinking (Sepharose CL-2B, CL-4B, and CL-6B) using both HPLC-SEC and gravity-based protocols, utilizing the supernatant from isolated human platelets redispersed in an additive solution containing plasma as the source of EVs. The experimental design involved the precise determination of EV elution volumes, identification of EV fractions based on associated markers, and assessment of co-eluted plasma constituents. The findings indicated that smaller pore sizes of the gels led to increased co-elution of lipoproteins with EVs. Yet, they also enhanced EV yields, highlighting a trade-off between yield and purity. Specifically, the CL-6B gel, with the smallest pore size, demonstrated the highest EV yield and lipoprotein contamination among the compared gels. Consequently, the selection of SEC gel for EV purification should be tailored to the requirements of the subsequent analysis, balancing yield and purity considerations.

Unlike most kinetic studies, which focus on electron transport, here we consider reaction kinetics with a focus on chemical mass transport. To achieve this, we used a precision microfluidic reactor which accurately controlled acetate concentration ([Ac]), flow rate (Q), and flow direction (tangential and perpendicular), while output current (I) from a mature Geobacter sulfurreducens electroactive biofilm (EAB) was measured. A detailed analysis of the effects of the control variables on the current (I) were evaluated over a long timeframe, between 1 month to nearly 1 year. The results indicate that all experimental parameters have effects on outputs, but overall, age is the dominant factor. After nearly 1 year, current densities were as high as 29.5 A m-1, which is higher than any other 3-electrode experiment on G. sulfurreducens EAB. The main mechanisms for high outputs at early stages appeared to be related to EAB deacidification, whereas for the old EAB, increases were related to significantly higher acetate permeability due to structural changes in the EAB. Additionally, each flow mode exhibits complementary kinetic properties based on a quantitative analysis of apparent enzyme/substrate affinity (KM(app)) and maximum current (Imax) values. Therefore, in addition to providing valuable insights to the biosensors and bioelectronics community, these findings open the door to practical approaches for optimization of BES device design and operation.", "date": "2023-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Microbiology; Biocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The barrier to rotational interconversion (~45 kJ/mol) is too large for isomerization to occur under ambient conditions. This paper presents evidence of a change in conformer abundance when dilute CH3ONO is deposited onto a cold substrate; the relative population of the freshly deposited cis conformer is seen to increase compared to its gas-phase abundance, measured by in-situ infrared spectroscopy. We observe abundance changes depending on the identity of the bath gas (N2, Ar, and Xe) and deposition angle. The observations indicate that the surface properties of the growing matrix influence conformer abundance\u2014contrary to the widely held assumption that conformer abundance in matrices reflects gas-phase abundance. We posit that differences in the angle-dependent host-gas deposition dynamics affect surface morphology, causing changes in conformer abundances. Quantum chemistry calculations of the binding energies between CH3ONO and a single bath-gas component reveal that the N2:cis\u00ac-CH3ONO complex is stabilized relative to the N2:trans-CH3ONO complex.  However, significant energetic stabilization is not observed in 1:1 complexes of Ar:CH3ONO or Xe:CH3ONO. From our results, we conclude that the surface morphologies play a significant role in trapping cis-CH3ONO more effectively than trans-CH3ONO, likely because cis-CH3ONO is more compact. Taken together, the observations highlight the necessity for careful characterization of conformers in matrix-isolated systems, emphasizing a need for further study into the deposition dynamics and surface structure of chemically inert matrices.", "date": "2023-11-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To this end, this paper investigates recycling cathode material from an end-of-life Gen 1 Nissan Leaf (2011 model, 40,000 miles) which contains a mixture of spinel (LMO) and a Ni-rich layered oxide (LO). Citric acid was employed to selectively leach LMO into solution while leaving the remaining LO as a solid.

The underlying dynamics have been well characterized for mononuclear Fe(II) spin-crossover (SCO) complexes, where it was shown that the spin transition can induce coherent activation of metal-ligand breathing and bending vibrational modes, identified as the main reaction coordinates. While precise characterization of the femtosecond nuclear wave packet brings rich information on photoinduced spin transitions, it is scarcely explored in bimetallic Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs). In this work, we performed transient absorption spectroscopy with sub-20 fs time resolution on the [Cs0.7Co(Fe(CN)6)0.9] PBA to unravel high-frequency coherent structural dynamics, which is interpreted as the activation of a low-symmetry CoN6 Jahn-Teller mode at 12 THz. This coherent fingerprint shows that the photoexcitation initially drives motion along the Jahn-Teller coordinate before the spin transition occurs, i.e., over less than 50 fs. These results are in stark contrast with conventional activation of fully-symmetric breathing modes reported for several SCO compounds, thus providing new insights on the ultrafast spin-transition-induced charge transfer dynamics in PBAs.

In this regard, the influence of SBA-15 mesoporous silica, as a host matrix, on the photophysical properties of Europium-trisdipicolinate cesium salt was investigated. The lanthanide complex can be completely and reversibly adsorbed on the silica, using incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) in water, without the need of anchoring groups or covalent bonding on the silica surface. This specific procedure allows the homogeneous dispersion of the lanthanide complex into the host silica matrix. Appropriately assessing the photophysical properties of the targeted luminescent material proved remarkably challenging, demanding utmost caution, particularly due to the strong scattering of the mesoporous matrices. Additionally, while our observations confirm an important increase of luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide complexes upon integration into these mediums, we attribute this variation to the differing refractive indexes and not to specific surface interactions or confinement effect. Indeed, it appeared that previous literature precedents depicted erroneous exhalations of the complexes intrinsic quantum yield due to the repeated use of erroneous refractive index values. In the meantime, the luminance of these materials under UV irradiation improves drastically in comparison to what is obtained with the physical dispersion of micro-crystals of the lanthanide complex onto silica. We demonstrate that this improvement is due to a reduced inner filter effect in the adsorbed samples.

Instead of relying on a distinct CG solvent model, AdSoS is based on CG models defined by a dimensional scaling of the FG solvent by a factor s, accompanied by the s-dependent modulation of its mass and interaction parameters. The latter changes are designed to achieve an isomorphism between the dynamics of the FG and CG models, and to preserve the dispersive and dielectric solvation properties of the solvent with respect to a solute at FG resolution. As a result, the AdSoS scheme minimizes the thermodynamic mismatch between the different regions of the adaptive-resolution system.

In this report, we present the rigorous optical dispersion data analysis of single crystal MAPbBr3 involving variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry data appended with transmission intensity data. This approach yields a more robust derivation of MAPbBr3 optical constants (refractive index, n, and extinction coefficient, k) for both anomalous (absorptance) and normal (no absorptance) optical dispersion regimes. Using the derived optical constants for our MAPbBr3 single crystals, illustrative modeled solar cell device designs are presented in relation to non-realistic designs prepared using representative optical constants reported in the literature to date. In comparison, our derived optical dispersion data enables the modeled design of realistic planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) optical performance where the active layer (MAPbBr3) is optimized for maximum solar radiation absorption. We further demonstrate optimized modeled planar PSC designs with minimal parasitic optical absorptance in non-active PSC device layers resulting in improved performance at broad angles of incidence (approximately 0-70\u00b0).

These compounds were converted to hydrido chlorides by treatment with dihydrogen (H2) and a base. By converting to tert-butoxide derivatives in situ under an atmosphere of H2, the poly hydride PCalkylP complexes LHRRu(H)3 compounds were generated. In these complexes, H2 has added across the Ru=C bond in the PCcarbeneP starting materials. The polyhydrides are dynamic in solution and extensive NMR studies helped to elucidate the speciation and fluxional processes operative in this dynamic system. The polyhydride complexes react rapidly with CO2 to give the PCcarbeneP formato hydride complexes LRRu(H)-kappa-2-O2CH. For R = H, the 1,2-hydride shift from the anchoring alkyl of the PCalkylP carbon to the metal is reversible, but for R = NMe2 it is irreversible. The CO2 incorporated into the formato ligand of these compounds exchanges with free CO2 via a bimolecular mechanism that is more rapid for R = NMe2 than for R = H; plausible explanations for this observation are proffered. Experiments designed to evaluate the efficacy of the R = NMe2 formato hydride complex as a catalyst precursors for CO2 hydrogenation to formate salts reveal poor performance in comparison to state-of-the-art ruthenium-based catalysts.

The integration of secondary amines\u2014 monoethanolamine (MEA), aminomethyl propanol (AMP), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)\u2014with the benchmark ethylenediamine (EDA) was thoroughly studied, evaluating their impact on absorption and desorption kinetics and capacities, and electrochemical performance.

They contain secondary phases, binders, residual chemicals, and various types of defects. It is of paramount importance to evaluate the degree of crystallinity and accessibility of different pore compartments to adsorbing guest molecules.

The range of d-block metal complexes that can catalyze dinitrogen reduction to ammonia or tris(silyl)amines under ambient conditions has increased in recent years, and now includes more electropositive metal complexes, rather than the traditional electron-rich middle and late d-block cations used by nature and industry. Conventional f-block metal complexes do not have filled d-orbitals that would enable binding of N2. Here, arene-bridged tetraphenolates are used to form metallacyclic structures by coordination to lanthanide or group 4 cations that can bind dinitrogen in the cavity and catalyze its conversion to bis(silyl)amines in ambient conditions. The unusual double-substitution product is attributed to the steric control afforded by the metalacycle\u2019s pocket. This is the first time that lanthanide complexes (and zirconium) have been shown to catalyze nitrogen reduction, and the reactivity of the most active, samarium, is attributed to the strong, yet accessible, reducing capacity of its divalent oxidation state, and the ability of the structure to retain group 1 metal cations in the catalyst coordination sphere. The group 4 complexes featuring small cavities are most selective for the formation of bis(silyl)amine, while the lanthanide complexes, with larger cavities, are also able to make the traditional tris(silyl)amine product from N2. A series of experimental, analytical, spectroscopic, and computational studies provide insight into the mechanism of the reductive functionalization.

Two physical models \u2013self-trapped exciton and defect-induced Stokes-shift \u2013 have been proposed to explain this unconventional phenomenon. However, both explanations provide limited rationalizations without consideration of the formidable compositional space, and thus, the fundamental origin of broadband PL remains elusive. Herein, we established our high-throughput automated experimental workflow to systematically explore the broadband PL in mixed Pb-Sn 2D MHPs, employing PEA (phenethylammonium) as a model cation known to work as a rigid organic spacer. Spectrally, the broadband PL becomes further broadened with rapid PEA2PbI4 phase segregation with increasing Pb concentrations during early-stage crystallization. Counterintuitively, MHPs with high Pb concentrations exhibit prolonged PL lifetimes despite high defect densities. Hyperspectral microscopy identifies substantial PEA2PbI4 phase segregation in those films, hypothesizing that the establishment of charge transfer excitons by the phase segregation upon crystallization is responsible for the extraordinary behavior; at high-Pb compositions, this far outperforms the leverage of defect-induced emission, thereby resulting in distinctive PL properties.

Since 2010, over 600 new catalysed hydroboration protocols have been reported despite the prevalence of hidden borane catalysis across hydroboration reactions using HBcat and HBpin. Nucleophilic species, present as either activators, additives or inherent to the catalyst structure, readily mediate the decomposition of HBpin and HBcat to boranes, including (ligated) BH3.

Traditional methods, often reliant on solid surfaces, necessitate complex and labor-intensive procedures. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) systems emerged as promising due to their ability to extract biomolecules via the partition effect. Inspired by the biomolecular compartmentalization observed in cellular organelles, we form coacervates via associative LLPS for concentrating a diverse range of biomolecules, significantly enhancing sensitivity and lowering detection limits of biomolecules by condensing biomolecules in compartments. We demonstrate that under optimal conditions these coacervates can achieve an enrichment factor of up to 22.8 for DNA, surpassing the efficiency of segregative LLPS. This results in significantly enhanced sensitivity for DNA detection. Through fluorescence microscopy, microplate readers, and flow cytometry, we establish that coacervate droplets are approximately 21 times more effective in reducing the limit of detection (LOD) for DNA compared to segregative LLPS droplets. The superior performance of coacervates is attributed to non-covalent interactions between DNA and molecules within coacervates, enabling ultra-sensitive quantification without the need for complex instrumentation or signal amplification.

The impact of mixed protein assemblies on surface composition and interfacial shear mechanics remains broadly unexplored, in comparison to the impact that formulation has on dilatational mechanics and surface tension or pressure. In this report, we use interfacial shear rheology to quantify the evolution of interfacial shear moduli as a function of composition in bovine serum albumin (BSA)/b-casein mixed assemblies. We present the striking difference in mechanics of these two protein and observe the dominance of -casein in regulating interfacial shear mechanics. This observation correlates well with the strong asymmetry of adsorption of these two proteins, characterised by fluorescence microscopy. Using neutron reflectometry and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we examine the architecture of corresponding protein assemblies and their surface diffusion, providing evidence for distinct morphologies, but surprisingly comparable diffusion profiles. Finally, we explore the impact of crosslinking and sequential protein adsorption on the interfacial shear mechanics of corresponding assemblies. Overall, this work indicates that, despite comparable surface densities, BSA and b-casein assemblies at liquid-liquid interfaces display almost 2 orders of magnitude difference in interfacial shear storage modulus and strikingly different viscoelastic profiles. In addition, co-adsorption and sequential adsorption processes are found to further modulate interfacial shear mechanics.

These recognition elements match with complex machineries through a variety of non-covalent interactions, enabling specific targeting of functions. In contrast, most approaches in non-equilibrium systems do not consider the structure of the fuel as a critical element to control the processes. Herein, we show that the amino acid side chains (A, F, Nap) in the structure of activated aminoacyl phosphate esters can direct assembly and reactivity in the context of non-equilibrium structure formation. We focus on the ways in which the activated amino acids guide structure formation and how structures and reactivity cross regulate when constructing different assemblies. Through the chemical functionalization of energy-rich aminoacyl phosphate esters, we are able to control the coupling yield to esters and thioesters upon adding dipeptides containing tyrosine or cysteine amino acid residues. The structural elements around the phosphate esters guide the lifetime of the structures formed and their supramolecular assemblies, which can further be influenced by the structure and reactivity of dipeptide substrates. Moreover, we demonstrate that an aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y) can autonomously generate a pool of high energy molecules, where dynamic oligomerization and de-oligomerization of esters occurs in a single step process.

It is often infeasible or undesirable to replace a solvent with its perdeuteriated form, for example when analysing formulations in situ, when exchangeable protons are present, or for practical reasons. Solvent signal suppression techniques are therefore required. WATERGATE methods are well known to provide good solvent suppression while enabling retention of signals undergoing chemical exchange with the solvent signal. Spectra of mixtures, such as pharmaceutical formulations, are often complicated by signal overlap, high dynamic range, the narrow spectral width of 1H NMR, and signal multiplicity. Here, we show that, by combining WATERGATE solvent suppression with pure shift NMR, ultra-high resolution 1H NMR spectra can be acquired while suppressing intense solvent signals and retaining exchangeable 1H signals.

These VOCs offer valuable insights into factors such as freshness, fertility, the presence of cracks, embryo sex, and breed. In our study, we assessed three mass spectrometry-based systems (headspace sorptive extraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HSSE-GC-MS, proton transfer reaction time-of-flight-mass spectrometry; PTR-TOF-MS; and selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry; SIFT-MS) to analyze and identify VOCs present in intact hatching eggs from three distinct breeds (Dekalb white layer, Shaver brown layer, and Ross 308 broiler). The eggs were sampled on incubation days 2 and 8, to identify VOCs that distinguish breeds irrespective of incubation day. VOC measurements were conducted on 15 eggs per breed by placing them together with PDMS-coated stir bars inside inert Teflon\u00ae air sampling bags. After an accumulation period of 2 hours, the headspace was analyzed using PTR-TOF-MS and SIFT-MS, while the VOCs adsorbed onto the stir bars were analyzed using GC-MS for additional compound identification. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were constructed for breed differentiation, and variable selection was performed. As a result, 111 VOCs were identified using HSSE-GC-MS, with alcohols and esters being the most abundant. The PLS-DA models demonstrated the efficacy of breed discrimination, with the HSSE-GC-MS and the PTR-TOF-MS exhibiting the highest balanced accuracy of 95.5% using a reduced set of 11 VOCs and 5 product ion masses, respectively. The SIFT-MS model had a balanced accuracy of 92.8% with a reduced set of 11 product ion masses.

In this work, we present an optimization framework to carry out the bottom-up design of porous electrodes by coupling a genetic algorithm with a pore network modeling framework. We introduce geometrical versatility by adding a pore merging and splitting function, study the impact of various optimization parameters, geometrical definitions, and objective functions, and incorporate electrode structures and flow field with well-defined geometries.

We found that for kinetically sluggish electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, electrodes with numerous small pores and high internal surface area provide enhanced performance, whereas for kinetically facile electrolytes with low ionic conductivity, low through-plane tortuosity and high hydraulic conductance are required.

In this work we present a new method to quantify anodic corrosion and determine average corrosion rates as a function of solution composition, current density and BDD material. The method uses white light interferometry (WLI), in conjunction with BDD electrodes integrated into 3D-printed flow cells, to measure three-dimensional changes in surface structure pre- and post-anodic corrosion over a 72-hr period. It is equally applicable to both thin film BDD and much thicker, freestanding BDD. As WLI lends itself to large area measurements, data are collected over geometric areas of 0.5 cm2. In particular it is shown that the addition of 1 M acetic acid to a 0.5 M potassium sulfate solution results in an increase in the average corrosion rate of ~\u00d760 (for freestanding polished BDD). In the same solution, thin film BDD is found to corrode ~\u00d72 faster than freestanding polished BDD.

We perform feature selection using random forest-ranked recursive feature addition (RF-RFA) to identify the features essential to model transferability. Of the ML models considered, the full feature set random forest (RF) and recursive feature addition RF models perform best, achieving moderate correlation to experimental T1/2 values. We then compare ML T1/2 predictions to those from three previously identified best- performing density functional approximations (DFAs) which accurately predict SCO behavior across SCO-95, finding that the ML models predict T1/2 more accurately than the best-performing DFAs. In addition, we study ML model predictions on the set of 18 SCO complexes for which only estimated T1/2 values are available. Upon excluding outliers from this set, the RF-RFA RF model shows strong correlation to estimated T1/2 values with a Pearson\u2019s r of 0.82. In contrast, DFA-predicted T1/2 values have large errors and show no correlation to estimated T1/2 values over the same set of complexes.

We demonstrate here how various technologies are ripe enough to enable much more fluent, immersive and natural human-computer interactions that in turn facilitate collaboration between human users, using affordable hardware through the internet and without even installing any specialized programs. For this, we introduce HandMol, a web app that exploits (i) WebXR for molecular visualization and manipulation in virtual reality, (ii) speech recognition coupled to a large language model to pass commands orally, (iii) speech synthesis for auditory feedback, (iv) WebRTC to communicate multiple instances of the tool without even requiring a server, and (v) external APIs to flexibly account for molecular mechanics, exemplified here with an endpoint running an AMBER forcefield for protein and nucleic acids and another running a DFT-trained neural network, ANI-2x, to allow exploration of conformation and some simple reactivity at high speed and accuracy. We show example applications to situations from daily work and education in chemistry and structural biology where HandMol can provide an advantage over traditional software: exploring and explaining molecular conformations and reactivity, docking and undocking small molecules into/out of protein pockets, threading molecules through nanopores, preparing systems for molecular simulations and for protein design, etc. We also present a brief study showing how users, even with limited or even no experience in VR, can significantly benefit from these kinds of technologies.

In recent years, the Markov State Model (MSM) constructed from extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex protein conformational changes. In MSMs, dynamics are modeled as a sequence of Markovian transitions among metastable conformational states at discrete time intervals (called lag time). A major challenge for MSM is that the lag time must be long enough to allow transitions among states to become memoryless (or Markovian). However, this lag time is constrained by the length of individual MD simulations available to track these transitions. To address this challenge, we have recently developed Generalized Master Equation (GME)-based approaches, encoding non-Markovian dynamics using a time-dependent memory kernel. In this tutorial, we introduce the theory behind two recently developed GME-based non-Markovian dynamic models: the Quasi Markov State Model (qMSM) and the Integrative Generalized Master Equation (IGME). We subsequently outline the procedures for constructing these models and provide a step-by-step tutorial on applying qMSM and IGME to study two peptide systems: the alanine dipeptide and villin headpiece.

The computational modelling of complex polysaccharide phases will assist in understanding the properties and behaviour of all these systems. In this paper, structural, bonding and mechanical properties of $10$ wt\\% cellulose-callose hydrogels ($\\beta$-glucans co-existing in plant cell walls) were investigated by atomistic simulations. Systems of this kind have recently been introduced in experiments revealing unexpected interactions between the polysaccharides.

The simulation shows that the relatively homogeneous distribution of saccharide nanofibres and chains in water is not due to the solubility of cellulose and callose, but to the formation of a number of cross-links among the various sample components. The broad  distribution of strength and elasticity among the links implies a degree of anharmonicity and irreversible deformation already evident at low external load. Besides the qualitative agreement with experimental observations, the simulation results display also quantitative disagreements in the estimation of elastic coefficients such as the Young's modulus that require further investigation. Complementary simulations of dense cellulose-callose mixtures (no hydrogels) highlight the role of callose in smoothing the contact surface of different nanofibres forming larger bundles. Cellulose-callose structures in these systems displayed an enhanced water uptake and delayed dye release when compared to cellulose alone, highlighting potential new applications as drug delivery scaffolds.

However, they frequently suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) compared to established donor-acceptor TADF emitters, leading to severe device efficiency roll-off at high exciton densities. Introducing heavy atom effects (HAE) by core-substitution has been previously shown to enhance spin orbit coupling and thus RISC in MR-TADF emitters, frequently with oxygen atoms replaced by isoelectronic sulfur or selenium. Here, we explore an alternate HAE strategy using peripheral halogenation of the MR-TADF DiKTa core, comparing tBr-DiKTa and dBr-tBu-DiKTa with non-halogenated Mes3-DiKTa. The two brominated emitters demonstrate improved kRISC because of the HAE, while the rate appears to improve by an additional order of magnitude in mCP host, because of intermolecular (guest-host) interaction. Despite the beneficial hetero-intermolecular interactions, strong homo-intermolecular interactions result in enhanced non-radiative pathways and lower photoluminescence quantum yields. OLEDs of dBr-tBu-DiKTa hence showed comparable EQEmax with Mes3-DiKTa (21%) and improved efficiency roll-off until 500 cd m-2, although with accelerated roll-off beyond a critical current density. Together with comparisons in less strongly doped devices, these results show that the HAE provided by peripheral halogens improves the device performance up to 500 cd m-2, but also support detrimental intermolecular interactions that dominate at higher device currents.

Accurately determining the global minima of a molecular structure is important in diverse scientific fields, including drug design, materials science, and chemical synthesis. Conformational search engines serve as valuable tools for exploring the extensive conformational space of molecules and identifying energetically favorable conformations. In this study, we present a comparison of Auto3D, CREST, Balloon, and ETKDG (from RDKit), which are freely available conformational search engines, to evaluate their effectiveness in locating the global minima. These engines employ distinct methodologies, including machine learning (ML) potential-based, semiempirical, and force field (FF) based approaches. To validate these methods, we propose the use of collisional cross section (CCS) values obtained from ion mobility \u2013 mass spectrometry (IM-MS) studies. We hypothesize that experimental gas-phase CCS values can provide experimental evidence that we likely have the global minimum for a given molecule. To facilitate this effort, we used our gas-phase conformation library (GPCL) which currently consists of the full ensembles of 20 small molecules, which can be used by the community to validate any conformational search engine. Further members of the GPCL can be readily created for any molecule of interest using our standard workflow used to compute CCS values expanding the ability of the GPCL in validation exercises. These innovative validation techniques enhance our understanding of the conformational landscape and provide valuable insights into the performance of conformation generation engines. Our findings shed light on the strengths and limitations of each search engine, enabling informed decisions for their utilization in various scientific fields, where accurate molecular structure determination is crucial for understanding biological activity and designing targeted interventions. By facilitating the identification of reliable conformations, this study significantly contributes to enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of molecular structure determination, with a particular focus on metabolite structure elucidation.

A consequence of this substantial improvement is a desire to re-optimise treatment for efficiency, minimise potential environmental impacts and maximize benefits from targeted lead pipe replacement programmes. The extent to which compliance data can be used to provide evidence-based justification for these objectives is examined for supplies in the north-west of England. In the twelve years since the treatment solution was implemented lead non-compliance has steadily fallen from 3.0 % in 2004 to less than 0.3 % over in 2016, despite minimal changes in treatment, indicating that long term structural changes in the corrosion layer are occurring over this timescale. Only by combining regulatory and operational data collected over 5-year period to form a large data set (N=62,810) did significant non-random deviations emerge. The resulting zonal compliance distribution was characterised as a zero-inflated overdispersed Poisson. A large part of the overdispersion was accounted for by the zonal variation in the proportion of properties with lead service pipes. This variation also accounted for the zero-inflated aspect which relates to a substantial number of zones having few or no lead service pipes. Such areas may provide economic opportunity for small lead pipe replacement programmes as an alternative to plumbosolvency treatment. At a regional level compliance varies with property age peaking in the period 1919 and 1940. This is accounted for by the historical selection of lead has the preferred material for service pipes. The analysis shows that in order to assess zonal lead risk from random daytime data it is essential to have quantitative information about the proportion of properties with lead service pipes. Incidentally, it was found that the risk of non-compliance in properties with lead service pipes was nearly thirty times that in properties without lead service pipes. Analysis of compliance data by supply provided only limited justification for re-optimisation of treatment. This issue will get more difficult with further improvement in compliance.", "date": "2023-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Water Purification", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To gain molecular-level insight into the intrinsic binding properties of octamethyl calix[4]pyrrole (omC4P) host molecules with halide guest ions, we performed cryogenic ion vibrational spectroscopy (CIVS) of omC4P in complexes with fluoride, chloride, and bromide ions. We interpret the spectra using density functional theory, describing the infrared spectra of these complexes with both harmonic and anharmonic VPT2 calculations. The NH stretching modes of the pyrrole moieties serve as sensitive probes of the ion binding properties, as their frequencies encode the ion-receptor interactions. While scaled harmonic spectra reproduce the experimental NH stretching modes of the chloride and bromide complexes in broad strokes, the high proton affinity of fluoride introduces strong anharmonic effects. As a result, the spectrum of F\u2212\u00b7omC4P is not even qualitatively captured by harmonic calculations, but it is recovered very well by VPT2 calculations. In addition, the VPT2 calculations recover the intricate coupling of the NH stretching modes with overtones and combination bands of CH stretching and NH bending modes and with low-frequency vibrations of the omC4P macrocycle, which are apparent for all halide ion complexes investigated here. A comparison of the CIVS spectra with infrared spectra of solutions of the same ion-receptor complexes shows how ion solvation changes the ion-receptor interactions for the different halide ions.

Achieving high permeability for desired molecules alongside exceptional rejection of other species presents a significant design challenge. One potential strategy involves optimizing the chemistry and geometry of isolated nanopores to enhance permeability and selectivity, while maximizing their density within a membrane. However, the impact of pore proximity on membrane performance remains an open question. Through path sampling simulations of model graphitic membranes with multiple sub-nanometer pores, we reveal that nanoscale proximity between pores detrimentally affects water permeability and salt rejection. Specifically, counter-ion transport is decelerated, while co-ion transport is accelerated, due to direct interactions between water molecules, salt ions, and the dipoles within neighboring pores. Notably, the observed ionic transport timescales significantly deviate from established theories such as the access resistance model, but are well explained using the simple phenomenological model that we develop in this work. We use this model to pre-screen and optimize pore arrangements that elicit minimal correlations at a target pore density. These findings deepen our understanding of multi-pore systems, informing the rational design of nanoporous membranes for enhanced separation processes such as water desalination. They also shed light onto the physiology of biological cells that employ ion channel proteins to modulate ion transport and reversal potentials.

Here, we introduce a new molecular protonics experimental approach to investigate lateral PT across membranes by measuring long-range lateral proton conduction via a few layers of lipid bilayers in a solid-state-like environment, i.e., without having bulk water surrounding the membrane. This configuration enables focusing on lateral proton conduction across the surface of the membrane while decoupling it from bulk water. Hence, by controlling the relative humidity of the environment, we can directly explore the role of water in the lateral PT process. We show that proton conduction is dependent on the amount of water and their structure, and on membrane composition, where we explore the role of the head group, the level of tail saturation, and the role of the membrane phase and fluidity. The measured PT as a function of temperature shows an inverse temperature dependency, which we explain by the desorption/adsorption of water molecules into the solid membrane platform.

The overall process is easy and biocompatible in that solutions of common iron and molybdate salts are mixed to generate a PIG, which, upon drying under mild temperature, turns into a strengthened ceramic block that displays a high mechanical performance. Analogous to the well-known Prince Rupert\u2019s drop reinforced by residual stress upon quenching, the uneven volume shrinkage from the outside inwards during dehydration builds up residual stress that enables amorphous mineral fusion and strengthening.

First, we identify locally separate water regions (with different structural properties) each around the {N(CH3)3}+ and the C=O functional groups of the PMETAC chain and one around the Cl- ion. These water regions or domains, which are effectively the first hydration shells around the respective moieties, overlap and the extent of the overlap depends on the nature of the species triggering it. Second, despite the overlap, the water molecules in these domains demonstrate disparate properties dictated by the properties of the atoms/groups around which they are located. For example, the N atom is present as the {N(CH3)3}+ group in the PMETAC chain and the presence of the methyl groups make the {N(CH3)3}+ group trigger apolar hydration as evidenced by the corresponding orientation of the dipole of the water molecules within the water domain formed around the {N(CH3)3}+ moiety. Further, we report that the water molecules constituting the apolar hydration layer around the N(CH3)3}+ group have enhanced tetrahedrality as compared to the water molecules constituting the hydration layer around the C=O group and the Cl- counterion. Our simulations also identify that there is an intervening water layer between the Cl- ion and {N(CH3)3}+ group: the stability of this water layer prevents the Cl- ion from coming very close to the {N(CH3)3}+ group, despite the strong electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged species. As a consequence, there is a significantly large mobility of the Cl- ions inside the PMETAC brush layer. Furthermore, the C=O group of the PE chain, due to the partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and the specific structure of the system (namely the fact that the C=O group is a part of the PMETAC chains in brush-like configuration and are significantly away from other influencing moieties), demonstrates strongly hydrophilic behavior and enforces a specific dipole response of water molecules analogous to that experienced by water around anionic species of high charge density. In summary, our findings confirm that PMETAC brushes undergo hydrophilic hydration at one site, apolar hydration at another site, and ensures large mobility of the supported Cl- counterions.

Trends in acid and water extraction clearly show two and three regimes, respectively, but the speciation of HNO3, water, and amine in these regimes is not apparent.  1H-NMR of the organic phase shows that there are at least two distinct acidic protons in the organic phase while ATR-FTIR results show that the organic phase with excess acid extraction is a mixture of trioctylammonium-nitrate ion pairs (TOAH.NO3), and undissociated HNO3 molecules.  Comparison with DFT-computed IR spectra show that the  chain-like configurations of TOAH.NO3.HNO3.H2O are favored over TOAH.NO3.H2O.HNO3, i.e., direct interaction between the two HNO3 molecules is more favored compared to a water-mediated interaction. SAXS of the organic phases were modeled as sums of Ornstein-Zernike (O-Z) scattering and a prepeak feature in the higher Q region, corresponding to features from density fluctuations and extractant packing, respectively. The extraction of undissociated HNO3 by the ion pairs leads to an increased X-ray scattering contrast in the organic phase without any significant change in the O-Z correlation length.  These results show that the organic phase nanostructure is more sensitive to the concentration of TOAH.NO3 and is relatively unaffected by excess acid extraction.

Traditional methods of fabrication of drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) employ the random sequence form of linear PLGA to yield non-crosslinked polymeric NPs that form when the polymer nanoprecipitates out of solution. Given the large-scale use of PLGA-based polymeric drug delivery systems to date, it is crucial to be able to control the ratio and sequence of lactic and glycolic components in the overall drug delivery system, which in turn can impact factors such as stability, drug loading, drug release and degradability. In this work, we present a novel PLGA-inspired NP polymerization technique, which allows the formation of NPs via the cross-linking of precisely sequenced short oligolactoglycolic acid dimethacrylates (OLGADMAs). Following the synthesis of a range of OLGADMAs we successfully generated a library of NPs via this rapid and surfactant-free nanopolymerization method, which permits the simultaneous NP formation and encapsulation of drugs such as dexamethasone. Our results indicate that NPs produced through this nanopolymerization technique with precisely controlled sequences exhibit heightened stability compared to conventionally sequenced and non-sequence controlled PLGA, as evidenced by minimal pH changes over a five-week span. This improved stability is attributed to simultaneous crosslinking and co-polymerization of the OLGADMAs. Moreover, the long-acting NPs demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity and uniform cellular uptake in vitro. We conclude that the ability to precisely regulate the sequence of short PLGA-inspired monomers and employ a unique in situ nanopolymerizing reaction results in exceptionally stable NPs for sustained drug delivery and opens exciting possibilities for the development of a range of long-lasting drug delivery systems with programmable structure and function.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Controlled-Release Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Part I reported on the detailed findings of the experimental program and the physical transport of the particles through the system. A key purpose of the present paper was to deduce the underlying partition surface from relatively basic feed information on the Fe assays obtained as a function of the particle size. Conversion of the feed data into a simple binary description based on the density of hematite and density of silicates was used. This approach then provided a basis for applying the partition surface to a given feed to predict the separation performance. Data from the experiments were compared to values predicted from the partition surface. A least squares objective function was used to deduce the parameters governing the partition surface. Across 12 of the experiments, the key exponent, n, governing the partition surface was found to be 0.26+/-0.02. This result was in very good agreement with the value of 0.28 determined previously. The second key parameter, the Ep, was also determined for each of the experiments. The lowest Ep, found to be 365 kg/m3 for a low slimes viscosity, was also in good agreement with the result reported previously for a deslimed feed.

Optimisation of these processes is usually based on end of pipe measurement made at specific residence times. This process is both time-consuming and the data sometimes challenging to interpret. In the present work, operando nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques both at the scale of the whole bed (global) and spatially-resolved within the bed (local) are used to gain new insights to the catalytic conversion process under reaction conditions. Spatially resolved spectroscopic and diffusion-T2-relaxation (D-T2) methods interrogate local differences in chemical conversion and selectivity, and mass transport (molecular self-diffusion) respectively, thereby providing valuable information for process simulation models.  This capability is demonstrated using the continuous flow three phase (gas-liquid-solid) hydrogenation of benzonitrile over a fixed bed of 0.5 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst pellets yielding toluene and benzylamine. Global 1H spectroscopic and D-T2 were used to monitor chemical conversion and the approach to steady state; these were subsequently followed by spatially resolved 1H spectra and spatially resolved D-T2 correlations to examine the local differences in axial conversion and selectivity of the catalyst bed packing. At steady-state a global conversion of 63% was achieved with 65% and 25% selectivity to benzylamine and toluene respectively.

As biological systems use mechanical forces to regulate several processes, from tissue regeneration to cancer development, we selected alginate-based hydrogels with compressive moduli of breast tissues (1-20 kPa) model different stages of breast cancer development in vitro, and as new drug screening technologies. Human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were cultured on several hydrogels and as different in vitro models (i.e., 3D models and 2.5D models). All hydrogels are cytocompatible, allowing cells growth up to 1 week. We selected 2.5D in vitro models to investigate the correlation between drug efficacy and microenvironment/ECM stiffness, as more similar to standard 2D in vitro models (i.e., 2D/TCP). We selected doxorubicin as models drug, as first-line treatment for breast cancer. Interestingly, doxorubicin was less effective in cells cultured in softer hydrogels (EC50 0.495 \u00b1 0.248 \u03bcM, 6.9 \u00b1 0.6 kPa) than in stiffer ones (EC50 0.189 \u00b1 0.032 \u03bcM, 21.0 \u00b1 3.8 kPa), with the latter being similar to 2D/TCP controls (EC50 0.129 \u00b1 0.028 \u03bcM, > 106 kPa). Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed hydrogel library with decoupled biophysical and biochemical properties enables to better study how microenvironmental cues impact on cell behaviour in vitro. Moreover, results suggest the need to use new approaches in precision medicine to study drug efficacy and resistance in the context of cancer, using in vitro models able to mimic different tumour progression microenvironments as in vivo.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Biocompatible Materials; Biopolymers; Hydrogels", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For this, Porous Boron Nitride (PBN)-PBN 950 and PBN 1050 at two different porosities with low (high) and high (low) specific surface area (SSA) and aspect ratio (AR) respectively, both composed of 2D porous flakes of quasi-crystalline BN of hexagonal phase, arranged in rod and flower pattern were obtained via gas-solid interaction at 950 and 1050oC respectively. Nanofluids of both PBNs in TO displayed a linear relationship between porosity and insulation characteristics with ~26-39 % rise in AC Breakdown Voltage along with Resistivity. It was explained by the role of nanofiller porosity in providing large interfacial zones and deep traps for quantitively scavenging and holding streamer charges at the oil-nanofiller interface. Further, despite of being quasi-crystalline and porous, both PBNs in TO upgraded the thermal properties by quasi-ballistic transfer of acoustic phonons via 2D flakes of hexagonal phase. However, the thermal conductivity varied inversely with porosity with ~ 32.5 - 28 % surge with PBN 950 and PBN 1050, respectively at 50oC. This trend was theoretically supported as well as explained due to the increase in phonon-defect scattering owing to the increase in porosity and pore asymmetry together with reduced AR in PBN 1050. Finally, the unchanged flash and pour points with negligible increase in acidity over months plus the aforementioned results at low filler fractions establishes the superiority of PBN over other BN nanofillers for applications in liquid insulation in future", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Ceramics; Thermal Conductors and Insulators; Nanofluidics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For example, the amount of adsorbed material, as a function of concentration of the material which is not adsorbed, obeys Langmuir's equation. In this paper we argue this relation is valid only for macroscopic (large enough) systems. However, when particle numbers of adsorbate molecules and/or adsorbing sites are small, Langmuir's model fails to describe the chemical equilibrium of the system. This is because the kinetics of forming, or the probability of observing, occupied sites arises from two-body interactions, and as such, ought to include cross-correlations between particle numbers of the adsorbate and adsorbing sites. The effect of these correlations, as reflected by deviations in predicting composition when correlations are ignored, increases with decreasing particle numbers and becomes substantial when only few adsorbate molecules, or adsorbing sites, are present in the system. In addition, any change that augments the fraction of occupied sites at equilibrium (e.g., smaller volume, lower temperature, or stronger adsorption energy) further increases the discrepancy between observed properties of small systems and those predicted by Langmuir's theory. In contrast, for large systems these cross-correlations become negligible, and therefore when expressing properties involving two-body processes, it is possible to consider independently the concentration of each component. By applying statistical mechanics concepts, we derive a general expression of the equilibrium constant for adsorption. It is also demonstrated that in ensembles in which total numbers of particles are fixed, the magnitudes of fluctuations in particle numbers alone, can predict the average chemical composition of the system. Moreover an alternative adsorption equation, predicting the average fraction of occupied sites from the value of the equilibrium constant, is proposed.

For example, the structural changes of a protein can often be followed with spectroscopic tools by utilizing such an interaction. Streptavidin-bound 5-(and-6)-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) biocytin is one of the few systems with which CPI can actually be observed via the fluorescence of TMR. While it has been suggested that the fluorescence is quenched when the ligand is bound to the binding pocket of streptavidin and is recovered after biotin occupies the binding pocket to replace TMR, no clear evidence has been provided yet. In order to gain a better understanding of this CPI, here we propose a possible binding site of TMR in the streptavidin, and predict the binding affinity values of biotin and the TMR moiety of TMR-biocytin conjugate. We estimate that the biotin affinity (-20.2 \u00b1 1.4 kcal/mol) is significantly higher than the TMR-biocytin affinity (-6.91 \u00b1 0.72 kcal/mol and -8.06 \u00b1 0.79 kcal/mol), which supports the earlier explanation on the fluorescence quenching and recovery of biotinylated dyes. We also discover that TMR cannot bind to the streptavidin pocket as perfectly as biotin does, but that it rather blocks the entrance portion of the binding pocket. Fluorescence quenching of TMR-biocytin by streptavidin is measured with time-resolved fluorescence to show that the average fluorescence lifetime of TMR-biocytin decreases from 3.54 ns to 2.54 ns in the presence of excess streptavidin. Based on the distance between TMR and the nearby tryptophan residues, we propose that the nearby tryptophan residues of streptavidin are the potential quenchers of the dye unit fluorescence.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among all MOFs, Ni2X2BTDD (X = F, Cl, Br) stands out as a promising water harvester due to its ability to adsorb substantial amounts of water at low relative humidity (RH). Here, we use advanced molecular dynamics simulations car- ried out with the state-of-the-art MB-pol data-driven many-body potential to monitor water adsorption in the three Ni2X2BTDD variants as a function of RH. Our simulations reveal that the type of halide atom in the three Ni2X2BTDD frameworks significantly influences the corresponding molecular mechanisms of water adsorption: while water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with the fluoride atoms in Ni2F2BTDD, they tend to form hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atoms of the triazolate linkers in Ni2Cl2BTDD and Ni2Br2BTDD. Importantly, the large size of the bromide atoms reduces the void volume in the Ni2Br2BTDD pores, which enable water molecules to initiate an extended hydrogen-bond network at lower RH. These findings not only underscore the prospect for precisely tuning structural and chemical modifications of the frameworks to optimize their interaction with water, but also highlight the predictive power of simulations with the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential.

The results suggest that hot exciton localization within the manifold of excited states is caused by the hindrance of \u03a6I- and \u03a6P - torsional rotation in the monomeric units of a dimer. This hindrance arises due to weak \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction in the dimer resulting in an energetically uphill excited-state barrier for \u03a6I- and \u03a6P - twisted rotation impeding the isomerization process in chromophore. Thus, the study highlights the potential impact of the weak \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction regulating the photodynamics of the green fluorescent protein chromophore derivatives.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In such cases, it becomes imperative to construct a training set that includes the most diverse, representative, and informative samples. Here, a novel regression tree-based active learning algorithm is employed for such a purpose. It is applied to predict band gap and adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of materials that results from the virtually infinite combinations of their building units. Simpler and low dimensional descrip- tors, such as the Stoichiometric-120 and geometric properties, found here to better represent MOFs in the low data regime, are used to compute the feature space for this model. The partition given by a regression tree constructed on the labeled part of the dataset is used to select new samples to be added to the training set, thereby limiting its size while maximizing the prediction quality. Through tests on the QMOF, hMOF, and dMOF data sets, we show that our method is effective in constructing small training data sets to learn regression models that predict well the target properties, thus reducing the label- ing cost. Specifically, our active learning approach is highly beneficial when labels are unevenly distributed in the descriptor space and when the label distribution is imbalanced, which is often the case for real world data. This offers a unique tool to efficiently analyze complex structure-property relationships in materials and accelerate materials discovery.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Not only are direct dynamics of the neutral thiobase impacted, but also the dynamics of excess electron accommodation. In this work, time resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) is used to measure binary anionic clusters of iodide and 4-thiouracil, I\u02c94TU. We investigate charge transfer dynamics driven by excitation at 3.88 eV, corresponding to the lowest \u03c0\u03c0* transition of the thiouracil, and 4.16 eV, near the cluster vertical detachment energy.  The photoexcited state dynamics are probed by photodetachment with 1.55 eV and 3.146 eV pulses. Excitation at 3.88 eV leads to signal from the valence-bound ion only, indicating a charge accommodation mechanism that does not utilize the dipole-bound anion as an intermediate. Excitation at 4.16 eV rapidly gives rise to dipole-bound and valence-bound ion signals, with a second rise in valence-bound signal corresponding to the decay of the dipole-bound signal. The dynamics associated with the low energy \u03c0\u03c0* excitation of 4-thiouracil provide clear experimental proof for the importance of localized excitation and electron backfilling in halide-nucleobase clusters.

Classical pairwise additive models have been widely utilized for elaborating the underlying mechanism behind the relaxation phenomena. However, they have shown their limits due to either the absence or inaccurate descriptions of many-body and medium-to-long-range interactions. This work demonstrates that the Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) model trained with SCAN functional help calculate the dielectric constant at the accuracy of the first-principles simulations. The DPMD model outperforms the classical force fields (SPC/Fw and TIP4P/epsilon) in predicting dielectric spectra especially in replicating high-frequency excesses, attributed to its adeptness in simulating intricate hydrogen bond networks. Through a comprehensive analysis of the simulation results, it becomes evident that only the DPMD model effectively accommodates a wide range of hydrogen bond coordination scenarios thereby characterizing the intricate nature of the hydrogen bond network. This adaptability stems from the intricate interplay of many-body interactions and intramolecular dynamics. In addition, orientation defects within the DPMD model play a significant role in shaping the potential energy barrier due to the adaptability.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Given 6PPD's application as an antioxidant in a wide array of rubber products and wastes, cost-effective measurement of 6PPD is important for product and waste management. We herein developed a naked-eye colorimetric method for the rapid measurement (<10 min) of 6PPD in rubber products and wastes with low cost (<$1 per sample). The inspiration for this method stems from the observation of the formation of red-colored products when 6PPD is exposed to oxidants, at concentrations as low as 0.65 mg/L. The remarkable selectivity of the method was evaluated by 15 other structurally diverse phenols and anilines. LC-UV and mass spectrometry results corroborated N-1,3-dimethyl butyl-N\u2019-phenyl quinone diamine (6QDI) as the primary oxidation product. Interestingly, we discovered that the protonated form of 6QDI, rather than its neutral counterpart, was the red-colored reaction product with \u03bbmax = 490 nm. We further validated the method by applying it to the measurement of 6PPD in a wide array of rubber products and wastes, with 6PPD detected in 22 out of 50 samples. Strong agreement was observed between the colorimetric method and LC-MS measurements, with the highest concentrations detected in car tire rubber. In summary, this study introduces a rapid and cost-effective approach for rapid screening of 6PPD in rubber products and wastes.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Wastes; Environmental Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we expand the utility of these networks to the prediction of crystal structures consisting of organic molecules. Traditional methods for computing crystal structure properties, such as plane-wave quantum chemical methods based on density functional theory (DFT), are prohibitively resource-intensive, often necessitating compromises in accuracy and the choice of exchange-correlation functional. We present an approach that leverages the efficiency, and transferability of equivariant neural networks, specifically Allegro, to predict molecular crystal structure energies at a reduced computational cost. Our neural network is trained on molecular clusters using a highly accurate Gaussian-type orbital (GTO)-based method as the target level of theory, eliminating the need for costly periodic DFT calculations, while providing access to all families of exchange-corelation functionals and post-Hartree Fock methods. The trained model exhibits remarkable accuracy in predicting binding energies, aligning closely with those computed by plane-wave based DFT methods, thus representing significant cost reductions. Furthermore, the Allegro network was seamlessly integrated with the USPEX framework, accelerating the discovery of low-energy crystal structures during crystal structure prediction.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We investigate the effect of interfacial potential on Auger recombination processes in InP-based core/shell quantum dots (c/s QDs) using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). We have synthesized c/s QDs with diverse interfacial potentials: steep ones (InP/ZnS and InP/ZnSe QDs) and a smoothed counterpart (InP/ZnSexS1-x/ZnS QDs). The steady-state absorption and luminescence spectra obtained from aliquots extracted during the synthesis of InP/ZnSexS1-x/ZnS QDs and the EDS line profile revealed the formation of a compositional gradient shell (smoothed interfacial potential). The Auger recombination processes in InP/ZnSexS1-x/ZnS QDs QDs were ~ 8 times slower than those in InP/ZnS QDs in the same volume. These suppressions can be explained by the effective electron wavefunction penetration from the core into the shell and reduced carrier momentum in the final state resulted from the smoothed interfacial potential. These findings provide an important guideline for the rational design of the interfacial potentials in InP-based c/s QDs for various applications such as LED and laser devices.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

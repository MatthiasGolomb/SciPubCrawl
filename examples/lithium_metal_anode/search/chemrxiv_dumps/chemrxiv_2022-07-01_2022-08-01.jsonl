To test the superhydrophilicity, the free energy cost of removing waters near the interfaces are calculated using the density fluctuations method.

Interactions between surfaces and interfacial waters promote a templating effect whereby the latter are aligned in a pattern that follows the underlying lattice of the surfaces.  Translational and rotational dynamics of interfacial water molecules are slower than in bulk water.  Hydrogen bonds between water and both surfaces are asymmetric, water-to-aluminol ones are stronger than aluminol-to-water ones.

Nevertheless, flexible organic crystals with mutually exclusive elastic and plastic traits, with contrasting structural requirements, co-existing under different stress settings are exceptional; hence, it is imperative to establish the concurring factors that beget this rare occurrence. We report a series of halogen-substituted benzil crystals showing elastic bending (within ~ 2.45% strain), followed by elastoplastic deformation at ambient conditions. At higher stress settings, they display exceptional plastic flexibility that one could bend, twist, or even coil around a capillary tube. X-ray diffraction, microscopy, and computational data reveal the microscopic and macroscopic basis for the exciting co-existence of elastic, elastoplastic, and plastic properties in the crystals. The layered molecular arrangement and the weak dispersive interactions sustaining the interlayer region provide considerable tolerance towards the breaking and making upon engaging or releasing the external stress; it enables restoring the original state within the elastic strain. Comparative studies with oxalate compounds, wherein the twisted diketo moiety in benzil was replaced with a rigid and coplanar central oxalate moiety, enabled us to understand the effect of the anisotropy factor in the crystal packing induced by the C=O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C tetral interactions. The enhanced anisotropy depreciated the elastic domain, making the oxalate crystals more prone to plastic deformation. Three-point bending experiments and the determined Young's moduli further corroborate the co-existence of the elastic and plastic realm and highlights the critical role of the underlying structural elements that determine the elastic to plastic transformation. The work highlights the possible co-existence of orthogonal mechanical characteristics in molecular crystals and further construed the concurrent effect of the microscopic and macroscopic elements in attaining this exceptional mechanical trait.", "date": "2022-07-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the impact of room-temperature ILs on the mechanical, morphological and electrostatic properties of solid-supported DOPC phospholipid bilayers, taken as models of biomembranes. In particular, we have characterized the concentration-dependent and time-dependent evolution of the morphological, structural and mechanical properties of DOPC lipid membranes in the presence of imidazolium-based ILs with different alkyl chain length and hydrophilic/hydrophobic character.\nThe majority of ILs investigated were found to possess the ability of restructuring the lipid bilayer, through the formation of new ILs/lipid complexes, showing distinctive morphological features (increase of area and roughness). The nanomechanical analysis of the lipid membrane exposed to ILs revealed a progressive, concentration-dependent perturbation of the structural ordering and rigidity of the membrane, evidenced by a decrease in the breakthrough force, Young\u2019s modulus and area stretching modulus. AFM detected a modification of the electrostatic double-layer at the membrane surface, in terms of a reduction of the original negative surface charge density, suggesting a progressive stratification of cations on the exposed leaflet of the lipid membrane.

In this regard, we coupled several tools of DNA nanoscience, such as RNA cleavage, dynamic strand displacement reactions, and multivalent palindromic interactions, in a synchronize pathway so that the input signal can be processed inside the protocells and generate downstream cues giving rise to metabolic adaptive behavior. For example, the compartmentalized DNAzyme catalyzes the bond-cleavage of a substrate that releases a DNA strand in situ to trigger a strand displacement reaction at the shell of the protocells leading to a change in color resembling a \u201cphenotype-like\u201d change in cells, and finally to establish communication with other protocells via multivalent interactions.", "date": "2022-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Biopolymers; Hydrogels; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we investigated the electrophilic reactivity of the 3-acyl-5-hydroxy-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrole-2-one (AHPO) scaffold, a heterocyclic motif that is e.g. present in various bioactive natural products. Our investigations were focused on the compound MT-21 - a simplified structural analogue of the natural product epolactaene - which is known to have both neurotrophic activity and ability to trigger apoptotic cell death. We found that the central N-acyl hemiaminal group of MT-21 can function as an electrophilic centre enabling divergent reactivity with both amine- and thiol-based nucleophiles, which furthermore translated to reactivity with proteins in both cell lysates and live cells. We found that in live cells MT-21 strongly engaged the lipid transport protein fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) by direct binding to a cysteine residue in the bottom of the ligand binding pocket. Through preparation of a series of MT-21 derivatives, we probed the specificity of this interaction which was found to be strongly dependent on subtle structural changes. Our study suggests that MT-21 may be employed as a tool compound in future studies of the biology of FABP5, which remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, our study has also made clear that other natural products containing the AHPO-motif may likewise possess covalent reactivity and that this property may underlie their biological activity.

Much of the existing work investigating the effect of flow has been phenomenological, lacking a direct and quantitative connection between the flow gradients and measurable quantities of the conformation or alignment of the conjugated polymers in solution. Furthermore, while aggregation of conjugated polymers in solution has been demonstrated to result in highly aligned thin-films, there are few studies that probe the interplay between the structures that form during aggregation and flow-induced alignment during processing. Here, we explore in detail the influence of flow type, solution aggregation, and concentration on the flow-induced alignment of conjugated polymers. We apply a microfluidic platform to systematically subject the conjugated polymer solution to large and controllable shear and extensional strain rates and use flow-induced retardance (birefringence) measurements to characterize the degree of alignment. By using flow-induced retardance in combination with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy of freeze-dried solutions we are able to determine the solution state structure and clearly demonstrate the interplay between solution aggregation and fluid flow. We determine the overall relaxation time of the material and the strengths of shear and extensional flows required to align conjugated polymer aggregates. Furthermore, we find that although enhanced aggregation can facilitate flow-induced alignment, the type of aggregation and the presence of interparticle interactions at higher concentrations can diminish the effectiveness of flow. The results here demonstrate that there is a complex interplay between the conjugated polymer solution state and fluid flow and that simply increasing the conjugated polymer\u2019s aggregation, concentration, or the strength of flow does not necessarily lead to better or more effective alignment in solution. A careful understanding of the synergy between these two aspects can help to establish design rules in solution processing for improving conjugated polymer film morphology.", "date": "2022-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Aggregates and Assemblies; Materials Processing; Conducting polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A bottleneck in the workflow that remains to be solved is how to integrate human feedback in the exploration of the chemical space to optimize molecules. A human drug designer still needs to design the goal, expressed as a scoring function for the molecules that captures the designer\u2019s implicit knowledge about the optimization task. Little support for this task exists and, consequently, a chemist usually resorts to iteratively building the objective function of multi-parameter optimization (MPO) in de novo design. We propose a principled approach to use human-in-the-loop machine learning to help the chemist to adapt the MPO scoring function to better match their goal. An advantage is that the method can learn the scoring function directly from the user\u2019s feedback while they browse the output of the molecule generator, instead of the current manual tuning of the scoring function with trial and error. The proposed method uses a probabilistic model that captures the user\u2019s idea and uncertainty about the scoring function, and it uses active learning to interact with the user. We present two case studies for this: In the first use-case, the parameters of an MPO are learned, and in the second use-case a non-parametric component of the scoring function to capture human domain knowledge is developed. The results show the effectiveness of the methods in two simulated example cases with an oracle, achieving significant improvement in less than 200 feedback queries, for the goals of a high QED score and identifying potent molecules for the DRD2 receptor, respectively.

Unlike the extracellular matrix, the intrinsically stable amyloid-like fibrils do not respond nor adapt to stimuli of their natural environment. Here, we designed a self-assembling motif (CKFKFQF), in which a photosensitive o-nitrobenzyl linker (PCL) was inserted. This peptide (CKFK-PCL-FQF) assembled into amyloid-like fibrils comparable to the unsubstituted CKFKFQF and revealed a strong response to UV-light. After UV irradiation, the secondary structure of the fibrils, fibril morphology and bioactivity were lost. Thus, coating surfaces with the pre-formed fibrils and exposing them to UV-light through a photomask generated well-defined areas with patterns of intact and destroyed fibrillar morphology.

The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of the relationship between their diverse structures and biological functions. While HS syntheses have advanced significantly in recent years, preparation of HS libraries remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulties in achieving high yields in glycosylation and sulfation reactions especially with longer glycans and the need to prepare multiple compounds. A new strategy to synthesize a library of HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharides has been developed to expedite library preparation.  HS disaccharides were linked in a \u201chead-to-tail\u201d fashion from the reducing end of a module to the non-reducing end of a neighboring module to mimic native HS. Three differentially sulfated HS disaccharides were designed and prepared from a common intermediate. Conjugation of these modules using amide chemistry bypassed the need for challenging glycosylation reactions to extend the HS backbone. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharides were achieved using these three HS modules. This new class of compounds mimicked well the native HS with their binding to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) exhibiting similar structure-activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mimic natural HS suggest the new head-to-tail linked pseudo-hexasaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

In the co-metabolic degradation reactors, 1000 ppb and 1200 ppb of BDE-47 were degraded 54.58% and 60.98%, respectively; however, 100 ppb, 250 ppb and 500 ppb of BDE-47 were hardly transformed.

Although various metal\u2013oxo complexes are known to facilitate alkane hydroxylation, probing the mechanistic nature of the reaction is difficult due to the extremely fast rebound of the radical intermediate in the postulated oxygen-rebound pathway. Automated reaction mechanism discovery methods, such as the artificial force induced reaction (AFIR) method, enable the efficient exploration of both expected and unexpected reaction pathways, revealing the reaction mechanism. Here, we employed this approach combined with density-functional theory (DFT) to investigate the structure and reactivity of heterometallic cubane complexes similar to the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II. For a series of M(O)Co3O4 cubanes, where M(O) is a terminal oxo with M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Mo, Tc, Ru and Rh, we first computed the stability of the possible spin states and the radical (i.e., oxyl) character of the M(O) moiety as a measure of their potential activity in the catalytic hydroxylation of alkanes. DFT calculations on these reactions promoted by Ru(O)Co3O4 and Fe(O)Co3O4 suggest that the latter promotes the hydroxylation of methane with a rate-determining H-abstraction barrier of 24.6 kcal mol-1. The moderate height of this barrier, together with the low cost and low toxicity of iron and cobalt, suggest that the Fe(O)Co3O4 cubane is a promising candidate for the catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol. AFIR calculations showed that the oxygen-rebound pathway yields the lowest-energy profile, thus validating this mechanism for the hydroxylation of alkanes by heterometallic cubanes.

Under our experimental conditions the reaction occurs at the air-water interface, where significant depletion of both ozone and iodide produces the observed shift from zero to first order kinetics with increasing [O3]. Analytical expressions for surface concentrations are derived to accurately predict the reactive uptake coefficients obtained from experiments (\u03b3 = 2\u00d710-4). These predictions are extended over a range of [O3] and [I-] to assess the impact of competitive adsorption on the multiphase reaction mechanism under more dilute reaction conditions.

The design of improved capture materials requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which carbon dioxide is bound. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods have emerged as a powerful probe of CO2 sorption and diffusion in carbon capture materials. In this article, we first review the practical considerations for carrying out NMR measurements on capture materials dosed with CO2 and we then present three case studies that review our recent work on NMR studies of CO2 binding in metal-organic framework materials. We show that simple 13C NMR experiments are often inadequate to determine CO2 binding modes, but that more advanced experiments such as multidimensional NMR experiments and 17O NMR experiments can lead to more conclusive structural assignments. We further discuss how pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR can be used to explore diffusion of adsorbed CO2 through the porous framework. Finally, we provide an outlook on the challenges and opportunities for the further development of NMR methodologies that can improve our understanding of carbon capture.", "date": "2022-07-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Further analysis of the structure-mining results using Machine Learning can enable the extraction of more nanostructural information such as the distribution and size of intergrown domains in the structure. Our results show that with synthesis time, the intergrowth structure reorders from a R-like to a \u03b2-like structure, with segregation of R- and \u03b2-MnO2 domains.

Methylation at C5 decreases potency against vertebrate ion channels (GABAa receptors) but maintains or increases antagonism of homologous invertebrate GABA-gated chloride channels (RDL receptors).

Understanding their effects on biological systems is of importance to improve our understanding of their properties and safety. However, reusability of previously produced data to help developing computational risk assessment tools is still limited, due to the inconsistency in experimental reporting, the lack of generally accepted machine-readable metadata standards, and the ability to combine between such standards. Fortunately, the research community has developed multiple minimum reporting standards (MRS) to address a number of these issues. This makes the development of a machine-friendly approach possible to annotate and assess datasets' reusability according to those standards. In this work, we identified twelve published minimum reporting standards relevant to nanosafety research and converted them into a machine-readable representation in the form of FAIR maturity indicators. Moreover, as part of this NanoSafety Data Reusability Assessment framework, we developed a metadata generator web application to be integrated into experimental data management.

However, several challenges prevent MoS2 from being truly applicable, including limited number of active sites (typically only the edges are active) and poor conductivity. In this work, we perform an extensive density func- tional theory (DFT) screening of substitutional doping as a possibility to activate the otherwise inert basal surface. We assess 17 Earth abundant elements for molybdenum doping and 5 elements (N, O, P, Se and Te) for sulfur substitution. Systematically de- termining the preference of the metallic dopants to be located on the edges rather than in the basal plane, we reveal that most dopants are much more likely to be incorpo- rated at the edges, suggesting that advanced synthesis methods are required to obtain basal-plane doped catalysts. The latter may, however, feature many more active sites per MoS2 formula unit, motivating our study on the properties of such substitutionally doped surfaces. For the first time for such a screening study, we explore not only the adsorption of H, but also of OH and H2O to explore the solvent effect since the reac- tion takes place in an aqueous medium. Two additional phenomena that could hinder the hydrogen production at these sites are investigated, namely H2S release and the (local) segregation/dispersion tendency of the dopants in the basal surface. Moreover, to assess the electrocatalytic activity, we take the electrochemical potential explicitly into account via grand canonical DFT in combinations. Compared with pristine MoS2 nanosheets, our results show that most doping elements significantly enhanced the elec- trocatalytic activity. Considering all assessed factors, we identify the most promising systems: Dimers of Ti, Zr and Hf and the substitution of S by P are predicted to lead to stable active sites on the basal plane with overpotentials of about 0.2 V.", "date": "2022-07-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Likewise, the reduction of O2 and its reverse, the oxidation of reduced oxygen species to form O2, are indispensable components of emerging renewable technologies for energy storage and conversion. Storing and unleashing the energy contained within the O2 molecule requires control over the formation or scission of the four-electron double bond between two oxygen atoms. Nature performs these demanding multi-electron transformations by distributing the redox burden among multiple metal ions: evolution created metalloenzymes with polynuclear clusters wherein metal ions act in concert to deliver or accept multiple electrons. Most relevant in this sense are the tetramanganese-calcium (Mn4CaO5) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, responsible for O2 formation, and the tricopper clusters in multi-copper oxidases, which mediate O2 reduction. The critical step in both O2 reduction and O2 evolution is the interconversion between multinuclear metal-oxo species, where the O atoms carry formal \u20132 charges, and O\u2013O bonded species where the oxygen atoms are more oxidized. Attempts to mimic the natural systems with synthetic analogs have led to a number of elegant molecular clusters that shed light on the electron transfer events and stepwise mechanism of O\u2013O bond cleavage and formation. To our knowledge, however, the interconversion between molecular O2 and metal-oxo species in either synthetic or enzymatic discrete systems has not been documented. Here, we report that a tetramangenese cluster formed by self-assembly within a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) spontaneously cleaves the oxygen-oxygen double bond and reduces O2 by four electrons at room temperature. The ensuing tetranuclear manganese-oxo cluster engages in weak C\u2013H bond activation and, more importantly, is competent for O\u2013O bond formation and O2 evolution at elevated temperature, enabled by the head-to-head orientation of two fully reduced oxo atoms that bridge neighboring Mn pairs. This study demonstrates the viability of four-electron interconversion between molecular O2 and metal-oxo species and highlights the importance of site-isolation for achieving multi-electron chemistry at polynuclear metal clusters.

Transparent window infrared (IR) spectroscopy leverages site-specific probes that absorb in the \u201ctransparent window\u201d region of the biomolecular IR spectrum. Carbon-deuterium (C-D) bonds are especially compelling transparent window probes since they are non-perturbative, can be readily introduced site selectively into peptides and proteins, and their stretch frequencies are sensitive to changes in the local molecular environment. Importantly, IR spectroscopy can be applied to a wide range of molecular samples regardless of solubility or physical state, making it an ideal technique for addressing the solubility challenges presented by self-assembling molecules. Here, we present the first continuous observation of transparent window probes following stopped-flow initiation. To demonstrate utility in a self-assembling system, we selected the MAX1 peptide hydrogel, a biocompatible material that has significant promise for use in drug delivery and medical applications. C-D labeled valine was synthetically introduced into five distinct positions of the twenty- residue MAX1 \u03b2-hairpin peptide. Consistent with current structural models, steady-state IR absorption frequencies and linewidths of C-D bonds at all labeled positions indicate that these side chains occupy a hydrophobic region of the hydrogel and that the motion of side chains located in the middle of the hairpin is more restricted than those located on the hairpin ends. Following a rapid change in ionic strength to initiate self-assembly, the peptide absorption spectra were monitored as function of time, allowing determination of site-specific time constants. We find that within the experimental resolution, MAX1 self-assembly occurs as a cooperative process. These studies suggest that stopped-flow transparent window FTIR can be extended to other time-resolved\napplications, such as protein folding and enzyme kinetics.", "date": "2022-07-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the reasons behind the dominance of this building block are not well understood. We use a new set of processable materials, in which the sulfone content is systematically controlled, to understand how the sulfone unit affects the three key processes involved in photocatalytic hydrogen generation in this system: light absorption; transfer of the photogenerated hole to the hole scavenger triethylamine (TEA); and transfer of the photogenerated electron to the palladium metal co-catalyst that remains in the polymer from synthesis. Using transient absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, and combined with molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations, we find that the sulfone unit has two primary effects. On the picosecond timescale, it dictates the thermodynamics of hole transfer out of the polymer. The sulfone unit attracts water molecules such that the average permittivity experienced by the solvated polymer is increased, and we demonstrate here that TEA oxidation is only thermodynamically favourable above a certain permittivity threshold. On the microsecond timescale, we present experimental evidence that the sulfone unit acts as the electron transfer site out of the polymer, with the kinetics of electron extraction to palladium dictated by the ratio of photogenerated electrons to the number of sulfone units. For the highest performing, sulfone-rich material, hydrogen evolution appears to be limited by the photogeneration rate of electrons rather than their extraction from the polymer.", "date": "2022-07-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Polymer Science; Energy; Conducting polymers; Photocatalysis; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Examination of a substrate diverted from aromatization resulted in inner-sphere ligand rearrangement to afford an azaallyl chloride complex; kinetic studies suggest this species forms via an analogous azaallenium intermediate. Studies on base-promoted release of the isoquinoline suggest that the azaallyl chloride is not an obligate intermediate for aromatization and the parent azaallenium can directly eliminate to give a neutral dichloroosmium(II)-isoquinoline intermediate. The heteroarene can subsequently be thermally liberated to afford an osmium(II) acetonitrile complex, which can be oxidized to regenerate the nitride over two steps. First, in the presence of ammonia, oxidation affords an osmium(III) amidine, with subsequent oxidation in the presence of toluene sulfonic acid ultimately regenerating the nitride. The mechanistic foundation set by this synthetic cycle opens the door to the further development of nitrogen insertion heteroarene syntheses promoted by late transition metal nitrides.", "date": "2022-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Organometallic Compounds; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The developed method detected an extremely low concentration of analyte that was enriched and concentrated on sensitive SERS sites of the compact supraparticles formed from drop evaporation. A low limit of detection (LOD) of 10-16 M was achieved for a  model hydrophobic compound rhodamine 6G (R6G). The quantitative analysis of R6G concentration was obtained from 10-5 M to 10-11 M.

The intensity of SERS detection in our approach was robust to the dispersity of the nanoparticles in the drop but became stronger after a longer drying time. The mechanism underlying the ultrasensitive detection is the sequential process of concentration, extraction, and absorption of the analyte during evaporation of self-lubrication drop and hot spot generation for intensification of SERS signals.

Here we show that quantification of the true concentration of OH\u02d9 generated from water oxidation via electrochemical (EC)-EPR is unlikely. This is primarily due to the spin trap oxidising at potentials less positive than water and resulting in the same spin trap adduct as is formed from the solution reaction of OH\u02d9 with the spin trap. We illustrate this through consideration of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) to spin trap OH\u02d9. DMPO oxidation on a boron doped diamond (BDD) electrode in stationary solution occurs at a peak current potential of +1.90 V vs SCE, water oxidation commences at +2.35 V vs SCE. EC-EPR spectra shows signatures due to the hydroxyl spin adduct (DMPO-OH\u02d9) at potentials lower than the thermodynamic standard water/HO\u02d9 potential and in the region for DMPO oxidation. Increasing the potential into the water oxidation region, surprisingly, shows a lower DMPO-OH\u02d9 concentration than when the potential is in the DMPO oxidation region. This behavior is attributed to further oxidation of DMPO-OH\u02d9, production of fouling products on the electrode surface and bubble formation. Radical scavengers (ethanol) and other spin traps, here N-tert-butyl-\u03b1-phenylnitrone (PBN), \u03b1-(4-pyridyl N-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN) and 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane dimer (MNP), also show oxidation signals less positive than that of water. However, by monitoring ethanol-DMPO adduct versus DMPO-OH\u02d9 product distributions as a function of applied potential, it is possible to identify the potential at which HO\u02d9 generation via water oxidation starts to dominate.

These investigations revealed that cyclo-CBG, a recently isolated phytocannabinoid, is the major metabolite that is rapidly formed by selected human cytochrome P450s (CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9). Additionally, in vivo studies with mice administered with CBG, supported these studies, where cyclo-CBG is the major metabolite as well. Spectroscopic binding studies along with docking and modeling of CBG molecule near the heme in the active site of P450s confirmed these observations, pointing at the preferred site-selectivity of CBG metabolism at the prenyl chain over other positions. Importantly, we found out that CBG and its oxidized CBG metabolites reduced inflammation in BV2 microglial cells stimulated with LPS. Overall, combining enzymological studies, mass spectrometry, and chemical synthesis, we showcase that CBG is rapidly metabolized by human P450s to form oxidized metabolites that are bioactive.

Ionic correlations critically define double layer properties that are essential to electrocatalytic performance, including capacitance and localization of potential gradients. However, the influence of ionic correlations on CO2 electro-reduction remains unexplored. Here, we use electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO in ionic liquid-based electrolytes to investigate how the emergence of ionic correlations with increasing ion concentration influences reaction rates and selectivity. Remarkably, we find substantial acceleration of potential-dependent CO2 reduction rates and notable enhancement of faradaic efficiency to CO at intermediate concentrations of 0.9 M ionic liquid in acetonitrile, a concentration regime that has not been studied previously. We find that onset potentials for CO2 reduction remain relatively unchanged at -2.01 V vs. Ag/Ag+ from 0.025 M up to 1.1 M and increase to -2.04 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in the limit of neat ionic liquids. Hence, the acceleration of CO2 reduction we observe originates from the amplification of potential-dependent driving forces, as opposed to changes in onset potential. Importantly, our findings are general across co-catalytic and non-catalytic ions. We propose that concentrations of maximum reactivity correspond to conditions where electric double layers exhibit the strongest screening, which would localize electric fields to stabilize polar intermediates. Our study demonstrates that tuning bulk electrostatic screening lengths via modulation of ionic clustering provides a general approach to accelerating both inner sphere and outer sphere electrochemical reactions.", "date": "2022-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A corollary of this rule, i.e., the Kasha-Vavilov rule, states that the emission spectra are independent of the excitation wavelength. Although these rules apply for most of the molecular systems, violations of these rules are often reported for molecular systems. The prototypical case of a Kasha\u2019s rule violation is the fluorescence observed from S2 in azulene. Thanks to the advances in both theoretical and experimental research, other types of anomalous fluorescence arising from higher-lying excited states (e.g., excitation energy transfer (EET)-based dual emissions, thermally-activated fluorescence etc.), and which mechanistically differ from the azulene-like anomalous fluorescence, are more recurrently reported in the literature. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to these anomalous emissions can be numerous and they are not yet well understood. \n In order to shed some light into the above phenomena, this account provides a comprehensive review on this topic. We herein report quantum chemical investigations in target molecular systems breaking Kasha\u2019s rule. The latter molecules were chosen as they were unambiguously reported to display anti-Kasha fluorescence. Our studies highlight three different types of anti-Kasha scenarios. Specifically, i) the strong electronic-, weak vibrational-nonadiabatic coupling (NAC) regime (here named as Type I case, i.e., azulene-like); ii) the strong electronic-, strong vibrational-NAC regime (Type II case, i.e., thermally-activated S2 fluorescence); and the iii) very weak electronic NAC regime (Type III case, i.e., EET dyads). In addition, by combining state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations with excited-state decay rate theories and appropriate excited-state kinetic models, we provide semi-quantitative estimations of photoluminescence quantum yields for the most rigid molecular entities. Finally, we propose the use of simple theoretical descriptors relying on calculations of the excited-state density difference and the electron-vibrational coupling to classify anomalous emissions according to their coupling scenario.\nBesides the fundamental interest of the above investigations, the herein developed computational protocols and descriptors will be useful for the tailored design of dyes with tunable and unconventional fluorescence properties and their exploitation in a wide range of areas, i.e., from organic-light emitting diodes (OLEDs) to bioimaging, small molecule fluorescent probes and photocatalysis. Finally, our theoretical framework enables attaining a holistic understanding of the interconversion processes between excited states, where the electron-vibrational coupling is shown to play a central role in determining the efficacy.\n", "date": "2022-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Thermal gels were employed as a separations matrix because of their unique ability to change viscosity in response to temperature. Proteins (6\u2013464 kDa) were added into thermal gel and loaded into a microfluidic device. Electrolyte optimization was conducted to achieve robust tITP to isotachophoretically preconcentrate proteins and then electrophoretically separate them. Electropherograms were collected through both time and distance to enable both small and large proteins to be measured within a single analysis. The effects of temperature were evaluated and found to exhibit a pronounced effect on the separation. Temperature gradients were then employed to alter thermal gel viscosity over time to maximize separation resolution between proteins. The results herein demonstrate how gradient TG-tITP achieves rapid, high-resolution separations of native proteins over a wide mass range while requiring significantly less protein loading than PAGE and providing faster analysis times.", "date": "2022-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recently, droplet-based microfluidics has emerged as a powerful technology enabling ultra-high throughput screening of enzyme libraries and the effective identification and isolation of novel, improved enzyme variants, outperforming conventional enzyme screening platforms by several orders of magnitude in terms of speed and chemical consumption. When using droplet-based platforms fluorescence remains the predominant choice for detection of enzymatic activity due to its high sensitivity and low limits of detection. However, this approach often requires the use of labeled, non-natural substrates, which are typically not commercially available. In addition, fluorescence detection is only suitable for a few enzyme classes such as hydrolases or oxidases, whose reactions can often lead to a fluorescent signal. Herein, we describe an assay that enables fluorescence detection of enzymatic activity through a reaction cascade for the industrially important enzyme subclass of dehydrogenases. By applying a hydrogen peroxide-forming NADH oxidase coupled with peroxidase-catalyzed fluorescence generation, quantification of NADH and dehydrogenase activity becomes possible. We explored the utility of this assay in the evolution of a low performing alcohol dehydrogenase from Sphingomonas species A1 (SpsADH). A fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) platform was utilized for the screening of a 50,000 variant SpsADH library towards the non-native substrate L-guluronate, a primary component of macroalgae, with the potential to serve as raw material for the bio-based production of chemicals. Significantly, we found an enzyme variant with a 2.6-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency kcat/Km towards the non-native substrate, with only a single round of mutagenesis.

A common electrochemical capture approach is to employ redox-active molecules such as quinones. Upon electrochemical reduction, quinones become activated for the capture of CO2 through a chemical reaction. A key disadvantage of this method is the possibility of side-reactions with oxygen, which is present in almost all gas mixtures of interest for carbon capture. This issue can potentially be mitigated by fine-tuning redox potentials through the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups on the quinone ring. In this article, we investigate the thermodynamics of the electron transfer and chemical steps of CO2  capture in different quinone derivatives with a range of substituents. By combining density functional theory calculations and cyclic voltammetry experiments, we support a previously described trade-off between redox potentials and the strength of CO2  capture. We show that redox potentials can readily be tuned to more positive values to impart stability to oxygen, but as a consequence, significant decreases in CO2  binding free energies are observed. Our calculations support this effect for a large series of anthraquinones and benzoquinones, with different trade-off relationships observed for the two classes of molecules.

The latter was dubbed as the NOS bond, reflecting the individual atoms directly involved in this rather uncommon bond which finds little parallel in lab chemistry. It is found to form under oxidising conditions and reversible upon addition of reducing agents. Further studies have shown that this bond is found over a large variety of systems and organisms, potentially playing an important role in regulation, cellular defense and replication. Not only that, double NOS bonds have been identified and even found to be competitive in relation to the formation of disulfide bonds. This raises several questions about how this exotic bond comes to be, what are the intermediates involved in its formation and how it competes with other pathways of sulfide oxidation (e.g., sulfinic acid formation, disulfide linkage). With this objective in mind, we revisited our first proposed mechanism for the reaction with model electronic structure calculations, adding information about the reactivity with alternative reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other potential competing products of oxidation. We present a reaction network with more than 30 intermediates which provides one of the most encompassing pictures for cysteine oxidation pathways to date.", "date": "2022-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Whether dendrites are driven by mechanical failure or electrochemical degradation of solid electrolytes remains an open question. If internal mechanical forces drive failure, superimposing an external compressive load that counters internal stress may mitigate dendrite penetration. Here, we investigate this hypothesis by dynamically applying mechanical loads to growing lithium metal dendrites in Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 solid electrolytes. Operando microscopy reveals marked deflection in the dendrite growth trajectory at the onset of compressive loading. At loads near 200 MPa, this deflection is sufficient to avert cell failure. Using fracture mechanics, we quantify the impact of stack pressure and in-plane stresses on dendrite trajectory, chart the residual stresses required to prevent short-circuit failure, and propose cell design approaches to achieve such stresses.

Many of these modified nucleotides are sensitive toward nucleophiles and bases. Because known solid phase DNA and RNA synthesis technologies require strongly nucleophilic and basic conditions for deprotection and cleavage, there is no technology for the synthesis of DNAs and RNAs containing these sensitive nucleotides. The Dim-Dmoc technology has been developed to overcome the challenge. With Dim-Dmoc protection, oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) deprotection has be achieved with sodium periodate oxidation followed by \u03b2-elimination induced by the weak base aniline. Some sensitive groups have been shown to be stable under the deprotection conditions. Besides serving as a base, aniline also serves as a nucleophilic scavenger for the side products of Dim-Dmoc deprotection, which prevents the side products from reacting with the deprotected ODN. For this reason, excess aniline is needed. In this article, we report the use of alkyl Dim (aDim) and alkyl Dmoc (aDmoc) protecting groups for ODN synthesis. With aDim-aDmoc protection, deprotection is demonstrated to be achievable with sodium periodate oxidation followed by the non-nucleophilic base potassium carbonate at pH 8. No scavenger for the side products of deprotection is needed. Over 10 ODNs with length ranging from 10-mer to 23-mer were synthesized, and importantly, the ODNs could be easily purified with RP HPLC. It was further demonstrated that the highly sensitive N4-acetylcytidine nucleoside could survive the oxidative deprotection conditions, and ODNs containing this sensitive nucleotide could be readily synthesized and purified without the need of any special cautions.

Many enhanced sampling algorithms have been developed to predict both relative and absolute binding free energies. All methods come with various sources of error, such as representations of the system (force fields, choice of water model), sampling methods and physical approximations. One means of comparing these tools is through participation in blind prediction challenges such as the Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) challenges. Previously we have shown that free energies and transition rates can be calculated by directly simulating the binding and unbinding processes with our variant of the weighted ensemble algorithm ``Resampling of Ensembles by Variation Optimization'', or ``REVO''. Here, we calculate binding free energies retrospectively for three SAMPL6 host-guest systems and prospectively for a SAMPL9 system to test a modification of REVO that restricts its cloning behavior in quasi-unbound states. Specifically, trajectories cannot clone if they meet a physical requirement that represents a high likelihood of unbinding, which in the case of this work is a center-of-mass to center-of-mass distance. The overall effect of this change was difficult to predict, as it results in fewer unbinding events each of which with a much higher statistical weight. For all four systems tested, this new strategy produced either more accurate unbinding free energies or more consistent results between simulations than the standard REVO algorithm. This approach is highly flexible, and any feature of interest for a system can be used to determine cloning eligibility. These findings thus constitute an important improvement in the calculation of transition rates and binding free energies with the weighted ensemble method.", "date": "2022-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and operando infrared (IR) revealed that metallic Rh species were oxidized to afford isolated [Rh(NO)2]+ species under NO flow at 200\u00b0C, whereas small Rh metal clusters is formed under the subsequent H2 flow. Ab initio thermodynamics analysis shows that the plausible structures under NO and H2 at 200\u00b0C are [Rh(NO)2]+ and Rh clusters in MOR, which is consistent with the experimental observations. A comparative study of Rh-loaded Al2O3 suggests that Al sites in MOR increase the thermodynamic stability of isolated Rh+ species and thus prevent their overoxidation to Rh2O3 under NO. NO capture in the form of [Rh(NO)2]+ and its selective reduction toward NH3 under H2 flow were observed by in situ IR measurements. The RhMOR catalyst exhibited ~60% of NOx conversion above 200\u00b0C under periodic lean/rich conditions. Transition state calculations showed that the activation barrier for NO reduction to NH3 on [Rh(NO)2]+ (178 kJ/mol) is higher than that for Rh13 (156 kJ/mol), suggesting that Rh metal clusters are preferable NH3 formation sites, where the Rh13-catalyzed NO reduction into N2 and N2O was less preferable than NH3 formation, which is consistent with the experimental results. Combined with operando IR experiments under lean (NO + O2) and rich (NO + H2) conditions, we show that the reversible dynamic structural evolution of Rh species ([Rh(NO)2]+ \uf031  Rh metal clusters under lean and rich conditions) is a key mechanistic feature for unsteady-state de-NOx via the capture of NO, its selective reduction to NH3, and the selective reduction of NO with NH3 formed in situ.", "date": "2022-07-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although this species features an aromatic P2B three-membered ring, the ring strain allows the hemi-labile behavior of the P-B donor-acceptor bond, thereby exhibiting frustrated Lewis pair reactivity. Our finding paves the way for further exploration of the reactivity patterns of monomeric phosphaborenes.", "date": "2022-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Decomposition of perovskite oxides under applied potential is typically linked to cation leaching and amorphization of the material. However, structural changes and phase transformations at the catalyst surface were also shown to govern the activity of several perovskite electro-catalysts under applied potential. Hence, it is crucial for the rational design of durable perovskite catalysts to understand the interplay between the formation of active surface phases and stability limitations under OER conditions. In the present study, we reveal a surface-dominated activation and deactivation mechanism of the prominent electrocatalyst La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-\u1e9f under steady-state OER conditions. Using a multi-scale micros-copy and spectroscopy approach, we identify evolving Co-oxyhydroxide as catalytically active surface species and La-hydroxide as inactive species involved in the transient degradation behavior of the catalyst. While the leaching of Sr results in the formation of mixed surface phases, that can be considered as a part of the active surface, the gradual depletion of Co from a self-assembled active CoO(OH) phase and the relative enrichment of passivating La(OH)3 at the electrode surface results in the failure of the perovskite catalyst under applied potential.

The current work focuses on the investigation of photophysical and photochemical properties of indole and indole derivatives e.g. tryptophan, serotonin and melatonin using theoretical and computational methodologies. Having three close-lying excited electronic states, the vibronic coupling effect becomes extremely important yet challenging for the photophysics and photochemistry of indole. Here, we have used density functional theory (DFT) extensively and evaluated the performance of DFT in compared to available experimental and ab initio results from literature. The benchmarking of the method is followed by investigation of the chemical and geometrical effects of ring substitution in indole. A bathochromic shift has been observed in the HOMO-LUMO gap as well as vertical excitation energy from indole to melatonin. While the contribution of the in-plane small adjacent groups increases the electron density of the indole ring, the out-of-plane long substituent groups have minor effect. The comparison of singlet-triplet gaps suggests highest probability of inter-system crossing  for tryptophan which is in line with previous experiment. The absorption spectra calculated including the vibronic coupling are in good agreement with experiment. These results can be used to estimate the error in photophysical observables of indole derivatives calculated considering indole as prototypical system.

In our model, a knowledge-aware subgraph pooling strategy was designed to capture the local and global environments around the ionization sites for micro-pKa prediction. To overcome the scarcity of accurate pKa data, low-fidelity data (computational pKa) was used to fit the high-fidelity data (experimental pKa) through transfer learning. Moreover, we implemented knowledge-guided data augmentation on the pre-training data according to the consistency between acidic pKa and basic pKa.

Often these modeling and simulation efforts are limited by datasets that are too small because of the cost (time and money) associated with making the measurements. Other groups have demonstrated improvements in throughput of LC separations by focusing on \u201coverhead\u201d associated with the instrument itself \u2013 for example, between-analysis software processing time, and autosampler motions. In this paper we explore the possibility of using columns with small volumes (i.e., 5 mm x 2.1 mm i.d.) compared to conventional columns (e.g., 100 mm x 2.1 mm i.d.) that are typically used for retention measurements. We find that isocratic retention factors calculated for columns with these dimensions are different by about 20%; we attribute this difference \u2013 which we interpret as an error in measurements based on data from the 5 mm column \u2013 to extra-column volume associated with inlet and outlet frits. Since retention factor is a thermodynamic property of the mobile/stationary phase system under study, it should be independent of the dimensions of the column that is used for the measurement. We propose using ratios of retention factors (i.e., selectivities) to translate retention measurements between columns of different dimensions, so that measurements made using small columns can be used to make predictions for separations that involve conventional columns. We find that this approach reduces the difference in retention factors (5 mm compared to 100 mm columns) from an average of 18% to an average absolute difference of 1.7% (all errors less than 8%). This approach will significantly increase the rate at which high quality retention data can be collected to thousands of measurements per instrument per day, which in turn will likely have a profound impact on the quality of models and simulations that can be developed for many aspects of LC separations.", "date": "2022-07-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Apparatus; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In general, PNC primarily focuses on designing specialty cellular materials that can effectively attenuate unwanted sounds by virtue of its intrinsic morphology. Here, we develop Lattice Boltzmann (LB) framework to simulate wave propagation in viscoelastic materials and design multi-phase solids with enabling morphologies that can effectively reduce acoustic noise. To establish the effect of cellular solid morphologies on wave propagation, we analyze the acoustic characteristics of transmitted and reflected waves generated from the fluid-structure interactions. Our findings indicate that cellular solids with vertically aligned perforations exhibit excellent characteristics for attenuation of transmitted waves. On the contrary, cellular solids with circular perforations are efficient for attenuating the reflected waves. Consequently, in real-life scenarios, for sound inhibition and noise filtration systems, cellular solids with vertically striped perforations are preferable while for indoor acoustic systems, cellular solids with large circular perforations are efficacious. In essence, we have not only successfully implemented viscoelastic LBM for simulating the sound waves through multi-phase media but also harness its capabilities for tailoring the morphologies of cellular solids targeted towards a variety of PNC systems.

Ion binding and target binding of Ca2+-binding proteins are highly related. Therefore, understanding the ion binding mechanism will benefit the relevant inhibitor design towards the Ca2+ binding proteins. The EF-hand is the typical ion binding motif in Ca2+-binding proteins. Previous studies indicate that the ion binding affinity of the EF-hand increases with peptide length, but this mechanism has not been fully established. Herein, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations, and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) analysis, we systematically investigated four Ca2+ binding peptides containing the EF-hand loop in the site III of rabbit skeletal troponin C (TnC). These four peptides have 13, 21, 26, and 34 residues, respectively. Our simulations reproduced the observed trend that the ion binding affinity increases with peptide length. Our results implied that the E-helix motif preceding the EF-hand loop, especially the Phe99 residue, plays a significant role in this regulation. The E-helix has a significant impact on the backbone and sidechain conformations of the Asp103 residue, rigidifying important hydrogen bonds in the EF-hand and decreasing the solvent exposure of the Ca2+ ion, hence leading to more favorable Ca2+ binding in longer peptides.

Hydration is a key reaction for incorporating protons by filling oxygen vacancies, VO, with hydroxyl groups and activating proton conduction in the perovskite. However, probing the local environment of oxygen vacancies responsible for hydration is challenging because the behavior depends on the temperature and water partial pressure, which necessitates in situ observations and calculations of the local environments at elevated temperatures. To obtain such information, we combined in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for both the Sc and Zr K-edges, thermogravimetry, X-ray diffractometry, and active learning ab initio replica exchange Monte Carlo (RXMC) simulations in undoped and 20\u201340 at% Sc-doped barium zirconates at and below 800 \u00b0C. The presence of oxygen vacancies adjacent to Sc and Zr in the dehydrated samples and the hydration of these oxygen vacancies under a wet atmosphere were probed by in situ XAS for Sc and Zr pre-edges at elevated temperatures. Here, the microscopic hydration linearly responds to the macroscopic degree of hydration. RXMC sampling further supports the presence of Sc-VO-Zr and Sc-VO-Sc environments. An initial hydration occurs in the Sc-VO-Zr environment at and above 600 \u00b0C, but the Sc-VO-Sc environment contribution is greater at higher degrees of hydration.

Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has been proposed as a suitable platform for this application, particularly using collision cross section (CCS) databases obtained from differ-ent commercial IM-MS instruments. CCS is foreseen as an ideal additional identification parameter for steroids as long-term repeatability and interlaboratory reproducibility of this measurand are excellent and matrix effects are negligible. While excellent results were demonstrated for individual IM-MS technologies, a systematic comparison of CCS derived from all major commercial IM-MS technologies has not been performed. To address this gap, a comprehensive interlabor-atory comparison of 142 CCS values derived from drift tube (DTIM-MS), traveling wave (TWIM-MS) and trapped ion mo-bility (TIM-MS) platforms using a set of 87 steroids was undertaken. Besides delivering three instrument-specific CCS databases, systematic comparisons revealed excellent interlaboratory performance for 95% of the ions with CCS biases within \u00b11% for TIM-MS and within \u00b12% for TWIM-MS with respect to DTIM-MS values. However, a small fraction of ions (<1.5 %) showed larger biases of up to 7% indicating that differences in the ion conformation sampled on different in-strument types need to be further investigated. Systematic differences between CCS derived from different IM-MS analyz-ers and implications on the applicability for non-targeted analysis are critically discussed.

Here, we use the electrochemical underpotential deposition method to synthesize palladium nanocube electrocataysts with controlled copper surface coverage (e.g. partial and full copper coatings). We then examine the potential for NO3- destruction (conversion) and catalyst selectivity. We identify that partial copper-coated Pd nanocubes effectively facilitate the reduction of 95% of NO3-.

To this end, a chemically modified bamboo biochar was prepared from bamboo sawdust to effectively remove ciprofloxacin (CIP) from an aqueous solution. Under similar adsorption conditions, the modified bamboo biochar (MBC) has an excellent CIP removal efficiency (96%) compared to unmodified bamboo biochar (UBC) efficiency (45%). Thus, MBC was used in batch adsorption experiments and the process was optimized with the central composite design (CCD) framework of response surface methodology (RSM). Sorption process parameters such as initial CIP concentration, pH, adsorbent dose, and contact time were studied and found to have a significant effect on CIP removal. The optimal CIP removal (96%) was obtained at MBC dose (0.5 g L-1), CIP initial concentration (20 mg L-1), pH (7.5), and contact time (46 min). The adsorption kinetic data were well described by the pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.999), and both Langmuir (R2 = 0.994) and Freundlich (R2 = 0.972) models gave the best fit in CIP adsorption isotherm analysis. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of the MBC was 78.43 mg g-1 based on the Langmuir isotherm model. These results suggest that CIP adsorption was mainly controlled by chemisorption. Moreover, the CIP adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. Overall, MBC is a low-cost, efficient, and recyclable adsorbent for eliminating emerging contaminants such as ciprofloxacin from an aqueous solution.", "date": "2022-07-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Water Purification", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Multiple vaccines are in use, but there are many underserved locations that do not have adequate access to them. Variants may emerge that are highly resistant to existing vaccines, and therefore cheap and readily obtainable therapeutics are needed. Phytochemicals, or plant chemicals, can possibly be such therapeutics. Phytochemicals can be used in a polypharmacological approach, where multiple viral proteins are inhibited and escape mutations are made less likely. Finding the right phytochemicals for viral protein inhibition is challenging, but in-silico screening methods can make this a more tractable problem. In this study, we screen a wide range of natural drug products against a comprehensive set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins using a high-resolution computational workflow. This workflow consists of a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS), where an initial phytochemical library was docked against all selected protein structures. Subsequently, ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) was employed, where chemical features of 34 lead compounds obtained from the SBVS were used to predict 53 lead compounds from a larger phytochemical library via supervised learning. A computational docking validation of the 53 predicted leads obtained from LBVS revealed that 28 of them elicit strong binding interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Thus, the inclusion of LBVS resulted in a 4-fold increase in the lead discovery rate. Of the total 62 leads, 18 showed promising pharmacokinetic properties in a computational ADME screening. Collectively, this study demonstrates the advantage of incorporating machine learning elements into a virtual screening workflow.

Herein, we report the development of LRRK2 Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs), culminating in the discovery of degrader XL01126, as an alternative LRRK2 targeting strategy. Initial designs and screens of PROTACs based on ligands for E3 ligases von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), Cereblon (CRBN), and cellular inhibitor of Apoptosis (cIAP) identified the best degraders containing thioether-conjugated VHL ligand VH101. A second round of medicinal chemistry exploration led to qualifying XL01126 as a fast and potent degrader of LRRK2 in multiple cell lines, with DC50 values within 15-72 nM, Dmax values range from 82-90%, and degradation half-lives span from 0.6h to 2.4h. XL01126 exhibits high cell permeability and forms a positively cooperative ternary complex with VHL and LRRK2 (\u03b1=5.7), which compensates for a substantial loss of binary binding affinities to VHL and LRRK2, underscoring its strong degradation performance in cells. Remarkably, XL01126 is orally bioavailable (F=15%) and can penetrate the blood brain barrier after either oral or parenteral dosing in mice.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements on the Ln3Mo4SiO14 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr and Nd) are in agreement with a trivalent state of the rare earths for the Ce, Pr and Nd compounds, while that on the lanthanum compound confirm the presence of one unpaired electron per Mo3 as expected.

Often with superior thermal stability, protease resistance, and antimicrobial activity, lasso peptides are promising candidates for bioengineering and pharmseutical applications. To enable high-throughput computational prediction and design of lasso peptides, we developed software, LassoHTP, for automatic lasso peptide structure construction and modeling. LassoHTP consists of three modules, including: scaffold constructor, mutant generator, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulator. Based on a user-provided sequence and conformational annotation, LassoHTP can either generate the structure and conformational ensemble as is or conduct random mutagenesis. We used LassoHTP to construct eight known lasso peptide structures de novo and to simulate their conformational ensembles from 100 ns MD simulations. For benchmarking, we calculated the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of these ensembles with reference to their experimental crystal or NMR PDB structures; we also compared these RMSD values against those of the MD ensembles that are initiated from the PDB structures. The results show that the RMSD values of the LassoHTP-initiated ensembles are highly similar to those of the PDB-initiated ensembles with the \u2206RMSD ranging from 0.0 to 1.2 \u00c5 and averaging at 0.5 \u00c5. LassoHTP offers a computational platform to develop strategies for lasso peptide prediction and design.

An intensive 13-month monitoring programme was undertaken in two adjacent urban areas in South-West England: a small commuter town Keynsham and the city of Bath. The study has shown a great potential of using triangulated WBE and National health Service (NHS) prescription data in understanding pain treatment in two contrasting communities with strong apparent seasonal patterns of short pain medications vs chronic pain treatment as well as the type of treatment used (e.g. oral vs topical). Community-wide usage of NSAIDs and paracetamol in the intercity study is population size and season driven with the highest usage recorded in winter months. This contrasts with other pain pharmaceuticals, especially those used for chronic pain, where no/limited seasonal usage was recorded. Unmetabolized NSAIDs are, to a large extent, directly disposed of into the sewerage system bypassing metabolism due to their preferred topical application. This is particularly apparent in winter months with naproxen showing the highest seasonal variability. Pharma/met analysis allows for tracking topical (non-metabolic) application/down-the-drain disposal of pharmaceuticals with frequent instances of direct disposal of NSAIDs into the sewerage system observed. Normalisation of pharma markers to population size shows comparable estimates of pharma usage in the two cities confirming population as the main driver of pharma loads in wastewater. Variable application patterns of pain pharmaceuticals make back-calculation of intake more convoluted. Intake calculated using percentage of urinary/faecal excretion of metabolites or parent compounds as consumption markers leads to likely underestimation of NSAIDs usage due their both oral and topical application. Prescription data indicates cumulative internal and topical usage.

Using a controlled-laboratory experiment, we determined, for the first time, negligible carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation, and a significant inverse nitrogen isotope effect during aerobic 2,3-DCA biodegradation via dioxygenation using a mixed enrichment culture.

Standard summary metrics statistically derived from the MWD only provide an incomplete picture of the polymer MWD. Machine learning (ML) methods coupled with high-throughput experimentation (HTE) could potentially allow for the prediction of the entire polymer MWD without information loss. In our work, we present a computer controlled HTE platform that is able to run up to 8 unique variable conditions for the free radical polymerizations of styrene. The segmented-flow HTE system was equipped with an inline Raman spectrometer and offline size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to obtain time dependent conversion and MWD respectively. In a supervised learning exercise, the gradient-boosted decision trees ML algorithm was used to predict monomer conversion from reagent concentrations and reaction time with high accuracy, using data obtained from the Raman spectra. A second ML algorithm uses the random forest regressor to predict entire MWDs of the synthesized polymer. Each algorithm can navigate the complexity of multiple parallel reactions occurring in a polymerization.  The algorithm accurately predicts monomer conversion in the first case despite variations in the polymerization kinetic parameters over time. In the second case, we predict the polymer MWD where fine details such as the shape and skew of the MWD are captured without information loss. SHAP values were calculated to examine the dependence of the ML model output on the experimental conditions. A transfer learning approach was also used to enhance the predictive power of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model in predicting batch polymerization MWDs. Overall, we demonstrate that the combination of HTE and ML provide a high level of predictive accuracy in determining polymerization outcomes, providing polymer chemists with the ability to target the synthesis of polymers with desired properties via the predicted conversion and MWD.", "date": "2022-07-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The initial source of PHIP is the non-equilibrium spin order of parahydrogen, i.e., dihydrogen where the two protons make up a singlet spin state. Conversion of this spin order into net magnetization of magnetic heteronuclei, e.g., 13C, provides one of the most efficient ways to exploit PHIP. We propose a facile route to increase the performance of PHIP transfer in experiments with adiabatic sweeps of the ultralow magnetic field. To date this technique yields the highest efficiency of PHIP transfer, yet it has been mostly utilized with linear field sweeps, which does not consider the underlying spin dynamics, resulting in sub-optimal polarization. This issue was previously addressed by using the \u201cconstant\u201d adiabaticity method, which, however, requires extensive calculations for large spin systems. In this work, the field sweep is optimized by utilizing the field dependence of the average 13C polarization. Both the experimental detection and the numerical simulation of this dependence are straightforward, even for complex multi-spin systems. This work provides a comprehensive survey of PHIP transfer dynamics at ultralow field for two molecular systems that are relevant for PHIP, namely, maleic acid and allyl pyruvate. The proposed optimization allowed us to increase the resulting 13C polarization in 13C-allyl pyruvate from 6.8% with a linear profile to 8.7% with an \u201coptimal\u201d profile. Such facile optimization routines are valuable for adiabatic experiments in complex spin systems undergoing rapid relaxation or chemical exchange.", "date": "2022-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Specifically, we study the degradation pathways of SrIrO3, a highly active electrocatalyst, during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by tracking the potential-dependent Sr leaching and perovskite dissolution at the nanometer scale. This material serves as a model system for degradation studies of perovskite AMO3 oxides, exhibiting both A-cation leaching and transition metal (M) dissolution. We show that Sr leaching precedes perovskite dissolution by up to 0.8 V, leading to a wide voltage window of stability where water oxidation occurs on a Sr-depleted surface without significant corrosion. Moreover, we reveal that the stability of the perovskite surface is strongly influenced by the electrolytic environment and that corrosion rates differ dramatically as a function of dissolved Sr concentration.

Short duration remote sensing measurements of methane emissions are becoming economically feasible and deployable at large scale, but interpretation of these snapshot measurements is complex due to the inherent spatial and temporal variability of methane emissions.  Even if measurement technologies have no uncertainty, short duration sampling of these complex temporal emission patterns introduces a sampling uncertainty.  This work examines the sampling uncertainties associated with monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual short-duration measurements of methane emissions for a group of fifty sample sites selected to replicate conditions in the Barnett Shale oil and gas production region. One of the key characteristics of Barnett Shale methane emissions is the presence of high-emission rate events which contribute to approximately half of total emissions.  These high-emission events typically account for only 1-2% of emission rate observations in the Barnett Shale and are of uncertain duration.  Analyses were conducted to assess how the duration of these high-emission events impacts the accuracy of remote sensing measurements of methane emissions, conducted with frequencies ranging from monthly to annual. Emissions from pneumatic controllers, pneumatic pumps, tanks, and leaks, which collectively account for approximately half of emissions in the Barnett Shale, are accurately captured with annual sampling frequencies.  The addition of high-emission events increases the required number of measurements to maintain a targeted level of uncertainty, even under the assumption of no measurement uncertainty.  If emission events have a one-week duration, a monthly sampling frequency has an estimated sampling error >15% for the types of sources in the Barnett Shale, due to the inherent variability of the magnitudes of the high emission rate events.  The error associated with short-duration sampling increases as the duration of the high-emission events becomes shorter, suggesting that understanding the temporal persistence of significant emission events is important to consider when designing measurement protocols.

Here, we investigate the effects of CP and CV electrochemical conditioning on a Ni-based OER precatalyst and substrate in Fe-purified and Fe-unpurified KOH electrolytes by employing (\u2170) Ni foil, (\u2171) NiSe precatalyst films with different thicknesses on the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate, and (\u2172) NiSe precatalyst films on Ni foil substrates. It was found that CV electrochemical conditioning can result in a higher degree of in situ oxidation and Fe incorporation for Ni-based precatalysts and substrates compared to CP electrochemical conditioning. In turn, this brought about different material properties (e.g., in situ oxidized layer thickness, composition, crystallinity, and morphology) and electrochemical characteristics (e.g., active surface area, electron transport limitation, and intrinsic activity) of Ni-based electrocatalysts, thereby not only affecting their OER activity but also complicating the interpretation of the origin of OER activity.

The first part of this work uses a new data set of 1,225 donor/non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) pairs containing 1,001 unique pairs, one of the largest to date, to train an ensemble machine learning model to predict device efficiency (RMSE =1.60 +/- 0.14%).

Interesting design motifs show up in high-performing NFAs, such as diphenylamine substituents on the core and 3D terminal groups.  The donor polymers from the GA reveal that it may be beneficial to arrange the monomers as a small-block copolymer instead of the common alternating copolymer. The GAs for selection of tandem cell materials successfully find material combinations, that when in a device together, have strong absorption across the entire visible-near-IR spectrum.

Such stability affects the removal of water in the Froth Treatment Process prior to upgrading of bitumen extracted from mining operations. The literature presents various examples of the use of the Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Difference (HLD) framework to formulate demulsifiers for conventional crude oils, reducing the emulsion stability from hours to minutes when HLD=0 (phase inversion point). To apply this approach to bitumen emulsions, the HLD of these systems needs to be assessed. A previous attempt to obtain the HLD of bitumen emulsions was incomplete because the suspected surfactant-like and oil-like behavior of polar oils in bitumen, particularly asphaltenes and naphthenic acids (NAs), could not be resolved. This question was revisited using a newly established framework for the HLD of polar oils. To this end, microemulsion phase behavior studies were conducted involving mixtures of ionic and nonionic surfactants with asphaltenes, diluted bitumen, and deasphalted bitumen (maltenes), which led to the realization that asphaltenes do not play a role in HLD when other surfactants are present in the system. Instead, NAs and their dissociation into naphthenates dominate the phase behavior of bitumen emulsions. It was determined that a gradual change in the degree of dissociation of NAs, induced by sodium hydroxide addition, could substantially change the HLD of the system and the accompanying changes in interfacial tension, emulsion stability, and residual water content in the oil phase.

However, the device-level application is still limited to the unpredictability of external quantum efficiency (EQE). Although theoretical research involving internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and mechanistic pathways for reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) in TADF systems have been explored quite rigorously, investigation on EQE is lacking. With the emergence of data-driven analysis being the fourth paradigm of science (empirical, theoretical, and computational being the previous three), we have employed ML models on 30 features of 123 samples, availed from literature to predict the EQEmax. On the one hand, the employed models capture device selectivity but are prevalent in the emissive range of chromophores. We have shown that Gradient Boosting (GB), an ensemble learning model, has been able to predict EQEmax with r2 score of 0.71\u00b10.04/0.84 and a low RMSE of 4.22\u00b10.55/2.53 for the train/test set. Considering the current state-of-the-art (SOTA), this is the best model which can predict for TADF chromophores of any emissive range and delineate the effect of device architecture. We also have carried out feature importance analysis to make this so-called black-box model interpretable. This analysis has helped to figure out essential parameters responsible for better EQE efficiency.

The results show that OPLS3e behaves similarly to the CHARMM36 force field and relatively accurately follows the experimentally measured SCH for the lipid headgroup, the glycerol backbone, and the acyl tails. Thus, OPLS3e is a good choice for POPC bilayer simulations under many biologically relevant conditions. The exception are systems with an abundancy of ions, as similarly to most other force fields OPLS3e strongly overestimates the membrane-binding of cations, especially Ca2+. This leads to undesirable positive charge of the membrane surface and drastically lowers the concentration of Ca2+ in the surrounding solvent, which might cause issues in systems sensitive to correct charge distribution profiles across the membrane.", "date": "2022-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Nonetheless, current understanding of the precise biological function of different modification patterns is limited by the difficulty of mass spectrometry to identify and quantify different combinatorial isomers in their mixtures as they naturally occur. This profound difficulty is a result of the fundamental incompleteness of the information contained in a one-dimensional mass spectrum featuring the mass-to-charge ratios and relative abundances of the individual peptide fragments. Here we demonstrate that the fragment-fragment correlations revealed by the recently developed two-dimensional partial covariance mass spectrometry (2D-PC-MS) allow one to solve the combinatorial PTM puzzles that cannot be tackled by the standard mass spectrometry as a matter of principle. We introduce the concept of 2D-PC-MS marker ion correlations and show that they can provide the missing PTM location information that enables identification of co-fragmentated combinatorially modified isomers in their mixtures. We demonstrate experimentally the use of the marker ion correlations to fully analyze and resolve mixtures of doubly acetylated histone H4 peptides, a problem that was previously branded \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d.

Despite previous developments in transition metal-catalyzed and -free approaches, C\u2013H borylation of sterically hindered arenes remains a largely unsolved problem to date. Here, we report a synthetic strategy of a precious metal-free electrophilic C\u2013H borylation of sterically hindered alkyl- and haloarenes to generate aryl boronic esters. The reported approach consists of two simple steps that can be carried out under open flask conditions. The first step relies on electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) induced by cage-opening of Cs2[closo-B10H10], forming a 6-Ar-nido-B10H13 product containing a B\u2013C bond. This is followed by an unprecedented cage deconstruction of arylated decaboranes promoted by diols leading to selective breakage of B\u2013B bonds in the cluster while preserving the B\u2013C bond. The combination of these two steps allows for the preparation of aryl boronic esters that are hard-ly accessible by current direct C\u2013H borylation approaches. Unlike the previous arene C\u2013H borylations, this reaction does not require any precious metals, highly-engineered ligands, pre-functionalized boron reagents, or inert conditions. In addition, the unique properties of a non-classical boron cluster electrophile intermediate, B10H13+, afforded an unprecedented regi-oselectivity with unique steric and electronic control without the undesirable side reactions common in electrophilic aro-matic substitution.

Here, we show that assigning internal fragments generated from TD-MS enhances the sequence coverage of disulfide intact proteins by 20-60% by returning information from the interior of the protein sequence, which cannot be obtained by terminal fragments alone. The inclusion of internal fragments can extend the sequence information of disulfide intact proteins to near complete sequence coverage. Importantly, the enhanced sequence information that arise from the assignment of internal fragments can be used to determine the relative position of disulfide bonds and the exact disulfide connectivity between cysteines.

In this study, data mining and machine learning were practiced estimating the partitioning of Per- and Poly-fluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) compounds during aqueous adsorption on various adsorbent materials with a vision to potentially replace the time-consuming and labor-intensive adsorption experiments. Regression models, such as linear, tree, support vector machine (SVM), ensemble of trees, and gaussian process regression (GPR) models were trained and tested using previously published data. 290 data points and 170 data points for activated carbon and mineral adsorbents, respectively, were mined for training the models and 10 data points were used to test the trained models. Statistical parameters, such as Root-Mean-Square Error (RSME), R-Squared, Mean Average Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc., were used to compare the regression models. It was found that rational quadratic GPR (R-squared = 0.9966) and fine regression tree (R-Squared = 0.9427) models had the highest estimation accuracy for carbon-based and mineral-based adsorbents, respectively. These models were then validated for prediction accuracy using 10 data points from previous studies as an outer test set. Rational quadratic GPR was able to achieve 99% prediction accuracy for carbon-based adsorbent, while fine tree regression model was able to achieve 94% prediction accuracy. Despite such high estimation accuracy, the data mining process revealed the data shortage and the need for more research on PFAS adsorption to present real-world models.

A chief example is the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide via reduction of dioxygen with concomitant photooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Although it has long been known that photoexcitation of benzaldehyde under UV light yields reactive benzaldehyde radicals capable of oxidizing substrates such as benzyl alcohol, it was assumed that such autocatalytic processes cannot be initiated under visible light irradiation. Herein we demonstrate the ability of benzaldehyde to promote auto-photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and produce large quantities of H2O2 in solvent-free (no water) or biphasic (with water) systems even under nominally solar-simulated visible light (>420 nm cutoff filter) irradiation. While these results open up broader prospects for the use of benzaldehyde in visible light-driven photocatalysis as exemplified by the ability of benzaldehyde to photocatalyze H2O2 production even in the presence of alternative electron donors (e.g., ethanol), they also shed some critical light on the plethora of research reports on photocatalytic H2O2 production in which benzyl alcohol was employed as electron donor. Since the autocatalytic pathway based on the photocatalytic activity of benzaldehyde formed during photocatalysis under such conditions cannot be neglected, the interpretations of photocatalytic performance are likely contentious and distorted in such reports. We conclude that the use of benzyl alcohol as a model electron donor in photocatalytic studies should be definitely discouraged, and highlight the importance of carrying out simple check protocols for excluding similar issues when using alternative substrates.", "date": "2022-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The combination of these properties makes Fc-MPIMs ideal candidate materials for optoelectronic devices, and the ability to tune these properties would broaden the impact of these materials. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the CAM-B3LYP/def2SVP level were carried out on Fc MPIM fragments to examine the effect of pendant functional groups on conformational stability and electron delocalization in these systems. The conformational stability of the Fc MPIMs can affect the porosity, and the electronic delocalization is related to the conjugation in the material.  The Fc MPIM fragments are most stable when the dihedral angle between Fc cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings is 11.5\u00b0. Pendant functional groups are found to affect the stability of the local minimum at 144\u00b0, with alkyl chains increasing the stability, and bulky tert-butyl and trifluoromethyl groups decreasing stability. It is also possible to tune the electron delocalization of the HOMO and LUMO across the molecule. The Fe center of the Fc moiety contributes to the frontier orbitals, which is expected to enhance electronic communication in the parent polymer. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations indicate the \u03c0\u2192\u03c0^* transition is slightly affected by the orientation of the dihedral angle between Cp rings, but primarily depends on the electronic nature of the pendant group. This work shows that the conformational stability and orbital delocalization of a model Fc MPIM can be tuned by functionalization with different pendant groups.

Here, the concept of mechanical interlocking is introduced to the ligand architecture to enforce dynamic spatial restriction on the Cu coordination site unachievable using other structural means. The utility of the kinetic effects from mechanical bond in transition metal catalysis is just about to emerge, and here the catenane ligands govern the O2 adduct binding mode, thereby steering the selectivity to generate H2O as the major product via the 4e\u2013 pathway, rivaling the selectivity of Pt.

In this work, we make use of computer simulations to measure the nucleation rate (J) of water at normal pressure under different supercooling conditions, ranging from 215 to 240K. We employ two different water models, mW, a coarse-grained potential for water, and TIP4P/ICE, an atomistic non-polarizable water model that provides one of the most accurate representations of the different ice phases. To evaluate J, we apply the Lattice Mold technique, a computational method based on the use of molds to induce the nucleus formation from the metastable liquid under conditions at which observing spontaneous nucleation would be unfeasible. With this method, we obtain estimates of the nucleation rate for ice Ih, Ic and a stacking mixture of ice Ih/Ic; reaching consensus with most of the previously reported rates, although differing with some others. Furthermore, we confirm that the predicted nucleation rates by the TIP4P/ICE model are in better agreement with experimental data than those obtained through the mW potential. Taken together, our study provides a reliable methodology to measure nucleation rates in a simple and computationally efficient manner which contributes to benchmarking the freezing behaviour of two popular water models.

MFMs have a wide variety of potential and realised adsorption applications. In order to design an ideal framework material for a particular application, the composition of molecular fragments is not the only factor, but the arrangement of the those fragments is also important, especially when the fragments (molecular building blocks) are chemically functionalised and lack symmetry. As has been observed in Metal Organic Frameworks, the flexibility and absorption properties may differ greatly when altering the orientation of the building units or changing the position of functional groups. However, although the position of functional group has a great influence on a targeted property, studies on functional group arrangements have only been performed on a small set of MOF structures.\n\nIn this contribution, we develop a fingerprint/descriptor for optimising functionalised molecular framework structures using machine learning. We begin from  the  perspective of a molecular framework structure described as a collection of discrete pore shapes. To describe the chemical environment of the pore, we derive a fingerprint based on the occurrence of pairwise distances between functional groups in each pore. We present the possibilities of functional group arrangements in the 14 most common pore shapes, created by ditopic (2-connected) linkers are presented. The method to enumerate and identify possible isomers is explained.

Of longstanding interest are Sn(II) perovskites (e.g., Sn(Zr1/2Ti1/2)O3, SZT), which are theoretically predicted Pb-free analogues of (Pb(Zr1/2Ti1/2)O3, PZT), a commercial piezoelectric compound that is dominant in the electronics industry. Herein, we describe the synthesis of this metastable SZT dielectric through a low-temperature flux reaction technique.  The SZT has been found, for the first time, to grow and to be stabilized as a nanoshell at the surfaces of Ba(Zr1/2Ti1/2)O3 (BZT) particles, i.e., forming as BZT-SZT core-shell particles, as a result of Sn(II) cation exchange. In situ powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy data show that the SZT nanoshells result from the controlled cation diffusion of Sn(II) cations into the BZT particles, with tunable thicknesses of ~25 nm to 100 nm. The SZT nanoshell is calculated to possess a metastability of about \uf02d0.5 eV atom\u20131 with respect to decomposition to SnO, ZrO2, and TiO2, and thus cannot currently be prepared as stand-alone particles. Rietveld refinements of XRD data are consistent with a two-phase BZT-SZT model, with each phase possessing a generally cubic perovskite-type structure and nearly identical lattice parameters. M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopic data (119Sn) are consistent with Sn(II) cations within the SZT nanoshells and an outer ~5 to 10 nm surface region comprised of oxidized Sn(IV) cations after exposure to air and water. The optical band gap of the SZT shell was found to be ~2.2 eV, which is redshifted by ~1.2 eV as compared to BZT. This closing of the band gap was probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and found to stem from a shift of the valence band edge to higher energies (~1.07 eV) as a result of the addition of the Sn 5s2 orbitals forming a new higher-energy valence band. In summary, a novel synthetic tactic is demonstrated to be effective in preparing highly metastable SZT and representing a generally useful strategy for the kinetic stabilization of other predicted, metastable dielectrics.", "date": "2022-07-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Core-Shell Materials; Solid State Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One of the most therapeutically important and best-studied receptors in these pathways is dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). Unfortunately, DRD2 is challenging to study with traditional molecular biological techniques, and most drugs designed to target DRD2 are ligands for many other receptors. Here, we developed probes able to both covalently bind to DRD2 using photoaffinity labeling as well as provide a chemical handle for detection or affinity purification. These probes behaved like good DRD2 agonists in traditional biochemical assays and were able to perform in chemical biological assays of cell and receptor labeling. Rat whole brain labeling and affinity enrichment using the probe permitted proteomic analysis of the probes\u2019 interacting proteins.

One important source of ENMs are silver nanoparticles (NPs) that are extensively used as anti-bacterial additives. The introduction of ENMs into the human body can occur via ingestion, skin uptake, or the respiratory system. Therefore, evaluating how NPs translocate over bio-membranes is essential in assessing their primary toxicity. Unfortunately, data regarding membrane-NP interaction is still scarce, as is a theoretical and in-silico insight that governs adhesion and translocation for the most relevant NPs and membranes. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular descriptions alleviate this situation but are hampered by the absence of a direct link to specific NP materials and membrane adhesion mechanisms. Here, we interrogate the relationship between the standard CG NP representation and the adhesion characteristics of a model lung membrane. We find that the standard model is inapt of describing silver (Ag) NPs of different sizes, meaning that a matching CG representation for one size is not transferable to other sizes. In addition, we identify two basic types of primary adhesion - (partial) NPs\nwrapping by the membrane and NP insertion into the membrane - that depend on the NP\u2019s overall hydrophobicity and significantly differ in terms of lipid coatings. The\nnon-transferability of the standard CG model forms an inspiration for introducing a core-shell model even for bare NPs that are uniform in composition. We show that this\nextension allows us to reproduce the size-dependent adhesion properties of bare Ag NPs at the atomistic scales. Next, we evaluate adhesion signatures for bare Ag NPs up\nto 10 nm diameter, illustrating that the previously atomically resolved lipid response to binding is correctly reproduced at the CG level. The simulation for the largest NP provides insight into the role of water in trapping NPs into defected mixed monolayer- bilayer states. This metastable situation is well beyond the previously considered elastic models and implicit-solvent molecular descriptions. We expect this development to be instrumental for simulating NP membrane adhesion towards experimental length and time scales for particular NP materials.", "date": "2022-07-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The applicability of these has been proven in numerous applications, but their proliferation is still limited. Arguably, the majority of LC methods are still developed in a conventional manner, i.e. by analysts who rely on their knowledge and experience. In this work, a novel, open-source algorithm was developed for automated and interpretive method development of LC separations. A closed-loop workflow was constructed that interacted directly with the LC and ran unsupervised in an automated fashion. The algorithm was tested using two newly designed strategies. The first utilized retention modeling, whereas the second used the Bayesian-optimization machine-learning approach. In both cases, the algorithm could arrive within ten iterations at an optimum of the objective function, which included resolution and measurement time. The design of the algorithm was modular, so as to facilitate compatibility with previous works in literature and its performance thus hinged on each module (e.g., signal processing, choice of retention model, objective function). Key focus areas for further improvement were identified. Bayesian optimization did not require any peak tracking or retention modeling. Accurate prediction of elution profiles was found to be indispensable for the strategy using retention modeling. This is the first interpretive algorithm demonstrated with complex samples. Peak tracking was conducted using UV-Vis absorbance detection, but use of MS detection is expected to significantly broaden the applicability of the workflow.

To comprehensively investigate the effects of hazelnut storage, samples were stored under three short-term and two long-term conditions and the polar metabolome was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy at different time points. Large differences in the polar metabolome were observed between the investigated storage conditions. Classification between samples before and after storage showed that samples stored under harsh conditions for a short-term and under standard conditions for a long-term were almost always classified correctly. Boruta, a feature selection algorithm, was used to identify which metabolites were significant for classification. Increases in hexanoic octanoic and nonanoic acid, all products of lipid oxidation, were found across all conditions and an increase in formic acid in most.

Structure and dynamics of the s2m are key to establishing a structure-function connection, yet a full set of atomistic resolution coordinates is not available for SARS-CoV-2 s2m. Our work constructs three-dimensional coordinates consistent with NMR solution phase data for SARS-CoV-2 s2m and provides a comparative analysis with its counterpart SARS-CoV s2m. We employed initial coordinates based on PDB ID: 1XJR for SARS-CoV s2m and two models for SARS-CoV-2 s2m: one based on 1XJR in which we introduced the mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 s2m and the second based on the available SARS-CoV-2 NMR NOE data supplemented with knowledge-based methods. For each of the three systems, 3500 ns molecular dynamics simulations were used to sample the structure and dynamics, and principal component analysis (PCA) reduced the ensembles to hierarchal conformational substates for detailed analysis. Dilute solution simulations of SARS-CoV s2m, demonstrate that the GNRA-like terminal pentaloop is rigidly defined by base stacking uniquely positioned for possible kissing dimer formation. However, the SARS-CoV-2 s2m simulation did not retain the reported crystallographic SARS-CoV motifs and the terminal loop expands to a highly dynamic \u201cnonaloop.\u201d Increased flexibility and structural disorganization are observed for the larger terminal loops, where an entropic penalty is computed to explain the experimentally observed reduction in kissing complex formation. Overall, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements have a similarly pronounced L-shape due to different motif interactions. Our study establishes the atomistic three-dimensional structure and uncovers dynamic differences that arise from s2m sequence changes, which sets the stage for the interrogation of different mechanistic pathways of suspected biological function.", "date": "2022-07-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As landfills are the final disposal method for majority of the waste, PFAS concentration in landfill leachate have been found in the range of few \u00b5g/L to mg/L. Only few conventional treatments such as Activated Carbon, Reverse Osmosis, and Ion-Exchange has been proven effective in removing PFAS. However, these treatment methods are proving to be very expensive and generate secondary contamination that needs to be disposed-off or treated. Since the phase out of C8-PFAS compounds, more short chain PFAS compounds are detected in landfill leachate. Hence, an effective treatment strategy is needed to keep up with the rising concentration levels and variety of PFAS compounds. The purpose of this study was to develop a sustainable and cost-effective process using modified Coal Fly-Ash (CFA) that can treat both short chain and long chain PFAS compounds. Previous studies have shown application of CFA in removal of dye and metals from different types of wastewaters. In previous studies CFA was modified to enhance its surface properties, that can improve the adsorption of organic and anionic contaminants. In this study, thermo-chemical modification was used on CFA to remove organic matter and PFAS compounds. Preliminary results showed that, CFA can remove more than 90% UV absorbance, more than 80% TOC and approximately 40% of total PFAS compounds. The maximum adsorption capacity for total PFAS was found to be 84 ng PFAS per g CFA, out of which 70 ng was for short chain PFAS and 14 ng for long chain PFAS compounds. An effective removal of organic matter and PFAS compounds, show a promising application of CFA in leachate treatment.

Ecotoxicity reviews have consolidated that low concentrations of pharmaceutical pollutants, specifically non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, impose significant toxicological risks on the aquatic ecosystem. Research solutions have shifted towards electrochemical oxidation for its environmental-friendly, precise, and flexible reduction characteristics over non-electrochemical technologies. However, there isn't significant literature dedicated to finding the conditions for small-scale pretreatment, leaving the environment between the pollutant source and WWTPs at risk. This research explores the optimal conditions to pretreat pharmaceutical wastewater using electrochemical oxidation on a small-scale. A conventional approach, utilizing accessible materials and simple procedures, was selected to ease the implementation of pretreatment outside of WWTPs. Spectrophotometric analysis was performed to identify the concentration changes through absorbance for reagents. Manipulated variables of temperature, pH level, scale, and electrode metal type were analyzed individually per solution and in combination to produce the overall effect. F-Test and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests were employed to derive the maximum electrochemical oxidation ability for different variables. Results indicate that at the 95% confidence level, temperatures below 25\u02daC, pH levels below 4, larger scale, and higher reactivity metal plates produce the highest electrochemical oxidation magnitude. Overall analysis comparing the combined optimal conditions with the control group yielded an approximately 50% greater concentration reduction magnitude.

The measurements at 532 and 611 nm access the X-^3-\u03a3^- and a-^1-Delta electronic states of SO, whereas the measurements at 355 nm also access the b-^1\u03a3^+ state. In aggregate, the photoelectron anisotropy parameter values follow the general trend with respect to electron kinetic energy (eKE) expected for \u03c0* orbital photodetachment. The trend is similar to O2-, but the minimum of the SO- curve is shifted to smaller eKE. This shift is attributed mainly to the exit-channel interactions of the departing electron with the dipole moment of the neutral SO core, rather than the differing shapes of the SO- and O2- molecular orbitals. Of the several ab initio models considered, two approaches yield good agreement with the experiment: one representing the departing electron as a superposition of eigenfunctions of a point dipole-field Hamiltonian, and another describing the outgoing electron in terms of Coulomb waves originating from two separated charge centers, with a partial positive charge on the sulfur and an equal negative charge on the oxygen. These fundamentally related approaches support the conclusion that electron-dipole interactions in the exit channel of SO- photodetachment play an important role in shaping the PADs. While a similar conclusion was previously reached for photodetachment from sigma orbitals of CN- (Hart, Lyle, Spellberg, Krylov, Mabbs, J. Phys. Chem.

The high specific surface area of MSP (428 m2 g-1) as the anti-icing agent carrier significantly contributed to the retainment of PEG in the composites.

Oney-Hawthorne; Syuan-Ting  Kuo; David P.  Barondeau; David H. Russell", "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster cofactors are required for the function of many critical cellular processes. These cofactors are assembled and inserted into apo target proteins by conserved Fe-S cluster biosynthetic pathways. In the ISC system of E. coli, the scaffold protein IscU assembles Fe-S cluster intermediates from iron, electrons, and inorganic sulfur, which is provided by the cysteine desulfurase enzyme IscS. IscU also binds to Zn, which mimics and competes for binding with the Fe-S cluster. Crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies reveal that IscU is a metamorphic protein that exists in multiple conformational states, which include at least a structured form and a disordered form. The structured form of IscU is favored by metal binding and is stable in a narrow temperature range, undergoing both cold and hot denaturation. However, there is controversy over whether the structured or disordered form of IscU binds to IscS and functions in Fe-S cluster assembly. The recent development of variable-temperature electrospray ionization (vT-ESI) native ion mobility mass spectrometry (nIM-MS) enables probing the temperature dependence of macromolecular conformation and binding events in a single experiment. Here, vT-ESI nIM-MS results established that IscU exists in structured, intermediate, and disordered conformations. IscU samples shift towards high-charge states that have more extended conformations under extreme temperatures, consistent with cold/heat denaturation. A comparison of Zn-IscU and apo-IscU reveals that Zn(II) binding (i) attenuates the cold/heat-denaturation of IscU and promotes the refolding of IscU; (ii) favors the structured aand intermediate conformations and inhibits the disordered high charge states; and (iii) attenuates collisional induced unfolding (CIU) of intermediate conformations. Moreover, IscS was shown to alter the local conformation around the IscU active site, resulting in weakened Zn(II) affinity. Overall, these findings provide structural rationalization of the role of Zn(II) on stabilizing IscU conformation and the role of IscS on altering the IscU active site to prepare for Zn(II) release and cluster synthesis. This work highlights how vT-ESI-nMS can be applied as a powerful tool in mechanistic enzymology by providing details of relationships among temperature, protein conformations, and ligand/protein binding.", "date": "2022-07-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Its layered structure allows the efficient intercalation of ions, leading to experimental volumetric capacitance as high as 140 F/cm3. Molecular dynamics could in principle be used to characterize its charging mechanism, however, unlike conventional nanoporous carbon, 1T-MoS2 is a multi-component electrode. The Mo and S atoms have very different electronegativities, so that 1T-MoS2 cannot be simulated accurately using the conventional constant potential method. In this work, we show that controlling the electrochemical potential of the atoms allows to recover average partial charges for the elements in agreement with electronic structure calculations for the material at rest, without compromising the ability to simulate systems under an applied voltage. The simulations yield volumetric capacitances in agreement with experiments.  We show that due to the large electronegativity of S, the co-ion desorption is the main charging mechanism at play during the charging process. This contrast drastically with carbon materials for which ion exchange and counter-ion adsorption usually dominate.

As an inherently chiral structural feature, the helix provides a modular platform for the creation of chiral nanomaterials exhibiting a diverse range of capabilities.  Nonetheless, the development of rapid, scalable methods for production of chiral nanomaterials presents a formidable challenge.  However, recent advances in both amphiphilic block copolymer (BCP) synthesis and self-assembly provide tractable means to do just that.  In this work, polymerization induced crystallization-driven self-assembly (PI-CDSA) is combined, for the first time, with helical, rod-coil BCP self-assembly to enable scalable and controllable in situ synthesis of chiral nanostructures with variable shape, size, and dimensionality.  Herein, we detail the use of newly developed Asymmetric PI-CDSA methodologies in the synthesis and in situ self-assembly of chiral, rod-coil BCPs comprised of poly(aryl isocyanide) (PAIC) rigid-rod and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) random-coil components.

Using seeded, living asymmetric PI-CDSA, the lengths and heights of 1D nanofiber and 3D spirangle nanostructures, respectively, can be selectively tuned via alterations in unimer-to-seed ratios. The formation of these nanostructures is dictated by the liquid crystalline nature of PAIC blocks and the hierarchical assembly of these BCPs, with chirality translated across length scales and in multiple dimensions (i.e., spirangles), led to large amplifications in chiroptical activity with high Kuhn\u2019s dissymmetry factors reaching 0.029.", "date": "2023-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers); Nanofabrication; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

By combing two complementary chemical moieties, such as sulfonic acid group and Rh(II)-carboxylate paddlewheel, we synthesized a robust water-soluble cuboctahedral MOP with excellent features in both solution and solid state. Herein, we demonstrate that the superior chemical stability of the Rh2 unit and the elevated number of functional groups on the surface (24 per cage) result in a porous cage with high solubility and stability in water, including acidic, neutral and basic pH conditions. We also prove that the sulfonic acid-rich form of the cage can be isolated through post-synthetic acid treatment. This transformation involves an improved gas uptake capacity, and the capability to reversibly assemble the cages into a 3D metal-organic framework (MOF) structure. Likewise, this sulfonic acid functionalization provides both MOP and MOF solids with high proton conductivities (> 10-3 S cm-1), comparable to previously reported high conducting metal-organic materials. The influence of the MOP-to-MOF processing in the gas adsorption capacity indicates this structural transformation can provide materials with higher and more controllable porous properties.

To conduct the necessary nonadiabatic dynamics simulations with high-lying electronic states and deal with fluorescence timescales of about 100 ns of this large molecule, we developed new computational protocols. The results from both approaches confirm that the band shoulder is, in fact, due to S2 emission. We show that the non-Kasha behavior is a dynamic-equilibrium effect, not caused by a metastable S2 minimum. However, it requires considerable vibrational energy, which can only be achieved in collisionless regimes after transitions into highly excited states.

We have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the competition between water/toluene and water/decane to cellulose. We consider two cellulose surfaces (from different crystalline planes) with different roughness and different accessibility to hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. We also use bacterial cellulose to perform wetting and solvent exchange experiments.

Toluene can be replaced by water but a water hydration layer cannot be replaced by toluene, an effect that can be traced back to the molecular features of cellulose. This preference is confirmed experimentally by solvent exchange experiments.

In this research, MD simulations are used to predict the contact angle values of different epoxy systems on a BNNT surface. A reactive INTERFACE force field was parameterized and utilized in the simulations to accurately describe the interaction of the epoxy monomers with the BNNT surface.

Oxidation of tryptophan results in electrowetting of this residue. This structural change makes the free energy surfaces of electron transfer non-parabolic as described by the Q-model of electron transfer. We analyze the medium dynamical effect on protein electron transfer produced by coupled Stokes-shift dynamics and the dynamics of the donor-acceptor distance modulating electron tunneling. The equilibrium donor-acceptor distance falls in the plateau region of the rate constant, when it is determined by the protein-water dynamics and the probability of electron tunneling does not affect the rate. The crossover distance found here puts most intraprotein electron-transfer reactions under the umbrella of dynamical control. The crossover between the medium-controlled and tunneling-controlled kinetics is combined with the effect of the protein-water medium on the activation barrier to formulate principles of tunability of protein-based charge-transfer chains. The main principle in optimizing the activation barrier is the departure from the Gaussian-Gibbsian statistics of fluctuations promoting activated transitions. This is achieved either by incomplete (nonergodic) sampling, breaking the link between the Stokes-shift and variance reorganization energies, or through wetting-induced structural changes of the enzyme's active site.

These results show remarkable changes across the structural phase transitions together with presence of multiple peaks, prominently in the low temperature regime, that can be associated with different crystallographic phases apparently coexisting at low temperatures. We propose that the persistent dominant presence of the PL signal associated with the high temperature tetragonal/cubic phase in each case even at the lowest temperature can only originate from a structural relaxation at the surface of the grains of the low temperature phase, making the surface electronic structure close to that of the high temperature phases. Since the bandgap is smaller for the surface related phase, the photoexcited energy is significantly transferred to the surface region before deexcitation, giving rise to the dominance of this PL feature. Our results show that with an increasing FA content, this transfer of energy becomes more efficient with a complete suppression of the PL features of the low temperature bulk phase, while the x-ray diffraction shows a phase pure low temperature phase alone. Additionally, we show that the lowest energy PL feature that appears only at a critical low temperature is not associated with any crystallographic transition, but correlates well with the plastic crystal-like transition arising from the three-fold rotations of the MA unit around its C-N axis as determined by prior quasi-elastic neutron scattering studies. This suggests that the MA rotations suppress the formation of self-trapped excitonic features via electron-phonon interactions, while the feature begins to appear with increasing intensity as the MA rotations are frozen with a decreasing temperature below a certain temperature. This interpretation allows us to estimate the polaronic contribution to the stability of the self-trapped exciton in these systems to be around ~35 \u00b1 3 meV. Interestingly, the PL spectrum progressively shows a suppression of contributions from the low temperature phases and the self-trapped exciton with an increasing FA content, leading to a single peak PL feature at all temperatures for the highest FA content sample investigated in this work.", "date": "2022-07-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Optical Materials; Photovoltaics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The key targets in molecular-based assays to detect STEC are stx1 or stx2 genes, coding for the ability to produce Shiga T Toxin 1 and 2. The most commonly used molecular detection techniques, such as PCR and real-time PCR, are considerably time-consuming and there is an urgent need for a more rapid screening assay which could be used in agri-food settings. In this work, an amplification-free multiplex electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous detection of stx1 and stx2 genes was developed using a silicon-based chip comprising of six interdigitated gold microelectrodes(IDE) sensors. Two probes complementary to stx1 and stx2 genes were immobilised on a single chip allowing for multiplex detection. The selectivity of the multiplex sensor was confirmed using fluorescence and electrochemistry. The developed assay conditions allowed for an improved limit of detection by three orders of magnitude compared to the previous reports achieving a amplification-free limit of detection of 100 zM (10-19 M) for both, stx1 and stx2 genes. The developed sensor was validated using chromosomal DNA extracted from a bacterial culture containing no virulence genes, stx1 gene only, and both stx1 and stx2. Such multiplex sensor, if combined with on-chip DNA extraction, could revolutionise the point-of-use detection of STEC as well as other pathogens for instance on-farm or in the food industry.", "date": "2022-07-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) has emerged as a model-free alternative to equivalent circuits and physical models to circumvent the inherent challenges of EIS analysis. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to deconvolve DRTs, but several issues remain, e.g., the long training time, the DNN accuracy, and the deconvolution of DRTs with negative peaks. The DNN-DRT model was developed here to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, a pretraining step was included to decrease the computation time. A thorough error analysis was also conducted to evaluate the different components of the DRT and impedance errors to ultimately decrease them. Lastly, the training loss function was modified to handle DRTs with negative peaks. These different advances were validated with an array of synthetic EIS spectra and real EIS spectra from a lithium-ion battery, a solid oxide fuel cell, and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Moreover, this new model outperformed in most cases the previously developed DRTtools and deep-DRT model. Overall, we envision that this research will open the venue for more DNN-based analyses of EIS data for electrochemical systems.", "date": "2022-07-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

An extensive structure-activity relationship study (SAR) was performed, which focused mainly on the combination of scaffold changes and revealed the key chemical features for a high anti-CHIKV inhibition. Further, to investigate the druggability of the compound series, a thorough ADMET investigation was carried out: the compounds were screened for their aqueous solubility, lipophilicity, their toxicity in CaCo-2 cells, and possible hERG channel interactions. Additionally, 55 analogues were assessed for their metabolic stability in human liver microsomes (HLMs) which led to a structure-metabolism relationship study (SMR). The compounds showed an excellent safety profile, favourable physicochemical characteristics, and the required metabolic stability. A cross-resistance study confirmed the viral capping machinery (nsP1) to be the viral target of these second-generation CHVB compounds.

This is because the normal polarization of a Si-H bond is Si(delta+)-H(delta-), while that of a C-H bond is C(delta-)-H(delta+). From a bond orbital perspective, a sigma*CH orbital has greater expansion on hydrogen, while a sigma*SiH orbital has greater expansion on Si. Thus, the lone pair of a base mainly attacks hydrogen of a C-H bond for deprotonation, but adds to the silicon atom of a Si-H bond. Previous reports showed that the assistance of negative hyperconjugation between the lone pair of the silyl anion and sigma* orbitals on silyl substituent(s) or an intramolecular chelating group (a pincer ligand) is necessary for deprotonation from silanes. In fact, Kira et al. found that treatment of diphenylsilane with t-butyllithium or LDA resulted in nucleophilic substitution, not deprotonation, only to eliminate a hydride as a leaving group. Recently, we developed a silicon-homologation reaction by a deprotonation-nucleophilic substitution sequence. In that reaction, we assumed that dispro-portionation led to alkoxysilyllithium or a silenoid species generated in situ. We expected that a disproportionation approach could be applied to the deprotonation of monosilanes, such as diphenylsilane. Here we report the first successful approach to the deprotonation of monosilanes with no intramolecular chelation.

However, control of structure requires, by definition, control over folding handedness. Control over o-phenylene twist sense is currently lacking. While chiral induction from groups at o-phenylene termini has been demonstrated, it would be useful to instead direct twisting from internal positions in order to leave the ends free. Here, we explore chiral induction in a series of o-phenylenes with chiral imides at their centers. Conformational behavior has been studied by NMR and CD spectroscopies and DFT calculations. Chiral induction in otherwise unfunctionalized o-phenylenes is generally poor. However, strategic functionalization of the helix surface with trifluoromethyl and methyl groups allows it to better interact with the imide groups, greatly increasing diastereomeric excesses.

For instance, pH can regulate the long-range electron transfer (ET) in many proteins. However, the mechanistic basis of many pH-dependent long-range ET processes remain unclear. In this study, we unravel the critical role of pH in accelerating the long-range ET in lignin peroxidase (LiP) using QM/MM MD simulations and the nonadiabatic ET and PCET theories. As a key enzyme involved in lignin degradation, LiP accomplishes the one-electron oxidation of lignin via two consecutive long-range ET reactions: the first one involves ET from Trp171 to the active species of Compound I, affording the Trp171 radical species, while the second one involves ET from the lignin substrate to the Trp171 radical, affording the lignin cation radical species. Our study demonstrates that pH can remarkably modulate the mechanism and kinetics of both ET reactions. Specifically, in the absence of the pH buffer of tartaric acid, our study shows that the first ET leads to a neutral Trp\u2022 radical, agreeing with the EPR experiments. Surprisingly, the addition of the tartaric acid stabilizes the Trp-H\u2022+ cation radical via second-sphere H-bonding interactions and accelerates the ET rate for lignin oxidation by several orders of magnitude.

Their properties, though, have been extensively studied mainly in the domain of regression, in relation to which the effect of well-known deleterious factors (like object leverage or data distributions deviating from ideal conditions) on the accuracy of the prediction of an external response variable have been thoroughly assessed. Conversely, much less attention has been paid to what these factors might yield in alternative scenarios, where least squares approaches are still utilised, yet the objectives of data modelling may be very different. As an example, one can think of multivariate curve resolution (MCR) problems which are usually addressed by means of Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS). In this respect, this article wants to offer a perspective on the basic principles of MCR-ALS from the regression point of view. In particular, the following critical aspects will be highlighted: i) in the presence of minor components, if the number of analysed data points is too large, the leverage of those that may be essential for a MCR-ALS resolution might become too low for guaranteeing its correctness and ii) in order to overcome this black hole effect and improve the accuracy of the MCR-ALS output, data pruning can be exploited. More in detail, this communication will provide a practical illustration of such aspects in the field of hyperspectral imaging where even single experimental runs may lead to the generation of massive amounts of spectral recordings.", "date": "2022-07-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Imaging; Spectroscopy (Anal.

For diagnosing the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), methods using antibodies specific to antigens on the virus are broadly used. We generated by classical SELEX a number of aptamers, interacting with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV2 spike protein (SARS-CoV2 Spike RBD) from Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. The sequence identification was performed using a novel methodology based on the nanopore sequencing. For sequence identification of selected aptamers, we created the novel protocol for aptamer identification based on nanopore sequencing. We identified the best aptamer candidate named MEZ. It was chemically synthesized and tested for binding with SARS CoV2 Spike RBD domain of the S-protein from different strains. Kd of the complex is 6.5 nM being comparable with known aptamers. Virus neutralization tests demonstrate similar results for already known and MEZ aptamers. We identified differences for aptamers binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD from Wuhan-Hu-1 and Omicron strains. MD simulations reveal that the number of hydrogen bonds between the protein and aptamer is higher for the more stable complex. Moreover, dynamic network analysis show that the motions of the aptamer and protein are correlated to a higher extent in a more stable complex. Based on the experimental data and computational results we can conclude that the authentic RBD-aptamer complex has two specific points for interaction and the 3'-end of aptamer is responsible for strain identification. Therefore, the selected aptamer based on experimental data can be an alternative biological element for the development of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing with strain specificity and cost efficiency due to the short length of aptamer being 31 nucleotides.", "date": "2022-07-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Realizing reversed conductance decay is an important step towards making long and highly conducting molecular wires. Recent work has shown that one-dimensional topological insulators (1D TIs) can exhibit reversed conductance decay due to their non-trivial edge states. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for 1D TIs relates to the electronic structure of these isolated molecules but not their electron transport properties as single-molecule junctions. Herein, we use a tight-binding approach to demonstrate that polyacetylene and other diradicaloid 1D TIs show a reversed conductance decay at the short chain limit. We explain these conductance trends by analyzing the impact of the edge states in these 1D systems on the single-molecule junction transmission.

Therefore, the annual-hydrogen-yield-climatic-response (AHYCR) ratio is introduced as a figure of merit to evaluate the outdoor performance of integrated solar water splitting devices.

In particular, catalysts based on Cu modified with post-transition metals (Sn or In) are known to reduce CO2 selectively to either CO or HCOO- depending on their composition. However, it remains unclear exactly which factors induce this switch in reaction pathways, and whether these two related bimetal combinations follow similar general structure-activity trends. To investigate these questions systematically, Cu-In and Cu-Sn bimetallic catalysts were synthesized across a range of composition ratios and studied in detail. Compositional and morphological control was achieved via a simple electrochemical synthesis approach. A combination of operando and quasi in-situ spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray photoelectron, X-ray absorption, and Raman spectroscopy, were used to observe the dynamic behaviors of the catalysts\u2019 surface structure, composition, speciation, and local environment during CO2 electrolysis. The two systems exhibited similar selectivity dependency on their surface composition. Cu-rich catalysts produce mainly CO, while Cu-poor catalysts were found to mainly produce HCOO-. Despite these similarities, the speciation of Sn and In at the surface differed from each other, and were found to be strongly dependent on the applied potential and the catalyst composition. For Cu-rich compositions optimized for CO production (Cu85In15 and Cu85Sn15), indium was present predominantly in reduced metallic form (In0), whereas tin mainly existed as an oxidized species (Sn2/4+). Meanwhile, for the HCOO--selective compositions (Cu25In75 and Cu40Sn60), the indium exclusively exhibited In0 regardless of the applied potential, while the tin resembles was reduced to metallic (Sn0) only at most negative applied potential, which corresponds to the best HCOO- selectivity. Furthermore, while Cu40Sn60 enhances HCOO- selectivity by inhibiting H2 evolution, Cu25In75 improves the HCOO- selectivity at the expense of CO production. Due to these differences, we contend that identical mechanisms cannot be used to explain the behavior of these two bimetallic systems (Cu-In and Cu-Sn). Operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy measurements provide direct evidence of the local alkalization and its impact on the dynamic transformation of oxidized Cu surface species (Cu2O/CuO) into a mixture of Cu(OH)2 and basic Cu carbonates (Cux(OH)y(CO3)y) rather than metallic Cu under CO2 electrolysis. This study provides novel insight into the origin of the switch in selectivity between CO and HCOO- pathways at Cu bimetallic catalysts and the nature of surface-active sites and key intermediates for both pathways.

Here we revisit the Jahn- Teller distortion of allene and spiropentadiene by assessing the possible implications of their helical \u03c0-systems in the radical cations. We describe a general relation between the structure and the number of \u03c0-electrons in linear and spiroconjugated systems. Through constrained optimizations we compare the stabilization achieved by bond-length alternation and axial torsion in the radical cations, which we explain with a simple frontier molecular orbital (MO) picture. While structurally different, allene and spiropentadiene have similar helical frontier MOs. Both cations relax through torsion because the stabilization of their helical frontier MOs is bigger than that which can be achieved by linear \u03c0-conjugation. Electrohelicity thus manifests in molecular systems with partial occupation as a helical \u03c0-conjugation effect, which evidently provides more stabilization than its linear counterpart in terms of the Jahn-Teller distortion.

Permeability data for water and oxygen through epoxy-based coatings are of particular interest because the coating\u2019s barrier performance in humid environments is directly related to how quickly these reactants get to the metal/coating interface. There is, however, an absence of literature data to explain oxygen transport within coatings in the presence of condensed water and its associated plasticization effects. We show that water is a dominant player in the barrier performance of epoxy coatings because it blocks the transport of other permeants. Through analysis of the sorption isotherms and empirical permeation data, we determined adjustable parameters that explain water vapor plasticization effects in fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) at 65\u00b0C. At this temperature, evolution of cavity formation and break-up of water clusters result in high mobility of water molecules inside the epoxy network. We also modeled oxygen transport through FBE in wet-state conditions based on time lag measurements, and with reported literature data on vapor and gas sorption in epoxy. In a mixed gas/vapor system, condensed water in FBE blocks and/or significantly decreases gas permeation in the coating. If the service temperature is low (less than 40\u00b0C), water immobilizes the oxygen gas within microvoid regions in the glassy epoxy. Our experimental measurements, combined with Freeman\u2019s theoretical model for upper bound limits, showed that this water-induced blocking mechanism is sufficient to suppress corrosion reactions on the underlying substrate material. At 65\u00b0C and above, the synergistic effect of coating plasticization by water molecules and dissolution of oxygen in a mobile water phase results in significant gaseous transport. We applied mathematical models based on proven sorption and transport models to FBE free-standing films and derived adjustable parameters to quantitatively explain this competitive permeation. Our O2 transport data show that, compared to the single-layer FBE, epoxy-based coatings with additional polyolefin layers can improve the barrier performance by deprivation of micropore channels for gas transport.", "date": "2022-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Coating Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Indeed, knee points often originate from complex interplays between electrodes, through a cascade of parasitic reactions or modification of cell balancing. In this work, we analyze and demonstrate how combining adequate electrochemical testing protocols, coupled with analysis such as differential voltage analysis or capacity marching analysis, allows disentangling effects as complex as cross talking events for selected graphite/Ni-rich cell chemistries.

An everlasting challenge in realizing full-spectrum CPL detection when using chiral organic semiconductors is to achieve strong chiroptical activities in the near infrared (NIR) region. The conventional approaches to reducing the band gap of organic semiconductors are based on co-planar backbones and lead to molecular symmetries incompatible with the presence of chirality; thus, the strategies to design chiral molecules rely on twisted stereogenic moieties. Here, instead of a de novo design of chiral molecular structures, we introduce a widely applicable strategy to directly induce chiroptical activity in planar non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which have been largely developed in the framework of organic photovoltaics and provide a wealth of opportunities to fill the spectral gap of CPL detection in the NIR. We demonstrate proof-of-concept circularly polarized organic photodiodes (CP-OPDs) using chiroptically active NFA blends, which exhibit strong circular dichroism (CD) and hence great sensitivity to CPL in the NIR region. Importantly, this strategy is found to be effective in a wide series of state-of-the-art NFA families, i.e., ITIC, o-IDTBR, and Y6 analogs, which significantly broadens the range of materials applicable to NIR CPL detection and can inspire further designs of strongly CPL-active systems for chiropto-electronics.", "date": "2022-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Processing; Optical Materials; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we evaluate the binding of positively charged small molecules, etidocaine and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), to a POPC lipid bilayer using the changes in lipid headgroup order parameters.

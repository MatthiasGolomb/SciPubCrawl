Mitotane (MT) has been used for treatment of ACC for decades, either alone or in combination with cytotoxic  chemotherapy. Even at doses up to 6 g per day, more than half of the patients do not achieve targeted plasma concentration (14-20 mg/L) even after many months of treatment which is caused by low water solubility and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties such as poor bioavailability and high volume of distribution of MT. The clinical need and previously reported extraordinary high drug loading of poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)-block-poly(2-butyl-2-oxazoline)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (A-pBuOx-A) based micelles for paclitaxel (PTX), led us to develop MT loaded micelles which may enable an injectable formulation. We successfully solubilized up to 6 g/L of MT in an aqueous formulation. The MT loaded nanoformulations were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray<br />\n<p>diffraction (XRD), confirmed the amorphous nature of drug in the formulations. The polymer itself did not show cytotoxicity in adrenal and liver cell lines. By using the ACC model cell line NCI-H295 both in monolayers and tumor cell spheroids, we demonstrated micellar MT to exhibit comparable efficacy to its ethanol solution. We postulate that this formulation would be suitable for i.v. application and more rapid attainment of therapeutic plasma concentrations. In conclusion, we consider our micellar formulation a promising tool to alleviate major drawbacks of current MT treatment while retaining bioactivity towards ACC in vitro.</p>", "date": "2019-05-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biocompatible Materials; Surfactants; Drug delivery systems; Organic Polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although algorithms for representation learning are extensively studied, their applications to domain-specific areas, such as polymer, are limited largely due to the lack of benchmark databases. In this work, we investigate different types of polymer representations, including Morgan Fingerprint (MF), molecular embedding (ME) and molecular graph (MG), based on a benchmark database from a subset of PolyInfo. We evaluate the quality of different polymer representations via quantifying the relationships between the representations and polymer properties, including density, melting temperature and glass transition temperature. Different representation learning schemes, such as supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, are investigated. It is found that ME outperforms the other representations for structure-property relationship quantification in all cases studied, and MG is shown to be much inferior than ME and MF, likely due to the relatively small volumes of training data available. For MEs, it is found that the similarities of substructure MEs under different learning schemes (e.g., SL, SSL and TL) are differently estimated, thus leading to different performance scores in structure-property relation quantification. Several ME mixtures have shown to outperform the single MEs in the corresponding regression tasks, and this is attributed to the information gain when mixing different ME.", "date": "2019-05-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This approach to reaction development often yields asymmetric methods that perform poorly using substrates sterically or electronically dissimilar to those used during the reaction optimization campaign. Consequently, expanding the scope of previously optimized catalytic asymmetric reactions to include new substrates is decidedly non-trivial. Here we address this challenge through the development of a systematic workflow to broaden the applicability and reliability of asymmetric conjugate additions to substrates conventionally regarded as sterically and electronically challenging. The copper-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of alkylzirconium nucleophiles to form tertiary centers, although successful for linear alkyl chains, fails for more sterically demanding linear \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones. Key to adapting this method to obtain high enantioselectivity was the discovery of new phosphoramidite ligands, designed using quantitative structure-selectivity relationships (QSSR). Iterative rounds of model construction and ligand synthesis were executed in parallel to evaluate the performance of twenty chiral ligands. The copper-catalyzed asymmetric addition is now more broadly applicable, even tolerating linear enones bearing tert-butyl \u03b2-substituents. The presence of common functional groups is tolerated in both nucleophiles and electrophiles, giving up to 99% yield and 95% ee across twenty examples.", "date": "2019-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Ligand Design; Reaction (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Sulfide solid electrolytes have received particular attention as a result of their high ionic conductivities. One of the main reasons for such high ionic conductivity is the apparently reduced grain boundary resistance of sulfide solid electrolytes compared to their oxide counterparts, but this is not fully established. Using two model electrolyte systems, Na3PS4 and Na3PO4, we apply a novel microscale simulation approach to analyze ionic transport in polycrystalline materials with various grain volumes. For Na3PO4, high grain boundary resistance is found, with the Na-ion conductivity decreasing with decreasing grain volume. For Na3PS4, the overall influence of grain boundaries is significantly reduced compared to the oxide. Detailed analysis reveals a minimal change in the local structures and Na-ion conduction mechanism between bulk and polycrystalline Na3PS4, whereas the change is far more substantial for Na3PO4, with evidence of over-coordination of Na ions at the grain boundaries.

As a consequence, most catalytic amidation protocols are unsuccessful when applied to polar and/or functionalised substrates of the kind commonly used in medicinal chemistry. In this paper we report a practical and useful catalytic direct amidation reaction using tert-butyl acetate as the reaction solvent. The use of an ester solvent offers improvements in terms of safety and sustainability, but also leads to an improved reaction scope with regard to polar substrates and less nucleophilic anilines, both of which are important components of amides used in medicinal chemistry.

Ahmed", "abstract": "The phosphorus (P) immobilization and thus its availability for plants are mainly affected by the strong interaction of phosphates with soil components especially soil mineral surfaces. Related reactions have been studied extensively via sorption experiments especially by carrying out adsorption of ortho-phosphate onto Fe-oxide surfaces. But a molecular-level understanding for the P-binding mechanisms at the mineral-water interface is still lacking, especially for forest eco-systems. Therefore, the current contribution provides an investigation of the molecular binding mechanisms for two abundant phosphates in forest soils, inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) and glycerolphosphate (GP), at the diaspore mineral surface. Here a hybrid electrostatic embedding quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) based molecular dynamics simulation has been applied to explore the diaspore-IHP/GP-water interactions. The results provide evidence for the formation of different P-diaspore binding motifs involving monodentate (M) and bidentate (B) for GP and two (2M) as well as three (3M) monodentate for IHP. The interaction energy results indicated the abundance of the GP B motif compared to the M one. The IHP 3M motif has a higher total interaction energy compared to its 2M motif, but exhibits a lower interaction energy per bond. Compared to GP, IHP exhibited stronger interaction with the surface as well as with water. Water was found to play an important role in controlling these diaspore-IHP/GP-water interactions. The interfacial water molecules form moderately strong H-bonds (HBs) with GP and IHP as well as with the diaspore surface. For all the diaspore-IHP/GP-water complexes, the interaction of water with diaspore exceeds that with the studied phosphates. Furthermore, some water molecules form covalent bonds with diaspore Al atoms while others dissociate at the surface to protons and hydroxyl groups leading to proton transfer processes. Finally, the current results con\ufb01rm previous experimental conclusions indicating the importance of the number of phosphate groups, HBs, and proton transfers in controlling the P-binding at soil mineral surfaces.", "date": "2019-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work we investigated four lyophilised formulations containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and three formulations containing a monoclonal antibody (mAb, here mAb1), and explore the role of the excipients polysorbate 80, sucrose, trehalose, and arginine on stabilising proteins. By performing temperature variable terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) experiments it is possible to study the vibrational dynamics of these formulations. The THz-TDS measurements reveal two distinct glass transition processes in all tested formulations. The lower temperature transition, <i>T</i><sub>g\u03b2</sub>, is associated with the onset of local motion due to the secondary relaxation whilst the higher temperature transition, <i>T</i><sub>g\u03b1</sub>, marks the onset of the \u03b1 relaxation. For some of the formulations, the globular BSA as well as mAb1, the absorption at terahertz frequencies does not increase further at temperatures above <i>T</i><sub>g\u03b1</sub>. Such behaviour is in contrast to our previous observations for small organic molecules as well as linear polymers where absorption is always observed to steadily increase with temperature due to the stronger absorption of terahertz radiation by more mobile dipoles. The absence of such further increase in absorption with higher temperatures therefore suggests a localised confinement of the protein/excipient matrix at high temperatures that hinders any further increase in mobility. Additionally, we used Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) experimental data to further investigate the structural changes associated with our terahertz spectroscopy measurements. None of these techniques were able to resolve the subtle changes associated with vibrational confinement observed by terahertz spectroscopy. No evidence was found for any conformational changes in the protein structure upon reconstitution. We found that subtle changes in excipient composition had an effect on the transition temperatures <i>T</i><sub>g\u03b1 </sub>and <i>T</i><sub>g\u03b2</sub> as well as the vibrational confinement in the solid state.

Burchett; Gregory S. Steeno; David L. Mobley; Xinjun Hou", "abstract": "Predicting binding free energy of ligand-protein complexes has been a grand challenge in the field of computational chemistry since the early days of molecular modeling. Multiple computational methodologies exist to predict ligand binding affinities. Pathway-based Free Energy Perturbation (FEP), Thermodynamic Integration (TI) as well as Linear Interaction Energy (LIE), and Molecular Mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-PBSA/GBSA) have been applied to a variety of biologically relevant problems and achieved different levels of predictive accuracy. Recent advancements in computer hardware and simulation algorithms of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo sampling, as well as improved general force field parameters, have made FEP a principal approach for calculating the free energy differences, especially when calculating the host-guest binding affinity differences upon chemical modification.<br /><br />Since the FEP-calculated binding free energy difference, denoted ddGFEP only characterizes the difference in free energy between pairs of ligands or complexes, not the absolute binding free energy value of each individual host-guest system, denoted dG, we examine two rarely asked questions in FEP application:<br /><br />1) Which values would be more appropriate as the prediction to assess the ligands prospectively: the calculated pairwise free energy differences, ddGFEP, or the estimated absolute binding energies, d^G, transformed from ddGFEP?<br />2) In the situation where only a limited number of ligand pairs can be calculated in FEP, can the perturbation pairs be optimally selected with respect to the reference ligand(s) to maximize the prediction precision?<br /><br />These two questions underline the viability of an often-neglected assumption in pairwise comparisons: that the pairwise value is sufficient to make a quantitative and reliable characterization of an individual ligand's properties or activities. This implicit assumption would be true if there was no error in each pairwise calculation. Recently pair designs such as multiple pathways or cycle closure analyses provided calculation error estimation but did not address the statistical impact of the two questions above. The error impact is fully minimized by conducting an exhaustive study that obtains all NC2 = N(N-1)/2 pairs for a set N molecules; more if there is directionality (dGi,j != dGj,i). Obviously, that study design is impractical and unnecessary. Thus, we desire to collect the right amount of data that is 1) feasibly attainable, 2) topologically sufficient, and 3) mathematically synthesizable so that we can mitigate inherent calculation errors and have higher confidence in our conclusions.<br /><br />The significance of above questions can be illustrated by a motivating example shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, which considers two different perturbation graph designs for 20 ligands with the same number of FEP perturbation pairs, 19, and the same reference, Ligand 1. These two designs reached different conclusions in rank ordering ligand potencies due to errors inherent in the FEP derived estimates. Based on design A, ligands 5, 7, 14, 15 would be selected as the best four (20%) picks since those d^G estimates are the most favorable. Design B would yield ligands 5, 12, 18, 19 as best for the same reason. Without knowing the true value, dGTrue of the other 19 ligands, we lack a prospective metric to assess which design could be more precise even though, retrospectively, we know that both designs had reasonably good agreement with the true values, as measured through correlation and error metrics. However, the top picks from neither design were consistent with the true top four ligands, which are ligands 7, 10, 12, 18. Yet, if all of the 20C2 =190 pairs could have been calculated as listed in the last column of Table 1, the best four ligands would have been correctly identified. Additionally, the other metrics included in Table 1 were significantly improved. However, as mentioned above, calculating all possible pairs, or even a significant fraction of all possible pairs, is unlikely in practice, especially when number of molecules are large. Given this restriction, is it possible to objectively determine whether design A or B will give more precise predictions?<br /><br />In this report, we investigated the performance of the calculated ddGFEP values compared to the pairwise differences in least squares derived d^G estimates both analytically and through simulations. Based on our findings, we recommend applying weighted least squares to transforming ddGFEP values into d^G estimates. Second, we investigated the factors that contribute to the precision of the d^G estimates, such as the total number of computed pairs, the selection of computed pairs, and the uncertainty in the computed ddGFEP values. The mean squared error, denoted MSE and Spearman's rank correlation, are used as performance metrics.<br /><br />To illustrate, we demonstrated how the structural similarity can be included in design and its potential impact on prediction precision. As in the majority of reported FEP studies on binding affinity prediction, the ddGFEP pairs were selected based on chemical structure similarity. Pairs with small chemical differences are assumed to be more likely to have smaller errors in ddGFEP calculation. Together using the constructed mathematic system and literature examples, we demonstrate that some of pair-selection schemes (designs) are better than the others. To minimize the prediction uncertainty, it is recommended to wisely select design optimality criterion to suit<br />practical applications accordingly.<br />", "date": "2019-05-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

When models are trained using debiased data splits, the reward for simply memorising the training data is reduced, suggesting that the ability of the model to make accurate predictions for novel candidate ligands will improve. To test this hypothesis, we use distance-based data splits to measure how well a model can generalise. We first confirm that models perform better for randomly split held-out sets than for distant held-out sets. We then debias the data and find, surprisingly, that debiasing typically reduces the ability of models to make accurate predictions for distant held-out test sets.

Incorporation of graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) in the polyamide layer can alter the surface characteristics, permeability, selectivity, and can enhance the chlorine resistance of these membranes. In this study, a layer-by-layer (LbL) synthesis technique has been developed for embedding GONPs in polyamide layer. Polyamide layers with GONPs were synthesized in various sequences, such as alternating layers of GONPs and polyamide, and GONPs on top of the polyamide layer. Incorporation of GONPs resulted in an increase of surface hydrophilicity, as captured by the change of the water contact angle. Water flux and salt rejection properties of synthesized membranes have been investigated by using a dead-end cell. The salt rejection ability of membranes increased slightly with the incorporation of GONPs, while the water flux found to be similar to that observed for the pristine membranes without GONPs. Upon exposure to chlorine,  GONPs embedded membranes retained salt rejection performance better than the pristine membranes.

The applied temperature of the working electrode influences both its electrical resistance and the electrochemical potential of a redox couple.

We demonstrate that the performance of machine learning scoring functions are consistently improved by the inclusion of diverse ligand-based features.

Counter-intuitively, our results show that D570K inhibitory mutation exerts its effect by enhancing rather than weakening STAT3-DNA interactions, which interferes with the DNA release by the protein dimer and thus inhibits STAT3 function as a transcription factor. We mapped the binding site and characterised the binding mode of a clinical candidate napabucasin/BBI-608 at STAT3, which resembles the effect of D570K mutation. We also discovered a novel binding site at STAT3 DNA binding domain, amenable to bind small molecule ligands.</p><p>Our results contribute to understanding the activation/inhibition mechanism of STAT3, to explain the molecular mechanism of STAT3 inhibition by napabucasin/BBI-608. In this study, alongside the characterisation of the BBI-608 binding mode, we mapped a novel binding sites amenable to bind small molecule ligands, which may pave the way to design novel STAT3 inhibitors and to suggest new strategies for pharmacological intervention to combat cancers associated with poor prognosis.</p>", "date": "2019-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Cell and Molecular Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An approach to overcome this challenge that has gained prominence in recent years leverages the plasticity and malleability of lignin biosynthesis to tune lignin structure in planta through genetic approaches. An improved understanding of lignin biosynthesis can thus provide fundamental insights critical for the development of effective tailoring and valorization strategies. Although it is widely accepted that lignin monomers and growing chains are oxidized enzymatically into radicals that then undergo kinetically-controlled coupling in planta, direct experimental evidence has been scarce because of the difficulty of exactly replicating in planta lignification conditions. Here, we computationally investigate a set of radical reactions representative of lignin biosynthesis. We show that, contrary to the widely held notion that radical coupling reactions should be barrierless and dynamically controlled, the computed activation energies can be qualitatively consistent with key structural observations made empirically for native lignin in a variety of biomass types.

DAMP4, a designer biosurfactant, enables the\nmodification of interfaces via genetic or chemical fusion to functional\nmoieties. However, bioconjugation of addressable amines introduces\nheterogeneity that limits the precision of functionalization as well as the resolution\nof interfacial characterization. Here we designed DAMP4 variants with cysteine\npoint mutations to allow for site-specific bioconjugation. The DAMP4 variants\nwere shown to retain the structural stability and interfacial activity characteristic\nof the parent molecule, while permitting efficient and specific conjugation of\npolyethylene glycol (PEG). PEGylation results in a considerable reduction on\nthe interfacial activity of both single and double mutants. Comparison of\nconjugates with one or two conjugation sites shows that both the number of\nconjugates as well as the mass of conjugated material impacts the interfacial activity\nof DAMP4. As a result, the ability of DAMP4 variants with multiple PEG\nconjugates to impart colloidal stability on peptide-stabilized emulsions is\nreduced. We suggest that this is due to steric constraints on the structure of\namphiphilic helices at the interface. Specific and efficient bioconjugation permits\nthe exploration and investigation of the interfacial properties of designer\nprotein biosurfactants with molecular precision. Our findings should therefore\ninform the design and modification of biosurfactants for their increasing use\nin industrial processes, and nutritional and pharmaceutical formulations.", "date": "2019-05-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Self-Assembly; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We now introduce photoswitchable PROTACs that can be activated with the temporal and spatial precision that light provides. These trifunctional molecules, which we named PHOTACs, consist of a ligand for an E3 ligase, a photoswitch, and a ligand for a protein of interest. We demonstrate this concept by using PHOTACs that target either BET family proteins (BRD2,3,4) or FKBP12. Our lead compounds display little or no activity in the dark but can be reversibly activated to varying degrees with different wavelengths of light.

We present a novel approach to modify the potential energy surface in order to drive the system to a user-defined target distribution where the free energy barrier is lowered. The new approach, called targeted adversarial learning optimized sampling (TALOS) combines the strengths of statistical mechanics and deep learning. By casting the enhanced sampling problem as a competing game between a real sampling engine and a virtual discriminator, TALOS enables unsupervised construction of bias potential on an arbitrary dimensional space and seeks for an optimal transport plan that transforms the system into target. Through multiple experiments we show that on-the-fly training of TALOS benefits from the state-of-art optimization techniques in deep learning, thus is efficient, robust and interpretable. Additionally, TALOS is closely connected to actor-critic reinforcement learning, giving rise to a new approach to manipulating the Hamiltonian systems via deep learning.</div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

What is directly detected in FT-MS spectra are spectral features (peaks) that correspond to sets of adducted and charged forms of specific molecules in the sample. The robust assignment of these features is an essential step for MS-based metabolomics experiments, but the sheer complexity of what is detected and a variety of analytically-introduced variance, errors, and artifacts has hindered the systematic analysis of complex patterns of observed peaks with respect to isotope content. We have devel-oped a method called SMIRFE that detects small biomolecules and determines their elemental molecular formula (EMF) using de-tected sets of isotopologue peaks sharing the same EMF. SMIRFE does not use a database of known metabolite formulas, instead a nearly comprehensive search space of all isotopologues within a mass range is constructed and used for assignment. This search space can be tailored for different isotope labeling patterns expected in different stable isotope tracing experiments. Using consumer-level computing equipment, a large search space of 2000 daltons was constructed and assignment performance was evaluated and validated using verified assignments on a pair of peak lists derived from spectra containing unlabeled and 15N-labeled versions of amino acids derivatized using ethylchloroformate. SMIRFE identified 18 of 18 predicted derivatized EMFs and each assignment was evaluated statistically and assigned an e-value representing the probability to occur by chance.", "date": "2019-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Mass Spectrometry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

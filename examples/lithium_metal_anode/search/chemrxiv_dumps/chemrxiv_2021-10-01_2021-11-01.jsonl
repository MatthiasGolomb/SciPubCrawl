The remarkable guest binding behavior of the Cucurbiturils family of supramolecular containers makes them promising drug carriers. Among Cucurbit[n]urils, Cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) has intermediate portal size and cavity volume. It can exploit almost all host-guest recognition motifs formed by this host family. In our previous work, an extensive computational investigation of the binding of 7 commonly abused and structurally diverse drugs to the CB8 host was performed and a general dynamical binding picture of CB8-guest interactions was obtained. Further, two widely used fixed-charge models for drug-like molecules were investigated and compared in great detail, aiming at providing guidelines in choosing an appropriate charge scheme in host-guest modelling. Iterative refitting of atomic charges leads to improved binding thermodynamics and the best root-mean-squared deviation from the experimental reference is 2.6 kcal/mol. In this work, we focus on a thorough evaluation of the remaining parts of classical force fields, i.e., the bonded interactions. The widely used general Amber force fields are assessed and refitted to improve the intra-molecular conformational preference and thus the description of inter-molecular host-guest interactions. The interaction pattern and binding thermodynamics show significant dependence on the modelling parameters. The refitted system-specific parameter set improves the consistency of the modelling results and the experimental reference significantly. Finally, combining the previous charge-scheme comparison and the current force-field refitting, we provide general guidelines for the theoretical modelling of host-guest binding.

Here, we report a method for covalent Trp modification that is suitable for both scenarios by invoking photo-induced electron transfer (PET) as a means of driving efficient reactivity.  We have engineered biaryl N-carbamoyl pyridinium salts that possess a donor-acceptor relationship enabling optical triggering with visible light whilst simultaneously attenuating the probe\u2019s photo-oxidation potential in order to prevent photodegradation.  This probe was assayed against a small bank of eight peptides and proteins, where it was found that micromolar concentrations of probe and short irradiation times (10-60 min) with violet light enabled efficient reactivity towards surface exposed Trp residues.  The carbamate transferring group can be used to transfer useful functional groups to proteins including affinity tags and click handles.  DFT calculations and other mechanistic analyses reveal correlations between excited state lifetimes, relative fluorescent quantum yields, and chemical reactivity.  Biotinylated and azide-functionalized pyridinium salts were used for Trp profiling in HEK293T lysates and in situ in HEK293T cells using 450 nm LED irradiation.

The microstructure, crystalline phases, contents and ZnO unit-cell parameters for the ZnO:5%Eu sponges synthesised at 200 to 900 oC were obtained by XRD, SEM, and TEM analysis. XRD showed peaks solely of h-ZnO for the 600 oC sample, while heating at 700 oC and higher caused phase separation into h-ZnO:Eu and c-Eu2O3. XRD showed a close to zero increase in ZnO unit cell-volume of ca. 0.4 vol%, compared to un-doped ZnO for the non-phase separated, clean oxide made at 600 oC. The Zn EXAFS data showed an almost intact local ZnO structure. The Eu EXAFS showed an unusually low coordination number (CN) of ca. 5 for the 200-600 oC samples, while the CN increased for higher temperatures, in concert with the formation of c-Eu2O3. 23 DFT-generated theoretical ZnO structures containing Eu-clusters built from 1 to 4 Eu3+-Zn2+-vacancy- Eu3+ pairs were compared with the experimental data. The lowest formation energies and ZnO unit-cell volume increase versus un-doped ZnO (0.6-0.7 vol%), were obtained when combining two or four Eu3+-Zn2+-vacancy- Eu3+ pairs into Eu4 and Eu8 clusters showing an average Eu CN of ca. 5. These theoretically determined lowest energy structures were all in good agreement with the experimental results obtained by EXAFS and XRD. Photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra performed on the ZnO:5at%Eu sponges obtained at various temperatures, showed strong quenching of the characteristic Eu3+ transitions for samples obtained at 600 and 800 \u00b0C, most likely due to changes in the ZnO defect states, which are crucial for Eu3+ excitation, and due to self-quenching upon Eu clustering and c- Eu2O3 phase separation. Thus, the optical data further supported Eu clustering found by EXAFS, DFT and XRD techniques, corroborating structure-property relationships in these materials. Overall, as far as we can find, the findings reported herein point to a doping structure very different from those previously proposed in the literature.

These enzymes all contain a conserved second-sphere Trp residue that is essential for enzymatic turnover. Previous studies have revealed several important roles for the conserved second-sphere Trp in Staphylococcus aureus IsdG, S. aureus IsdI, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MhuD. However, a general model for the geometric, electronic, and functional role of the second-sphere Trp had not been deduced prior to this work. Here, UV/Vis absorption (Abs) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies were employed to show that the W67F variant of IsdG perturbs the heme substrate conformation without altering the protein secondary structure. In general, it can now be stated that a dynamic equilibrium between \u201cplanar\u201d and \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformations exists within non-canonical heme oxygenases, and that the second-sphere Trp favors population of the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic CD spectroscopies were used to characterize the electronic structures of IsdG and IsdI variants with different substrate conformational distributions. These data revealed that the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation promotes partial porphyrin-to-iron electron transfer, which makes the meso carbons of the porphyrin ring susceptible to radical attack. Finally, UV/Vis Abs spectroscopy was utilized to quantify the enzymatic rates, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to identify the product distributions, for variants of IsdG with altered substrate conformational distributions. In general, the rate of heme oxygenation by non-canonical heme oxygenases depends upon the population of the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation. Also, the production of staphylobilin or mycobilin by these enzymes is correlated with the population of the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation, since variants that favor population of the \u201cplanar\u201d substrate conformation yield significant amounts of biliverdin. These data can be understood within the framework of a concerted rearrangement mechanism for the monooxygenation of heme to meso-hydroxyheme by non-canonical heme oxygenases. However, the mechanisms of IsdG/IsdI and MhuD must diverge following this intermediate in order to generate distinct staphylobilin and mycobilin products, respectively.", "date": "2021-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recent simulations predict that detonation-like shocks produce highly reactive nanoscale shear bands in the layered crystalline explosive TATB (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene), but the thresholds leading to this response are poorly understood. We utilize molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate the high-rate compressive stress-strain response of TATB, with a focus on understanding flow behavior. The dependence of strength on pressure and loading axis (crystal orientation) is explored. The deformation mechanisms fall broadly into two categories, with compression along crystal layers activating a buckling/twinning mode and compression normal to the layers producing nanoscale shear bands. Despite the complexity of the underlying mechanisms, the crystal exhibits relatively straightforward stress-strain curves. Most of the crystal orientations studied show rapid strain softening following the onset of yielding, which settles to a steady flow state. Trajectories are analyzed using five metrics for local states and structural order, but most of these metrics yield similar distributions for these deformation mechanisms. On the other hand, a recently proposed measure of intramolecular strain energy is found to most cleanly distinguish between these mechanisms, while also providing a plausible connection with mechanochemically accelerated decomposition kinetics.

The static computational strategy, which recovers the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics based on the calculations of a few stationary geometries at zero temperature and some ideal statistic mechanics models, is the most popular approach in theoretical catalysis due to its simplicity. In comparison, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a well-tested approach to provide more precise descriptions of catalytic processes, however, experiencing a significantly expensive computational cost in the direct ab initio calculation of potential energy and gradients. Here we proposed a highly efficient dynamic computational strategy for the calculation of thermodynamic and kinetic properties in heterogeneous catalysis on the basis of neural network potential energy surface (NN PES) and MD simulations. Taking CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface as the illustrative model catalytic system, we demonstrated that our NN-PES-based MD simulations can efficiently generate the reliable smooth two-dimensional potential-of-mean-force (2-D PMF) surfaces in a wide range of temperatures (from 300 to 900 K), and thus temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties can be obtained in a comprehensive investigation on the whole PMF surface rather than a rough estimation using ideal models based on a few optimized geometries. Moreover, MD simulations offer an effective way to describe the surface kinetics such as the CO adsorbate on-surface movement, which goes beyond the most popular static estimation based on calculated free energy barrier and transition state theory (TST). By comparing the results obtained in the dynamic and static approaches, we further revealed that the dynamic strategy significantly improves the predictions of both thermodynamic and kinetic properties as compared to the popular ideal statistic mechanics approaches such as harmonic analysis and TST. It is expected that this accurate yet efficient dynamic strategy can be a powerful tool in understanding reaction mechanisms and reactivity of a catalytic surface system, and further guides the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts.\n", "date": "2021-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemical Kinetics; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

High enzyme loading while preserving high specific activity is fundamental for development, but to combine these biospecific features with a porous carrier is an unmet challenge. Here, we explored synthetic incorporation of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) with metal-free tetraamidine/tetracarboxylate-based BioHOF-1. Comparison of different DAAO forms in BioHOF-1 incorporation revealed that N-terminal enzyme fusion with the positively charged module Zbasic2 (Z-DAAO) promotes the loading (2.5-fold; ~500 mg g-1) and strongly boosts the activity (6.5-fold). To benchmark the HOF composite with metal-organic framework (MOF) composites, Z-DAAO was immobilized into the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), the relatively more hydrophilic analogue metal azolate framework-7 (MAF-7). While sensitivity to the framework environment limited the activity of DAAO@MAF-7 (3.2 U mg-1) and DAAO@ZIF-8 (\u2264 0.5 U mg-1), the activity of DAAO@BioHOF-1 was comparable (~45%) to that of soluble DAAO (50.1 U mg-1) and independent of the enzyme loading (100 \u2013 500 mg g-1). The DAAO@BioHOF-1 composites showed superior activity with respect to every reported carrier for the same enzyme and excellent stability during solid catalyst recycling.

The precision of dephasing parameters is between 8\u00d7 to 50\u00d7 better for nonlinear model fitting compared to the CLS method, which effectively increases data acquisition efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude. Whereas the center-line-slope (CLS) method requires sequential fitting of both the nonlinear and linear spectra, our model fitting algorithm only requires nonlinear spectra, but accurately predicts the linear spectrum. We show an experimental example in which the CLS time constants differ by 60% for independent measurements of the same system, while the Kubo time constants differ by only 10% for model fitting. This suggests that model fitting is a far more robust method of measuring spectral diffusion than the CLS method, which is more susceptible to structured residual signals that are not removable by pure solvent subtraction. Statistical analysis of the CLS method reveals a fundamental oversight in accounting for the propagation of uncertainty by Kubo time constants in the process of fitting to the linear absorption spectrum.

Using a robot-assisted workflow, we synthesized and characterized two novel MHP derivatives that have distinct optical properties: a one-dimensional (1D) morphPbI3 phase ([C4H10NO][PbI3]) and a 2D (morph)2PbI4 phase ([C4H10NO]2[PbI4]).

Despite these favorable optical properties, uses of J-aggregates as high-speed light sources have been hindered by their low photoluminescence quantum yields. Here, we take a bottom-up approach to design a novel J-aggregate system with a large extinction coefficient, a high quantum yield and a short lifetime. To achieve this goal, we first select a J-aggregating cyanine chromophore and reduce its nonradiative pathways by rigidifying the backbone of the cyanine dye. The resulting conformationally-restrained cyanine dye exhibits strong absorbance at 530 nm and fluorescence at 550 nm with 90% quantum yield and 2.3 ns lifetime. We develop optimal conditions for the self-assembly of highly emissive J-aggregates. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) reveal micron-scale extended structures with 2D sheet-like morphology, indicating long-range structural order. These novel J-aggregates have a strong red-shifted absorption at 600 nm, resonant fluorescence with no Stokes shift, 50% quantum yield, and 220 ps lifetime at room temperature. We further stabilize these aggregates in a glassy sugar matrix and study their excitonic behavior using temperature-dependent absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. These temperature- dependent studies confirm J-type excitonic coupling and superradiance.

Normally, due to the significant differences between the computational cost of ab initio quantum mechanics (QM) calculations and those of semi-empirical quantum mechanics (SQM) and molecular mechanics (MM), this indirect method could be used to obtain the QM thermodynamics by combining the SQM or MM results and the SQM-to-QM or MM-to-QM corrections. In our previous works, a multi-dimensional nonequilibrium pulling framework for Hamiltonian variations has been introduced based on bidirectional pulling and bidirectional reweighting. The method performs nonequilibrium free energy simulations in the configurational space to obtain the thermodynamic profile along the conformational change pathway under a selected computationally efficient Hamiltonian, and uses the nonequilibrium alchemical method to correct or perturb the thermodynamic profile to that under the target Hamiltonian. The BAR-based method is designed to achieve the best generality and transferability and thus leads to modest (~20 folds) speedup. In this work, we explore the possibility of further accelerating the nonequilibrium free energy simulation by employing unidirectional pulling and using the selection criterion to obtain the initial configurations used to initiate nonequilibrium trajectories following the idea of adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD). A single initial condition is used to seed the whole multi-dimensional nonequilibrium free energy simulation and the sampling is performed fully in the nonequilibrium ensemble. Introducing very short ps-length equilibrium sampling to grab more initial seeds could also be helpful. The ASMD scheme estimates the free energy difference with the unidirectional exponential average (EXP), but it does not follow exactly the requirements of the EXP estimator. Another deficiency of the seeding simulation is the inherently sequential or serial pulling due to the inter-segment dependency, which triggers some problems in the parallelizability of the simulation. Numerical tests are performed to grasp some insights and guidelines for using this selection-criterion-based ASMD scheme. The presented selection-criterion-based multi-dimensional ASMD scheme follows the same perturbation network of the BAR-based method, and thus could be used in various Hamiltonian-variation cases.

With the advancement of science and technology several modes of cashless transaction have been introduced to our country but still a large section of our society is dependent on the transaction through currency notes. The composition of the Indian currency generally comprises of cotton rags, balsam and parts of silk for the purpose of security threads. These currency notes are a hidden threat to us as they transmit bacteria, virus and fungus through touch and gets transmitted from one person to another. An Indian note changes hands in an average of 500 times a day therefore increasing the chances of contaminating the currency getting high and the transmission of harmful diseases through this currency also increases. When these highly contaminated Indian currencies comes in contact with the human touch it results in the transmission of harmful bacteria into the humans therefore causing several bacteria prone diseases such as food poisoning diarrhoea Gonorrhoea, meningitis, ulcers, and several other diseases. Therefore, it is important to make the Indian currency antibacterial.\nThe main focus of the study is to develop an antibacterial chemical agent which comprises of certain natural as well as chemical components as a solution which will be used to activate the antibacterial properties of the natural fibres present in the currency. Several investigations were carried out on how the natural ingredients that is of lemon extracts, industrial vinegar and ginger extract would act on the surface of the currency notes. Bleach was used to chlorinate the note as the fibroin fibres gets activated of the silk thread when chlorine treatment is done and it kills about 99.9% of the bacteria including E. coli and S. aureus. The application of the natural extracts on the surface of the currency showed specific changes as it was instantly more clear than previous condition. The acidic and the antibacterial properties of the natural ingredients used, makes the currency note bacteria free as well as dirt free for a certain period of time which is a notifiable change. The treated currency were seen to be preventing the growth of bacteria for a certain period of time because of the activation of antibacterial properties of silk fibres due to the application of chlorine on silk and also the application of natural ingredients therefore preventing the growth of bacteria by persisting on the outer surface of the currency.\n", "date": "2022-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Based on the X-ray structure of BRD protein degrader MZ1 (1) in complex with human VHL and BRD4BD2, we expected that the 1,2-disubstituted ethyl group near the JQ-1 moiety in MZ1 (1) could be replaced by a planar benzene tether as a platform for further functionalization. To test this hypothesis, we first designed six divalent MZ1 derivatives, 2a-c and 3a-c, by combining three variations of substitution patterns on the benzene ring (1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-substitution) and two variations in the number of ethylene glycol units (1 or 2). We then tested the synthesized compounds for the BRD4 degradation activity of each. As expected, we found that 1,2D-EG2-MZ1 (2a), an MZ1 derivative with 1,2-disubstituted benzene possessing two ethylene glycol units, had an activity profile similar to that of MZ1 (1). Based on the structure of 2a, we then synthesized and evaluated four isomeric trivalent MZ1 derivatives, 15a-15d, having a tert-butyl ester unit on the benzene ring as a handle for further functionalization. Among the four isomers, 1,2,5T-EG2-MZ1 (15c) retained a level of BRD4 depletion activity similar to that of 2a without inducing a measurable Hook effect, and its BRD4 depletion kinetics was the same as that of MZ1 (1).

Detecting metal ions in fingermark residue has long been of interest in the field of forensic science, due to the possibility of linking trace metal ion profiles to prior activity with specific metal objects (e.g. gun or explosive handling). Unfortunately, the imaging capability to visualise trace metal ions at sufficient spatial resolution to determine their distribution within a fingermark (micron level) was not previously available. Here, we demonstrate for the first time transfer and persistence of metals in fingermarks, at micron spatial resolution, using synchrotron sourced x-ray fluorescence microscopy. Fingermarks were taken before and after brief handling of a gun barrel, ammunition cartridge case and party sparkler to demonstrate the transfer of metals. The results reveal increased metal content after contact with these objects, and critically, a differential pattern of metal ion increase was observed after handling different objects. Persistence studies indicate that these metals are removed as easily as they are transferred, with a brief period of hand washing appearing to successfully remove metallic residue from subsequent fingermarks. Preliminary work using x-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopic mapping highlighted the potential use of this technique to differentiate between different chemical forms of metals and metal ions in latent fingermarks. It is anticipated that these findings can now be used to assist future work for the advancement of trace metal detection tests and fingermark development procedures", "date": "2021-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Microscopy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Here, we develop ECG within the GPU-accelerated Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) framework to enable CG QC predictions of a conjugated oligomer using range-separated hybrid density functional theory.  DKL-ECG provides accurate reproduction of QC electronic properties in conjunction with prediction uncertainties that facilitate efficient training over multiple temperature data sets via active learning.

We attribute this result to the low conformational barriers of our test molecule and the redundant sampling of configurations induced by Boltzmann sampling, even for distinct temperature ensembles.", "date": "2021-10-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The recent outbreak of this zoonotic disease demands in silico study of the hypothetical proteins for efficient drug and vaccine discovery. As hypothetical proteins constitute a substantial portion of the proteome, it\u2019s essential to annotate them structurally and functionally. The current study characterized physicochemical properties, predicted homology-based 3D structure and annotated functions of the hypothetical protein AVO28_00330 of Y. pestis using a range of bioinformatic tools and softwares. Swiss Model and Phyre2 server were utilized to predict the tertiary model which was minimized energetically using YASARA server. The quality assessment servers found the model as a good one. For future molecular docking analysis, active binding sites were predicted using CASTp. Protein-protein interaction analysis was performed in STRING server. For functional prediction InterPro, Pfam, Motif and other tools were used. The hypothetical protein revealed tricopeptide repeat domain and rubredoxin metal-binding domain which regulates lipopolysaccharide metabolic process in the outer cell membrane which contributes to virulence property of the protein.

Monomeric aromatic tetrapyrroles (such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and corroles) coordinated to Co(II) have been considered as oxygen reduction catalysts due to their low cost and relative ease of synthesis. How- ever, these systems have been repeatedly shown to be selective for O2 reduction by the less desired 2e \u2013/2H+ pathway to yield hydrogen peroxide. Herein, we report the initial synthesis and study of a Co(II) tetrapyrrole complex based upon a non-aromatic isocorrole scaffold that is competent for 4e\u2013/4H+ ORR. This Co(II) 10,10-dimethyl isocorrole (Co[10- DMIC]) is obtained in a just four simple steps and excellent yield from a known dipyrromethane synthon. Evaluation of the steady state spectroscopic and redox properties of Co[10-DMIC] against those of Co(II) porphyrin ([Co(TPFPP)]) and corrole ([Co(TPFPC)(PPh3)]) homologs demonstrated that the light harvesting and electrochemical properties of the isocorrole are distinct from those displayed by more traditional aromatic tetrapyrroles. Further, investigation of the ORR activity of Co[10-DMIC] using a combination of electrochemical and chemical reduction studies revealed that this simple, unadorned monomeric Co(II) tetrapyrrole is ~85% selective for the 4e\u2013/4H+ reduction of O2 to H2O over the more kinetically facile 2e\u2013/2H+ process that delivers H2O2. By contrast, the same ORR evaluations conducted for the Co(II) porphyrin and corrole homologs demonstrated that these traditional aromatic systems catalyze the 2e\u2013/2H+ conversion of O2 to H2O2 with near complete selectivity. Despite being a simple, easily prepared, monomeric tetrapyrrole platform, Co[10-DMIC] supports an ORR catalysis that has historically only been achieved using elaborate porphyrinoid-based architectures that incorporate pendant proton-transfer groups, ditopic molecular clefts, or which impose cofacially ori- ented O2 binding sites. Accordingly, Co[10-DMIC] represents the first simple, unadorned, monomeric metalloisocorrole complex that can be easily prepared and which shows a privileged performance for the 4e\u2013/4H+ peractivation of O2 to water as compared to other simple Co(II) tetrapyrroles.", "date": "2021-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrochemistry; Ligands (Inorg.); Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The state-specific autodetachment rate measurements obtained by the picosecond time-resolved pump-probe method on the cryogenically cooled anions, exhibit the exceptionally long lifetime (\u03c4) of ~ 2.5 \uf0b1 0.6 ns (as the upper bound) for the 11\u20191 vibrational mode of the 4-BrPhO- DBS.

Therefore, targeting DsbA represents an attractive approach to control bacterial virulence. X-ray crystal structures reveal that DsbA enzymes share a similar fold, however, the hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site, which is implicated in substrate binding, is shorter and flatter in the structure of V. cholerae DsbA (VcDsbA) compared to E. coli DsbA (EcDsbA). The flat and largely featureless nature of this hydrophobic groove is challenging for the development of small molecule inhibitors. Using fragment-based screening approaches, we have identified a novel small molecule, based on the benzimidazole scaffold, that binds to the hydrophobic groove of oxidized VcDsbA with a KD of 446 \u00b1 10 \u00b5M. The same benzimidazole compound has ~8-fold selectivity for VcDsbA over EcDsbA and binds to oxidized EcDsbA, with KD > 3.5 mM. We generated a model of the benzimidazole complex with VcDsbA using NMR data but were unable to determine the structure of the benzimidazole bound EcDsbA using either NMR or X-ray crystallography. Therefore, a structural basis for the observed selectivity is unclear. To better understand ligand binding to these two enzymes we crystallized each of them in complex with a known ligand, the bile salt sodium taurocholate. The crystal structures show that taurocholate adopts different binding poses in complex with VcDsbA and EcDsbA, and reveals the protein-ligand interactions that stabilize the different modes of binding. This work highlights the capacity of fragment-based drug discovery to identify inhibitors of challenging protein targets. In addition, it provides a starting point for development of more potent and specific VcDsbA inhibitors that act through a novel anti-virulence mechanism.", "date": "2021-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previously, the ubiquitous issue regarding severe wasting of computational resources in all forms of molecular simulations due to repetitive local sampling was raised, and the local free energy landscape approach was proposed to address it. This approach is derived from a simple idea of first learning local distributions, and followed by dynamic assembly of which to infer global joint distribution of a target molecular system. When compared with conventional explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, a simple and approximate implementation of this theory in protein structural refinement harvested acceleration of about six orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy. While this initial test revealed tremendous benefits for addressing repetitive local sampling, there are some implicit assumptions need to be articulated.

In bulk diamond, we find that increasing laser power increases ODMR contrast, consistent with a power-dependent increase in spin-polarization.

This work investigates the effect of regioregularity on the intrinsic hole and electron transport characteristics of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) using current-voltage (I-V) measurements in metal/polymer/metal sandwich structures. Through a direct comparison between 93% regioregular P3HT (EG-P3HT) and 100% regioregular defect-free poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (DF-P3HT), it is found that the elimination of regioregularity defects improves the electron mobility of DF-P3HT (1.05 \u00d7 10-7 cm2 V-1 s-1) by three orders of magnitude compared to the 93% regioregular EG-P3HT sample (1.82 \u00d7 10-10 cm2 V-1 s-1). Quantum chemical calculations indicate that the improvement of electron mobility in DF-P3HT can be associated to the lower degree of disorder in these samples that tends to increase the transfer angle between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of adjacent chains.

The necessity of joining arene building blocks to access these valuable compounds has inspired multiple approaches for biaryl bond formation and challenged chemists to develop increasingly concise and robust methods for this task. Oxidative coupling of two C\u2013H bonds offers an efficient strategy for the formation of a biaryl C\u2013C bond, however, fundamental challenges remain in controlling the reactivity and selectivity for uniting a given pair of substrates. Biocatalytic oxidative cross-coupling reactions have the potential to overcome limitations inherent to small molecule- mediated methods by providing a paradigm with catalyst-controlled selectivity. In this article, we disclose a strategy for biocatalytic cross-coupling through oxidative C\u2013C bond formation using cytochrome P450 enzymes. We demonstrate the ability to catalyze cross-coupling reactions on a panel of phenolic substrates using natural P450 catalysts. Moreover, we engineer a P450 to possess the desired reactivity, site- selectivity, and atroposelectivity by transforming a low-yielding, unselective reaction into a highly efficient and selective process. This streamlined method for constructing sterically hindered biaryl bonds provides a programmable platform for assembling molecules with catalyst-controlled reactivity and selectivity.", "date": "2021-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Robust results were obtained with the spectra as well as the vectorized correlation maps as independent components. It was also shown that the order of ICA and ILT steps can be swapped. While performing the ILT step before ICA provided better contrast, a substantial data compression can be achieved if ICA is executed first. Thereby the overall computation time could be reduced by one to two orders of magnitude, since the number of computationally expensive ILT steps is limited to the number of retained independent components. \nFor LGPS, it was demonstrated that physically meaningful independent components and mixing matrices are obtained, which could be correlated with previously investigated material properties yet provided a clearer, better separation of features in the data. LGPS from two different batches was investigated, which showed substantial differences in their spectral and relaxation behavior.

However, the influencing factors arising from the chemical structures of the polymers are often ignored due to a continuous or coarse-grained description of the polymer. Here, we approached this phenomenon using all-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and two conventionally used polymer materials, polycarbonate (PC) and poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). We reproduced the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the two materials reasonably well. Then we characterized and investigated the glass transition process by looking at the changes of potential energy, dihedral transition, and thermal fluctuation of the individual degrees of freedom in the systems, over the entire temperature range of glass transition. As previously reported, the dihedral angles stop their conformational changes gradually at the Tg, especially for the main chain dihedrals, and sidechain rotations immediately rooting from the main chain. The volumetric change during the temperature decrease is confirmed to be because of conformational adjustment, probably due to the tendency of chain stretching for the maintenance of the radius of gyration, and the loss of thermal energy. The strength of motions of single degrees of freedom and polymer chains, and overall slow motions obtained by normal mode analysis (NMA) shows that different motions at different spatial scale may gradually stop at distinct temperature in the MD simulation temporal and spatial scales.

To understand the ICT process in photo-excited dye molecules, we analyse the electronic properties and structural parameters of a chosen set of experimentally synthesized donor-acceptor (D-A) and donor-$\\pi$--spacer-acceptor (D-$\\pi$-A) type dye molecules in their ground, excited and cationic states. The correlation between structural modification and charge redistribution in different parts of the molecule helps to identify the extent of $\\pi$-conjugation and spatial rearrangement of electron density localization along the molecular skeleton. We find that prominent twisting of several groups and resulting molecular bond rearrangements in larger parts of the molecule promotes efficient donor to acceptor ICT, such as in D-A type, ADEKA1 and C275 dyes.  Thus based on modest computation of structural and electronic properties of dye molecules in their respective ground, excited and cationic states, we identify the desired structural changes that facilitate tunable intramolecular charge transfer to highlight a simple and direct prescription to screen out probable efficient dye molecules among many samples.

Subtracting this concentration bias from the equilibrium voltage/potential, we define the \"kinetic reference voltage/potential\" where the reactant and product states are \"aligned\" within the potential energy landscape of the system. The kinetic reference voltage/potential is a fundamental descriptor for a given electrochemical reaction, providing an intrinsic reference point which is most relevant in cases where the (standard) equilibrium voltage/potential is biased by large concentration differences between the reactant and product side.

Here we investigate the exciton dynamics in a 2D COF, its corresponding hexagonal macrocycle, and extended nanotubes comprised of stacked macrocycles. The excitonic behavior of these three systems provide an understanding of excitonic processes that occur in the plane of the covalently bonded 2D macromolecules and between layers of the nanotubes and 2D COF. The nanotube and analogous 2D COF exhibit longer excited-state\nlifetimes (~100 ps) compared to the individual, solvated macrocycles (<0.5 ps). These differences are attributed to the internal conversion facilitated by the internal motions of the imine linkages which are significantly reduced in the assembled macrocycles in the nanotube and 2D COF sheets in the layered structures. The exciton diffusion processes in the assembled nanotubes and 2D COF\nsystems were characterized by the autocorrelations of the transition dipole moment of the excitons, giving the depolarization time constants for both systems to be ~1 ps. This work also reveals the anisotropic exciton dynamics related to the in-plane and inter-plane structural factors in these systems.

However, the mechanism underlying exact transfer and the generation dynamics of hot carriers, and the strategies used to further improve the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction still deserve a further look. In this work, we perform a nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics study to depict the correlation between the reaction rate of  plasmon-driven water splitting (PDWS) and the sizes of gold particles, the incident light frequency and intensity, and the near-field's spatial distribution. Four model systems, \\ce{H2O} and \\ce{Au20}@\\ce{H2O} separately interacting with the laser field and the near field generated by the Au nanoparticle (NP) with a few nanometers in size, have been investigated. Our simulated results clearly unveil the mechanism of PDWS and hot-electron injection in a Schottky-free junction:  the electrons populated on the antibonding orbitals of \\ce{H2O} are mandatory to drive the \\ce{OH} bond breaking and the strong orbital hybridization between \\ce{Au20} and \\ce{H2O} creates the condition for direct electron injection. We further find that the linear dependence of the reaction rate and the field amplitude only holds at a relatively weak field and it breaks down when the second {\\ce{OH}} bond begins to dissociate and field-induced water fragmenting at a very intensive field, and that with the guarantee of electron injection, the water splitting rate increases with the increase of NP's size. This study will be helpful for further improving the efficiency of the photochemical reactions involving the plasmon-generated hot carriers and expanding the applications of hot carriers in varieties of chemical\nreactions.", "date": "2021-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The corresponding ideal equations for equilibria and kinetics reveal the mathematical structure, known for real systems, in comprehensible clarity. The ideal gas reference corresponds to the limit of an entirely flat potential energy surface of the system where chemical equilibria and kinetics are determined by \"unspecific\" particle number combinatorics according to the reaction stoichiometry. The ideal equilibrium and rate constants provide a reference for the definition of excess equilibrium and rate constants of real reactions that quantify all \"system-specific\" contributions resulting from the particular shape of the potential energy surface. The ideal gas reference therefore enables a distinction between unspecific and system-specific aspects in the equilibria and kinetics of chemical association/dissociation reactions. Whereas conventional equilibrium and rate constants suffer from incompatibility between reactions of different stoichiometry, excess equilibrium and rate constants can be consistently compared across different reaction orders. Furthermore, whereas the conventional treatment requires an arbitrary specification of reference concentrations, e.g. at standard conditions, the ideal gas framework introduces an intrinsic concentration scale that is equal to the inverse of a molecular volume.", "date": "2021-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Statistical Mechanics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This scheme takes advantage of both the powerful local feature extraction ability of CNN and the long-term global sequential pattern recognition ability of LSTM. With feature fusion of individually trained CNN-LSTM models for the quantum population and coherence dynamics, the proposed scheme is shown to have high accuracy and robustness in predicting the linearized semiclassical and symmetrical quasiclassical mapping dynamics of various spin-boson models with learning time up to 0.3 ps. Furthermore, if the hybrid network has learned the dynamics of a system, this knowledge is transferable that could significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting the dynamics of a similar system.

Here we show, by analysing the space between 1800 and 1869, how the periodic system evolved until its formulation.  We found that after an unstable period culminating around 1826, the system began to converge to a backbone structure, unveiled in the 1860s, which was clearly evident in the 1840s.  Hence, contrary to the belief that the ``ripe moment'' to formulate the system was in the 1860s, it was in the 1840s.  The evolution of the system is marked by the rise of organic chemistry in the first quarter of the nineteenth-century, which prompted the recognition of relationships among main group elements and obscured some of transition metals, which explains why the formulators of the periodic system struggled accommodating them.  We also introduced an algorithm to adjust the chemical space according to different sets of atomic weights, which allowed for estimating the resulting periodic systems of chemists using one or the other nineteenth-century atomic weights.  These weights produce orderings of the elements very similar to that of 1869, while providing different similarity relationships among the elements, therefore producing different periodic systems.  By analysing these systems, from Dalton up to Mendeleev, we found that Gmelin's atomic weights of 1843 produce systems remarkably similar to that of 1869, a similarity that was reinforced by the atomic weights on the years to come.", "date": "2021-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here a new method for comprehensive characterization of SFPs is presented, which makes use of the total oxidizable precursors assay for fingerprint-based structural elucidation, and combustion ion chromatography for TF quantification. When used in parallel, quantitative determination of SFPs (in units of mass of CnF2n+1/m2 textile) is achieved. Expressing SFP concentrations in terms of mass of side-chain (as opposed to fluorine equivalents) facilitates estimation of both the structure and quantity of PFAA degradation products. As a proof-of-principle, the method was applied to six unknown SFP-coated medical textiles from Sweden. Four products contained C6-fluorotelomer-based SFPs (concentration range 36-188 mg C6F13/m2), one contained a C4-sulfonamide-based SFP (718 mg C4F9/m2), and one contained a C8-fluorotelomer-based SFP (249 mg C8F17/m2).

Mainly acting to absorb light where chlorophyll cannot (500-650 nm), phycobiliproteins also play an instrumental role in helping cryptophyte algae respond to changes in light intensity through the process of photoacclimation. Until recently, photoacclimation in cryptophyte algae was only observed as a change in the cellular concentration of phycobiliproteins; however, an additional photoacclimation response was recently discovered that causes shifts in the phycobiliprotein absorbance peaks following growth under red, blue, or green light. Here, we reproduce this newly identified photoacclimation response in two other species of cryptophyte algae, P. sulcata and H. pacifica, and elucidate the origin of the response on the protein level. We compare isolated native and photoacclimated phycobiliproteins for these two species using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and we report the x-ray structures of the PC577 light harvesting complex and corresponding photoacclimated complex. We find that neither the protein sequences, nor the protein structures are modified by photoacclimation. We conclude that cryptophyte algae change a chromophore in one site of their phycobiliprotein beta-subunits as part of the photoacclimation response to changes in the spectral quality of light.

The release of surface active compounds generates Marangoni flows that cause repulsion, whereas capillary forces drive attraction. Typically, these interactions are non-directional and mechanisms to establish directional connections between the self-organizing elements are lacking. In this work, we unravel the mechanisms involved in the self-organization of a linear amphiphile into millimeter-long filaments that form connections between floating droplets. First, we show how the release of the amphiphile tetra(ethylene glycol) monododecyl ether from a floating source droplet onto the air-water interface generates a Marangoni flow. This flow extrudes self-assembled amphiphile filaments which grow from the source droplet, and concomitantly repels floating droplets in the surroundings. A hydrophobic drain droplet that depletes the amphiphiles from the air-water interface directs the Marangoni flow and thereby the growing filaments. We show how these filaments, upon tethering to the drain, potentially facilitate internal Marangoni convection and elastocapillary effects, which attract the drain back towards the source droplet. Furthermore, this concept establishes connections that are selective to the composition of the drain droplets \u2013 which influences the rate at which they deplete the amphiphile \u2013 such that repulsive and attractive forces can be balanced. Thereby, we provide a novel method through which directional attraction can be established in synthetic self-organizing systems, and advance our understanding of how complexity arises from simple building blocks.", "date": "2021-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we combined the best of both worlds by developing a two-step radical ring-opening copolymerization-induced self-assembly (rROPISA) process, allowing to generate aqueous suspensions of narrowly dispersed, degradable vinyl copolymer nanoparticles at 15 wt.% solid contents, containing cyclic ketene acetal (CKA) units in the nanoparticle core.

Successful incorporation of ester groups in the copolymers was demonstrated by hydrolytic degradation of both the copolymers and the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles\u2019 cytocompatibility was then established by cell viability assays and cell morphology observation with three representative healthy cell lines.

In this work, a microfluidic approach was devised to study the effect of shear stresses on biofilms from a dental unit waterline (DUWL)-isolated P. aeruginosa strain, PPF-1. During application of relevant shear stress levels to DUWLs, the response of the PPF-1 biofilm was observed and compared to a clinical P. aeruginosa reference strain, PAO1. The response measurements were repeated for biofilms\nexposed to additional Mg2+ ions. Using a microfluidic approach to transforming optical density maps into three-dimensional images, we applied computational fluid dynamics simulations and determined the critical shear stresses for biofilm sloughing. In the absence of Mg2+, PPF-1 biofilms showed weaker attachment than PAO1 biofilms, resulting in continuous slough/regrowth cycles triggered by applied shear stresses of 1.42 +/- 0.32 Pa. Introducing Mg2+ into the PPF-1 biofilm culture medium seemed to place the biofilm into a viscoplastic mechanical state, thereby increasing mechanical stability, which resulted in elevated tolerances to shear stresses up to a critical value of 5.43 +/- 1.52 Pa. This resulted in a propensity for less frequent but more catastrophic sloughing events like that observed for the PAO1 reference strain. This suggests that in a low ionic environment, biofilms from the PPF-1 strain can result in higher and more continuous ejection of biofilm materials, possibly leading to increased downstream colonization of engineered flow systems.", "date": "2021-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Microscopy; Biophysics; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Logan; Jesse Greener", "abstract": "Power overshoot can hinder determination of maximum power densities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In this work, a microfluidic approach was used to study overshoot in an MFC containing a pure culture of electroactive biofilms (EAB) containing Geobacter sulfurreducens. After 1-month operation under constant flow of an ideal nutrient medium, the MFC health began to degrade, marked by voltage loss and the appearance of anomalies in the power density curves. One such anomaly was a chronic power overshoot, accompanying a loss of both measured power and current density on the high-current side of the power density curve. The degree of power overshoot was quantified while certain flow-based interventions were applied, notably the shear\nerosion of the EAB outer layer. Next, two approaches to acclimation were demonstrated to treat the remaining overshoot. The standard approach, which acclimates the MFC to high currents before a standard polarization test, eliminated the remaining overshoot and returned maximum\npower densities to initial levels, but maximum current density remained lower than the initial level. A microfluidic-assisted \u201clong-hold polarization test\u201d enabled efficient in situ acclimation of each external resistor during the measurement. Despite the health-compromised MFC, this\nmethod provided long-term stability during the polarization test, resulting in power and current density measurements that exceeded those made on the healthy MFC using the standard polarization test. We conclude that slower electron transfer kinetics in unhealthy MFCs can provoke overshoot by prolonging the time to reach steady state during the polarization test, but a properly designed measurement overcomes this problem.", "date": "2021-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Analytical Chemistry; Energy; Electrochemical Analysis; Electrocatalysis; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Because of their highly tunable chemical property and robustness to a wide range of experimental conditions, peptoids contribute to a very promising group of next-generation functional chemical additives. To generalize the design philosophy, it is critical to understand the origin of facet selectivity at the molecular level. We employ molecular dynamics simulations and biased sampling methods to investigate the origin of Au(111)-favored adsorption of a peptoid, Nce3Ncp6, that is evidenced to assist the formation of five-fold twinned nanostructures. We find that the facet-selectivity is achieved through a synergistic effect of both molecule-surface and solvent-surface interactions. Extending beyond the single-chain scenario, the order of peptoid-peptoid and peptoid-surface energetics, i.e., peptoid-Au(100) < peptoid-peptoid < peptoid-Au(111), further amplifies the distinct behavior of Nce3Ncp6 chains on different Au surfaces.

The single vibrational degree of freedom, as well as the strong nonadiabatic coupling that arises from the excited electronic states taking on considerable ionic character, provides a realistic chemical system to test the accuracy of quasi-classical methods to model population dynamics where the results are directly comparable against quantum mechanical benchmarks. Using a simulated pump-probe experiment, this work presents computational predictions of population transfer through the avoided crossings of NaH via symmetric quasi-classical Meyer-Miller (SQC/MM), Ehrenfest, and exact quantum dynamics on realistic, ab initio potential energy surfaces. The main driving force for population transfer arises from a sharply localized avoided crossing between the C and D singlet sigma potential energy surfaces which causes most of the population to transfer between t=15 and t=30 fs depending on the initially excited vibronic wavepacket. While quantum mechanical effects are expected due to the reduced mass of NaH, predictions of the population dynamics from both the SQC/MM and Ehrenfest models perform remarkably well against the quantum dynamics benchmark.

Despite the advances in improving the oxygen tolerability of TF-UC systems, \nthe evaluation of oxygen tolerability is based on comparing the performance at completely deoxygenated (0 % oxygen) and \nambient (20\u201321 %) conditions, leaving the physiological oxygen levels (0.3\u201313.5 %) neglected.

Ongoing efforts to boost the versatility and complexity of these responses increasingly focus on multi-stimuli-responsive molecular units and crosslinkers, as these bear the potential to impart self-regulatory behaviors building on cooperative effects and feedback mechanisms. Herein, we study a stimuli-responsive platform consisting of polyacrylamide-based hydrogels with well-known multi-responsive spiropyrans covalently bound as pendant groups or \u00b4non-innocent\u00b4 crosslinkers. Surprisingly, as compared to their appended counterparts, spiropyran crosslinkers cause up to two-fold larger hydrogel swelling in methylenebisacrylamide-crosslinked poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels, despite their increased relative crosslinking density. We seek the origin of this unexpected behavior by employing nanoindentation, swelling studies, and UV-vis spectroscopy to study changes in mechanical properties and in spiropyran isomer distribution as a function of solution pH, co-monomer chemistry, and swelling-induced polymer strain. We then estimate the osmotic counterion pressures as a function of spiropyran isomer distribution but find that such pressures alone are insufficient to explain the observed behavior. Charge complexation, cooperative effects between the hydrogel\u00b4s mechanics and chemistry, and aggregate formation may all be invoked to explain features of the observed \u00b4non-innocence\u00b4 of spiropyran crosslinkers.

These systems generally suffer from poor stability and NH3 selectivity; competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) outcompetes N2RR. Molecular catalyst systems can be exquisitely tuned and offer an alternative strategy, but progress has thus far been thwarted by the same selectivity issue; HER dominates. Herein we describe a tandem catalysis strategy that offers a solution to this puzzle. A molecular complex that can mediate an N2 reduction cycle is partnered with a co-catalyst that interfaces the electrode and an acid to mediate concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) steps, facilitating N\u2212H bond formation at a favorable applied potential and overall thermodynamic efficiency. Without CPET, certain intermediates of the N2RR cycle would be unreactive via independent electron transfer (ET) or proton transfer (PT) steps, thereby shunting the system.

Recently, the development of deep learning, combined with rising amounts of data, has provided powerful tools to build predictive models. Since molecules can be encoded as graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a popular choice of architecture to tackle this task. Training GNNs to predict molecular properties however faces the challenge of collecting annotated data which is a costly and time consuming process. On the other hand, it is easy to access large databases of molecules without annotations. In this setting, self-supervised learning can efficiently leverage large amounts of non-annotated data to compensate for the lack of annotated ones. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework for GNNs tailored specifically for molecular property prediction. Our framework uses multiple pretext tasks focusing on different scales of molecules (atoms, fragments and entire molecules).

In this work, the electroactive surface area of wrinkled gold electrodes was further enhanced up to 5-fold (30-fold over flat electrodes) using a chronoamperometric pulsing technique. Scanning electron microscopy images showed progressive increase of surface roughness in response to an increasing number of applied pulses. The resulting nanoroughened electrodes present several advantages in addition to the enhanced electroactive surface area. These electrodes offer superior fouling resistance compared to that of wrinkled and flat electrodes when submerged in a solution containing bovine serum albumin at high concentrations. Cyclic voltammetry data also revealed greater sensitivity of nanoroughened electrodes toward anodic copper stripping, where the limit of quantification of copper by the nano-roughened electrodes was 0.3 ppm. Nano-roughened electrodes also allowed the highly sensitive enzyme-free detection of glucose through chronoamperometry, with a limit of detection of 0.5 mM, whereas planar electrodes did not demonstrate any ability to oxidize glucose.

Statistical methods can achieve high accuracy at a lower cost, but data sparsity and unoptimized molecule and solvent representations often limit their ability to generalize. Here, we utilize directed message passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) to represent both dye molecules and solvents for predictions of molecular absorption peaks in solution. Additionally, we demonstrate a multi-fidelity approach based on an auxiliary model trained on over 28,000 TD-DFT calculations that further improves accuracy and generalizability, as shown through rigorous splitting strategies. Combining several openly-available experimental datasets, we benchmark these methods against a state-of-the-art regression tree algorithm and compare the D-MPNN solvent representation to several alternatives. Finally, we explore the interpretability of the learned representations using dimensionality reduction and evaluate the use of ensemble variance as an estimator of the epistemic uncertainty in our predictions of molecular peak absorption in solution. The prediction methods proposed herein can be integrated with active learning, generative modeling, and experimental workflows to enable the more rapid design of molecules with targeted optical properties.", "date": "2021-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To improve the treatment efficiency and reduce side effects, photoactivatable chemotherapy has been recently proposed for precise cancer treatment with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, most photoactivatable prodrugs require decoration by stoichiometric photo-cleavable groups, which are only responsive to ultraviolet irradiation and suffer from low reaction efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we herein propose a bioorthogonal photo-catalytic activation strategy with riboflavin as the catalyst for in situ transformation of prodrug dihydrochelerythrine (DHCHE) prodrug into anti-cancer drug chelerythrine (CHE), which can efficiently kill cancer cells and inhibit in vivo tumor growth under light irradiation. Meanwhile, the photo-catalytic transformation from DHCHE into CHE was in situ monitored by green-to-red fluorescence conversion, which can be used for precise control of the therapeutic dose. The photocatalytic mechanism was also fully explored by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Clinically relevant detection levels for SARS-CoV-2 are achieved in a simple, label-free measurement format using sample incubation times of 15 minutes.

Here, we examine the nature of anion\u2013water interactions at the air/water interface using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum-mechanical energy decomposition analysis based on symmetry-adapted perturbation theory.  Results are presented for a set of monovalent anions including Cl\u2013, Br\u2013, I\u2013, CN\u2013, OCN\u2013, SCN\u2013, NO2\u2013, NO3\u2013, and ClOn\u2013 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4), several of which are archetypal examples of surface-active species.   In all cases, we find that average anion\u2013water interaction energies are systematically larger in bulk water although the difference (with respect to the interaction energy in the interfacial environment) is well within the magnitude of the instantaneous fluctuations.   Specifically for the surface-active species Br\u2013(aq), I\u2013(aq), ClO4\u2013(aq), and SCN\u2013(aq), and also for ClO\u2013(aq), the charge-transfer (CT) energy is found to be larger at the interface than it is in bulk water, by an amount that is greater than the standard deviation of the fluctuations.  The Cl\u2013 ion also has a slightly larger CT energy at the interface but NO3\u2013(aq) does not; these two species are borderline cases where consensus is lacking regarding their surface activity.  However, CT stabilization amounts to < 20% of the total induction energy, for all of the ions considered here, and CT-free polarization energies are systematically larger in bulk water, again in all cases, so the role of these effects in soft anion surface activity remains unclear.  This analysis complements our recent work suggesting that the short-range solvation structure around these ions is scarcely different at the air/water interface from what it is in bulk water.  Together, these observations suggest that changes in first-shell hydration structure around soft anions cannot explain observed surface activities.

The generality of the protocol has been demonstrated by exploring a wide range of substrates. As an application the in-situ generated thyil radical has been trapped with disulfides to prepare hetro-disulfides of potential utility. The protocol proved to be practical on gram scale quantity and relied on clean energy source for the transformation. Based on the series of control experiments, cyclic volametry and Stern-Volmer studies the plausible mechanism has been proposed.

Azobenzene is a prototypical photoswitch but its derivatives can be poorly suited for in vivo applications such as photopharmacology due to undesired photochemical reactions promoted by ultraviolet light and its relatively short half-life (t1/2) of the Z-isomer (2 days). Experimental and computational studies suggest that these properties (\u03bbmax of the E isomer and t1/2 of the Z-isomer) are inversely related. We identified isomeric azobisthiophenes and azobisfurans from a high-throughput screening study of 1700 azoarenes as photoswitch candidates with improved \u03bbmax and t1/2 values relative to azobenzene. We used density functional theory to predict the activation free energies, reaction free energies, and vertical excitation energies of the E- and Z-isomers of 2,2- and 3,3-substituted azobisthiophenes and azobisfurans. The half-lives depend on whether the heterocycles are \ud835\udf0b-conjugated or cross-conjugated with the diazo \ud835\udf0b-bond. The 2,2-substituted azoarenes both have t1/2 values on the scale of 1 hour, while the 3,3-analogues have computed half-lives of 40 (thiophene) and 230 (furan) years. The 2,2-substituted heteroazoarenes have significantly higher \u03bbmax absorptions than their 3,3-substituted analogs: 76 nm for azofuran and 77 nm for azothiophene.

In such cases the transfer of the substrate between phases tends to proceed spontaneously, in the direction of equilibrium. Molecular ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic gating selectively inhibits or accelerates particular steps in a process, makes it possible to drive dynamic systems out of equilibrium. Here we report on a small-molecule pump immobilised on and near the surface of polymer beads, that uses an energy ratchet mechanism to actively transport substrates from solution onto the beads away from equilibrium. One complete cycle of the pump occurs with each pulse of a chemical fuel, synchronizing the ratchet dynamics so that the immobilised molecular machines all act in unison. Upon addition of the trichloroacetic acid fuel, micrometre-diameter polystyrene beads functionalised with an average of ~8\u00d710exp10 molecular pumps per bead, sequester from solution crown ethers appended with a fluorescent tag. Following consumption of the fuel, the rings are mechanically trapped in a higher energy, out-of-equilibrium, state on the beads and cannot be removed by dilution nor by switching the binding interactions off. This differs from dissipative assembled materials that require a continuous supply of energy to persist. Addition of a second pulse of fuel causes the uptake of more macrocycles, which can be labelled with a different fluorescent tag. This drives the system progressively further away from equilibrium and also confers sequence information on the deposited structure. The polymer-bound substrates (and the stored energy) can subsequently be released back to the bulk on demand, either emptying one compartment at a time or all at once. Non-equilibrium sorption by using immobilised artificial molecular machines to pump substrates from solution onto and into materials, offers potential for the transduction of energy from chemical fuels for the storage and release of energy and information. \n", "date": "2021-10-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Nanodevices; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Monitoring air quality extensively is challenging. Since government-operated monitors are sparsely located across California and the U.S., several regions and populations remain unmonitored.

State-of-the-art prebiotic chemistry links together reactions to create systems, intended to be more representative of the diverse chemical pathways that may have proceeded on early Earth. By practical necessity, prebiotic systems chemistry must be investigated under simplified conditions in comparison to likely natural environments. The mismatch in complexity between lab and environment poses a challenge: how to build systems chemistry that is robust not only in the idealised conditions of a lab, but also under natural levels of environmental stress? Here, we propose and formalise a conceptual framework for such work: interference chemistry. We define interference chemistry as the interaction between prebiotic systems chemistry and the environmental scenarios proposed to host it. Natural environments in which prebiotic chemistry could have occurred are messy, containing many spectator ions, mineral phases, and spatially and temporally variable physical processes, e.g., wet/dry cycles. Each of these environmental variables may interfere either constructively or destructively with prebiotic pathways, respectively aiding or inhibiting their efficacy. Exploring interference chemistry for a reaction system will point towards favoured or disfavoured regions of environmental parameter space. To do so, innovation is needed in both the investigation of early planetary environmental conditions, and the continued incorporation of these constraints into experimental systems chemistry. We argue that interference chemistry provides a compelling way to assess combinations of system and environment, leading the way to increasingly prebiotically plausible scenarios for the origin of life on Earth.", "date": "2021-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Geochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The diffusion domain approach (DDA) offers a means of reducing a three dimensional design to two dimensions to ease computational demands. However, the DDA approach can be limited when basic assumptions, for example that all electrodes in an array are equivalent, are incorrect.  Consequently, to get a more realistic view of molecular diffusion to nanoelectrodes, it is necessary to undertake simulations in 3D. In this work, two and three dimensional models of electrodes comprising of (i) single nanowires, (ii) arrays of nanowires and (iii) interdigitated arrays of nanowires operating in generator-collector mode, are undertaken and compared to experimental results obtained from fabricated devices. The 3D simulations predict a higher extracted current for a single nanowires and diffusionally independent nanowire arrays when compared to 2D simulations since, unlike the 2D model, they take into account molecular diffusion to and from the nanowire termini. This current difference was observed to increase with increasing electrode width and decrease with electrode length. When the nanowire arrays were diffusionally overlapped, they behaved as an electrode of larger width, and the divergence between the two models increased.  By contrast, in generator-collector mode, using interdigitated nanowire arrays, the difference between extracted current values obtained using two models was significantly lower.  Simulations indicated however that a higher collection efficiency was predicted by the 2D model when compared to the 3D model.   Electrochemical experiments were undertaken to confirm the simulation study and demonstrated that the extracted currents from 3D simulations more closely mapped onto experimentally measured currents.

In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of reactive surface nanodroplets for in-situ synthesis and anchoring of nanocaps of metal oxides with tailored porous structures. Spatial arrangement and surface coverage of nanocaps are predetermined during the formation of reactive nanodroplets, while the crystalline structures of metal oxides can be controlled by thermal treatment of organometallic nanodroplets produced from the biphasic reactions.

This interaction energy-based Graph Neural Network (EGNN) model outperforms traditional machine learning methods and a simple GNN with a F1 score of 0.9524 and Cohen\u2019s kappa score of 0.8861 for the hold out test set, suggesting that the topology of the small molecule, the structural interaction in the binding pocket, and chemical diversity of the training data are all important considerations for enhancing model performance. A Bootstrapped EGNN model was used to select compounds for synthesis and experimental validation with predicted high and low potency to inhibit PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. The potent inhibitor, (4-((3-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-2- methylbenzyl)oxy)-2,6-dimethoxybenzyl)-D-serine, is a hybrid of two known bioactive scaffolds, with an IC50 of 339.9 nM that is comparatively better than the known bioactive compound. We conclude that our bootstrapped EGNN model will be useful to identify target-specific high potency molecules designed by scaffold hopping, a well-known medicinal chemistry technique.", "date": "2021-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Herein, combining mass spectrometry based proteomics strategy with bioinformatics analysis, we revealed that PDS significantly downregulated 22 proteins, of which the genes contain rich G4 potential sequences, in HeLa cancer cells, consequently upregulating 16 proteins remarkably. The PDS-regulated proteins appeared to work synergistically to activate cyclin and cell cycle regulation, and to restrain the inhibition of ARE-mediated mRNA decay pathway, suggesting that PDS itself is not a potential anticancer agent, at least towards HeLa cancer. Importantly, among the PDS targeted genes, SUB1, which expresses the human positive cofactor and DNA lesion sensor PC4, was down-regulated by 4.76-fold. Further studies demonstrated that the downregulation of PC4 dramatically promoted the cytotoxicity of trans-[PtCl2(NH3)(thiazole)] towards HeLa cells to a similar level to that of cisplatin, contributable to retarding the repair of 1,3-trans-platinated DNA lesion mediated by PC4. These findings not only provide new insights into better understanding on the biological functions of PDS, but also implicate a strategy for the rational design of novel multi-targeting platinum anticancer drugs via conjugation of PDS as a ligand to the coordination scaffold of transplatin for battling drug resistance to cisplatin.", "date": "2021-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This \u201cintrinsic proton conductivity\u201d of the one-atom-thick crystals, with proposed through-plane conduction, challenged the notion that graphene is impermeable to atoms, ions and molecules. More recent evidence points to a defect-facilitated transport mechanism, analogous to transport through conventional ion-selective membranes based on graphene and h-BN. To clarify the nature of proton transmission through graphene, local ion-flux imaging is performed herein on graphene|Nafion membranes using an \u201celectrochemical ion (proton) pump cell\u201d mode of scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). Targeting regions that are free from visible macroscopic defects (e.g., cracks, holes etc.), and assessing hundreds to thousands of different sites across the graphene surfaces in a typical experiment, most of the graphene|Nafion membrane is impermeable to proton transport, with transmission typically occurring at only \u224820 \u2013 60 localized sites across a \u22480.003 mm2 area of membrane (>5000 measurements, total). When localized proton transport occurs, it can be a highly dynamic process, with new transmission sites \u201copening\u201d and a small number of sites \u201cclosing\u201d under an applied electric field, on the seconds timescale. Applying a simple equivalent circuit model of ion-transport through a cylindrical nanopore, the local transmission sites are estimated to possess dimensions (radii) on the (sub)nanometer-scale, implying that rare atomic defects are responsible for proton conductance through monolayer graphene. Overall, this work reinforces SECCM as a premier tool for the structure\u2212property mapping of microscopically complex (electro)materials, with the local ion-flux mapping configuration introduced herein being widely applicable for functional membrane characterization and beyond, e.g., for diagnosing failure mechanisms in protective surface coatings.", "date": "2021-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Carbon-based Materials; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The atomic-scale mechanisms governing this O-redox behaviour, however, are not fully understood.

Here, we reveal an O-redox mechanism linking transition metal migration and O2 formation in the disordered rocksalt Li2MnO2F. At high states of charge, O-ions dimerise to form molecular O2 trapped in the bulk structure, leaving vacant O sites surrounding neighbouring Mn ions. This undercoordination drives Mn movement into new fully-coordinated octahedral sites. Mn displacement can occur irreversibly, which results in voltage hysteresis, with a lower voltage upon discharge as observed experimentally. Alternatively, Mn displacement may take place into interstitial octahedral sites, which permits a reversible return of the Mn ion to its original site upon discharge, recovering the original Li2MnO2F structure and resulting in reversible O-redox without voltage loss. These new findings suggest that reversible transition metal ion migration provides a possible design route to retain the high energy density of O-redox disordered rocksalt cathodes on cycling.", "date": "2021-10-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Noncovalent intramolecular interactions have been often used as conformational control to enhance the planarity of polymers or molecules, which may reduce band gaps and promote charge transfer. However, it is little known if noncovalent interactions may alter the electronic properties of conjugated polymers through some mechanism other than the conformational control. Here, we studied the effects of various noncovalent interactions, including sulfur-nitrogen, sulfur-oxygen, sulfur-fluorine, oxygen-nitrogen, oxygen-fluorine, and nitrogen-fluorine, on the elec- tronic properties of polymers with planar geometry using unconstrained and constrained density functional theory. We found that the sulfur-nitrogen intramolecular interaction may reduce the band gaps of polymers and enhance the charge transfer more obviously than other noncovalent interactions. Our findings are also consistent with the experi- mental data. For the first time, our study shows that the sulfur-nitrogen noncovalent interaction may further affect the electronic structure of coplanar conjugated polymers, which cannot be only explained by the enhancement of molecular planarity.

Here we present the first demonstration for the use of hypergolic metal-organic frameworks (HMOFs) as additives to trigger hypergolic ignition in conventional paraffin-based hybrid engine fuels. HMOFS are a recently introduced class of stable and safe hypergolic materials, used here as a platform to bring readily tunable ignition and combustion properties to hydrocarbon fuels. We present an experimental investigation of the ignition delay (ID, the time from first contact with an oxidizer to ignition) of blends of HMOFs with paraffin, using White Fuming Nitric Acid (WFNA) as the oxidizer. The majority of measured IDs are under 10 ms, significantly below the upper limit of 50 ms required for functional hypergolic propellant, and within the ultrafast ignition range. A theoretical analysis of the performance of HMOFs-containing fuels in a hybrid launcher engine scenario also reveals the effect of the HMOF mass fraction on the specific impulse (Isp) and density impulse (\u03c1Isp).  The use of HMOFs to produce paraffin-based hypergolic fuels results in a slight decrease of the Isp and \u03c1Isp compared to that of pure paraffin, similar to the effect observed with Ammonia Borane (AB), a popular hypergolic additive.

Conceptually, the partitioning step is characterized by two parameters: transmittance for protein-bound DNA (binders) and transmittance for unbound DNA (nonbinders). Here we present the first study to reveal how these transmittances depend on experimental conditions; such studies are pivotal to the effective planning and control of selection. Our focus was capillary electrophoresis (CE) which is a partitioning approach of high efficiency. By combining a theoretical model and experimental data, we evaluated the dependence of transmittances of binders and nonbinders on the molecular weight of protein target in two modes of CE-based partitioning: nonequilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM) and ideal-filter capillary electrophoresis (IFCE). Our data suggest that as the molecular weight of the protein target decreases: (i) the transmittance for binders remains close to unity in NECEEM but decreases drastically in IFCE and (ii) the transmittance for nonbinders increases orders of magnitude in NECEEM but remains relatively stable at a very low level in IFCE. To determine the optimal CE conditions for a given size of protein target, a balance between transmittances of binders and nonbinder must be reached; such a balance would ensure the collection of binders of sufficient purity and quantity. We conclude that, as a rule of thumb, IFCE is preferable for large-size protein targets while NECEEM should be the method of choice for small-size protein targets", "date": "2021-10-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report a new series of proline (P2)-modified inhibitors of Chlamydia trachomatis HtrA (CtHtrA) developed by proline ring expansion and C\u03b3-substitutions. The structure-based drug optimization process was guided by molecular modelling and in vitro pharmacological evaluation of inhibitory potency, selectivity and cytotoxicity. Compound 25 from the first-generation 4-substituted proline analogues increased antiCtHtrA potency and selectivity over human neutrophil elastase (HNE) by approximately 6- and 12-fold, respectively, relative to the peptidic lead compound 1. Based on this compound, second-generation substituted proline residues containing 1,2,3-triazole moieties were synthesized by regioselective azide-alkyne click chemistry. Compound 49 demonstrated significantly improved antichlamydial activity in whole cell assays, diminishing the bacterial infectious progeny below the detection limit at the lowest dose tested. Compound 49 resulted in approximately 9- and 22-fold improvement in the inhibitory potency and selectivity relative to 1, respectively.

Biosynthesis of the pyrrole requires oxidation of an L-proline side chain. Herein, we investigated the biocatalytic mechanism of proline-to-pyrrole synthesis using the recently reported (Thapa et al., Biochemistry, 2019, 58, 918) structure of a Type II non-ribosomal protein synthetase (NRPS) Bmp3-Bmp1 (Oxidase-CP) complex. The substrate (L-proline side chain) is attached to the Bmp1(CP) and the catalytic site is located inside the flavin-dependent oxidase (Bmp3). Interestingly, the FAD molecule is free (unbound) within the Bmp3 catalytic site. We show that the FAD isoalloxazine ring is stabilized in the catalytic site of Bmp3 by strong hydrogen bonding with Asn123, Ile125, Ser126, and Thr158. The stability of the dimeric Bmp3 system including one FAD molecule in our simulation suggests that the tetrameric Bmp3 assembly, as found in the crystal structure, is not functionally important. After the initial deprotonation followed by an enamine-imine tautomerization, oxidation of either the C2-C3 bond or the C2-N1 bond, through a hydride transfer (either from C3 or N1), is required for the pyrrole synthesis. Using molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, and electronic structure calculations, we conclude that the hydride transfer is more likely to occur from C3 than N1.

The new metal carbonate force field has been validated using molecular dynamics simulations to study solvation and reactivity of metal and carbonate ions in water at 300 K and 700 K. The coordination radius and self-diffusion coefficient show good consistency with existing experiments and simulations results. The angular distribution analysis explains the structural preference of carbonate ions to form carbonates and bicarbonates, where Na+ predominantly forms carbonates due to lesser angular strain, while Ca2+ and Mg2+ prefer to form bicarbonates monodentate in nature.

Here, we systematically screen a combinatorially designed library of 43 well-defined polymers, ultimately identifying a lead polycationic vehicle (P38) for efficient pDNA delivery. Further, we demonstrate the versatility of P38 in co-delivering spCas9 RNP and pDNA payloads to mediate homology directed repair as well as in facilitating efficient pDNA delivery in ARPE-19 cells. P38 achieves nuclear import of pDNA and eludes lysosomal processing far more effectively than a structural analog that does not deliver pDNA as efficiently.

Our machine learning interpretability and causal inference approach derives structure-function relationships underlying delivery efficiency, polyplex uptake, and cellular viability, and probes the overlap in polymer design criteria between RNP and pDNA payloads. Together, combinatorial polymer synthesis, parallelized biological screening, and machine learning establish that pDNA delivery demands careful tuning of polycation protonation equilibria while RNP payloads are delivered most efficaciously by polymers that deprotonate cooperatively via hydrophobic interactions.

The biological consequences of arginine methylations depend on the methylation states of arginine that are determined by the PRMT\u2019s product specificity. Although the product specificity is a very important property, it is still unknown concerning why different PRMTs may generate different methylation states for the target arginine residues on protein substrates. PRMT7 is the only known member of Type III PRMT that produces mono-methylarginine (MMA) product. Interestingly, its E181D and E181D/Q329A mutants can catalyze, respectively, the formation of asymmetrically di-methylated arginine (\u03c9-NG, NG-dimethylarginine or ADMA) and symmetrically di-methylated arginine (\u03c9-NG, N'G-dimethylarginine or SDMA). The exact reasons for such product specificity modification as a result of the mutations have been unclear. Here QM/MM molecular dynamics (MD) and potential of mean force (PMF) free-energy simulations are performed for the E181D and E181D/Q329A mutants to understand the catalytic mechanism and the origin of their different product specificities from that of the wild-type PRMT7 as well as between E181D and E181D/Q329A. The simulations show that while the free energy barriers of E181D and E181D/Q329A for the first methylation are higher than that of the wild type, E181D and E181D/Q329A have the ability to add the second methyl group to the target mono-methyl arginine and generate ADMA and SDMA, respectively. The free energy barriers for E181D and E181D/Q329A to produce ADMA and SDMA, respectively, are considerably lower than the corresponding barriers involving the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, the computational study identifies some important structural, electronic and dynamic features that lead to the different product specificities and activities of the wild-type PRMT7, E181D and E181D/Q329A. These factors may play important roles in controlling the activity and product specificity of other PRMTs as well.

CRISPR base editors allow for rapid, robust, and programmed single base substitutions and gene inactivation, yet no such systems are currently available in M. tuberculosis. By screening distinct CRISPR base editors, we identified that only the unusual Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) cytidine base editor (CBE), but not the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 or Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cpf1 CBEs, are active in mycobacteria. Despite the notable C-to-T conversions, a high portion of undesired byproducts existed with St1Cas9 CBE.

However, the work is mainly empirical and there have not been corresponding theoretical studies using molecular-level simulations of the diffusion and orientation of neurotransmitters near these surfaces.  Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate in atomistic detail the surface diffusion of dopamine (DA), its oxidation product dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ), and their protonated forms on the pristine basal plane of flat graphene. All DA species rapidly adsorb to the surface and remain adsorbed for the full length of the equilibrium simulations, even without a holding potential or graphene surface defects. The diffusivities of the adsorbed and the fully solvated DA are similar, and all molecular diffusion on the surface is slower than that of an adatom of comparable molecular weight. The protonated species diffuse more slowly than their corresponding neutral forms, and the oxidized species diffuse more rapidly. The underlying hexagonal graphene structure has little influence over the molecular adsorbate's lateral position. The vertical placement of the amine group on dopamine is highly dependent upon its charge, and the protonated amine prefers to be above the surface near the solvating waters. Solvation has a large effect on surface diffusivities when diffusion is compared to that in a vacuum.  These are the first results of molecular dynamics simulations of dopamine diffusion at the aqueous-graphene interface, and they show that dopamine diffuses quickly on graphene surfaces, even without an applied potential. These calculations provide a basis for future simulations to predict the behavior of neurotransmitter diffusion on advanced carbon materials electrodes.

Therefore, understanding the relationship between the concentration of the additive in the base oil and the resulting surface coverage is extremely important for lubricant formulations, as well as many other surfactant applications. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the adsorption isotherms of three different OFMs, stearic acid (SA), glycerol monoostearate (GMS), and glycerol monooleate (GMO), onto a hematite surface from hydrocarbon solvents, n-hexadecane and poly-\u03b1-olefin (PAO). First, we calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) of the adsorption process using MD simulations with the adaptive biasing force (ABF) algorithm. Our MD simulations show that SA has the weakest adsorption energy on hematite, followed by GMS, and finally GMO, due to the increasing number of functional groups available to bind to the surface. We also estimate the area occupied by each OFM molecule on the surface in the high-coverage limit using MD simulations of the annealing of OFM films with different initial surface coverages. We obtain a similar hard-disk area for GMS and GMO, but a lower value for SA, which is due to its smaller headgroup size. Based on the adsorption energy and surface area, we determine the corresponding adsorption isotherms using the molecular thermodynamic theory (MTT), which agree well with one available experimental data-set for SA. Two other experimental data-sets for SA require lateral interactions between surfactant molecules to be accounted for. SA forms monolayers with lower surface coverage than GMO and GMS at low concentrations (due to a smaller adsorption energy), but also has the highest plateau coverage (due to a smaller hard-disk area). We validate the adsorption energies from the MD simulations using high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) friction experiments with different concentrations of the OFMs in PAO. We use the Jahanmir and Beltzer model to estimate the surface coverage at each concentration and the adsorption energy of each OFM from the HFRR friction data. For OFMs with saturated tailgroups (SA and GMS), we obtain good agreement between the predictions made by the simulations and the experiments. The MD simulation and experimental results deviate for OFMs containing Z-unsaturated tailgroups (GMO), with the former suggesting stronger adsorption for GMO than GMS, while the latter predicts the opposite trend. We suggest that this is can be attributed to the higher steric barrier of adsorption of the OFMs with kinked Z-unsaturated tailgroup through a partially formed monolayer, an aspect which was not captured in the current simulations. This study demonstrates that MD simulations with the ABF algorithm, alongside MTT, are an accurate and efficient tool to predict adsorption isotherms at solid-liquid interfaces.", "date": "2021-10-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Structural, thermal-control, and coating materials containing organic polymers are particularly susceptible to AO attack at these high velocities, resulting in erosion, roughening, and degradation of function.  Copolymerization or blending of a polymer with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) yields a material that can resist AO attack through the formation of a passivating silicon-oxide layer.  Still, these hybrid organic/inorganic polymers become rough through AO reactions as the passivating layer is forming.  Surface roughness may enhance satellite drag because it promotes energy transfer and scattering angle randomization during gas-surface collisions.  As potential low-drag and AO-resistant materials, we have investigated POSS-containing films of clear and Kapton-like polyimides that have an atomically smooth AO-resistant coating of Al2O3 that is grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD).  Coated and uncoated films were exposed to hyperthermal molecular beams containing atomic and molecular oxygen to investigate their AO resistance, and molecular beam-surface scattering studies were conducted to characterize the gas-surface scattering dynamics on pristine and AO-exposed surfaces to inform drag predictions.  The AO erosion yield of Al2O3 ALD-coated films is essentially zero.  Simulations of drag on a representative satellite structure that are based on the observed scattering dynamics suggest that the use of the Al2O3 ALD-coated POSS-polyimides on external satellite surfaces have the potential to reduce drag to less than half that predicted for diffuse scattering surfaces.  These smooth and AO-resistant polymer films thus show promise for use in the extreme oxidizing and high-drag environment in VLEO.", "date": "2021-10-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Space Chemistry; Interfaces; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here we report that water content determines the adhesion strength of oil sands on solid surfaces at temperature of -2.5 \u25e6C to -20 \u25e6C. Our measurements by X-ray micro-computed tomography revealed that water forms capillary bridges between the sand particles and the solid substrate and more air gaps at the interface between oil sands and the substrate are filled with interstitial water at a higher content. We experimentally measured the minimal force required to push the frozen oil sands off the substrate and identified that the adhesion strength increased linearly with water content from 4% to 14% on both rubber and steel substrate. For short freezing time at a fixed water content, lowering the temperature increased the adhesion strength on the steel substrate. Fouling from a layer of bitumen or asphaltenes aggravated the adhesion of oil sands on steel. A theoretical model was proposed to rationalize the linear relationship between water content and the adhesion strength, based on the contact area between ice and the substrate.

Despite low Ni loading less than 2.4 wt%, MSR on Ni-Mo2C/FAU exhibits high activity and stability, yet deactivation of Ni-FAU (the sample without Mo2C) is significant. Further investigations elucidate that the catalyst deactivation is caused by Ni particle sintering via Ostwald ripening instead of coking, and steam induces hydroxylated Ni surface that accelerates sintering. Moreover, encapsulated Mo2C boosts the activity and stability of Ni on zeolite Y by enhancing CH4 activation rather than activating H2O. The interplays among Mo2C and Ni particles dynamically balance the carbon formation and consumption rates, and inhibit Ni sintering.

However, the mechanism of this reaction remains controversy. Using density function theory (DFT), we revealed that the reaction takes place through a silylium ion migration mediated hydroamidation (SMH) pathway. The SMH pathway goes through two steps, the first step is Ag+ promoted proton and silylium ion exchange between siloxy-alkynes and amide, leading to ketene and silyl-imines, the second step is Ag+ catalyzed nucleophilic addition between ketene and silyl-imines, following with a silylium ion migration afford the final product. In this reaction, Ag+ activate the siloxy-alkyne into silylium ion and silver-ketene through p-\u03c0 conjugate effect, the silylium ion then act as catalyst. According to our calculation, the scopes of alkynes in this reaction may be extend to silyl-substituted ynamines or silyl-substituted ynamides, and the scopes of amide maybe expanded into p-\u03c0 conjugate system such as diazoles, diazepines and so on.

Interestingly, the literature has many reports of fast degradation of Al electrodes, where less than a dozen cycles can be achieved. However, in some studies, Al anodes demonstrate stable cycling life with several hundred cycles. In this work, we present a successful pathway for enabling long-term cycling of simple Al foil anodes: \u03b2-LiAl phase grown from Al foil (\u03b1-Al) exhibits a cycling life of 500 cycles with a ~96% capacity retention when paired with a commercial cathode.

This solubility range at room temperature is determined to be ~6 at%. Consequently, this design circumvents the critical issues associated with the \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 phase transformations, such as volume change, mechanical strain, and nanopore formation.

This plant has been used alone as well as in combination with other plants for the preparation of different anti-malarial formulations. However, there is no report on the assessment of its anti-plasmodial activity, and the compound responsible for this activity. The main aim of this study was to conduct phytochemical investigation of A. heterophyllum roots for the preparation of extract, fractions and isolation of pure molecules to identify active fractions/molecules responsible for the anti-plasmodial activity, and development of UHPLC-DAD based analytical method which can be used for the quantification of marker compounds in the extracts and fractions. Hydro-alcoholic extract (1:1 v/v) and fractions (n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water) were prepared from the dried powdered roots of A. heterophyllum. Fractions were further subjected to silica gel-based column chromatography to isolate pure specialized secondary metabolites from this plant. All extracts, fractions and pure molecules were evaluated against the chloroquine resistant Pf INDO and chloroquine sensitive Pf3D7 strains in culture for calculating their IC50 values. UHPLC-DAD based analytical method was also developed for the first time for the quantification and quality assessment of this commercially important Himalayan medicinal plant. Phytochemical investigation of A. heterophyllum root led to the isolation of six specialized metabolites named as 2-O-cinnamoyl hetisine (1), atisinium (2), 4-oxabicyclo [3.2.2] nona-1(7),5,8-triene (3), atisinium cinnamate (4), aconitic acid (5), and atisinium formate (6).

Chloroform fraction was found to be the most active with IC50 (\u00b5g/mL) 1.01 (Pf INDO) and 1.32 (Pf3D7). The isolated molecule 2-O-cinnamoyl hetisine (1), a new diterpenoid alkaloid isolated from chloroform fraction, showed promising antiplasmodial activities with IC50 (\u00b5M) 1.92 (Pf INDO) and 10.8 (Pf 3D7).

Atisinium (2) and 2-O-cinnamoyl hetisine (1) were found to be the main marker compounds of this plant based on quantity and antiplasmodial activity, respectively. This study provides the scientific rational for the traditional use of this plant in treating malaria. Further, this study revealed that anti-malarial potential of this plant might be due to the presence of diterpenoid alkaloids.

While electrocatalysts can alleviate kinetic overpotentials, diffusional resistances at the pore-scale often prevent full catalyst utilization. The effect of intraparticle diffusion on the overall reaction rate can be quantified through an effectiveness factor expression governed by the Thiele modulus parameter. This analytical approach is integral to the development of catalytic structures for thermochemical processes and has previously been extended to electrochemical processes by accounting for the relationship between reaction kinetics and electrode overpotential. In this paper, we illustrate the method by deriving the expression for the potential-dependent Thiele modulus and using it to quantify the effectiveness factor for porous electrocatalytic structures. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of this mathematical framework to spherical microparticles as a function of applied overpotential across catalyst properties and reactant characteristics. The relative effects of kinetics and mass transport are related to overall reaction rates, revealing markedly lower catalyst utilization at increasing overpotential.

The cycle number and hence detection time is determined by the analytical sensitivity of the detector. Hybridisation of complementary DNA strands to oligonucleotide-modified conducting polymer electrodes yields an increase in the charge transfer resistance for the ferri-ferrocyanide redox couple. Sensors using this technology for e-PCR offer a label-free method with detector sensitivity in the pM range, potentially decreasing the required cycle number from 30 to 10 and offering a much simplified instrument construction. We demonstrate sensors using screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with a conducting polymer formed from a monomer pre-functionalised with complementary oligonucleotide. Off-chip pre-functionalisation of the conducting polymer precursor is a key step towards practical manufacture and the method is potentially a general one for sensors which require a capture probe-functionalised surface.  We demonstrate reliable sensitivity of the interfacial resistance change at the pM scale for short (20-mer) sequences and at the aM scale for bacterial lysate, with dynamic range extending to \u03bcM scale and response time-scale 5 min. Donnan exclusion of the redox couple from the surface, as previously proposed, seems unlikely as a mechanism for such ultra-high sensitivity. We demonstrate that the most important element in the response at the lowest concentrations is due to variation of an electrical resistance within the polymer film. We develop a mechanism based on repulsion from the solution interface of dopant anions and attraction towards and trapping at the interface of radical cations (polarons) by the charge associated with surface-bound DNA.

However, MP2 exhibits well-known shortcomings including an incomplete description of dispersion interactions and sizable failures for transition metal chemistry.  Herein, we first explore multiple physically justified forms of single-parameter regularization and then demonstrate that with appropriate parameter choice, regularized MP2 with Hartree-Fock reference orbitals yields high and transferable accuracy across a wide variety of noncovalent interactions (S22, S66, XB40, A24, and L7 test sets) and (mostly closed-shell) transition metal thermochemistry (metal-carbonyl dissociations and a subset of MOR41).  We find that, especially for systems with interacting pi systems relevant to dispersion interactions and dative bonding, regularization serves to  damp overestimated pair-wise additive contributions to the first-order amplitudes that affect correlation energy and charge-density.  The optimal parameter values for the noncovalent and transition metal sets are 1.1 and 0.4 for two regularizers, $\\kappa$ and $\\sigma^2$, respectively. These two regularizers slightly degrade the accuracy of conventional MP2 for some small-molecule test sets which are well-known to be sensitive to charge-density distribution (radical stabilization energies, barrier heights, dipole moments, and polarizabilities), most of which have relatively large gaps. Due to the relatively straightforward implementations of nuclear gradient and other properties, we recommend $\\kappa$-MP2 with $\\kappa$ = 1.1 as a more accurate alternative to conventional MP2 and other related variants. Our results suggest that appropriately regularized MP2 models represent promising forms for the nonlocal correlation part of double hybrid density functionals, at no additional cost over conventional MP2.

We also employed SCS-CC2 to evaluate donor-acceptor systems that contain a MR-TADF moiety acting as the acceptor and show that the broad emission observed for some of these compounds arises from the solvent-promoted stabilization of a higher-lying charge transfer (CT) singlet state (S2).

A complete molecular picture of thermophoresis is still missing and phenomenological approaches are often employed to account for the experimental observations. In particular, the amplitude of the resulting concentration-gradients (quantified by the Soret coefficient) depends on many factors that are not straightforwardly rationalized. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations appear as an exquisite tool to shed light on the molecular origins for this phenomenon in molecular systems, but the practical implementation of thermophoretic settings in silico poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a robust approach to tackle thermophoresis in dilute realistic solutions at the molecular level. We rely on a recent enhanced heat-exchange algorithm to generate temperature-gradients. We carefully assess the convergence of thermophoretic simulations in dilute aqueous solutions. We show that simulations typically need to be propagated on long timescales (hundreds of nanoseconds).  We find that the magnitude of the temperature gradient and the box sizes have little effect on the measured Soret coefficients. Practical guidelines are derived from such observations. Provided with this reliable setup, we discuss the results of thermophoretic simulations on several examples of molecular, neutral solutes, which we find in very good agreement with experimental measurements regarding the concentration-, mass-, and temperature-dependence of the Soret coefficient. \n", "date": "2021-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, one of the major difficulties in designing an efficient autocatalytic amplification system is the requirement for reactants that are both highly reactive and chemically stable in order to avoid limitations imposed by undesirable background amplifications. In the present work, we devised a reaction network based on a redox cross-catalysis principle, in which two catalytic loops activate each other. The first loop, catalyzed by H2O2, involves the oxi-dative deprotection of a naphthylboronate ester probe into a redox-active naphthohydroquinone, which in turn catalyzes the production of H2O2 by redox cycling in the presence of a reducing enzyme/substrate couple. We present here a set of new molecular probes with improved reactivity and stability, resulting in particularly steep sigmoidal kinetic traces and enhanced discrimination between specific and nonspecific responses. This translates into the sensitive de-tection of H2O2 down to a few nM in less than 10 minutes or a redox cycling compound such as the 2-amino-3-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone H2O2 down to 50 pM in less than 30 minutes. The critical reason leading to these remarkably good performances is the extended stability stemming from the double masking of the naphthohydroquinone core by two boronate groups, a counterintuitive strategy if we consider the need for two equivalents of H2O2 for full deprotection. An in-depth study of the mechanism and dynamics of this complex reaction network is conducted in order to better understand, predict and optimize its functioning. From this investigation, the time response as well as detection limit are found highly dependent on pH, nature of buffer, and concentration of the reducing enzyme.", "date": "2021-10-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Homogeneous Catalysis; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

PeT based indicators rely either on PeT into the excited state (acceptor PeT) or out of the excited state (donor PeT). Our group has been developing voltage-sensitive fluorophores (VF dyes) that respond to changes in biological membrane potential. We hypothesize that the mechanism of voltage sensitivity arises from acceptor PeT (a-PeT) from an electron-rich aniline-containing molecular wire into the excited state fluorophore, resulting in decreased fluorescence at negative membrane potentials. Here, we can reverse the direction of electron flow to access donor-excited PeT (d-PeT) VF dyes by introducing electron-withdrawing (EWG), rather than electron-rich molecular wires. Similar to first-generation aniline containing VF dyes, EWG-containing VF dyes show voltage-sensitive fluorescence, but with the opposite polarity: hyperpolarizing membrane potentials now give fluorescence increases. We use a combination of computation and experiment to estimate a \u0394E of ~0.6 eV for voltage sensitivity in d-PeT indicators, show that two of the new reverse VF dyes are voltage sensitive, and provide the first example, to our knowledge, of a molecular sensor that can be tuned across energy regimes to access bi-directional electron flow for fluorescence sensing in living systems.", "date": "2021-10-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.); Physical Organic Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This is often achieved by the incorporation of trace and minor elements into the magnetite lattice. Such incorporation was shown to depend strongly on the magnetite formation pathway (i.e., abiotic vs biological), but the mechanisms controlling element partitioning between magnetite and its surrounding precipitation solution remain to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of theoretical modelling (lattice and crystal field theories) and experimental evidence (high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy) to demonstrate that element incorporation into abiotic magnetite nanoparticles is controlled principally by cation size and valence. Elements from the first series of transition metals (Cr to Zn) constituted exceptions to this finding as their incorporation appeared to be also controlled by the energy levels of their unfilled 3d orbitals, in line with crystal field mechanisms. We then show that element incorporation into biological magnetite nanoparticles produced by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) cannot be explained by crystal-chemical parameters alone, which points to the biological control exerted by the bacteria over the element transfer between MTB growth medium and the intracellular environment. This screening effect generates biological magnetite with a purer chemical composition than the abiotic materials formed in a solution of similar composition.

Screening different boranes revealed a correlation between calculated fluoride affinity of the borane and nucleophilic fluorination reactivity, with sufficent fluoride affinity required for boranes to react with CsF and form Cs[fluoroborate] salts, but too high a fluoride affinity leading to fluoroborates that are poor at transferring fluoride to an electrophile.

Because the valence band of half-Heusler phases benefit from the valence band extrema at several high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone (BZ), it is possible to engineer better p-type HH materials through band convergence. However, the thermoelectric studies of n-type HH phases have been lagging behind since the conduction band minimum is always at the same high-symmetry point (X) in the BZ, giving the impression that there is little opportunity for band engineering. Here we study the n-type orbital diagram of 69 HHs, and show that there are two competing conduction bands with very different effective masses actually at the same X point in the BZ, which can be engineered to be converged. The two conduction bands are dominated by the d orbitals of X and Y atoms, respectively. The energy offset between the two bands depends on the difference in electron configuration and electronegativity of the X and Y atoms. Based on the orbital phase diagram, we provide the strategy to engineer the conduction band convergence by mixing the HH compounds with the reverse band offsets. We demonstrate the strategy by alloying VCoSn and TaCoSn. The V0.5Ta0.5CoSn mixture presents the high conduction band convergence and corresponding significantly larger density-of-states effective mass than either VCoSn or TaCoSn.

To engineer the protein rationally, a detailed understanding of the biochemical mechanism and limiting steps is essential. Conventional fitting to equations derived based on simplifying approximations may be inaccurate for complex mechanisms like that of staphylokinase. We employed a modern numerical approach of global kinetic data analysis whereby steady-state kinetics and binding affinity datasets were analyzed in parallel. Our approach provided an extended, revised understanding of the staphylokinase mechanism without simplifying approximations and determined the value of turnover number kcat of 117 s-1 that was 10,000-fold higher than that reported in the literature.

Very often, the computational bottleneck of such direct simulation comes from electronic structure theory. For example, at every time step of a trajectory, nonadiabatic dynamics requires potential energy surfaces, their gradients, and the matrix elements coupling the surfaces. The need for the couplings can be alleviated by employing the time derivatives of the wave functions, which can be evaluated from overlaps of electronic wave functions at successive timesteps. However, evaluation of overlap integrals is still expensive for large systems. In addition, for electronic structure methods for which the wave functions or the coupling matrix elements are not available, nonadiabatic dynamics algorithms become inapplicable. In this work, building on recent work by Baeck and An, we propose new nonadiabatic dynamics algorithms that only require adiabatic potential energies and their gradients. The new methods are named curvature- driven coherent switching with decay of mixing (\u03baCSDM) and curvature-driven trajectory surface hopping (\u03baTSH). We show how powerful these new methods are in terms of computer time and good agreement with methods employing nonadiabatic coupling vectors computed in conventional ways. The lowering of the computational cost will allow longer nonadiabatic trajectories and greater ensemble averaging to be affordable, and the ability to calculate the dynamics without electronic structure coupling matrix elements extends the dynamics capability to new classes of electronic structure methods.", "date": "2021-10-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, due to the sensitivity of metal centers toward various biomolecules, especially glutathione, low activity and turnover of artificial metalloenzymes in vivo are systematic problems not fully solved. Apart from straightforward routes such as the use of neutralizing agents, metal cofactors modification and directed evolution, one may notice that nature can create isolated microenvironments for diverse biological processes within cells. Following this way, here we report the in vivo assembly of artificial metalloenzymes based on HaloTag-SNAPTag fusion protein. These metalloenzymes have metal cofactors bound on protein interfaces, and can trigger liquid-liquid phase separation to form liquid condensates inside Escherichia coli. These condensates serve as membraneless, isolated compartments for artificial metalloenzymes to efficiently perform intracellular catalysis, mediating abiotic unmasking, coupling and polymerization reactions. The cellular compartmentalization also enables spatial control of reactions, either facilitating a cascade reaction within the confined spaces, or concurrent reactions with spatial separation. Such engineered Escherichia coli can work as whole-cell catalyst with confined metal species, colonizing at mice intestine to effect in vivo abiotic transformations with a lower chance of heavy metal poisoning. These results represent a systematic strategy to stabilize and potentiate artificial metalloenzyme in vivo, with potential applications in fields such as non-natural metabolism, fermentation and drug delivery.", "date": "2021-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we show a crystal phase mediated restructuring of Pt NPs on TiO2, as a simple approach for fabricating either atomically dispersed single atoms (SAs) or reshaped planar NPs of Pt catalysts with tunable reactivities. Utilizing a variety of state-of-the-art characterizations, we showed that rutile TiO2 favors the reshaping of 2D planar Pt NPs, whereas the anatase surface facilitates the redispersion of Pt NPs to SAs upon calcination in the air up to 400 \u00baC. Environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) and density function theory (DFT) calculations were employed to directly visualize the dynamic transformation of Pt NPs and reveal the specific role that TiO2 supports play in promoting the stability and diffusion of Pt SAs. As a result, the reverse reactivity was achieved by tunning their distinct restructuring behaviors. Thus, the Pt SAs on anatase TiO2 preferentially activated selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene (21.22 x 10-2 s-1 at 50 \u00baC), while planar Pt NPs on rutile significantly enhanced the combustion of methane (3.11 x 10-2 s-1 at 310 \u00baC).

Here we challenge a standard practice in sequence-based affinity prediction models: instead of leveraging the full primary structure of proteins, each target is represented by a sequence of 29 residues defining the ATP binding site. In kinase-ligand binding affinity prediction, our results show that the reduced active site sequence representation is not only computationally more efficient but consistently yields significantly higher performance than the full primary structure. This trend persists across different models, datasets, performance metrics and holds true when predicting affinity for both unseen ligands and kinases. Our interpretability analysis further demonstrates that, even without supervision, the full sequence model can learn to focus on the active site residues to a higher extent. We then investigate a de novo molecular design task and find that the active site provides benefits in the computational efficiency, but otherwise, both kinase representations yield similar optimized affinities (for both SMILES and SELFIES-based molecular generators). Our work challenges the assumption that full primary structure is indispensable for modelling human kinases.

We therefore combined a popular cheminformatics reaction representation, the so-called condensed graph of reaction (CGR), with a recent GCNN architecture to arrive at a versatile, robust and compact deep learning model.

Only zeolites with high Si/Al ratios >15 are hydrophobic enough to exclude the Pd from the micropores while forming well-faceted PdO nanoparticles. Simultaneously, during self-assembly mobile Al hydroxo species get incorporated into the as-formed PdO nanoparticles. For the first time, we reveal selective incorporation of rows of O3Al(IV)-OHbridging aluminum hydroxo-species into the (101) facets of PdO nanoparticles that form during thermal self-assembly in Pd/SSZ-13 using state-of-the-art atomically-resolved HAADF-STEM imaging, solid-state NMR, DFT calculations and reactivity measurements. The Al+3-OH moieties form atom-thin rows in place of tri-coordinate Pd ions Pd+2 in Pd1O3 on (101) facets: these tri-coordinate Pd1+2O3 are responsible for C-H bond dissociation of methane and hydrocarbons during catalytic methane oxidation. However, on unmodified or non-zeolite supported PdO nanoparticles in the presence of water vapor from engine exhaust, water competes with methane by forming a deactivated Pdtetra(OH)(H2O)Pdtetra site with two water molecules on contiguous 3-coordinate Pd, which is not active for C-H bond activation. When Al-OH moieties are present in place of some tri-coordinate Pd1O3 sites, water dissociation becomes kinetically unfavorable due to disruption of Pdtetra(OH)(H2O)Pdtetra species formation. Consequently, our catalytic measurements reveal a significantly more stable performance of such catalysts in methane combustion in the presence of water vapor. Our findings provide an unprecedented atomic-level insight into structure-property relationships for supported PdO materials in catalytic methane oxidation and offer a new strategy to prepare moisture-tolerant Pd-containing methane combustion catalysts for green-house gas mitigation by selectively doping atomically thin rows of non-precious metal into specific facets of PdO.

Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4/GPR120) has been recently identified to be a promising therapeutic target for a group of metabolic associated disorders. For the prevention of type 2 diabetes, significant scientific and commercial interest has been developed around GPR120 and its role. Due to the unavailability of a crystal structure, the interaction dynamics of GPR120 agonists were not yet determined to date. In the present study, we constructed the homology model for GPR120 and validated using available mutational data and molecular dynamics simulation, and explored its binding modes with known small molecule agonists. So, sixteen propionic acid derivatives as GPR120 agonists were collected to elucidate their binding modes. Experiential and theoretical studies suggested that the carboxylic group of ligands interact with Arg99, which is an important interaction for GPR120 activation. However, earlier reports also suggest that this interaction is not stable during the molecular dynamics simulation, which contradicts the experimental observations. Evidently, to refute this, we got a stable interaction of Arg99 with TUG891 and other recently reported 15 GPR120 agonists. In addition, we have also observed that in 1 \u00b5s molecular dynamics simulation Arg183 present in ECL2 tends to come inside and interact with ligand.

Known amine ligands like Proline analogues and Cinchona alkaloids showed excellent asymmetric induction.

This chiral ligand was proved to be efficient for addition reactions in water providing products with excellent yields and enantiomeric ratios.

A greater understanding of sequence development throughout the polymerization process will aid the design of simple, generalizable methods to control sequence and tune supramolecular assembly. In previous simulations of solution-based step-growth copolymerizations, we have shown that weak, non-bonding attractions between monomers of the same type can produce a microphase separation among the lengthening nascent oligomers and thereby alter sequence. This work explores the phenomenon further, examining how effective attractive interactions, mediated by a solvent selective for one of the reacting species, impact the development of sequence and the supramolecular assembly in a simple A-B copolymerization. We find that as the effective attractions between monomers increase, an emergent self-organization of the reactants causes a shift in reaction kinetics and sequence development. When the solvent-mediated interactions  are selective enough, the simple mixture of A and B monomers oligomerize and self-assemble into structures characteristic of amphiphilic copolymers. The composition and morphology of these structures and the sequences of their chains are sensitive to the relative balance of affinities between the comonomer species.

The neopentane association in urea solution is greater than that in TMAO solution or neat water. We find the association is even less in TMAO solution than pure water.

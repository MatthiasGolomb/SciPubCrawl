However, characterizing the elastic modulus with current methods is particularly challenging for sub-micrometer thick films and hygroscopic materials because they are highly sensitive to environmental conditions and most methods require free-standing films which are difficult to prepare. In this work, we directly compared three buckling-based methods to determine the elastic moduli of supported thin films: 1) biaxial thermal shrinking, 2) uniaxial thermal shrinking, and 3) the mechanically compressed, strain-induced elastic buckling instability for mechanical measurements (SIEBIMM) method. Nanobiocomposite model films composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were assembled using layer-by-layer deposition to control composition and thickness. The three buckling-based methods yielded the same trends and comparable values for the elastic moduli of each CNC-PEI film composition (ranging from 15 \u2013 44 GPa, depending on film composition). This suggests that the methods are similarly effective for the quantification of thin film mechanical properties. Increasing the CNC content in the films statistically increased the modulus, however, increasing the PEI content did not lead to significant changes. The standard deviation of elastic moduli determined from SIEBIMM was 2-4 times larger than for thermal shrinking, likely due to extensive cracking and partial film delamination. In light of these results, biaxial thermal shrinking is recommended as the method of choice because it affords the simplest implementation and analysis and is the least sensitive to small deviations in the input parameter values, such as film thickness or substrate modulus.</p>", "date": "2020-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Composites; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Thin Films; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Yet, the preparation of such bifunctional materials remains challenging because both the inorganic and the biological moieties must be integrated in the same solid, while preserving their intrinsic activity. Combining an enzyme and a zeolite, for example, is complicated because the pores of the zeolite are too small to accommodate the enzyme and a covalent anchorage on the surface is often ineffective. Herein, we developed a new pathway to prepare a hybrid catalyst built from glucose oxidase and TS-1 zeolite. Such hybrid material can catalyze the in situ formation of H2O2, which is subsequently used by the zeolite to trigger the epoxidation of allylic alcohol. Starting from an enzymatic solution and a suspension of zeolite nanocrystals, the hybrid catalyst is obtained in one step, using a continuous spray drying method. While enzymes are expectedly unable to resist the conditions used in spray drying (temperature, shear stress, etc.), we leverage on the preparation of \u201cenzyme-polyelectrolyte complexes\u201d (EPCs) to increase the enzyme stability. Importantly, the use of EPCs also appears to prevent enzyme leaching and to stabilize the enzyme against pH changes. We show that the one-pot preparation by spray drying gives access to hybrid catalysts with unprecedented performance in the targeted chemoenzymatic reaction. Interestingly, the hybrid catalyst performs much better than the two catalysts operating as separate entities. We anticipate that this strategy could be used as an adaptable method to prepare other types of multifunctional materials.<br />", "date": "2020-08-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Biocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Hence, it is critical to obtain an accurate drug release profile. This study presents the first application of asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) with fluorescence detection (FLD) to characterize release profiles of fluorescent drugs from polymeric NPs, specifically poly lactic-co-glycolic acid NPs loaded with enrofloxacin (PLGA-Enro NPs). In contrast to traditional release measurements requiring separation of entrapped and dissolved drugs (typically by dialysis) prior to quantification, AF4-FLD provides in situ purification of the NPs from unincorporated drugs, along with direct measurement of the entrapped drug. Size distributions and shape factors are simultaneously obtained by online dynamic and multi-angle light scattering detectors. The AF4-FLD and dialysis approaches were compared to evaluate drug release from PLGA-Enro NPs containing a high proportion (\u2248 88%) of unincorporated (burst release) drug at three different temperatures spanning the glass transition temperature (30 \u00b0C for PLGA-Enro NPs). The AF4-FLD analysis was able to identify size-dependent release rates across the entire continuous NP size distribution, with smaller NPs showing faster release. The AF4-FLD method also clearly captured the expected temperature dependence of the drug release (from almost no release at 20 \u00b0C to rapid release at 37 \u00b0C). In contrast, dialysis was not able to distinguish these differences in the extent or rate of release of the entrapped drug because of interferences from the burst release background, as well as the dialysis lag time. A mechanistic diffusion model that integrates data from both AF4-FLD and dialysis further supported the advantages of AF4-FLD to capture the true release rate of entrapped drug and avoid artifacts observed in dialysis. Overall, this study demonstrates the novel application and unique advantages of AF4-FLD methods to obtain direct, size-resolved release profiles of fluorescent drugs from polymeric NPs.", "date": "2020-08-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug delivery systems; Analytical Chemistry - General; Nanodevices; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This challenge can be fueled by lack of sufficient material for spectroscopic analysis, or difficulties in sourcing the producing organism.

This work reports the implementation of bio-based thermo-responsive hydrogels comprised of xyloglucan (XG) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Thermo-responsive properties were obtained by enzymatic degalactosylation of tamarind seed XG (DG-XG), which reduced the galactose residue content by ~50%, and imparted a reversible thermal transition.  XG with comparable molar mass to DG-XG was achieved by ultrasonication treatment (XGu) for direct comparison of behavior. The hydrogels were prepared by simple mixing of DG-XG or XGu with CNCs in water. Phase diagrams were established to identify the ratios of DG-XG or XGu to CNCs (from 1:300 to 20:1 by mass) that yielded a viscous liquid, a phase separated mixture, a simple gel, or a thermo-responsive gel. Gelation occurred at a DG-XG or XGu to CNC ratio higher than that needed for the full surface coverage of CNCs, and required relatively high overall concentrations of both components (tested concentrations up to 20 g/L XG and 30 g/L CNCs). This is likely a result of the increase in effective hydrodynamic volume of CNCs due to the formation of XG-CNC complexes. Investigation of the adsorption behavior indicated that DG-XG formed a more rigid layer on CNCs compared to XGu. Rheological properties of the hydrogels were characterized and a reversible thermal transition was found for DG-XG/CNC gels at 35\u00b0C, where the mechanical properties of the gel could be tuned by adjusting the CNC content", "date": "2020-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biopolymers; Cellulosic materials; Hydrogels", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Models based on machine learning have emerged as a promising alternative to address these problems, but these models currently lack the precision to give crucial information on the magnitude of barrier heights, influence of solvents and catalysts and extent of regio- and chemoselectivity. Here, we construct hybrid models which combine the traditional transition state modelling and machine learning to accurately predict reaction barriers. We train a Gaussian Process Regression model to reproduce high-quality experimental kinetic data for the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction and use it to predict barriers with a mean absolute error of 0.77 kcal/mol for an external test set. The model was further validated on regio- and chemoselectivity prediction on patent reaction data and achieved a competitive top-1 accuracy of 86%, despite not being trained explicitly for this task. Importantly, the model gives error bars for its predictions that can be used for risk assessment by the end user. Hybrid models emerge as the preferred alternative for accurate reaction prediction in the very common low-data situation where only 100\u2013150 rate constants are available for a reaction class. With recent advances in deep learning for quickly predicting barriers and transition state geometries from density functional theory, we envision that hybrid models will soon become a standard alternative to complement current machine learning approaches based on ground-state physical organic descriptors or structural information such as molecular graphs or fingerprints.", "date": "2020-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Process Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Pharmaceutical Industry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Mitrasinovic", "abstract": "The infectious disease CoViD-19 is caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also referred to as hCoV-19. A possible infection mechanism includes dual host receptor recognitions by the SARS-CoV-2 transmembrane spike (S) glycoproteins. SARS-CoV-2 S contains two different domains, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD), which interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the ganglioside-rich domain of the plasma membrane at the surface of respiratory cell, respectively. The NTD amino acid residues (111-162) form a functional ganglioside-binding domain (GBD) that is conserved in all clinical isolates. Herein, the single point mutations (SPMs) of the GBD residues to which the virus is prone during genetic adaptation are predicted using an in silico protein engineering approach. Consequently, their effects on the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 S to the ganglioside-linked 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) are explored using molecular docking simulations. Val120Tyr and Asn122Trp are found to be the most likely SPMs in the GBD of SARS-CoV-2 S being involved in very specific recognition with 9-O-Ac-Sia through electrostatic interactions. Val120Tyr and Asn122Trp are also found to be the most likely SPMs in the GBD of SARS-CoV-2 S that is involved in conspicuously hydrophobic recognition with hidroxychloroquine (Hcq), thereby indicating the ability of Hcq to competitively inhibit GBD interactions with lipid rafts. However, the considerably non-specific binding of Hcq and the micromolar range of the dissociation constants of the SARS-CoV-2 S/Hcq complexes do not support the proposal of treating Hcq as a drug candidate. Maintaining a clear resemblance of the structure of a potential drug candidate to a natural substrate, accompanied by essential functional group modifications, may be a usable guideline for the structure-based design of anti-CoViD-19 drugs.<br />", "date": "2020-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recently, we have shown that STD NMR can be also applied to monitor changes in bound water during gelation of particulate dispersions. However, this technique is strongly dependent on gelator and solvent concentrations and does not report on the degree of organisation of the solvent within the particle network. This obscures the detailed understanding of the role of the solvent on gelation and precludes the comparison of solvation properties between dispersions prepared under different experimental conditions. In this work we report a novel STD NMR method to characterise the degree of solvent structuration in carbohydrate-based particulate dispersions by demonstrating for the first time that, for solvents interacting with large particles, the spin diffusion transfer build\u2011up curves can be modelled by the general one\u2011dimensional diffusion equation. Our novel approach, called Spin Diffusion Transfer Difference (SDTD) NMR, is independent of the gelator and solvent concentrations, allowing to monitor and compare the degree of solvent structuration in different gel networks. In addition, the simulation of SDTD build-up curves report on minimum distances (<i>r</i>) and spin diffusion rates (<i>D</i>) at the particle\u2011solvent interface. As a case study, we have characterised the degree of structuration of water and low molecular weight alcohols during the alcohol\u2011induced gelation of TEMPO-oxidised cellulose hydrogels by SDTD NMR, demonstrating the key role of water structuration on gel properties. SDTD NMR is a fast, robust and easy-to-implement solution NMR protocol that overcomes some of the limitations of the classical STD NMR approach when applied to the study of solvation. This technique can be readily extended to characterise the solvent(s) organisation in any type of particulate gels. Hence, the SDTD NMR method provides key insights on the role of water in the mechanism of gelation and the macroscopic properties of particulate gels, of fundamental importance for the design of soft matter materials with tuneable properties. </p>", "date": "2020-08-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biopolymers; Hydrogels; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is yet to be a proven effective treatment or cure for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-\u03b3, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities.

Studies on masks and respirators as a source of respirable debris were\nfound to be anecdotal (<i>Ann. Occup. Hyg.</i> <b>1986</b>, 20, 131\u2212133). Recent\ndiscussions on disposable masks and respirators focused on their widespread use\nduring the current pandemic and disposal into the environment (<i>Sci Total\nEnviron</i> <b>2020</b>, 737:140279; <i>Waste Manage</i> <b>2020</b>, 108, 202-205).</p><p><br /></p>\n\n<p>By putting several top-selling medical face masks and\nN95 respirators under microscopes, we found plenty of micro(nano)plastic debris\non their inner facings, with some appearing to be loosely attached while others\nstill connected to their structural fibers. The two types of debris often appear\nin the same cluster with similar morphology and texture. <b>Figure 1</b> in the\nmanuscript shows examples of these, and we have\nsubmitted a file containing additional images with methods and QA/QC as further\nevidence.</p><p><br /></p>\n\nWith\nthe novel coronavirus still looming in our communities, there is a strong ongoing\ndemand for personal respiratory protection devices. Supported by the latest guidance from WHO, many regulatory\nbodies have made these a compulsory requirement for the public when using\npublic transport, or in certain settings where it is difficult to maintain adequate\nphysical distancing. Respirable hazards such as micro(nano)plastics in\nthese, if pervasively exist, may pose a public health concern. Children, the elderly,\nand individuals having chronic respiratory diseases may be particularly\nsensitive to this type of inhalable contaminants. With a growing body of\nevidence on their adverse effects, micro(nano)plastics is an active research\ndomain with a quickly expanding scope. Researchers studying their inhalation, via\natmospheric or other anthropogenic sources, are now facing the reality that\nthere is a piece of plastic garment on top of the mouth and nose of millions of\npeople every day. With these becoming a necessity for many in their daily life\nand work, questions must be raised over this apparent regulatory gap concerning\ntheir long-term use safety.

There is currently no drug or vaccine for CoVid-19, but it has been revealed that some commercially available drugs are promising, at least for treating symptoms. Among them, Remdesivir, which can block the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in old SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, has been prescribed to CoVid-19 patients in many countries. A recent experiment showed that Remdesivir binds to SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibition constant of \u03bcM, but the exact target has not been reported. In this work, combining molecular docking, steered molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling we examined its binding affinity to two targets including the main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease, and RdRp. We showed that Remdesivir binds to Mpro slightly weaker than to RdRp and the corresponding inhibition constants, consistent with the experiment, fall to the \u03bcM range. The binding mechanisms of<br />Remdesivir to two targets differ in that electrostatic interaction is the main force in stabilizing the RdRp-Remdesivir complex, while the van der Waals interaction dominates in the MproRemdesivir case. Our result indicates that Remdesivir can target not only RdRp but also Mpro, which can be invoked to explain why this drug is effective in treating Covid-19. We have identified residues of the target protein that make the most important contribution to binding affinity, and this information is useful for drug development for this disease. \n<br />", "date": "2020-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An unprecedented rapid and global response has been set in motion to identify efficient antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2, mostly relying on the repurposing of drugs presenting or not previously known antiviral activity. Ivermectin is an approved drug used as antiparasitic in humans and animals with well documented broad-spectrum antiviral properties that emerge from host-directed effects. Recent results reported by Wagstaff and coworkers (Antiviral Research <b>2020</b>, <i>178</i>, 104787) show a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication <i>in vitro </i>by ivermectin, and clinical trials with human volunteers have already started. However, the mode of action of ivermectin is still largely unknown, especially at the molecular level. Here, we employ advanced molecular dynamics simulations to assess the influence of ivermectin on several key viral protein targets, with the aim to reveal the molecular bases of antiviral mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we show that ivermectin could be regarded as a multitarget agent, inhibiting different viral functions. These include blocking the recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the interactions with the two viral proteases 3CL<sup>pro</sup> and PL<sup>pro</sup>, and the SARS Unique Domain (SUD) non-structural protein. Hence, the wide spectrum of actions involving i) the interference with cell infection, ii) the inhibition of viral replication, and iii) elusion of the host immune system, could point to an unprecedented synergy between host- and virus-directed effects explaining the high anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity observed for this compound.", "date": "2020-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysics; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To uncover the\nmechanism, we focused on two\napproaches: a concerted and\na stepwise fashion.\nThe concerted pathway proceeds <i>via</i> deprotonation\nof the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys<sub>145</sub>  SgH)\nand simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the \u03b1-ketoamide\nwarhead.  In this work, we propose three plausible\nconcerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the\nfirst step is proton transfer from Cys<sub>145</sub>  SgH to\nHis<sub>41</sub> Nd\nforming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks\nthe a-keto\ngroup to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of\nthe tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl hole plays an important role. Moreover,\nas the \u03b1-keto group has two faces <i>Si</i> or <i>Re</i> for the nucleophilic\nattack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and\nR-thiohemiketal.\nWe computed the structural, electronic, and energetic parameters of all\nstationary points including transition states <i>via</i> ONIOM methodology at B3LYP/6-31G(d):PM6 level. Furthermore,\nto get more accurate results, we also calculated the single-point dispersion-corrected energy profile by\nusing \u03c9B97X-D/6-31G(d,p):PM6 level. Additionally, to characterize covalent,\nweak noncovalent interaction (NCI) and hydrogen-bonds, we applied NCI-reduced\ndensity gradient (NCI-RDG) methods along with Bader\u2019s Quantum Theory of\nAtoms-in-Molecules (QTAIM) and natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br />", "date": "2020-08-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

But dynamics study on the influences of the stacking effects on charge transfer in DNA is yet rare.In this article, a general rule about the relationship of onsite energies of same bases in a stack is derived by H \u0308uckel theory. It is found that the base in the middle position of the stack has lower onsite energy than the bases at the terminals due to squeezing effect, which is different from previous studied neighboring base effect. The former is along-range effect while the latter acts in a short range. Semiempirical MNDO calculations on (A:T) n (n=1\u223c10) systems verfied the H \u0308uckel analysis. From this perspective,the so-called incoherent hopping mechanism is actually somewhat coherent due to the squeezing effect. To understand these stacking effects on charge transfer in DNA,a cross-scale method which combines classical MD simulations, quantum mechanism calculations, Marcus electron transfer theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations is developed and applied on hole dynamics in (A:T) n (G:C) (n=1\u223c10) systems. Although no superexchange mechanism is explicitly involved in the studied systems, a crossover from strong to weak distance-dependency of hole arrival rates, which is an experimentally observed property of hole dynamics in DNA and is thought an evidence of the conversion from superexchange to hopping mechanism, also appears. We attribute it to the stacking effects. Such a result provides a new idea on explaining the crossover of different distance-dependencies of charge transfer rates in DNA. In addition, the squeezing effect may be a new driving force for long-range charge transfer. At the same time, some technical methods developed in the dynamics, e.g. calculations of onsite energies and electronic couplings in a stack, and simulated hole dynamics, etc.,can be generalized to other complex molecular systems with charge transfer behaviors.<br /><br />", "date": "2020-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we investigate the rheological response of collagen, fibrinogen, and thrombin protein solutions in bulk and at the solution/air interface. Interfacial rheological measurements show that fibrous collagen, fibrinogen and globular thrombin proteins adsorb and aggregate at the solution/air interface, forming a viscoelastic solid film at the interface. The viscoelastic film corrupts the bulk rheological measurements in rotational rheometers by contributing to an apparent yield stress, which increases the apparent bulk viscosity up to shear rates as high as 1000 s<sup>-1</sup>. The addition of a non-ionic surfactant, such as polysorbate 80 (PS80) in small amounts between 0.001 and 0.1 v/v%, prevents the formation of the interfacial layer, allowing the estimation of true bulk viscosity and viscoelastic properties of the solutions.

The BLOs were produced from a range of feedstocks including pine, mixed softwoods, forest residues, micro-algae, miscanthus, and wheat straw to cover a variety in nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine content and speciation. Nine samples were distributed, comprised of eight separate BLOs and one blind duplicate produced by five producers. The samples were analyzed for water, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine content. No analytical test method was mandated; laboratories were encouraged to utilize whichever method they determined would be most applicable, relying on the existing body of BLO literature as a guide. The results of this round robin study are presented in this paper. The results of the carbon, hydrogen, and water measurements as reference analyses had relative standard deviations (2.9%, 3.5, and 5.6%, respectively) that were comparable to those found in past round robin studies on fast pyrolysis bio-oil. The analysis of nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine showed higher levels of variability. Laboratories mostly chose the same method for water, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen determination whereas there were a variety of methods chosen for sulfur and chlorine determination.

One such interesting physicochemical property is thermal expansion, which arises from thermal vibration from the organic linker and metal ions. Herein, we show a very unique example of thermal responsiveness for DUT-49 framework, a MOF well-known for its distinctive negative gas adsorption (NGA) property. In the guest-free form, the framework shows another counter-intuitive phenomenon of negative thermal expansion (NTE), i.e. lattice size increase with decrease of temperature. However, in the solvated state, it shows both NTE and positive thermal expansion (i.e. lattice size decreases with lowering of temperature, PTE) based on a specific temperature range. When the solvent exists in liquid form inside the MOF pore, it retains the pristine NTE nature of the bare framework. But freezing of the solvent inside the pores induces a strain, which causes a structural transformation through in-plane bending of the linker and this squeezes the framework by ~10 % of the unit cell volume. This effect has been verified using 3 different solvents where the structural contraction occurs immediately at the freezing point of individual solvent. Furthermore, studies on a series of DUT-49(M) frameworks with varying metal confirm the general applicability of this mechanism.<br />", "date": "2020-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Physical and Chemical Properties; Structure; Surface; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we unveil the temperature-dependent response of PbS QD/graphene photodetectors by performing steady-state and time-dependent measurements over a large temperature range of 80\u2013300 K.

These restrictions had positive impacts for air quality due to a dramatic reduction of economic activity and emissions. In this work, a machine learning approach was designed and implemented to analyze local air quality improvements during the COVID-19 lockdown in Graz, Austria. The machine learning approach was used as a robust alternative to simple, historical measurement comparisons for various individual pollutants. Concentrations of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), PM10, O3 (ozone) and Ox (total oxidant) were selected from five measurement sites in Graz and were set as target variables for random forest regression models to predict their expected values during the city's lockdown period. The true vs. expected difference is presented here as an indicator of true pollution during the lockdown. The machine learning models showed a high level of generalization for predicting the concentrations. Therefore, the approach was suitable for analyzing reductions in pollution concentrations. Results on the validation set showed very good performance for Ox and NO2 when compared to PM10 and O3. The analysis indicated that the city\u2019s average concentration reductions for the lockdown period were: -36.9 to -41.6%, and -6.6 to -14.2% for NO2 and PM10, respectively. However, an increase of 11.6 to 33.8% for O3 was estimated. The reduction in pollutant concentration, especially NO2 can be explained by significant drops in traffic-flows during the lockdown period (-51.6 to -43.9%).

Detailed investigation of\nthe solubility in five different solvents revealed that the incorporation of the alkyl chains increases the\nsolubility significantly. The increased solubility of the materials allowed the application as host\nmaterials in red, green and blue solution processed PhOLEDs. Hence, this work presents the first\nsolution processed OLED devices based on the indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole scaffold.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>", "date": "2020-08-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Two major human AlkB family members, FTO and ALKBH5, both act as oxidative demethylases of N6 methyladenosine (m6A) but furnish different major products, N6 hydroxymethyladenosine (hm6A) and adenosine (A), respectively. Here we identify foundational mechanistic differences between FTO and ALKBH5 that promote these distinct biochemical outcomes. In contrast to FTO, which follows a traditional oxidative N-demethylation pathway to catalyze conversion of m6A to hm6A with subsequent slow release of A and FA, we find that ALKBH5 catalyzes a direct</p><p>m6A-to-A transformation with rapid FA release. We identify a catalytic R130/K132/Y139 triad within ALKBH5 that facilitates release of FA via an unprecedented covalent-based demethylation mechanism with direct detection of a covalent intermediate. Importantly, a K132Q mutant furnishes an ALKBH5 enzyme with an m6A demethylation profile that resembles that of FTO, establishing the importance of this residue in the proposed covalent mechanism. Finally, we show that ALKBH5 is an endogenous source of FA in the cell by activity-based sensing of FA fluxes perturbed via ALKBH5 knockdown. This work provides a fundamental biochemical rationale for non-redundant roles of these RNA demethylases beyond different substrate preferences and cellular localization, where m6A demethylation by ALKBH5 versus FTO results in release of FA, an endogenous one-carbon unit but potential genotoxin, at different rates in living systems.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Significance Statement</p><p><br /></p><p>Non-heme iron enzymes FTO and ALKBH5 play central roles in epigenetic RNA regulation by catalyzing the oxidation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) to produce N6-hydroxymethyladenosine (hm6A) and adenosine (A), respectively.

A bifunctional OER mechanism, in which the energetically demanding step of the attack of hydroxide on a metal oxo unit is facilitated by a hydrogen atom transfer to a second site, has the potential to circumvent the scaling relationship. However, the bifunctional mechanism has hitherto only been supported by theoretical computations. Here we describe an operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH-NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The data support two distinct mechanisms for the two catalysts: FeOOH-NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate-determining O-O bond forming step is the OH- attack on a Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a NiIII-O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive PCET steps.

In addition, the dielectric, magnetization and electron spin resonance studies reveal that this material exhibits multifunctional properties with temperature-induced reversible changes in its dielectric, conducting and magnetic behaviour associated with the phase transition. Also, the dielectric permitivity increases sharply up to 5 times when inducing the phase transition, which can be exploited to store electric energy into a capacitor.

The procedure relies on the thermal decomposition of di-<i>tert</i>-butylhyponitrite (DTBHN), a safer alternative to the explosive diacetyl peroxide, to produce highly reactive methyl radicals that can initiate the chain process. This mode of initiation generates byproducts that are either gaseous (N<sub>2</sub>) or volatile (acetone and methyl halide) thereby facilitating greatly product purification by either flash column chromatography or distillation. In addition, remarkably simple and mild reaction conditions (refluxing EtOAc during 30 minutes under normal atmosphere) and a low excess of the radical precursor reagent (2.0 equivalents) make this protocol particularly attractive for preparative synthetic applications. This initiation procedure has been demonstrated with a broad scope since it works efficiently to add a range of electrophilic radicals generated from iodides, bromides, selenides and xanthates over a range of unactivated terminal alkenes. A diverse set of radical trap substrates exemplifies a broad functional group tolerance.

Our data demonstrate the divergence of the assembly mechanisms upon shifting from pure water to buffered solutions (pH=7) upon introducing the DNA conjugate.

One of the reasons for this alarming discrepancy is the lack of a method which is sufficiently robust for carrying out validation studies, which may require analysis of samples from hundreds of patients across multiple institutions and pooling the results together. Capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based hybridization assay proved to be more robust than reversed transcription polymerase chain reaction (the current standard) but its limit of quantification (LOQ) exceeds 10 pM while miRNA concentrations in cell lysates are below 1 pM. Thus, CE-based separation must be preceded by on-column sample preconcentration. Here we explain challenges of sample preconcentration for CE-based miRNA analyses and introduce a preconcentration method that can suit CE-based miRNA analysis utilizing peptide nucleic acid (PNA) hybridization probes. The method combines field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) with isotachophoresis (ITP). We proved that FASS-ITP could retain and concentrate both near-neutral PNA with highly-negatively charged PNA\u2013miRNA hybrids. We demonstrated that preconcentration by FASS-ITP could be combined with the CE-based separation of the unreacted PNA probes from the PNA\u2013miRNA hybrids and facilitate improvement in LOQ by a factor of 140, down to 0.1 pM. Finally, we applied FASS-ITP-CE for simultaneous detection of two miRNAs in crude cell lysates and proved that the method was robust when used in complex biological matrices. The 140-fold improvement in LOQ and the robustness to biological matrices will significantly expand the applicability of CE-based miRNA analysis, bringing it closer to becoming a practical tool for validation of miRNA biomarkers. <div><br /></div></div>", "date": "2020-08-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, sensitive photoacoustic (PA) probes for detecting NO-associated complicated diseases (e.g., encephalitis), has yet to be developed. Herein, we report a NO-activated PA probe for in vivo detection of encephalitis by tuning the molecular geometry and energy transformation processes. A strong donor-acceptor structure with good conjugation can be obtained after NO treatment, along with the active intramolecular motion, significantly boosting \u201cturn-on\u201d near-infrared PA property. The molecular probe exhibits high specificity and sensitivity towards NO over interfering reactive species. Noninvasive in vivo imaging indicates that PA signal lights up in lipopolysaccharide-induced encephalitis with a high signal-to-background ratio of 15.7. Further studies reveal that the probe is also capable of differentiating encephalitis in different severities, being beneficial for understanding the disease evolution processes and drug screening.

As previous efforts towards molecular insulators focused on saturated molecules, it remains an open question whether pi- and sigma-transport can be simultaneously suppressed in conjugated systems. Here, we demonstrate that there are conjugated molecules where the sigma-transmission is suppressed by destructive sigma-interference, while the pi-transmission can be suppressed by a localized disruption of conjugation. Using density functional theory, we study the Landauer transmission and ballistic current density, which allow us to determine how the transmission is affected by various structural changes in the molecule. We find that in para-linked oligophenyl rings the sigma-transmission can be suppressed by changing the remaining hydrogens to methyl groups due to the inherent gauche-like structure of the carbon backbone within a benzene ring, similar to what was previously seen in saturated systems. At the same time, the methyl groups fulfil a dual purpose as they modulate the twist angle between neighboring phenyl rings. When neighboring rings are orthogonal to each other, the transmission through both pi- and sigma-systems is effectively suppressed. Alternatively, breaking conjugation in a single phenyl ring by saturating two carbons atoms with two methyl substituents on each carbon, results in suppressed pi- and sigma-transport independent of dihedral angle. These two strategies demonstrate that methyl-substituted oligophenyls are promising candidates for the development of molecular dielectric materials.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2020-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanodevices; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among capillary-driven devices,\nthose made from paper and polyester film are among the most common and have been used in a wide array\nof applications. However, since capillary forces are the only driving force, flow is difficult to control, and\npassive flow control methods such as changing the geometry must be used to accomplish various analytical\napplications. This study presents several new flow control methods that can be utilized in a laminate\ncapillary-driven microfluidic device to increase available functionality. First, we introduce push and burst\nvalve systems that can stop and start flow. These valves can be opened by either pressing the channel or\ninflowing other fluids to the valve region. Next, we propose flow control methods for Y-shaped channels\nthat enable more functions. In one example, we demonstrate the ability to accurately control concentration and in a second example, flow rate in the main channel is controlled by adjusting the geometry of the inlet\nchannel.

High-throughput screening studies of rigid materials, for example, have shown they are not able to achieve the original ARPA-E methane storage targets, yet an interesting question remains: what is the upper limit of deliverable capacity in flexible materials? In this work we develop a statistical adsorption model that specifically probes the limit of deliverable capacity in intrinsically flexible materials. The resulting adsorption thermodynamics indicate that a perfectly engineered, intrinsically flexible nanoporous material could achieve higher methane deliverable capacity than the best benchmark systems known to date with little to no total volume change. Density functional theory and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations identify a known metal-organic framework (MOF) that validates key features of the model.

These transitions consist of an electronic excitation from the ground to an excited state and a decay back to the initial ground state, associated with a photon emission. While this technique has been used primarily with atoms, it has also recently been shown to work for some divalent metal hydroxides (e.g. SrOH) and alkoxides (e.g. SrOCH3). This extension to molecules is possible because these molecules feature nearly isolated, atomic-like ground and first-excited electronic states centered on the radical metal atom. We theoretically investigate the extension of this idea to a larger scale by growing the alkyl group, R, beyond the initial methyl group, CH3, while preserving the isolated and highly vertical character of the electronic excitation on the radical metal atom, M. Theory suggests that in the limit as the size of the ligand carbon chain increases, it can be considered a functionalized diamond (or cubic boron nitride) surface. Several requirements must be observed for the cycling centers to function when bound to the surface. First, the surface must have a significant band gap that fully encapsulates both the ground and excited states of the cycling center. Second, while the surface lattice imposes strict limits on the achievable spacing between the SrO- groups, at high coverage, SrO- centers can interact, and show geometric changes and/or electronic state mixing. We show that the coverage of the diamond surface with SrO- cycling centers needs to be significantly submonolayer for the functionality of the cycling center to be preserved. Having the lattice-imposed spatial control of SrO- placements will allow nanometer-scale proximity between qubits and will eliminate the need for atom traps for localized cycling emitters. Our results also imply that a functionalization could be done on a scanning microscope tip for local quantum sensing or on photonic structures for optically-mediated quantum information processing. </div>", "date": "2020-08-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Computing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, existing coacervates are typically made of multiple macromolecular components, and designing short peptide analogues capable of self-coacervation has proven difficult. Here, we present a short peptide synthon for phase separation, made of only two dipeptide stickers linked via a flexible, hydrophilic spacer. These small-molecule compounds self-coacervate into micrometre-sized liquid droplets at sub-mM concentrations, which retain up to 75 weight-% water. The design is general and we derive guidelines for the required sticker hydrophobicity and spacer polarity.

RdRP simulations in its apo, NTP-bound and analogue-bound form have been performed for a cumulative time of 1.9 \u03bcs. The conformational flexibility of the RdRP molecule was explored using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Markov State Modeling (MSM) Analysis. PCA inferred the presence of correlated motions along the conserved motifs of the RdRP. The ligand binding motif F and template binding motif G showed motions that are negatively correlated with one another. LYS 551, ARG 553 and ARG 555 which are a part of the motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. ARG 836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the nucleotide analogues. The MSM analysis helped to observe different conformational states explored by the RdRP. The ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. The Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open and closed conformations. The closed states were observed to have more favorable docking of the ligands.

To rationally design single-atom alloys and other surfaces with localized ensembles, it is crucial to understand variations in reactivity when varying the dopant and the ensemble size. Here, we examined hydrogen adsorption on surfaces embedded with localized clusters and discovered general trends. Counterintuitively, increasing the amount of a more reactive metal sometimes makes a surface site less reactive. This behavior is due to the hybridization and splitting of narrow peaks in the electronic density of states of many of these surfaces, making them analogous to free-standing nanoclusters. When a single-atom alloy has a peak just below the Fermi energy, the corresponding two-dopant cluster often has weaker adsorption than the single-atom alloy due to splitting of this peak across the Fermi energy. Further, single-atom alloys have qualitatively different behavior than larger ensembles. Specifically, the adsorption energy is a U-shaped function of the dopant\u2019s group for single atom alloys.

The formation of the covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex was then simulated using hybrid QM/MM free energy methods. After binding, the reaction mechanism was found to be composed of two steps: i) the activation of the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) to form an ion pair and ii) a Michael addition where the attack of the Sg atom of Cys145 to the Cb atom of the inhibitor precedes the water-mediated proton transfer from His41 to the Ca atom. The microscopic description of protease inhibition by N3 obtained from our simulations is strongly supported by the excellent agreement between the estimated activation free energy and the value derived from kinetic experiments.

These remarkably different\nbiosynthetic strategies represent a striking example of convergent BGC evolution, with selective pressure for the production\nof tambjamines seemingly leading to the emergence of separate biosynthetic pathways in pseudoalteromonads and\nstreptomycetes that ultimately produce closely related compounds", "date": "2020-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nonetheless, a comprehensive picture of the effect of temperature on hydrophobic hydration and protein denaturation remains elusive. Here, we study the effect of temperature on the hydration of model hydrophobic and amphiphilic solutes through molecular dynamics aiming at getting insight on the singular behavior of water concerning the zero entropy temperature Ts and entropic convergence also observed upon protein denaturation. We show that, similar to hydrocarbons and proteins, polar amphiphilic solutes exhibit a Ts, although strongly dependent upon solute-water interactions, opposite to hydrocarbons. Further, the temperature dependence of the hydration entropy normalized by the solvent accessible surface area is shown to be nearly solute size independent for hydrophobic but not for amphiphilic solutes, for similar reasons. These results are further discussed in the light of information theory (IT) and the structure of water around hydrophobic groups The latter shows that the tetrahedral enhancement of some water molecules around hydrophobic groups, associated with the reduction of water defects, leads to the strengthening of the weakest hydrogen bonds, relative to bulk water. However, a larger tetrahedrality is found in low density water populations, demonstrating that pure water has encoded structural information similar to that associated with hydrophobic hydration, consistent with IT assumptions. The source of the differences between Kauzmann's \"hydrocarbon model\" on protein denaturation and hydrophobic hydration is also discussed with relatively large amphiphilic hydrocarbons displaying a more similar behavior to globular proteins, than aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br />", "date": "2020-08-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Processes; Solution Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This has inspired significant research endeavors exploiting the potential of this special water in chemistry. However, these systems are so far limited to complex artificial solids or biphasic systems and small molecules as reactants. Here, we show that the intrinsically present surface-confined water in hierarchically structured biopolymers can be used as nanomedium to promote chemical reactions. We found in the example of cellulose fibers that confined water was actively involved in the reaction mechanism and facilitated the surface acetylation of the fiber, increasing reaction kinetics, efficiency and regioselectivity. Our findings can be regarded as proof-of-principle that the hydration layer in nanoporous polymers can be exploited as medium to promote chemical reactions at their surface. This concept can likely be extended to other polymers and various reaction systems. <br />", "date": "2020-08-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Biopolymers; Cellulosic materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We here introduce a fast prefiltering method for ligand prioritization that is based on a set of machine learning models and uses simple pose-invariant physicochemical descriptors of the ligands and the protein binding pocket. Our method, Rapid Screening with Physicochemical Descriptors + machine learning (RASPD+), is trained on PDBbind data and achieves a regression performance better than for the original RASPD method and comparable to traditional scoring functions on a range of different test sets without the need for generating ligand poses. Additionally, we use RASPD+ to identify molecular features important for binding affinity and assess the ability of RASPD+ to enrich active molecules from decoys.", "date": "2020-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Because the viral 3CLpro protein controls coronavirus replication, 3CLpro is identified as a target for drug molecules. We implemented an enhanced sampling method in combination with molecular dynamics and docking to reduce the computational screening search space to four molecules that could be synthesized and tested against SARS-CoV-2. Our computational method is much more robust than any other method available for drug screening (e.g., docking) because of sampling of the free energy surface of the binding site of the protein (including the ligand) and use of explicit solvent. We have considered all possible interactions between all the atoms present in the protein, ligands, and water. Using high-performance computing with graphical processing units, we were able to perform a large number of simulations within a month and converge the results to the four most strongly bound ligands (based on free energy and other scores) from a set of 17 ligands with lower docking scores. Additionally, we have considered N3 and 13b \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors as controls for which experimental crystal structures are available. Out of the top four ligands, PI-06 was found to have a higher screening score compared to the controls. Based on our results and analysis, we confidently claim that we have identified four potential ligands, out of which one ligand is the best choice based on free energy and the most promising candidate for further synthesis and testing against SARS-CoV-2.<br /></p>", "date": "2020-08-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Theory - Computational; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we have employed a new simple electrochemical microreactor design to oxidise an L-proline derivative at room temperature in continuous flow. Compared to batch, organic electrosynthesis via microflow reactors are advantageous because they allow shorter reaction times, optimization and scale up, safer working environments, and high selectivities (e.g. reduce overoxidation). Flow electrochemical reactors also provide high surface-to-volume ratios and impart the possibility of excluding the supporting electrolyte due to a very short interelectrode distance.  By the comparison of Hofer Moest type electrochemical oxidations at room temperature in batch and flow, we conclude that continuous flow electrolysis is superior to batch, producing a good yield and a higher enantiomeric excess. These results show that continuous flow has the potential to act as a new enabling technology for asymmetric synthesis to replace some aspects of conventional batch electrochemical processes.  </p>", "date": "2020-08-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioorganic Chemistry; Natural Products; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

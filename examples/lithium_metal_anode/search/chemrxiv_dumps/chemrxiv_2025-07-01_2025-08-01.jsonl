In this study, a flocculation system was developed by combining polyacrylamide (PAM)-based flocculants with iron-grafted cellulose fibers. Jar tests were systematically conducted to evaluate the performance of different PAM types (three cationic and one anionic) at various concentrations (0.5\u20135 mg/L), both with and without the addition of non-grafted and iron-grafted fibers (50\u2013300 mg/L). Flocculation performance was assessed based on turbidity reduction, total organic carbon (TOC) removal, and NA removal measured by fluorescence. The results demonstrate that iron-grafted fibers significantly enhanced treatment by promoting floc bridging and adsorption. Optimal removal was achieved using 1\u20132 mg/L of cationic PAM3 combined with 200\u2013250 mg/L of iron-grafted fibers, resulting in up to 66 % TOC removal and over 60 % NA removal after only 3 min of settling. Mechanical pressing of the flocs through a 100 \u00b5m mesh further improved water clarity and sludge compactness. Comparisons showed that non-grafted fibers provided moderate improvement, while systems without fibers performed poorly, especially when anionic polymers were used. This study highlights the importance of optimizing the fiber-to-polymer ratio and introduces iron-grafted cellulose as a sustainable and effective flocculation aid for complex industrial effluents.

In this study, we investigated the impact of alkali pretreatment on aluminosilicate structures in coal tailings and the subsequent implications for REE recovery during acid digestion. Pre-combustion coal refuse was treated with 5 M NaOH at varying solid-to-liquid (S/L) ratios (5, 50 g/L) and reaction times (5, 15 minutes), including a multi-step (five cycles) approach under microwave conditions. At 180\u25e6C, XRD, 29Si NMR Spectroscopy and thermodynamic modeling show kaolinite transformation to hydrosodalite under high S/L ratios, while kaolinite completely dissolved under low S/L ratios. Conversely, quartz maintained crystallinity under both S/L ratios but slowly converted to amorphous silica over longer alkaline treatments. These alkaline pre-treatments resulted in greater REE extraction under acidic conditions. Light REE extraction was enhanced by a factor of \u223c3 when kaolinite dissolved, but by a factor of \u223c2 when kaolinite was converted to hydrosodalite; the heavy REEs (including Y) extractions were enhanced by \u223c2 and \u223c1.5, respectively, under the same conditions. Extending pre-treatment time from 5 to 15 minutes led to minimal enhancement in REE extraction, therefore kaolinite solubility due to low S/L ratio appears to be the primary factor in REE release. This alkaline pre-treatment also led to uranium removal prior to acid digestion, while correlation analyses showed that REE recovery was closely linked to simultaneous Mg, Ca, Fe, and Ti recovery.

Our primary objective was to investigate the impact of specific physical forces on the chemical denaturation of DNA in the presence of salts. We used fractional cohesion parameters, as shown in the modified equations, which employ the cohesive energy density approach to expose these forces. The original cohesive energy density equation does not apply to ionic systems. So we modified this equation and developed a protocol for applying this modified equation to evaluate the influence of a salt. We did this by allocating salt effects to either the water or the denaturant, creating an \"effective\" cohesion parameter.

We demonstrate the influence of salts on hydrogen bonding, dispersion, polar forces, proton donor/acceptor ratio, dipole induction, orientation parameter, and electrostatic interactions during the denaturation process of DNA.   By analyzing independent experimental data, we demonstrate that salt affects electrostatic repulsion forces, with the most significant compensating attractive forces being dispersion forces.

However, their adoption is limited by large coercive electric fields (E_c), often approaching the dielectric breakdown field (E_b), raising concerns about energy efficiency and device reliability. The discovery of wurtzite FEs has also been constrained by a narrow chemical design space, with few known examples to date. Ferroelectricity in AlN-based alloys, particularly Al_1-xM_xN with trivalent M^3+ cations, has been a focal point of recent work. Building on studies of co-alloyed AlN for enhanced piezoelectricity, we computationally investigate ferroelectricity in Al_1-x(M1,M2)_xN alloys, where M1^2+ and M2^4+ are non-trivalent cations. Using density functional theory (DFT), solid-state nudged elastic band method, and structural analysis, we predict switchable polarization in Al_1-x(Mg,Hf)_xN. Compared to the prototypical Al_1-xSc_xN, this co-alloy exhibits a more rapid decrease in both the switching barrier and band gap with increasing x, suggesting a simultaneous reduction in E_c and E_b. At x~ 0.16, the E_c/E_b ratio is comparable to that of switchable Al_1-xSc_xN. This reduction in E_c is attributed to enhanced structural distortions introduced by co-alloying. By using band gap and distortion as design metrics, we identify several other promising M1-M2 combinations, and highlight Al_1-x(Ca,Si)_xN as a strong candidate for experimental validation.

Acrylamide (AA) is depolymerized from poly-acrylamide under harsh environmental conditions, such as exposure to UV radiation and elevated temperatures, causing severe water and soil pollution. Herein, in situ reconstructed Ag-doped Ni2P nanosheets on Ni foam (CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF) are developed as a bifunctional catalyst. This catalyst exhibits high activity for the AA oxidation reaction (AOR) and enables simultaneously energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) processes. After cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment, the previous zipper-like catalyst morphology transforms into a spherical morphology with interspersed rod-like structure particles on the surface, resulting in a unique structure with a larger electrochemical area and a higher quantity of active sites. The stability of CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF for both HER and AOR was established with chronopotentiometry tests. Post-characterizations by SEM, XRD and EDX analyses further suggest long-time stability of CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF. Particularly, the potential for AOR using CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF is minimized to 1.82 V generating a current density of 100 mA cm2 in the two-electrode setup. Significantly, 79.3% of AA was removed after 24 h of AOR processing at 50 mA cm2. Simultaneously, the ethanol generated at the anode serves as a value-added product for industrial application. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ag atoms act as the active sites for the degradation of AA to produce ethanol in the hybrid structure, while the Ag atoms exhibit a more thermoneutral value for *H2O and AA adsorption.

To ensure energy conservation during these transitions, atomic velocities must be adjusted. Traditional velocity rescaling methods either apply a uniform adjustment to atomic velocities, which can lead to size consistency issues, or rely on nonadiabatic coupling vectors, which are computationally expensive and may not always be available. Here, we introduce two novel velocity rescaling methods that incorporate atomic contributions to electronic transitions, derived from the one-electron transition density matrix or the density difference between states for a given transition. The first method, excitation weighted velocity rescaling, redistributes kinetic energy among atoms proportionally to their contributions to the electronic transition. This is achieved through a weighted scaling factor, computed from the population analysis of the one-electron transition density matrix or the density difference of the two states involved in the transition. The second method, excitation-thresholded velocity rescaling, adjusts the velocities only of atoms whose contributions exceed a predefined threshold, preventing unnecessary energy redistribution to atoms with minimal involvement in the excitation. We validate these approaches through excited-state dynamics simulations of fulvene and 1H-1,2,3 triazole. Our results show that excitation-weighted velocity rescaling closely reproduces the adjustments based on nonadiabatic coupling vectors for both fulvene and 1H-1,2,3-triazole.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Recently this idea was challenged by the first report of a cyclophane constructed from naphthalene-di-imide (NDI) units which do not satisfy the triplet energy criteria. In order to uncover electronic nature of the dynamic 1TT stabilization in such supramolecular constructs, herein we have synthesized five new NDI cyclophanes by altering the \ndistance and angle between the NDI units.

Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance.

While Faraday cages are ubiquitously used for this purpose, they are often implemented simply as metal boxes enclosing the measurement system, without accounting for critical design factors such as skin depth. In this study, we have investigated a host of factors to understand noise origins, noise coupling pathways, and systematic treatment for effective shielding against them beyond the common metal box treatment. To accomplish this, we pursued the construction of a nested Faraday system conducive for low-noise data acquisition, investigating powerline quality, grounding strategies for the Faraday cage, connectivity solutions for maintaining Faraday cage integrity, and relative positioning of the components in the measurement setup. Our findings have rendered noise in current measurements to be in the vicinity of biological nanopores.

In this work, we synthesize a series of thermoresponsive HBPs via activators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using an initiator-monomer conjugate (inimer), 2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)ethyl methacrylate (EMABIB), in combination with oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate. These HBPs are benchmarked against linear copolymers prepared with isobutyryloxyethyl methacrylate (IBOEMA), a monofunctional structural analogue of EMABIB, to isolate the influence of branching on thermal and rheological behavior. We explore how the molar composition of the inimer modulates cloud point temperature (Tcp), complex viscosity, extensional flow behavior, and hydrolytic degradability. We leverage density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrostatic potential (ESP) mapping to reveal connections between monomer polarity and their role in thermoresponsive behavior. Our findings show that hyperbranched architectures exhibit lower viscosity and Tcp, along with more consistent extensional flow behavior across concentrations, compared to their linear analogues at similar compositions. Moreover, the HBPs demonstrate selective and tunable degradation under basic conditions, highlighting their potential as responsive, degradable materials for potential future biomedical and industrial applications.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Organic Polymers; Polymer chains; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

On the other hand, compounds containing a 3,4-dichlorophenyl moiety, such as 1-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-amine (I), interact in a different region of the Trypanosoma brucei PTR1 (TbPTR1) binding pocket. In this work, we develop two compound series in which a 2-aminobenzothiazole moiety is connected to a 3,4-dichlorophenyl moiety via different linkers. A bespoke in-house compound library was virtually screened by computational docking against TbPTR1 and Leishmania major PTR1 (LmPTR1). Five selected compounds were synthesized, two of which, 1a and 1b, emerged as promising inhibitors of TbPTR1, with 1b also showing a micromolar inhibition level against LmPTR1 and moderate activity against Leishmania infantum (close to 50% at 10 \u00b5M), demonstrating its potential as a pan-parasite PTR1 inhibitor, which is rather unusual for 2-aminobenzothiazole derivatives. Quantum chemical calculations and crystallography guided the design of further compounds whose structure-activity relationship (SAR) showed that the halogen at the meta position of the phenyl ring is energetically more favorable for anti-PTR1 activity than at the para position, but that single halogen substitutions resulted in lower anti-parasite activities.

Flavoproteins capitalize on this sensitivity to tune their chemical reactivity and photochemistry. A fundamental understanding of this tuning mechanism is necessary for the design of novel flavoproteins. Photoactive flavoproteins such as Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domains have served as important scaffolds to tune photophysics through sequence mutations, resulting in a series of engineered LOV-based proteins that optimize fluorescence, intersystem crossing (ISC), photoreduction, and/or adduct formation over a range of timescales. To better guide future engineering efforts, we have recently employed hybrid quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical (QM/MM) models of LOV domains to study how intradomain electrostatics exert control over flavin's photophysics. In this work, we focus on a series of LOV1 and LOV2 domains from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLOV), Avena sativa (AsLOV), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrLOV); by simulating their spectroscopic properties, relative energetics of low-lying singlet and triplet \u03c0,\u03c0* and n,\u03c0* states, and electrostatic projection maps, we present a comparative study that sheds light on the variations in LOV domain's ISC efficiency in these three organisms.

Further incorporation of Cu atoms in Au alloys enhances their catalytic activity and selectivity. Experimental results have demonstrated different rates of benzyl alcohol conversion to benzaldehyde relative to different ratios of Au and Cu in the catalyst nanoparticle. The rates of conversion demonstrates higher catalytic activity of pure Au cluster compared to pure Cu cluster. In this work, the catalytic roles of Au and Cu in the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde were analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Au-rich and Cu-rich clusters were considered as catalyst, namely Au13, Au12Cu and Cu13, Cu12Au clusters respectively. The mechanism of the minimum energy path focuses on the oxidation of two molecules of benzyl alcohol by a single molecule of O2 to produce two molecules of benzaldehyde and H2O respectively. The calculations reveal that the reaction rate is predominantly governed by the adsorption of reactants and the desorption of products, consistent with experimental observations. In Cu-rich clusters, the adsorption of O2 is more favorable due to effective charge transfer between the cluster and O2 resulting in high adsorption energy.

This study presents a novel approach that employs vibration-induced local vortices (VILV) within a microfluidic platform to achieve spatial control over DNA condensate dimensions and enable their parallel generation. A key advantage of this platform is its ability to support direct observation and real-time tracking of structural morphology and dynamics. Through flow-field analysis of the VILV system, we demonstrate that uniform microvortices serve as virtual compartments, wherein DNA molecules confined within each vortex space aggregate and gradually relax into uniform spherical condensate droplets. By modulating parameters such as DNA concentration and micropillar dimensions, the VILV platform not only enables systematic control of condensate size but also facilitates the construction of complex, multicomponent \"patchy\" condensates with consistent morphology.

These proteins are frequently labeled \u201cundruggable,\u201d not because they cannot be modulated, but because their ligandable sites are hidden, transient, or mutant-specific. To address this, I developed a machine-guided, biophysically grounded pipeline that dynamically reveals cryptic pockets emerging only under specific conformational and hydration conditions. This pipeline integrates long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD), Markov State Modeling (MSM), time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), voxel-based hydration thermodynamics (\u0394G_water), and ligand\u2013residue contact persistence analysis to predict when and where a cryptic pocket forms\u2014and whether it is physically capable of supporting ligand binding.  Unlike traditional docking or e-pharmacophore workflows, my pipeline explicitly resolves conformational ensembles into metastable macrostates and ranks them by a novel Cryptic Dynamic Druggability Score (CDDS). CDDS integrates pocket lifetime, water displacement energetics, and contact persistence, providing a state-specific and interpretable druggability metric. The entire framework was applied across four challenging cancer targets: KRAS G12D, MYC Arg58Ala, TP53 Arg248Ser, and SRC kinase. In each case, I identified either (a) a cryptic pocket emerging selectively in the mutant with supportive hydration and binding energetics, or (b) a false positive that failed all dynamic criteria, despite high static druggability scores.  In KRAS G12D, a side-chain gate absent in the wild-type opened to form a metastable pocket with CDDS ~0.55, \u0394G_water \u2248 \u20133.8\u202fkcal/mol, and mutant-selective ligand binding. In MYC Arg58Ala, a cryptic site not present in the wild-type formed via side-chain deletion and surface charge inversion; a designed compound (Compound 32) bound with MM/GBSA \u2248 \u201321\u202fkcal/mol and persistent PLIP contacts. SRC kinase, a classical toxicity-prone ATP-site target, revealed a cryptic site outside the active site. This site was captured dynamically and bound Analog 7 with high affinity (\u0394G \u2248 \u201331\u202fkcal/mol) without touching the ATP pocket. In contrast, TP53 Arg248Ser showed a high Fpocket static score (0.708) but failed to sustain a pocket during MD. No meaningful ligand retention, water displacement, or stable macrostate pocket volume was observed\u2014illustrating the power of CDDS and dynamics to reject false positives.  The platform also incorporates a novel pharmacophore merging strategy using privileged scaffolds from FDA-approved and 3D-rich fragment libraries, guided entirely by dynamic pocket features rather than known ligands. Collectively, this approach enables rational design against targets previously inaccessible, de-risks biophysical assays by guiding when and where to probe, and offers a reproducible computational method for fragment hit validation, NMR probing, or soaking trials.  This work provides the first integrated, mutation-specific, dynamic cryptic pocket discovery framework validated across multiple targets. It represents a paradigm shift from structure-based design to time-aware, water-sensitive, functionally annotated druggability profiling.

Existing methods for assessing the coverage of a conformational space can be ambiguous, reference-dependent, and qualitative due to their reliance on visual perception. In this work, we propose CHQuant, a protocol designed to quantify the extent of conformational space coverage. This approach is based on the observation that the movement of atoms defines point clouds that can be characterised by the volumes of the corresponding convex hulls. By applying our method to several small molecules and conformational sampling methods, we show that convex hull volumes behave according to chemical intuition at an atomic, functional group and molecular level. Therefore convex hull volumes are useful measures that can be used to compare different sampling methods or datasets. Among many applications, the CHQuant approach  monitors the sampling achieved by any molecular dynamics sampler, and compares existing conformational databases of the same system.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the effectiveness of NMF-based MCR analysis depends heavily on both algorithmic choice and experimental design. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three NMF approaches\u2014standard alternating least squares (FroALS), Fast Projected Gradient Method (FroFPGM), which minimizes the same objective function as FroALS, and minimum volume regularization (MinVol), which incorporates an additional volume regularization term into the minimized objective function\u2014applied to both experimental Raman and simulated infrared spectroscopic datasets. While MinVol has shown promise in hyperspectral unmixing applications, this work represents its first application to spectroscopic reaction monitoring data. We demonstrate that FroFPGM and MinVol consistently outperform the conventional FroALS approach, with MinVol showing superior robustness at higher noise levels. Through extensive computational studies exploring different sampling strategies, we establish that the effectiveness of offline concentration measurements used as equality constraints in NMF analysis depends critically on their timing during the reaction. Contrary to common practice, optimal sampling points do not necessarily coincide with peak intermediate concentrations, but rather when reaction trajectories approach the facets of the reaction space's convex hull. We also show that reaction kinetics significantly influence the sensitivity to sampling point selection, highlighting the importance of careful experimental design. These insights provide practical guidelines for both experimental design and data analysis in MCR problems.

We evaluated both approaches on held-out public data and structurally novel PROTACs from AstraZeneca's proprietary collection. The Transformer-based model achieved high exact-match accuracy (86%) on public data but dropped significantly (18%) on structurally novel internal PROTACs due to occasional hallucinations. In contrast, the XGBoost model can ensure chemical validity and perfect reassembly accuracy on both sets, with lower exact-match accuracy on open-data (49%) but comparable performance on the internal set (23%). To improve reliability, we implemented a wrapper function for the Transformer (Transformer-Delta), which corrects partial prediction errors, raising reassembly accuracy to 96% on public and 70% on internal datasets. Combining the strengths of both models, we propose a hybrid approach that reliably annotates PROTACs across diverse chemical spaces.

The use of DMF is one of the major drawbacks for the transfer of UiO-66 to large-scale applications, since DMF is an expensive and toxic organic solvent. In this work, we propose a water-based route to synthesise UiO-66 using either dimethylterephthalate or bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, which can be obtained from chemical recycling of waste polyethyleneterephthalate, as a source of the linker. Hydrochloric acid and acetic acid were used as modulators during the synthesis to control the kinetics of ester hydrolysis and MOF crystallisation, aiming to avoid collateral precipitation of terephthalic acid. A chemometric design of experiments was employed to optimise the reaction parameters, finding that 15 molar equivalents of hydrochloric acid enable hydrolysis without inhibiting crystallisation, while acetic acid controls which phase is obtained, favouring the desired face centred cubic topology at 15 molar equivalents. The optimised conditions afford UiO-66 with high crystallinity and porosity in just 2 hours at 90 \u00b0C. A crucial role in the process is played by the monoester, which is more soluble than both the diester and the diacid in the reaction environment and is presumed to be involved in the formation of secondary building units. We also developed a DMF-free workup protocol based on the use of ethanol/dimethylsulfoxide mixtures and water. 50-fold scale up (500 mL) was demonstrated using a round bottom flask, producing UiO-66 with properties comparable to the product of the small-scale synthesis and with a space-time yield > 200 kg/(m3d).", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, provide this information, but for the simulation of IDPs dedicated protein and water force fields are needed, as traditional MD models for folded proteins prove inadequate for IDPs. Substantial effort was invested to develop IDP-specific force fields, but their performance in describing IDPs that undergo conformational changes\u2014such as those induced by molecular partner binding or changes in solution environment\u2014remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the ability of 20 MD models to accurately simulate structural and dynamic aspects of COR15A, an IDP just on the verge of folding, with a particular focus on their ability to capture subtle structural differences. We employ a two-step approach: (i) validation of short 200-ns simulations against small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, and (ii) detailed evaluation of the six best-performing MD models through extended 1.2-\u00b5s MD simulations against nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, including a single-point mutant with slightly increased helicity. Only DES-amber and ff99SBws capture helicity differences between wild-type and mutant, but ff99SBws overestimates helicity. Notably, only DES-amber adequately reproduces the COR15A dynamics, as assessed by NMR relaxation times at two different magnetic field strengths. Among the tested force fields, DES-amber emerges as the best MD model for the simulation of COR15A. Its application provides insights into its dynamic conformational landscape, albeit not perfectly reproducing all experimental data.

This task involves identifying the mechanism of the process, that can take place either adiabatically or nonadiabatically, and calculating the necessary quantities, such as vibronic couplings, according to the mechanism. Due to different electronic configurations involved, it almost becomes inevitable to use wavefunction-based multireference methods. However, the accurate prediction of rate constants for large molecular systems is limited by the high computational cost of common choices such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF). Since PCET reactions occur in a wide range of biological processes, the development of alternatives with large scalability is of particular interest. A promising alternative is the multistate density-functional theory method based on absolutely-localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs). This gives access to the diabatic donor and acceptor states, adiabatic ground and first excited states, and the electronic coupling. In this work, different operators for the construction of ALMOs are considered. A comparison with CASSCF and N-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory shows that accurate vibronic couplings can be obtained using a non-Hermitian operator. As the method relies on a fragmentation of the system, spectator fragments can be explicitly included with a convenient computational cost.

Our systematic analysis uncovers a universal pattern in EDMB formation following two or three well-defined stages, depending on the specific elements involved, that agrees with the recently published unified theory of multicenter bonding. Our unprecedented application of three local energy densities (kinetic, potential, and total) at bond critical points provides quantitative validation of the EDMB model and offers the first comprehensive explanation for the anomalous sixfold coordination in these compounds that defies the conventional 8-N rule.

Here, we combine machine-learning screening with constant-potential density functional theory simulations to systematically investigate CO dimerization on dilute CuM(100) alloys. p-Block metals, particularly Al and Ga, make the reaction exothermic and lower the activation barrier relative to pure Cu, with Al showing the highest activity.

Blood is delivered to the kidneys via the renal artery, and filtration begins at the glomerulus where small molecules pass into the nephron while larger components remain in circulation. The filtrate undergoes further refinement through selective tubular reabsorption and active secretion, culminating in urine formation. The role of the nephron in modulating drug excretion is modeled mathematically using key pharmacokinetic parameters, including the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), free drug fraction (fu), intrinsic tubular clearance, and the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC).

To this end, we present a system for performing photocatalytic reactions that combines time-resolved in situ measurements with a fully automated process for liquid handling, light source control, dynamic feedback and automated kinetic data evaluation, enabled by an open-source Python framework. The system is applied to study photocatalytic water oxidation using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as both photosensitizer and water oxidation catalyst, with oxygen formation being measured in situ. Using this benchmark reaction, we investigate the effect of different reaction parameters (catalyst and sacrificial oxidant concentration, irradiance, pH-value) on the rate of oxygen evolution. The results show that the automated process enables highly reproducible experiments while obtaining full time-concentration curves with a high temporal resolution (seconds) for each experiment. Using the obtained data we derive a chemical reaction network and rate constants to describe the detailed mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction. This kinetic model reveals an unexpected light-driven step to convert [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and water to hydrogen peroxide (which ultimately disproportionates to form oxygen) as well as two competing deactivation pathways, unimolecular and bimolecular decomposition, the latter of which is autocatalytic.

Here, we introduce the first high-throughput platform for the discovery of surface-engineered nanoparticles (SENs) that modulate enzyme function. Guided by the hypothesis that surface ligands are primary drivers of activity enhancement, we synthesized a library of 194 gold- and palladium-based SENs functionalized with diverse peptide ligands. These SENs were screened against three model enzymes: cytochrome c, lactoperoxidase (LPO), and lipase. Multiple SENs substantially increased enzymatic activity, with the most effective achieving ~19-fold increase. The resulting dataset enabled the training of a machine learning model that identified key ligand features associated with high-performing SENs, establishing a predictive framework for designing activity-enhancing NPs. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the ligand shell plays a dominant role in driving enhancement, suggesting that effective ligands identified via this approach can be readily transferred across NP platforms. To demonstrate functional relevance, we show that an optimized SEN/LPO pair outperforms LPO in inhibiting the growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria and disrupting biofilm formation.

Accordingly, LEN provides a lifesaving therapy for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multi-drug-resistant HIV-1. However, one notable shortcoming is a relatively low barrier of viral resistance to LEN. The clinical trials have identified resistance-associated mutations near the LEN binding site on HIV-1 CA including M66I, Q67H/K/N, K70R/H/N/S, N74D/H/K, A105S/T and T107N/A/C/S changes.

These findings necessitate continuing medicinal chemistry efforts to develop next-generation HIV-1 CA inhibitors against the emerging LEN resistant mutation. Here, our SAR studies have focused on the identification of LEN structural functionalities amenable to modifications and the development of a LEN analog with improved antiviral activity against the M66I mutant virus. We report a new LEN analog, KFA-027, with substantially improved antiviral activity (EC50 of ~444 nM, >20-fold) against HIV-1(M66I CA) compared to the parent LEN.

This plutonium-polyoxometalate (POM) coordination compound was crystallized as its caesium salt, Cs20[Pu(PW11O39)2]2\u00b713H2O, using microgram quantities of Pu. Single crystal XRD and solid-state UV-vis absorbance analysis confirm the stabilization of Pu4+ by the Keggin ligand. The unit cell contains two [Pu(PW11O39)2]10- complexes (Pu(PW11)2) bridged by cesium counterions. The Raman spectrum of Pu(PW11)2 reveals features consistent with those observed for the analogous tetravalent complexes with Zr4+, Hf4+, Ce4+, and Th4+. For the first coordination sphere of Pu, the average Pu-O bond distances in the two Pu sites are 2.35(3) and 2.34(3) \u00c5, matching the value extrapolated from the bonding trend based on the other 8-coordinated tetravalent cations coordinated to the Keggin POM. However, the long-range arrangement of the Pu(PW11)2 complexes within the lattice is unique in the series of MIV(PW11)2 compounds, with pairs of Pu(PW11)2 complexes organized perpendicular to each other. The aqueous speciation of Pu4+ in the presence of the POM was probed via UV-visible absorbance, coupled with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of the analogous systems Th(PW11)2, Ce(PW11)2, Hf(PW11)2, and Zr(PW11)2. The solution-state results indicate that, contrary to their trivalent counterparts, tetravalent cations quantitatively form the 1:2 species in solution (i.e., [Pu(PW11O39)2]10-(aq)) and no 1:1 species (e.g., [Pu(PW11O39)(H2O)x]3-(aq)). Finally, in the solid-state, a strong and linear correlation was found between the metal-oxygen bond distances in the MIV(PW11)2 compounds and the corresponding metal dioxides (PuO2, ThO2, CeO2, ZrO2, etc.), allowing for the extrapolation to other tetravalent ions (i.e., Pa4+, Am4+, and Bk4+).

A common strategy is to replace or remove these groups and compare the activity of the resulting analogs. If hydroxy groups are non-essential, or if their removal results in increased potency they may form the basis of improved inhibitors or substrates. In our studies of human neuraminidase enzymes (NEU), we have identified modifications at the C5 and C9 positions of the 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic (DANA) scaffold that provide potent and selective inhibitors. In this study, we sought to test the requirements of each of the four human NEU isoenzymes for the presence of O4, O7, O8, or O9 hydroxy groups found in DANA. We synthesized the corresponding mono- (4, 7, 8, and 9) and di-deoxy (7,9; 7,8; 8,9) analogs of DANA and tested their potency against human NEU. We found that 8-deoxy compounds increased potency against NEU2 and NEU3. Additionally, several di-deoxy analogs were tolerated by NEU1, NEU2, and NEU3. Finally, we generated known selective inhibitors of NEU3 and NEU4 and tested their 8-deoxy analogs. Combination of these features did not improve overall potency, suggesting deoxygenated analogs will require additional optimization.

However, significant challenges remain in the geometric regularity design, scalable and precise fabrication, stable characterization, and practical application of these structures. This study focuses on the self-assembly behavior of unsaturated water molecules under the synergistic action of interfacial confinement and an applied directional electric field. Combining molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations, we reveal a novel interfacial 2D parallelogram water lattice that can exist stably at both room temperature and cryogenic temperatures. To overcome fabrication bottlenecks, we propose a synergistic strategy employing a \"limited-quantity & confined-space dual-control method\" combined with directional electric field regulation. This strategy enables the precise and scalable preparation of 2D water/ice structures with consistent orientation and geometric order. Our findings demonstrate that under the synergistic conditions of a low-density aqueous environment, narrow-spaced interfacial confinement, and a directional electric field, water molecules spontaneously assemble into a 2D parallelogram lattice. The lattice orientation is precisely controlled by the direction of the electric field applied parallel to the interface. At room temperature, applying the electric field induces the formation of a highly ordered lattice structure; however, this orientational consistency vanishes immediately upon field removal. In contrast, at sub-ambient temperatures, the electric field induces a similarly ordered lattice, but crucially, the orientational consistency persists even after the field is withdrawn. Notably, in near-sub-ambient environments where molecular thermal motion is reduced, the formation of the ordered lattice can be achieved with a relatively small applied electric field. As the temperature decreases further, a stronger field is required to drive the ordering process. The field strength exhibits a significant negative correlation with system pressure, a universal relationship observed across both room temperature and cryogenic regimes. Increasing field strength systematically reduces the water layer thickness, clearly revealing the field-induced molecular ordering and structural densification. However, the system's total energy change is governed by competing mechanisms, including orientational energy, hydrogen-bond reconstruction energy, adsorption energy, and field-induced energy storage. This complexity results in a distinct non-monotonic thermodynamic response between the applied field voltage and the total system energy, with markedly different behaviors observed across different temperature ranges. The 2D parallelogram water lattice unveiled in this work represents a novel structure discovered under low-pressure interfacial confinement, challenging the conventional rules governing liquid water and ice phases. Its unique hydrogen-bond network and geometric arrangement not only open new perspectives for fundamental studies of physical properties but also hold breakthrough potential for technological applications. This discovery significantly enriches the knowledge base for constructing geometrically regular 2D materials based on weak interactions, extending beyond the realm of strong covalent, ionic, or metallic bonds. The \"dual-control method + directional electric field regulation\" strategy proposed herein provides a pioneering theoretical framework and experimental pathway for the scalable, controlled fabrication of 2D water/ice.

The challenge for PFAS removal is that it often requires a long time and high energy input to achieve high degradation efficiencies. This study reports a novel, ultrafast and effective method for degrading PFASs using the microdroplet technique. By forming microdroplets from PFAS solution spiked with oxidant such as sodium persulfate or Fenton\u2019s reagent, a range of PFAS compounds including short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) such as PFPeA (C4F9COOH) were quickly degraded with degradation efficiency reaching 77-94%. The microdroplet reaction was completed in less than 1 ms under ambient conditions. In contrast, without oxidant, the microdroplet degradation efficiency was 10-17%. Also, incubating PFAS with the oxidant in bulk solution for 30 min resulted in < 8% degradation efficiency. It appears that the PFAS degradation rate can be accelerated by over 2 million times in oxidant-containing microdroplets in comparison with the bulk solution. Based on measured fluoride product concentrations, our result suggests that persulfate primarily facilitates PFAS degradation via the two-carbon degradation pathway, whereas Fenton\u2019s reagent operates through the one-carbon degradation pathway.

Ruthenium-based catalysts, particularly Ru/C, are effective in hydrogenating LA to GVL but face challenges like metal leaching and catalyst degradation. To address this, researchers are improving catalyst stability through nitrogen-doped carbon supports and embedding strategies, however most of them involves tedious synthesis and expensive and non-renewable chemicals. In this work, we synthesized a stable, efficient ruthenium catalyst supported on carbon from biomass-derived chitosan without using additional nitrogen dopants, aiming to enhance its performance in LA hydrogenation. The Ru catalyst supported on N-doped carbon from chitosan pyrolysis at 700 \u00b0C, exhibited superior activity, stability, and recyclability for LA hydrogenation to GVL, outperforming conventional Ru/C and shows comparable activity with other reported Ru catalysts. Characterization by XPS and H\u2082-TPR revealed strong metal-support interactions facilitated by nitrogen functionalities, which stabilized ruthenium species in both reduced and oxidized states. Graphitic nitrogen species in the catalyst were decisive in the controlling the catalytic activity also maintaining a fine balnace between different nitrogen species and N-content was the key to synthesize suitable supports from chitosan. A proposed reaction mechanism highlights the role of Ru-N centers in facilitating hydrogen and LA activation and hydrogenation step, with basic nitrogen sites (pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen) aiding in the dehydration step to form GVL.

One approach is the use of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) degraders, which induce the formation of ternary complexes between the target protein and E3 ligase, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of the target protein. Understanding the conformational behavior of PROTACs in solutions and how it relates to their pharmacokinetic properties is crucial for optimizing PROTAC design and efficacy. Due to the large size and flexibility of PROTACs and their chameleonic character, it is essential to understand their conformational ensembles, and how they depend on the environment, rather than considering a single structure. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for exploring PROTAC conformational behavior using atomistic simulations. We employ the enhanced sampling method parallel bias metadynamics, where we bias generic local collective variables, specifically all rotatable dihedral angles, thereby avoiding the considerable challenge of identifying suitable global collective variables for biasing. The methodology allows for obtaining free energy surfaces of global CVs via reweighting, thus giving valuable insight into the conformational ensemble. We apply the method to the prototypical case of the MZ1 PROTAC degrader, which targets bromodomain-containing protein-4 (BRD4) for degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase, and elucidate its conformational behavior in different solvents, allowing us to gain insights into the chameleonic property of MZ1. Our results confirm that MZ1 adopts distinct conformations depending on the solvent, exhibiting collapsed conformations in water and chloroform, and extended conformations in DMSO. The observations of collapsed conformations in chloroform are notable, as chloroform mimics the hydrophobic membrane environment, and the propensity to adopt collapsed conformations in chloroform has been correlated to increased cell permeability, indicating that MZ1 can transition into conformations suitable for membrane penetration in apolar environments. Our methodological framework is generally applicable to large flexible molecules like PROTACs, and the results demonstrate its efficiency, laying the groundwork for similar investigations for other PROTACs and other \"beyond-rule-of-5\" drug candidates.

In addition to the distortion of the coordination geometry and enhancement of interactions in the secondary sphere,  reducing the size of the interlocked rings and increasing the steric hindrance of the exocyclic substituents are both found to suppress the opening of the Cu(I) coordination sphere, thus leading to a slower ligand exchange rate in both associative and dissociative exchange, which in turn affects chemical reactivity of the metal in which a substantial opening of the primary sphere is required. These detail understandings of the relationship between structures of the catenane ligand and the coordination properties and chemical reactivity thus form the basis of rational design of new metal complexes featuring the unique properties from mechanical bond for diverse applications.", "date": "2025-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Ligands (Inorg.); Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In particular, post-transition state bifurcations (PTSB) are increasingly observed in pathways relevant for the synthesis of complex chemical structures. In these reactions, the pathway bifurcates after a single transition structure (TS), resulting in a distribution of two distinct products. Recognizing the presence of PTSB in chemical reactions is crucial for predicting reaction outcomes. This importance stems from the need to move away from the conventional one-dimensional view of reaction pathways. We investigate the Cope rearrangement of 3,4-divinylcyclobut-1-ene, a versatile scaffold used in the synthesis of natural products. While this rearrangement was previously thought to proceed via a single pathway based on DFT calculations, our complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approach has uncovered a PTSB in this pathway. This is due to the presence of a Woodward-Hoffmann (WH) forbidden 8\u03c0 electrocyclization, which alters the PES, producing a TS similar in energy to the Cope TS. Our findings emphasize the importance of multi-reference methods and the role of forbidden WH pathways in this well-studied class of reactions, providing new insights into the selectivity between different products in the Cope rearrangement.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

HF densities are known to greatly reduce or overcorrect the charge-delocalization error associated with semi-local functionals. Over the last decade, this Hartree-Fock density functional theory (HF-DFT) has been systematized as density corrected DFT (DC-DFT), demonstrating remarkable success: improved chemical barrier heights, near chemical accuracy in water cluster binding energies, highly accurate interaction energies for halogenand chalcogen bonded systems, and more. For reaction barriers and water clusters, some of us found earlier that HFDFT works, not because the HF density is accurate but because of cancellation of negative functional-driven error (FE) by positive density-driven error (DE). In this work, we present evidence that interaction energy errors in halogen and chalcogen bonded molecular complexes in the B30 data set are not primarily driven by density errors, and that the success of HF-DFT for these weakly bonded molecular complexes results from a similar cancellation of FE by DE. Our benchmark Kohn-Sham inversion of the coupled cluster densities for NH3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7ClF, Cl\u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7SF2 and Cl\u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7SCF2 presents strong evidence for this error cancellation. For most of the complexes, we employ proxies for the electron transfer in the exact density: the LC\u03c9PBE long-range-corrected hybrid and the r2SCAN50 global hybrid. We further investigate several self-interaction correction (SIC) methods for these weakly bonded systems, finding significant improvement from FLOSIC.

The mechanism was found to be hierarchical in nature and the spatial hierarchy of fusing molecular clusters was preserved in the final assembled state. Time-dependent analysis of intermolecular interactions revealed that the aggregation started with sidechain phenyl group contacts, mediated by the hydrophobic effect, eventually giving rise to a complex combination of interactions involving specific patterns of peptide-peptide hydrogen bonding.

Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to analyze the free energy and electronic structure of these catalysts, systematically investigating the impact of curvature on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of M-(n,n)NC single-atom site catalysts. Through the systematic evaluation of the catalytic performance, 12 high-performance M-(n,n)NC catalysts were identified, namely Rh-(n,n)NC (n = 5~10), Fe-(n,n)NC (n = 6~10), and Co-(5,5)NC. Among them, five Fe-(n,n)NC (n = 6~10) catalysts with high catalytic activity and lower metal costs are recommended as the preferred candidates for OER catalysts. Electronic structure analysis reveals that curvature induces splitting and energy level shifts in the metal d orbitals, which exhibit a certain regularity corresponding to the systematic variation in curvature. The selective coupling of oxygen-containing intermediates (O, OH, OOH) with the metal d orbitals in M-(n,n)NC catalysts is also modulated by curvature, further influencing the adsorption capacity of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface. Consequently, M-(n,n)NC catalysts with different curvatures exhibit distinct trends in catalytic performance. Furthermore, this study investigated the correlation between the metal z-direction-related d-orbitals (dz2, dzy, and dzx) and catalytic performance, revealing that the spin-down dzy band center value can serve as a simple descriptor for M-(n,n)NC catalysts.

Our EMLE model is first applied to the natural Diels-Alderase AbyU, showing that it correctly differentiates the catalytic action on different enzyme-substrate conformations.

Using higher energy activation methods, like 193 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD), offers the potential to cause more extensive fragmentation of large proteins and thereby yield greater sequence coverage. Obtaining high sequence coverage requires confident identification and assignment of fragment ions, and this process is hampered by spectral congestion and low S/N of the fragment ions.  Here we explore the use of charge reduction methods to produce lower charge states of large proteins to increase ion accumulation and fragment ions, ones that are naturally dispersed in the m/z domain to alleviate spectral congestion. UVPD of low charge states of enolase (47 kDa) and PRN-1 (63 kDa) resulted in sequence coverages as high as 47% (24+ charge state of enolase) and 23% (32+ of PRN-1) in comparison  to 17% (55+ charge state of enolase) and 9% (55+ charge state of PRN-1) obtained for standard high charge states. Proton transfer charge reduction (PTCR) reactions were performed to further disperse fragment ions in the m/z domain and enhance identification. When employing PTCR after UVPD, sequence coverage was maximized for the highest charge states for enolase (55+, 67%) and PRN-1 (55+, 34%), confirming that charge reduction of fragment ions had a more notable impact on outcomes than charge reduction of precursor ions. Sequence coverages were increased further by combining results from electron transfer higher energy collision dissociation (EThcD) and UVPD (85% coverage for enolase and 52% coverage for PRN-1), bolstering the use of complementary MS/MS methods to yield greater dividends for top-down analysis of larger proteins.", "date": "2025-07-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Organic TADF emitters often feature donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A) architectures, where molecular conformation critically influences emission dynamics and efficiency. Introducing intramolecular hydrogen-bonding between D and A moieties is an emerging strategy to rigidify the structure and improving TADF emission. However the influence of environmental factors on such hydrogen-bonding interactions remains unclear. Here we investigate the impact of hydrogen-bonding medium on TADF emission using steady-state and time-resolved emission spectroscopy. Protic solvents quench TADF emission significantly, correlating with reduced prompt emission lifetimes, while delayed lifetimes remain unchanged. Ultrafast studies reveal a picosecond D-to-A intramolecular charge transfer event that slows in viscous media indicating a D-A torsional relaxation. The relaxation time further slows in protic environment highlighting the role of solvent-chromophore hydrogen-bonding interaction resulting in unfavourable excited state D-A conformations and diminished emission.

An antimicrobial mouthwash must therefore serve two opposing purposes. On the one hand, it must prevent the overgrowth of microbes, especially pathogenic bacteria, that is, it must kill these microbes. On the other hand, it has to maintain a renewable oral flora of useful bacteria, and for this you have to save at least some of these bacteria. According to published experimental data, which are cited in this article, mouthwash based on pure chlorine dioxide has proven to be able to do this. In our series of articles, we examine what models/mechanisms can explain that mouthwash containing pure chlorine dioxide is able to meet these seemingly contradictory requirements. In addition to reviewing the literature data, we also raise rational hypotheses, which will have to be verified with further scientific and clinical studies in the future. \nIn the first part of our series, we give a general overview of the experimental results published so far, as well as the possible mechanisms of the selectivity of chlorine dioxide. Based on experimental data and theoretical considerations, we point out that pure chlorine dioxide mouthwash has practically no effect on the mucous membrane, but it does affect the bacterial flora of the oral cavity. According to published data, a significant proportion of bacteria survive oral rinses, and rinsing kills pathogenic microbes more effectively than others. The latter can be explained by colonization resistance. Then, with the help of a model calculation based on the diffusion of ClO2 in plaque, we show that the majority of dental plaque bacteria cannot survive a 15-second mouth rinse with mouthwash containing 15 ppm ClO2. In other words, although the survival of a significant proportion of bacteria is obviously enabled by an oral biofilm, dental plaque cannot do so.

Atmospheric molecular clusters are important intermediates in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). The evaporation rate of clusters can be calculated using quantum chemical methods, with an exponential dependence on the free energy. Hence, for simulating accurate NPF rates, high-accuracy calculations are needed. We have constructed a versatile benchmark set 218 conformers of atmospheric molecular dimer clusters consisting of sulfuric acid (SA), formic acid (FA), nitric acid (NA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), water (W), ammonia (AM), methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA), and ethylenediamine (EDA) molecules. Using this testset, we benchmark the local coupled cluster methods, DLPNO- CCSD(T0) and LNO-CCSD(T), using different basis sets and locality settings, and test extrapolation procedures to the complete basis set (CBS), local approximation free (LAF), and complete PNO space (CPS) limits. The extrapolations are tested against the binding energies of high-level CCSD(F12*)(T+)/cc-pVTZ-F12 reference calculations. We find that the LNO-CCSD(T) methods offer a better accuracy-to-cost ratio for atmospheric molecular clusters than the usually employed DLPNO-CCSD(T0) method. Furthermore, the CBS limit extrapolation using the aug-cc-pVTZ and aug- cc-pVQZ basis sets should be readily attainable for the LNO-CCSD(T) method on the usually studied cluster sizes (4\u20138 monomers). Simulating the new particle formation rate of the (SA)1\u22124 (AM)1\u22124 and (SA)1\u22124 (DMA)1\u22124 systems using the Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code, we find an increased sensi- tivity to the locality settings for larger clusters, but the basis set error is still the most dominant. Hence, simulated cluster formation rates would benefit from doing LAF extrapolation. Finally, we illustrate the calculations of LNO-CCSD(T)/CBS binding energies of a large (SA)15 (TMA)15 cluster (300 atoms).

Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used as the backbone, with abundant dangling hy-droxy groups on every other carbon-carbon bond. The alkoxide was formed from the hydroxy groups by potas-sium hydroxide with the aid of azeotrope distillation, where the pyrophoric organometallic base was avoided during deprotonation. The composition of bottlebrush polymer PVA-g-PEO was adjusted by changing the backbone choice, reaction time, and the feed ratios of both side chain monomer and initiator with respect to the backbone. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure analysis investigated the anionic grafting-from mechanism in bottlebrush polymer. Thanks to the direct linkage of grafting sites to the backbone, the hydroxy proton showed distinguishable chemical shifts before and after grafting. After grafting, the residual hydroxy proton signal on the backbone implied an unfavorable anionic initiation in the isotactic tacticity seg-ment due to the spatial anion repulsion. By repeatedly initiating the synthesis of bottlebrush polymers, the grafting percentage increased, indicating that the grafting-from process was no longer hindered in isotactic segments due to the more spread-out distribution of initiation sites caused by the extended side chains.

Our approach automatically determines a finite number of relaxation processes and their parameters directly from experimental data, yielding parsimonious representations that naturally suppress artifacts. The method performs unsupervised deconvolution while providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for the DRT itself and its underlying parameters through Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling.

To address this challenge, we herein engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) with varying nick numbers, and established a positive correlation between nick number and the sensitivity to ROS-induced degradation of DONs. Building on this premise, we developed ROS sensitivity-programmed DNA origami sensors (DOSs) by orthogonally assembling targeting and signal modules with DONs.

Broad analytical assessments that are capable of bridging disparate length scales, unifying  equilibrium isotherm types and identifying interaction mechanisms remain elusive.  To this end, the study herein provides a unified model and benchmark to explain wide ranging observations of water in carbon micropores.

In this study, we first propose a molecular design strategy that introduces expanded free space within aggregates to enhance nonradiative decay and maximize the photothermal efficacy (PCE).

However, scaling SLED to industrially relevant rates remains challenging due to the onset of inertial effects at higher flow conditions, which disrupt electrostatic steering and lead to non-uniform deposition. In this work, we demonstrate that high-flow electrospray emitters can maintain SLED behavior up to ~5\u202fmL/h per tip, achieving over an order of magnitude increase in throughput compared to traditional needle-based systems. At these flow rates, PMMA coatings exhibit asymptotic thicknesses near 4\u20135\u202f\u00b5m, and complex 3D objects can be conformally coated in under two hours. Beyond this regime, deposition patterns become increasingly anisotropic, forming bullseye profiles and uncoated zones due to momentum-dominated droplet behavior. To counteract this, we apply a secondary bias to the spray target, which reduces the local electric field and mitigates inertial overshoot. This approach significantly improves coating uniformity and restores SLED-like behavior even at total flow rates up to 12\u201315\u202fmL/h. Both simulation and experimental results confirm that electric field shaping via secondary biasing provides a scalable and effective method to suppress inertial effects.

One fluidic approach involves creating extensional flow using constrictions. Transient relaxation of deformed droplets is then measured at the constriction exit.  We propose an alternative, arguably simpler approach: we use steady deformation within a constriction to measure surface tension. We calculate surface tension using Taylor's small deformation theory, which describes the relationship between droplet deformation and the Capillary number, or ratio of applied viscous stress to restoring surface tension stress.  Taylor originally developed his theory for unconfined droplets in pure shear or pure extension.  We apply Taylor\u2019s theory to droplets in pressure driven flows. We generate and flow emulsion droplets through a series of increasingly narrow constrictions and use steady deformation to measure surface tension.  We investigate both water-in-oil and oil-in-water droplets, stabilized by three different surfactants over a range of concentrations.  In a subset of experiments, we vary the viscosity ratio by adding polyethylene glycol diacrylate to water droplets. Validation using both the transient deformation fluidic approach and pendant drop measurements on individual droplets demonstrates the viability of Taylor\u2019s theory in regimes beyond those originally proposed.  Importantly, our results suggest steady state deformation in pressure driven flows can be used to measure surface tension even when droplets are slightly confined.

NH4NO3 is produced by the Haber-Bosch process (which converts elemental nitrogen to ammonia), followed by the Ostwald process (which converts ammonia to nitric acid). These thermal catalytic processes are estimated to contribute approximately 2 % of the global annual energy demand. In contrast, photocatalysis is a promising alternative for the direct conversion of nitrogen into nitrogen-containing compounds under mild reaction conditions. However, using photocatalysis for the simultaneous production of ammonium and nitrate in one reactor ( so-called overall nitrogen fixation) is still challenging. Herein, we report a proof-of-principle study that demonstrates the direct gas-phase photocatalytic conversion of elemental nitrogen into ammonium nitrate. As a heterogeneous photocatalyst, we used cobalt-containing polyoxometalate Na10[Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2] deposited on commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25). UV-light irradiation of a gaseous mixture of nitrogen (N-source), water (proton source), and oxygen (oxidant) at 150 \u00b0C resulted in the simultaneous production of ammonium and nitrate, as well as a minor amount of nitrite.

Aggregation proceeds via autocatalytic, thermodynamically favored pathways. Yet in living systems, dynamic, active regulation and compartmentalization\u2014such as in biomolecular condensates\u2014can suppress or delay such irreversible assembly. Inspired by this, we describe a peptide that exhibits pathway-dependent self-assembly into either amyloid-like fibers or fuel-driven, active, simple coacervate droplets. The peptide was designed to undergo chemical activation via a carbodiimide-driven reaction cycle, which transiently neutralizes its overall charge and promotes droplet formation. In the absence of fuel, the peptide slowly self-assembles into stable fibers through an autocatalytic process resembling amyloid aging. However, upon repeated or continuous fueling, the peptide forms dynamic, active droplets that persist for days and remain resistant to fiber formation. Therefore, we demonstrate that the fuel-driven active state can completely suppress fiber nucleation and growth. Only upon removal of the fuel the droplets dissolve, and fiber formation resumes. These findings demonstrate that the constant turnover of peptides through activation and deactivation can act as a kinetic sink, sequestering peptides and delaying the transition to the thermodynamically favored fiber state. Our results establish a minimal, chemically controlled system in which phase behavior and aging can be modulated by energy input.

However, there is strong experimental evidence that there are mesoscale clusters present in bulk solutions and there are also recent predictions from molecular simulations indicating nanoscale heterogeneity at solution interfaces. In this work, we investigate glycine concentration enhancement in undersaturated aqueous solutions at solid interfaces using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and surface plasmon spectroscopy (SPR) measurements. MD simulations predicted a strong concentration enhancement in a nanoscale region of a slightly undersaturated aqueous glycine solution in the vicinity of a Lennard-Jones solid wall representing dispersion interactions of the solid surface with solution molecules. SPR measurements showed for the first time direct experimental evidence of a strong concentration enhancement in the same glycine solution for both gold and polystyrene interfaces. These experiments were also carried out over a series of more dilute concentrations and there was both a clear concentration enhancement observed under all conditions and a difference in the dependence on concentration for the two interfaces investigated. We attribute the interfacial enhancement effect to non-specific dispersion (van der Waals) interactions between solution components and surfaces in contact with solutions. As such interactions are omnipresent in solutions and interfaces, we expect interface-induced concentration enhancement to be a generic phenomenon in liquid solutions, which is likely to have profound effects on interfacial processes, such as heterogeneous nucleation or catalysis.

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate two azobenzene-based 5\u2013HT2A receptor ligands differing only by a methoxy substituent position (para\u2013 vs meta\u2013methoxy). Compound 1 (para\u2013methoxy) switches from acting as a weak antagonist (trans) to a moderate agonist (cis), whereas compound 2 (meta-methoxy) maintains agonist activity in both forms, with cis-2 exhibiting the highest efficacy. Our simulations indicate that the key determinant of these efficacy differences lies in the vertical depth of ligand insertion into the orthosteric binding pocket. The para\u2013methoxy moiety of trans\u20131 forms hydrogen bonds with Asp2315.35 and Thr1603.37, anchoring the ligand deeper than typical tryptamine agonists and preventing engagement with activation-critical residues, thereby stabilizing the inactive receptor.

In the active receptor, cis\u20132 forms a persistent Thr1603.37 hydrogen bond that allows deeper penetration between TM4 and TM5, whereas cis\u20131\u2019s para\u2013methoxy causes steric hindrances limiting this interaction.

Here, we developed photoaffinity acetylated histone probes based on differentially acetylated H2A.Z isoforms I and II with an N-terminal diazirine and a C-terminal biotin tag for covalently capturing and enriching BPTF and new interactors. Photocrosslinking experiments followed by SDS-PAGE revealed that recombinant BPTF bromodomain (BPTF BD) directly interacts with both isoforms of H2A.Z in an affinity-dependent and acetyl-lysine binding pocket-specific manner.

Mono- and diacetylation were the predominant acetylation patterns identified with patterns containing acetylation sites K4ac, K7ac, K11ac, and K15ac.

Out-of-plane displacement coupled with oxidative adsorption generally lowers orbital splitting, favoring high-spin states for 3d elements, and in turn strengthens the adsorption of reaction intermediates. SACs can be classified into three categories preferring large, medium, and small displacements based on their d-electron count, with medium displacement leading to spin crossover.

Batch adsorption experiments assessed the influence of saponin structures, sorbent properties and environmental factors. All saponins exhibited unexpectedly strong sorption (Kd> 10\u00b3 L/kg in topsoil), with \u03b1-hederin showing the highest affinity (Kd = 229\u00d710\u00b3 L/kg on goethite), attributed to its moderate hydrophobicity (log Kow ~4.4), short sugar chain, and -COOH/-OH interactions. In contrast, the bulkier, more polar hederacoside C (log Kow ~ \u20131.2) showed weaker sorption. Sorption isotherms followed Freundlich behavior and was enhanced at acidic pH (~50% increase) for \u03b1-hederin and hederacolchiside A1 due to protonation of carboxylic acid groups (pKa ~4.7\u20134.9), while hederacoside C (pKa ~12.5) remained unaffected. Salt and fulvic acid reduced \u03b1-hederin adsorption (up to 80%), likely due to ion exchange and competitive complexation. Desorption studies showed \u03b1-hederin was strongly retained (<20% desorption), particularly on metal oxides. Scenario-based modeling indicates that under realistic application (50 \u03bcM), \u03b1-hederin and hederacolchiside A1 remain largely immobile, while hederacoside C may leach in low-sorption soils.

To address these challenges, we systematically test quantum chemical methods, including multireference (MR) approaches, domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster theory (DLPNO-CCSD(T)), and density functional theory (DFT). The initial C--H bond-breaking transition state requires MR treatment due to its multireference character, while subsequent steps permit efficient single-reference calculations. For the rate-limiting C--H activation step mediated by the vanadyl moiety, complete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) yields an apparent activation barrier ($E^{\\text{600K}}_{\\text{app}}$) of 138 kJ/mol, consistent with experimental values (134 $\\pm$ 4 kJ/mol; Gruene et al. \\textit{Catal.

While the formation of polarons \u2013 quasiparticles formed by electron/hole interactions with lattice vibrations \u2013 is a proposed trapping mechanism, direct evidence of such states has been elusive. Here, we use potential dependent transient absorption spectroscopy to identify the coherent phonon mode and strong carrier-phonon coupling responsible for hole small polaron formation after band-gap excitation and identify the three underlying d-d transitions which are strongly modulated by this phonon. The equilibrium geometry of hole small polarons in \u03b1-hematite is displaced from the ground state geometry along the vibrational coordinate of a symmetric A1g Fe-O stretching motion at 225 \u00b1 7 cm-1, with a lifetime of 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 ps.  Our comparative ex-situ and in-situ experiments reveal that the energy and coherence lifetime of the A1g mode is remarkably resilient to applied potential and the addition of an Al2O3 overlayer, but the coherence lifetime is sensitive to substrate identity.  This potential-dependent transient absorption approach establishes a powerful platform for directly probing polaron dynamics in photoelectrochemical systems, opening new pathways to rationally design modified hematite and other transition metal oxide electrodes with enhanced charge transport properties for more efficient solar water splitting.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For the first time, we systematically examine how concentrated electrolyte affects the thermodynamics of TM electrodeposition by combining experimental, theoretical, and computational methods. Our study revealed that the electrodeposition potential (Eeq) of a wide range of TMs (Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn) is strongly dependent on electrolyte concentration. The classical thermodynamic model, the Nernst equation, cannot quantify such concentration dependence due to its neglect of metal-anion complexation, a unique structural feature of concentrated aqueous electrolytes of TM ions due to their strong cation-anion interaction. By examining the energy landscape of the electrodeposition reaction and the complex formation equilibria, we derived a chemistry-agonistic physical model that successfully predicts Eeq in a wide range of concentrated electrolytes and for representative TMs. A unified thermodynamic framework of metal deposition is proposed by generalizing our model, which reduces to previously proposed models under limiting conditions and covers electrodeposition from dilute electrolyte to molten salt electrolyte.

This phenomenon remains a longstanding challenge for multielectron, multiproton reactions including the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), which generally requires large overpotentials for ammonia production (\u03b7_NO3/NH3 ) > 1.5 V). Thus, strategies to lower \u03b7_NO3/NH3 while increasing TOF are needed for more energy-efficient NO3RR. In this study, we investigate the molecular electrocatalyst [CoIII(DIM)Br2]ClO4 (DIM = 2,3-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-1,3-diene), which selectivity catalyzes NO3RR to NH3. Through electroanalytical studies, we demonstrate that electrolyte pH and counteranion concentration can be synergistically tuned to lower \u03b7_NO3/NH3 (up to 0.50 V) while increasing TOF (up to 5.2x).

While van der Waals interactions primarily drive the stacking behavior, electrostatic contributions unique to each substituent modulate its extent. Furthermore, we find that in highly symmetric lattice backbones, small substituent changes have minimal effect on electronic structure, whereas symmetry-breaking functionalization offers a robust and effective route to tune electronic, transport, and photophysical properties.

These phenomena often involve an ensemble of transient, irregular, and heterogeneous surface structures and require sampling a broader set of accessible configurations. Still, even this expanded view can fall short when the system is far from the thermodynamic equilibrium picture. This perspective reviews the growing body of experimental and computational evidence for such non-equilibrium restructuring phenomena. We categorize the scenarios where the system can be stranded, kinetically trapped in metastable regimes and never thermalize, as well as their physical origins. The restructuring arises not only from the intrinsic dynamics of the catalyst but also from the complex interplay with interfacial species, spawning a zoo of restructuring pathways of various chemical nature, sizes, and time scales. To meet the growing complexity, we outline promising directions in computational chemistry, machine learning, and integration with experiments. We call for a shift in perspective: to embrace complexity as a defining feature of catalysis, to not shy away from its inherent messiness, and to revisit deactivated or failed catalysts not as dead ends, but as rich, underexplored gold mines of mechanistic insight.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This concept has led to observations such as magneto-chiral dichroism and chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, being small, these effects often require additional amplification procedures such as flow chemistry to achieve bulk enantioseparation. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnetic field effect on photogenerated radical pairs, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry, can be harnessed for enantiopurification. Fundamental to this process is the collective decay of the singlet and triplet radical-pair states made possible by an applied magnetic field. Because opposite enantiomers exhibit spin-orbit coupling matrix elements of opposite signs, the singlet and triplet decay channels interfere constructively in one enantiomer. Meanwhile, molecules of the other enantiomer are funnelled into the first enantiomer through excited-state chirality inversion, achieving chiral resolution. Using an axially chiral binaphthyl derivative and a borane photosensitiser as prototype, we predict an appreciable enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 90% to be possible at steady state, attained within hundreds of milliseconds when irradiated by a laser. Importantly, our analytical results showcase regimes of perfect enantioselectivity (100% e.e.), accessible by further chemical optimisation of the photosensitiser for which general strategies are discussed.

As demand for REEs surges, scalable extraction strategies that operate effectively in ultra-dilute concentration regimes, such as those found in produced water, mine tailings, and geothermal brines, are essential for unlocking new domestic and unconventional sources of critical minerals. Magnetic fields have been largely dismissed as too weak to drive selective and sustained ion transport in solution in the absence of other chemical and electrochemical forces. Here, we demonstrate that inhomogeneous magnetic field gradients alone, without applied electric fields, induce long-range, directed transport and spatial redistribution of solvated lanthanide ions. High-resolution Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometry reveals the emergence of concentration waves and sustained ion enrichment, uncovering a dynamic force balance between magnetic drift and other forces in solution. These spatiotemporal observations are supported by a modified Poisson\u2013Nernst\u2013Planck (PNP) model that incorporates magnetic drift, standard diffusion, and charge imbalance forces. Such magnetically driven non-equilibrium mechanism elevates near-surface concentrations to 3\u20134 times above bulk values, forming condensed ionic domains that not only shift the local electrochemical potential of paramagnetic species but also trigger crystallization of well-defined dysprosium oxalate crystals at the magnetized interface. These newly observed phenomena unlock a powerful, field-responsive strategy for actively sculpting interfacial energetics, expanding beyond traditional chemical functionalization and opening new avenues for controlling ionic behavior at the nanoscale. Furthermore, a conservative technoeconomic analysis suggests that these inhomogeneous field based passive magnetic separation can significantly reduce energy and chemical costs for paramagnetic REEs compared to conventional methods, offering a scalable and sustainable platform for critical metal recovery from complex feedstocks.", "date": "2025-07-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Magnetic Materials; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we unveil the crucial role of PdAu/CeO2 catalysts in enabling selective methane transformation under mild conditions, using only water as the sole oxidant. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including XPS and catalytic testing, alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that a Pd0.3Au0.7/CeO2 catalyst, which predominantly exposes isolated Pd atoms, achieves remarkable methanol selectivity (~80%) at 500 K with a 1:1 methane-to-water ratio. While Pd/CeO2 efficiently activates methane, its tendency for overreaction leads to complete methanol decomposition, thereby limiting selectivity. Alloying Pd with Au on ceria mitigates this over-reactivity, preventing methanol degradation while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity. The PdAu/CeO\u2082 composite exhibits a synergistic effect: Pd in contact with the ceria support facilitates methane activation and water dissociation, while Au fine-tunes reactivity to promote methanol formation. DFT calculations confirm that isolated Pd sites at the PdAu/CeO2 interface play a key role in balancing activity and selectivity. This work underscores the importance of alloy/oxide interfaces in controlling selective methane conversion with water and offers valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis.

This study investigates the photophysical, electronic structure, excited state dynamics, and skin cancer cell photodynamic and inhibitory properties of 5-(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)-6-azauridine (PTAU). PTAU absorbs up to 425 nm and demonstrates dual photophysical characteristics, with fluorescence and singlet oxygen quantum yields of 43 \u00b1 1% and 52 \u00b1 2% in acetonitrile, and 12 \u00b1 1% and 33 \u00b1 2% in aqueous buffer, respectively.

While most applications of MLIPs have focused on small molecules, extending their accuracy and transferability to predict condensed-phase properties of liquids remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a novel framework for constructing transferable and data-efficient force fields for organic liquids using a dual-space active learning (AL) strategy. This approach enables an efficient AL workflow across both configurational and chemical space by coupling a query-by-committee method with an explicitly constructed target chemical space, generated using computationally inexpensive classical methods. Our approach employs a Euclidean transformer architecture to train the Neural Network Potential for Liquid Simulations (NPLS). As a proof of concept, we target the complete alkane family and train NPLS using high-level DFT data. The resulting model is rigorously benchmarked against experimental measurements, the state-of-the-art MLIP and widely-used classical force field across thermodynamic, dynamic, and phase transition properties. Instead of emphasizing model transferability across chemical elements in the periodic table, we highlight the importance of transferability across thermodynamic states. Remarkably, the NPLS model exhibits strong generalization across a broad range of temperatures and pressures, accurately capturing liquid\u2013solid phase transitions and enabling stable simulations of the derived polymers. However, systematic deviations, particularly in predicted liquid densities, arise from the neglect of nuclear quantum fluctuations (NQF) in classical MD. To address this, we perform path-integral MD (PIMD) simulations incorporating NQF, which significantly improve agreement with experiments. The resulting NPLS-PIMD predictions outperform those from OPLS-AA force fields in accuracy.

Here, we introduce a facile method that exploits the facile electroreduction of 4-nitrobenzodiazonium tetrafluoroborate to generate aryl radicals and initiate a radical chain reaction that enables the grafting of vinylic-terminated organosilicon compounds.

The writing action relies on the formation of the host:guest supramolecular adduct between the macrocycles and the components/constituents. The dynamic condensation reaction reads each action and changes the expression of the imines accordingly, giving a specific constitutional pattern. The strength of the up-regulating or down-regulating effect can be tuned depending on the supramolecular match between the guests and the microenvironments provided by the different macrocycles. Addition of an external scavenger that is a better fit for the host erases the action and reestablishes the initial equilibrium state, regulating the whole process.

However, the molecular details governing this network remain largely inaccessible to direct experimental observation. In this work, we construct a comprehensive first-principles model of the PSII supercomplex C2S2M2, based on quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, to investigate excitation energy transfer dynamics under both low- and high-light conditions. Our results show that efficient energy funneling to the RCs is mediated by two primary energy transfer pathways, which involve the terminal emitter domains of each antenna complex and span the two PSII monomers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of more than two quenching sites per RC is necessary to shift PSII into a photoprotective regime under high-light conditions.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry; Quasiparticles and Excitations", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Conventional electrolysis, currently used in industrial aminopyralid electrosyn-thesis processes, suffers from structural degradation of the Ag catalyst and the in situ formation of reac-tive species (ClO\u207b, NH\u2083, NO\u2082\u207b), leading to reduced product yields (<30%) and increased side-product formation.

Detailed Density Functional Theory computational work and extensive  experimental studies support a mechanism with homolytic aromatic substitution character, wherein electrophilic attack of the arene  system initiates N-C bond formation, but use of electrons from the Mo\u2261N triple bond completes the bond formation through an open-shell singlet transition state that formally reduces the metal center to Mo(V) and imbues the arene ring with significant radical character. This transition state is enthalpically 15 kcal mol-1 lower in energy than the classical \u201cWheland-type\u201d transition state common to electrophilic aromatic substitution paths proposed in related systems. Subsequent intramolecular transfer of the arene hydrogen to the imido nitrogen atom leads to the cationic Mo(IV) anilido complex [[ArMoIV]-NHPh]+, which rapidily reacts with available [[ArMoVI]\u2261N]+ by a proton-coupled electron transfer step to generate the observed 1 : 1 mixture of imido products [[ArMo(V)]=NR]+ (R = H; PhX, X = H, o,m,p-F). This second phase of the mechanism is also supported computationally and by an experimental crossover experiment and is driven by significant coordination-induced bond weakening (CIBW) in the N-H bond of the [[ArMoIV]-NHPh]+ and the lack of CIBW in the imido N-H product. The novel mechanism of C-H addition to the electrophilic terminal nitrido opens new low energy pathways for the development of systems capable of catalytic nitrogen atom transfer to C-H bonds.

Despite co-immobilization on the same support, the flavin induces premature ADH inactivation during discontinuous use of the heterogeneous hybrid catalyst.

While BODIPYs inherently generate ROS and act as photosensitizers, few studies have explored combining their photouncaging capability with photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we developed novel meso-methyl-BODIPY conjugates of the DNA alkylator Boc-seco-CBI and the multikinase inhibitor cabozantinib derivative, activated by green or red light. To enhance photodecaging efficiency of conjugates, heavy atoms (Br, I) were introduced, and the boron atom was alkylated. The synthesized compounds were characterized for key photophysical and photochemical properties, including quantum yields of singlet oxygen generation, fluorescence, photolysis and cytostatic release. It was shown, that green-light irradiation of halogenated Boc-seco-CBI conjugates enabled rapid cytostatic release (<1 min), though with modest drug yields due to competing photodegradation. However, efficient uncaging of the cytostatic from the BODIPY-cabozantinib conjugate was achieved only after extended photoirradiation (~80 min) with red light. In vitro evaluation using tumor (MDA-MB-231, A431) and normal (HEK293) cell lines with various EGFR/c-Met expression demonstrated that the BODIPY-cabozantinib conjugate exhibited predominant photosensitizing effects, with minimal cytostatic contribution. During this study, we encountered significant synthetic challenges in developing red-light-absorbing conjugates, coupled with their photodegradation under prolonged irradiation.

Numerous studies have added mechanistic insights from first-principles; however, they have generally been limited to analyzing kinetics in acid.  \nHere, we use constant-potential DFT coupled with Gaussian process-based transition state search to compile microkinetic models for alkaline HER. Accounting for both non-Nernstian effects and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, we reproduce experimental activity trends, as well as outliers in the conventional volcano. Relating activities to descriptors, we find that both refining the traditional descriptor with catalyst surface charge information and applying the H binding strength in the (generally) unfavorable top-site exhibit largely improved predictive power for exchange current densities.  This stems from their ability to capture trends in the kinetics of electrochemical hydrogen adsorption, the rate-limiting step on all investigated surfaces, as a consequence of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.  However, these descriptors are not applicable in predicting trends in the kinetics of non-electrochemical H2-desorption, which instead follow the difference in binding strengths between fcc- and top-sites and an effective electronic coupling term.\nCombining all identified descriptors, we define novel activity volcanoes, which can aid screening for abundant and active HER catalysts.

In this study, we developed a Brownian dynamics simulation (BDS) model incorporating optical gradient forces, optical dissipative forces, and thermophoretic forces to evaluate optothermal trapping of polystyrene nanoparticles in water containing polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000), induced by a focused near-infrared laser beam. The addition of PEG 6000 to water reverses the transport direction, causing thermophoresis from cold to hot and helping trap particles at the laser focus. In our simulations, we focused on the trapping behavior of nanoparticles under two laser wavelengths: 1064 nm and 1560 nm. Their markedly different absorption in water alters the balance between optical and thermophoretic forces. At the laser wavelength of 1560 nm, the high absorption coefficient of water prevents the use of high laser intensity. As a result, thermophoresis led to loose nanoparticle accumulation around the laser spot rather than tight optical trapping. In contrast, at 1064 nm, the use of high laser intensity generated a deep optical trapping potential. Combined with moderate thermophoretic assistance\u2014driven by a temperature increase of several Kelvin\u2014this resulted in a markedly higher trapping efficiency for nanoparticles. Thus, our BDS model enables the quantitative separation and evaluation of optical and thermal forces in optothermal manipulation and is useful for designing manipulation behaviors ranging from loose accumulation to tighter confinement.

Aqueous organic solvent fractionation represents a promising approach to improve on HL properties and subsequently increase its valorisation options. In this study, for the first time, biorefinery HL derived from birch was purified and fractionated with water-EtOH and -THF mixtures across the whole co-solvent concentration range at ambient temperature.

Here we report that using an azobenzene-based DNA binder, AzodiGua, able to intercalate between DNA base-pairs, can bring sequence-sensitivity to DNA coacervation. We show that different amounts of AzodiGua are necessary to induce coacervation as a function of DNA double- or single-stranded nature, as well as of its GC content. In addition, resulting coacervates were shown to be reversibly photosensitive via trans/cis isomerization of AzodiGua\u2019s azobenzene moiety, due to lower efficiency of the cis-isomer for DNA coacervation.

This precursor is subsequently flowed through the central channel of a cross-shaped microfluidic device, where it is focused by two lateral streams of water containing the stabilizer Pluronic F127. As water and ethanol mix, the polarity shift forces phytantriol to self-assemble into cubosomes, while the laminar-flow conditions imposed by the microchannels provide controlled mixing conditions. By adjusting the flow rate ratio (QR) between the water-F127 side streams and the phytantriol-ethanol precursor, we control the width of the precursor stream\u2014the region through which solvent molecules exchange. This manipulation thus directly governs the mixing time, influencing the kinetics of lipid self-assembly, which ultimately determines particle size. This technique allows for the tuning of cubosome sizes from 195 nm down to 125 nm, with size decreasing monotonically as QR increases. Although variability is still significant, largely due to pumping instability and the use of a commercial microfluidic device not specifically designed for this application, the trends are statistically significant for every precursor-concentration series (Kendall tau=-0.53 to -0.73, p<0.011). Further customization of the apparatus is expected to improve reproducibility and scalability. The results obtained with this microfluidic method differ markedly from those obtained by bulk solvent exchange, which shows only a weak and generally non-significant trend toward larger particle size at higher dilution ratios. In addition, the polydispersity index is consistently moderate, with an interquartile range of 0.15\u20130.19. Particle characterization was performed using dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), showing the typical size range, inner structure and morphology of cubosomes.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Self-Assembly; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One powerful design strategy is to exploit chang-es in the open / closed equilibrium of rhodamine amides. In the context of amide derivatives of rhodamine B, a prototypi-cal member of the rhodamine family, this strategy has been especially useful in the development of activity-based indica-tors for protons and metal ions. This is because at neutral pH, the closed form of rhodamine B amides dominates, making this otherwise bright and fluorescent dye non-fluorescent. At acidic pH, the equilibrium favors the open form. Despite a wealth of methods to trigger Lewis acid-mediated fluorogenicity of rhodamine B amides, there are far fewer ways to shift the open-close equilibrium to favor the open form at neutral pH. Here, we demonstrate that a simple substitution substan-tially shifts the native rhodamine B amide equilibrium to favor the open, fluorescent form at neutral pH. Rhodamine B de-rivatives with an N-(2'-carboxy)-phenyl substitution (an ortho anthranilic acid, RhoB-AA) show strong absorbance and emission at pH 7.2, up to ~1500\u00d7 greater than their unsubstituted N-phenyl derivatives (RhoB-Ph). The fluorescence of RhoB-AA at neutral pH is dependent on the free carboxylic acid. Esters of RhoB-AA are also ~1500\u00d7 less fluorescent than RhoB-AA and have optical properties nearly identical to the unsubstituted RhoB-Ph. Esters of RhoB-AA can be converted by esterases to the fully fluorescent RhoB-AA, demonstrating that the simple ortho anthranilic acid substitution is a pow-erful strategy for activity-based sensing with rhodamine amides at neutral pH.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we propose an automated workflow that generates accurate mechanistic reactor models from experimental concentration data of a given reactor. At the core of this workflow, a reinforcement learning agent assembles an interpretable reactor model by iteratively simplifying general differential balance equations and fitting the resulting candidate model to experimental data. We demonstrate the performance of our workflow in two case studies. An in silico case study shows that the workflow correctly reconstructs the model underlying a synthetic data set, is robust against noise in the input data, and has favourable scaling properties. The agent accelerates the model derivation process significantly compared to an exhaustive enumerative search. Secondly, an experimental case study is conducted employing a Taylor-Couette prototype reactor. A liquid-phase esterification reaction of (2-bromophenyl)methanol and acetic anhydride was used as a test system.

Both hashed and non-hashed molecular fingerprints are widely employed as inputs in QSAR modeling across various domains. While some studies have explored combining multiple fingerprints to improve molecular representation, comprehensive investigations into different fingerprint fusion strategies and the generalizability of a fused fingerprint across diverse prediction tasks remain limited. In this study, we applied low-, mid-, and high-levels fusion strategies to combine six non-hashed fingerprints and evaluated model performance across six publicly available datasets, including three regression and three classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that mid-level fusion, where fingerprint bits are selectively combined based on their importance within individual models, consistently improves predictive accuracy, as assessed by RMSE and R2 for regression, and F1-score and ROC-AUC for classification.

Grand canonical calculations indicate pristine Ni may be lightly covered by OH at alkaline conditions, in contrast to Pt/Pd, and reveal that S prevents OH adsorption. Static calculations showed no significant effect on kinetics. Using metadynamics to dynamically sample the Volmer step, we show an alignment in entropic effects on Ni and Pt.

Our characterization of the Ni and Pt interfaces from unbiased ab initio molecular dynamics show similar solvent structures, further supporting this line of thinking. Finally, calculations on OH- and S-modified Ni surfaces found that the former had a greater Volmer barrier by 0.16 eV. This OH-modified surface had a significantly less consistent solvation environment, with an average hydrogen bond lifetime 14 fs less than that of the S-modified surface.

The commonly used universal scaling model cannot explain such phenomena.

In this study, we investigate polyHIPE composites stabilized by dual 2D surfactants by systematically varying surfactant type, size, and mixing protocols. Specifically, we examine emulsions stabilized either by graphene sheets of distinct lateral sizes (1 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m) or combinations of graphene and boron nitride (BN) sheets. Additionally, we explore how surfactant mixing order, pre-mixed (combining surfactants before emulsification) versus post-mixed (combining separately emulsified components), influences emulsion stability and foam morphology. We observed cell-size variation in pre-mixed, 1 \u00b5m vs 10 \u00b5m polyHIPES, with the size varying from 192 \u00b5m (for 1 \u00b5m control) to ~1,076 \u00b5m (for 10 \u00b5m control) and 280 \u00b5m for the pre-mixed samples. Pre-mixed systems demonstrated that 2D surfactants were well-mixed into the emulsion cell walls, whereas post-mixed emulsions retained distinct phase-separated shapes. The resulting polyHIPEs demonstrated promise in controlling electrical conductivity (0.31 S\u00b7m-\u00b9 for post-mixed G-BN polyHIPEs vs. undetectable for pre-mixed G-BN polyHIPEs) enabling the creation of composites with tunable conductive properties. They also exhibited good viscosity and structural strength, making them suitable for use in 3D-printable material systems.

At sub-nanometer scales, confinement and interfacial interactions dramatically reshape the molecular landscape, challenging conventional assumptions about pH and chemical reactivity. Here, we combine density-corrected density functional theory with machine-learned interatomic potentials to investigate the autoionization of water confined to quasi-two-dimensional monolayers within sub-nanometer slit pores. We find that extreme confinement markedly suppresses water autoionization, raising the effective pKw by more than two units. This suppression originates from hydroxide ion destabilization at interfaces, driven by restricted hydrogen bonding, hindered molecular reorientation, and a breakdown of Grotthuss proton transport caused by topological frustration in the hydrogen-bond network.

Through repurposing and directed evolution of Thermotoga maritima threonine aldolases, we transformed a traditionally two-electron pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme into a highly active and stereoselective biocatalyst for single-electron C\u2013C bond formation, enabling enantioconvergent conversion of a broad range of racemic organoboron substrates.

Mechanistic studies using radical clock probes and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy uncovered an unexpected role of free PLP in oxidative radical generation under photochemical conditions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further elucidated the origin of enantio- and diastereoselectivity in the key radical addition step between the enzymatic quinonoid and the carbon-centered radical. Collectively, these results underscore the power of pyridoxal radical biocatalysis to access a broad spectrum of valuable non-canonical amino acid products via intermolecular, enzyme-controlled asymmetric radical chemistry, a transformation that remains elusive to both state-of-the-art small-molecule catalysis and native enzymology.

The bonding arrangement between the [CuMes] units has qualitatively been described as localized three-center two-electron (3c-2e) bonds.

For this reason, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study mesitylcopper as monomeric [CuMes] unit and [CuMes]n oligomers with n = 2 to n = 7.

Consequently, there is intense interest in developing calcitriol analogues that maintain effective interaction with the VDR, exhibiting comparable or enhanced biological activity without inducing hypercalcemia. Understanding the molecular interactions between calcitriol and the VDR is therefore critical for the rational design of novel analogues. In this study, we employed the ONIOM hybrid methodology, which combines different computational levels for distinct regions of the system, to investigate the interactions between cal- citriol and the VDR active site while reducing computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, the ONIOM2(B3LYP/6-31++G(2d,p):PM7) approach was used to characterize the binding interactions of the active vitamin D metabolite within the receptor\u2019s active site.

Here we report that transfer of ferromagnetism from a ferromagnet to an originally non-magnetic transition metal through proximity induced magnetism (PIM) via exchange interactions and/or a spin polarised current can be used to control catalytic activity. We demonstrate large changes in activity at Au and Pt electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations trace changes to the breaking of the scaling relationship for the Tafel HER mechanism. This occurs due to the different effects of the spin order on the vibrational zero point energy and vibrational entropy of the magnetically proximitized transition metal for intermediates and TS. The ability to circumvent scaling relationships on existing non-ferromagnetic materials can be applied across catalysis.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Extraction of REEs from secondary resources such as mine tailings, electronic waste, and industrial by-products becomes an alternative solution. This study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to (i) predict the leaching efficiency rates and (ii) provide real-time explanations of the key extraction factors during the leaching process, while also recommending condition adjustments to optimize the leaching efficiency of REEs from secondary resources. Trained on 572 experimental datasets sourced from the Web of Science database, the system enhances leaching performance by offering explainable recovery rates and identifying influential process parameters. The results showed that silica concentration is the most critical factor, followed by REEs classification (light vs. heavy). In contrast, acid strength (pH), aluminum content, and temperature exhibited moderate but comparatively lower contributions to the overall leaching performance. By identifying suboptimal parameters and suggesting adjustments that lead to improvements in the predicted recovery (R2=0.81), the approach exemplifies how explainable AI can bridge the gap between empirical data and process innovation.

In this study, we develop a structurally uniform electrochemical platform with well-defined nitrogen-containing terminal groups, like pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyridine, graphitic nitrogen, and amine. We uncover that pyridazine outperforms other nitrogen moieties in terms of ORR activity and product selectivity in a metal-free scenario, where pyridazine exhibits a 10-fold higher current density than other nitrogen moieties. Our results demonstrate that ORR activity is greatly influenced by the solution pH, steric, and electronic environment of the nitrogen moiety, while ORR activity is unaffected by alkali and transition metal ions present in solution.

However, the atomistic origins of variations in ionic conductivity with composition remain poorly understood. A key challenge in computationally designing high-performance glass electrolytes is the absence of an efficient general interatomic potential, particularly for mixed-anion systems, such as combinations of oxides, sulphides, and halides. To address these limitations, a machine learning interatomic potential for glass electrolytes is introduced, based on the atomic cluster expansion descriptor, covering common network formers, modifiers, and anions. Excellent agreement with experimental structure and property data across a wide range of glass compositions is observed. While the potential is broadly applicable to, e.g., lithium-ion conductivity, focus is here on the influence of glass composition on sodium-ion conductivity given the emerging importance of these conductors. By screening the diffusivity of 1,303 glass compositions, the presence of anion species, such as sulphides and halides, is found to have a large positive influence on diffusivity, enabling prediction of highly conductive glasses with mixed anions. Diffusivity and ionic conductivity are highly correlated with a set of descriptors, such as the average atomic volume.

Here we propose and demonstrate the efficient prediction of this important quantity using machine learning. Our approach is based on three ingredients: (1) a newly curated dataset of nearly 1 million MOFs and their properties, including measured free energies for a subset of these structures; (2) a novel sequence representation of MOFs, called MOFSeq, that incorporates both local and global MOF features; and (3) a large language model (LLM-Prop) pre-trained on strain energy prediction and then fine-tuned on free energy prediction using MOFSeq. Our trained model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.789 kJ/mol on free energy prediction. Remarkably, this same model, without retraining, demonstrated exceptional versatility by predicting MOF synthesizability with a 97% F1 score. Furthermore, it correctly selected the right MOF polymorph with an average accuracy of 78.1%, with this accuracy increasing to 100% for free energy differences greater than 4.05 kJ/mol and remaining above 60% even when the free energy difference was as low as 0.16 kJ/mol.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Cummings; Clare McCabe", "abstract": "Shear viscosity is a crucial property for optimising various industrial processes. While experimental data is widely available for common fluids under ambient conditions, viscosity often needs to be estimated at state conditions far from ambient temperature and pressure or for solvent systems lacking experimental measurements. Although empirical correlations can be used to estimate viscosity, molecular simulation offers a molecular-level approach that not only provides accurate viscosity estimates but also yields insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms and can be readily extended to fluid mixtures.  Of the available simulation approaches to calculating the viscosity, the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) periodic perturbation method (PPM) has demonstrated both computational efficiency and accuracy in predicting shear viscosity. However, implementing PPM requires significant trial and error in selecting a suitable acceleration amplitude or sampling at multiple acceleration amplitudes to determine an extrapolation scheme, both of which increase computational demands and reduce the appeal of the method. In this work, we demonstrate that Quentrec\u2019s local order theory provides a superior fit for the dependence of viscosity on acceleration amplitude, enabling accurate extrapolation to zero-perturbation viscosity. The method is applied to a diverse set of 144 organic solvents and yields results that show good agreement with both experimental data and values obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We further show that data-driven models can accurately estimate the acceleration amplitude corresponding to a given relative deviation from zero-perturbation viscosity. By specifying a reasonable relative deviation, the estimated acceleration amplitude exhibits lower statistical noise while simultaneously enabling precise reproduction of the computed zero-perturbation viscosity after compensating for the deviation. This approach circumvents the need for sampling multiple acceleration amplitudes and thereby facilitates the implementation of the PPM method.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The theoretical prediction of CID spectra plays a critical role in supporting and accelerating this process. To this end, we adapt the recently developed QCxMS2 program originally designed for the calculation of electron ionization (EI) spectra to enable the computation of CID-MS. To account for the fragmentation conditions characteristic of CID within the automated reaction network discovery approach of QCxMS2 we adapted the internal energy distribution to match the experimental conditions. This distribution can be adjusted via a single parameter to approximate various activation settings, thereby eliminating the need for explicit simulations of the collisional process. We evaluate our approach on a test set of 13 organic molecules with diverse functional groups, compiled specifically for this study. All reference spectra were recorded consistently under the same measurement conditions, including both CID and higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) modes.  Overall, QCxMS2 achieves good average entropy similarity scores (ESS) of 0.687 for the HCD spectra and 0.773 for the CID spectra. The direct comparison to experimental data demonstrates that the QCxMS2 approach, even without explicit modeling of collisions, is generally capable of computing both CID and HCD spectra with reasonable accuracy and robustness.

Understanding solubility at the early stages of drug discovery is essential for minimizing resource consumption and enhancing the likelihood of clinical success via prioritizing compounds with optimal solubility. Mo-lecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful computational tool for modeling various physicochemical properties, particularly solubility. MD simulations offer a detailed perspective on molecular interactions and dynamics, providing insights into the factors influencing solubility. This study aims to statistically examine the impact of ten MD-derived properties, along with logP, one of the most influential experimental properties, on the aqueous solubility of drugs us-ing Machine Learning (ML) techniques. To achieve this, a dataset comprising 211 drugs from diverse classes was com-piled from the literature. These drugs were subjected to MD simulation, from which relevant properties were extracted and selected as features. Additionally, the corresponding octanol-water partition coefficient (logP) from previous studies was incorporated into the analysis. Through rigorous analysis, the properties with the most significant influence on sol-ubility were identified and subsequently used as input features for four ensemble machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The results indicate that seven properties, logP, Solvent Accessi-ble Surface Area (SASA), Coulombic_t, LJ, Estimated Solvation Free energies (DGSolv), RMSD, and Average number of solvents in Solvation Shell (AVGshell) are highly effective in predicting solubility, exhibiting performance compara-ble to predictive models based on structural features. The Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved the best performance with a predictive R2 of 0.87 and an RMSE of 0.537 in test set.

A direct supply of CO to an electrode surface for CO reduction is an effective way to enhance the selectivity for C2+ products, but strategies are still needed to limit the concentration of water at the electrode interface and hence the hydrogen reduction reaction (HER). In this work, we investigate the impact of metal-organic framework (MOF) coatings and electrolyte composition on the microenvironment at copper electrodes as well as its ability to suppress HER. Using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrochemical experiments, we examine how NU-901 and ZIF-8 coatings influence solvent structuring, including CO and water coordination at the electrode surface. Experimental results show that MOF-coated copper electrodes exhibit lower Faradaic efficiencies for ethylene and methane production compared to bare copper. NU-901, with larger pores, allows more access to CO and water but favors hydrogen evolution over CO reduction, reducing selectivity for C2+ products. ZIF-8, with its smaller pores and hydrophobicity,1 restricts water coordination but does not improve C2+ formation.

At oxygen-evolution potentials, similar oxidised nickel states were present before and after the Fe incorporation, with negligible change in their redox potentials.

Specifically, we utilised 18O2/16O2 exchanges with and without UV illumination, with subsequent ion-beam analysis, to obtain as a function of temperature the respective, characteristic quantities: oxygen surface exchange coefficients k\u2217s, surface space-charge potentials \u03a60, and bulk oxygen tracer diffusion coefficients D\u2217O.

No significant change in D\u2217O was observed, placing bounds on the UV-induced change of bulk nonstoichiometry \u03b4 .

Notably, biomimetic constructs emulating these dynamics have emerged as powerful tools to provide insights into complex biological processes. Among these, the controlled demembranation of membranized coacervates represents a promising approach to endow them with additional functionalities and capabilities in response to external biological stimuli. Here, we developed a self-immolative polymer (SIP)-membranized coacervate capable of undergoing controlled demembranization upon exposure to \u03b3-ray. Membranization endows coacervates with high stability and remarkable salt resistance. Significantly, SIP-membranized coacervates demonstrate spatial organization whereby various enzymes can be located in discrete regions, which facilitates an on/off modulation for a cascade enzymatic reaction. When exposed to \u03b3-ray, SIP membrane undergoes controlled depolymerization, the fusion of these discrete spatial organization enhanced enzymatic cascade kinetics within the coacervates. Specifically, SIP-membranized coacervates carrying enzymes are incorporated as active artificial organelles in living cells and regulate enzymatic cascade reactions that generate nitric oxide (NO).

For reducing nanoparticle polydispersity, post-synthesis treatment serves as a com-plementary approach to synthesis optimization, yet it is often overlooked. Centrifugation is theoretically a versatile method for fractionating all types of polydisperse nanoparticles. However, due to the challenges of precisely controlling fractionation in the centrifugal field and the complex interactions between nanoparticles and ligands, centrifugation is largely confined to a washing step following nanoparticle synthesis. In this work, we utilize our custom-built multiwavelength analytical ultracen-trifugation (MWL-AUC), which can simultaneously capture sedimentation profiles and in-situ UV-vis spectra of gold nano-rods, to investigate their sedimentation behavior in a centrifugal field. Our findings indicate that the bilayer model of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) requires modification. The gold nanorods should be considered as being envel-oped by a significantly thick outer layer of CTAB, while only a small amount of free CTAB remains in the aqueous solvent. Gold nanorods at the sedimentation boundary possess a significantly thinner repulsive layer than those concentrated at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Consequently, the increased polydispersity in the repulsive layer counteracts the fractionation effect along the centrifugal field, ultimately leading to a \u201cfractionation saturation\u201d. To achieve effective fractionation, sufficient equilibrium time for ligand self-assembly on the outer layer of gold nanorods should be allowed between each centrifugation round.

This is because d4r units, which are strained in pure silica compositions, are known to be favored by both fluoride ions inside the unit and Ge atoms in (some of) its corners. In this work we show that using 1,3,4-trimethylimidazolium and fluoride anions as structure-directing agents, the phase selectivity of the crystallization changes from ITW at pure silica compositions to a new zeolite structure, called HPM-18, at a Gef in the gel as small as 0.15. HPM-18 contains the same density of d4r as ITW (one d4r every 12 tetrahedral atoms, T) and the same fraction of T sites belonging to d4r (2/3 of T sites). Hence, the reasons for this change in phase selectivity of the crystallization is intriguing, specially considering that HPM-18 is significantly more porous and less dense than ITW. We also found that while the structure of HPM-18 is ordered for low Gef materials, when the Gef increases two dimensional correlated disorder occurs and up to five different ordered polymorphs can be identified in the resulting intergrowth materials. Here we report synthesis, structural characterization and energy minimization calculations that help explain the observations. An energy penalty for the Si and Ge substitution in ITW helps understand the observed phase selectivity change, while the reduced energy difference between HPM-18 polymorphs in GeO2 compositions explain the increased disorder as the Ge fraction increases.

Magnetic characterization confirmed superparamagnetic behavior of stock CoFe2O4 and ferrite-doped PBAT composite foil.

Among all solvents, water (H2O), unsurprisingly, was the first used for electrochemical systems due to its non-toxicity, abundance, and exceptional ability to dissolve and dissociate ionic salts. Despite its early dominance, research shifted toward nonaqueous electrolytes\u2014such as organic solvents and ionic liquids\u2014because of their wider electrochemical stability windows, enabling the deposition of a broader range of materials. However, interest in electrochemical crystallization from aqueous electrolytes has resurged; this is largely driven by two factors. First, water\u2019s environmental friendliness makes it attractive for large-scale and sustainable applications. Second, water\u2019s inherent reactivity\u2014primarily due to spontaneous proton production (H_2 O \u2194 H^+  + \u3016OH\u3017^-)\u2014presents both challenges and, counterintuitively, unique opportunities. In particular, recent research into emerging aqueous battery chemistries based on in-situ electrochemical crystallization of metals such as Zn, Cu, and Sn at the anode, and compounds like MnO2 at the cathode has offered exciting new insights into the associated complex interfacial phenomena. Drawing in part on advances from the battery field, this Review aims to offer perspectives on tailoring aqueous systems for the electrochemical synthesis of crystalline matter. In contrast to nonaqueous systems, the proton-induced reactivity in aqueous electrolytes introduces additional complexities. Continuous gas generation and pH-induced precipitation can lead to porous, passivating interphases, posing significant challenges to precise control. However, this same proton activity also enables the formation of a diverse library of materials\u2014such as oxides and hydroxides\u2014that are often inaccessible through nonaqueous electrochemical paths. These aqueous crystallization processes offer a cost-effective and highly controllable approach for synthesizing critical materials for energy and sustainability applications such as electrochemical energy storage. In this Review, we first explore the key physicochemical processes involved in aqueous electro-crystallization of metals, a simpler group of materials with well-defined lattice structures and stoichiometries. We then turn our attention to critical considerations for growing more complex compounds, characterized by intricate lattice symmetries and stoichiometries. We argue that achieving precision control in aqueous electrochemical crystallization requires a holistic understanding of proton activity, its influence on crystallization, and the ability to regulate interfacial chemical kinetics and transport phenomena across multiple length scales. With such control, electrochemical crystallization in aqueous systems offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the precision synthesis of materials essential to energy technologies and sustainability.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inspired by natural biopolymers such as collagen and actin, which form highly extended fibrillar networks that stiffen biological tissues, we developed a modular strategy utilizing self-assembling peptides to direct the formation of covalently polymerized diacetylene networks in hydrogels. By systematically tuning peptide sequences, we precisely controlled the supramolecular organization and molecular orientation within self-assembled nanofibers. This optimization enabled efficient topotactic polymerization of diacetylene moieties within the self-assembling peptides. Peptide sequences that readily promoted polymerization formed hydrogels with superior viscoelastic properties. Incorporation of these diacetylene peptide amphiphiles (DA-PAs) into covalently crosslinked poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels increased their mechanical stiffness 200-fold, while increasing viscous dissipation over 1,000 times. Modifying the chemical structure of the PEG crosslinker tuned the interfacial interactions between the covalent PEG and DA-PA networks, modulating stiffness by almost an order of magnitude. Since the DA-PAs readily dissolved in water prior to polymerization, they can be incorporated into most hydrogel systems. Adding them to alginate hydrogels led to an almost 20-fold increase in hydrogel stiffness. This approach, merging peptide-driven supramolecular chemistry with precise covalent polymerization, provides powerful and versatile pathways for fabricating mechanically robust, biomimetic hydrogels that can be applied to a range of biomedical applications.

Herein, I reevaluate existing data, presenting strong evidence that LNPs escape the endosomal compartment through the recently discovered vesicle budding-and-collapse (VBC) mechanism. A critical sub-sequent finding is that endosomal escape triggers the formation of an insoluble lipid/nucleic acid aggregate within the cytoplasm. The slow dissolution of this aggregate emerges as an additional, potentially rate-limiting, bottleneck to functional nucleic acid delivery. By reconciling previously puzzling experimental observations, the VBC mechanism provides a powerful new theoretical framework for the rational design of LNPs, paving the way for enhanced endosomal escape and overall functional delivery efficiencies.

Together with ACCONim, this platform enabled access to either enantiomer of non-canonical amino acids with high efficiency. Mechanistic studies using deuterium-labeled substrates indicated that, in contrast to ACCONim, the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is not the rate-limiting step in IPNS-catalyzed nitrogen migration reaction. Moreover, unlike ACCO, IPNS confers excellent enantiocontrol over the HAT event. Combined computational and experimental studies shed light on the origin of enantiodivergence, unraveling a rare mechanistic and enantioselectivity dichotomy in asymmetric nitrogen migration catalyzed by two phylogenetically related enzymes IPNS and ACCO.

Based upon this, we propose a defect chemical mechanism centered around the electronic structure of the material and its interaction with the electromagnetic field. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a set of acceptor- and donor-type substituted ceria samples and quantified their thermal response towards microwave irradiation. We found, that the nature of the substituent greatly influences the microwave heating properties in CeO2 in respect to the heating rate and the extent of the stable temperature regime. While the introduction of oxygen vacancies by use of acceptor-type Gd-substitution did not affect both parameters significantly, the use of Ni as substituent dramatically improved the conversion of electromagnetic energy to heat. On the other hand, donor-type substitution by Nb-introduction completely suppressed the unstable temperature regime and not a single thermal runaway was observed in Nb-substituted CeO2 samples, even at relatively high temperatures and field strength.

This study optimizes flow conductance within these networks under tube-volume and tube surface-area constraints for fully developed laminar power-law fluid flow in elliptical cross-sectional tubes. We identify key network parameters influencing flow conductance and find that efficient flow occurs when a specific ratio of the semi-major or semi-minor axis lengths is achieved. This ratio depends on the number of daughter branches splitting at each junction (bifurcation number $N$) and the fluid's power-law index $n$. This study extends Hess-Murray's law to non-Newtonian fluids (thinning and thickening fluids) with arbitrary branch numbers for elliptical cross-sectional tubes. We find that the maximum flow conductance occurs when a non-dimensional semi-major or semi-minor axis length ratio $\\beta^*$ satisfies $\\beta^* = N^{-1/3}$, and $\\beta^* = N^{-(n+1)/(3n+2)}$ under constrained-volume and constrained tube's surface-area, respectively.

The stress field is found to be independent of rheological parameters and solely governed by pressure gradient and geometry.

The Faradaic efficiency of H2 production at the chiral electrodes is significantly lower than that at the achiral electrodes, whereas formate is only produced on the chiral electrodes. Time-resolved Kerr ellipticity indicates that carriers traveling through the helical structure become spin polarized, inducing an electron spin accumulation at the electrode surface, which provides the evidence that the topological structure of the electrocatalyst causes the spin polarization.

Currently, there are insufficient biodegradation data and limited understanding of spatial variation in biodegradation, particularly across diverse aquatic environments. This study investigated the spatial variation in chemical biodegradation rate constants (k) across seven distinct aquatic environments in Australia including marine, mangrove, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems, using a modified OECD 309 test. Significant spatial variation in k was found for 36 of 38 chemicals (ANOVA, p < 0.05). In addition, the average log k for the chemicals was strongly correlated with the average log k of the same chemicals in 18 European rivers measured using the same method (Pearson r = 0.94, p < 0.001), illustrating inter-continental consistency in the relative biodegradation behaviour of the chemicals. However, the standard deviation in log k was larger across the Australian sites than across the European sites for many chemicals. These findings provide two key insights: first, that diverse aquatic environments demonstrate greater spatial variability in k than rivers; and second, that despite this spatial variability, the modified OECD 309 method can reliably rank chemicals according to their biodegradability and thus be useful in persistence assessments.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we uncover the physical mechanisms governing anomalous surface diffusion of PEG-coated gold nanorods (AuNRs) moving near the silicon nitride (SiN$_x$) membrane of the liquid cell of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). By systematically tuning the ionic composition of the diffusion medium, we show how electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, and radiolysis-induced screening shape particle motion across a continuum of subdiffusive behaviors. Statistical analyses and deep learning classification reveal a tunable transition between fractional Brownian motion (FBM) in strongly interacting systems (e.g., H\\textsubscript{2}O) and annealed transient time motion (ATTM) in screened or passivated environments (e.g., NaCl and phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). These findings challenge the conventional notion that ionic strength alone governs surface mobility, instead emphasizing the role of the local interaction potential. To further elucidate the time-dependent interfacial dynamics, we develop the first passive nanorheology framework in LPTEM, modeling the surface environment as an effective viscoelastic medium. The resulting complex moduli exhibit evolving transitions from elastic to viscous behavior, with relaxation dynamics that correlate directly with diffusion class and radiolytic ion generation. This integrative approach transforms LPTEM from a static nanoimaging modality into a predictive platform for probing nanoscale transport in chemically evolving interfacial environments.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanofluidics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite growing interest in SF5-containing pharmacophores, current strategies mainly focus on aromatic drugs, with few approaches available for introducing SF5 groups into more diverse structural frameworks. In this context, the potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a non-toxic, inexpensive, and stable alternative to the widely used but hazardous SF5Cl, offers an attractive source of SF5 groups.

Manually mixing cell suspensions into viscous biomaterials can be challenging due to the high viscosity ratio between the two fluids. Static mixers are an attractive approach as they can quickly and reproducibly mix two fluids, including those with a high viscosity ratio. However, static mixers intended for viscous applications have not been comprehensively investigated for bioink preparation. This work evaluates the mixing performance, shear stress, and cell viability using four different types of static mixers intended for high viscosity mixing.\nMethods:\nThree static mixers intended for mixing viscous solutions were designed based on the Sulzer SMX, Ross ISG, and serpentine mixers and fabricated using resin 3D printing. CELLMIXER, a Kenics-style static mixer commercially available through CELLINK, was used as a comparator. Two biomaterial inks based on PEGDA and methacrylated gelatin were used to characterize each mixer\u2019s performance. Shear stress was estimated via fluid dynamics simulations using shear-thinning attributes measured experimentally through rheology. Mixing effectiveness was evaluated using fluorescent beads, from which the most effective design was chosen for live cell mixing experiments. Viability of cell lines (A549 and NIH-3T3) and primary human lung fibroblasts was evaluated post-mixing. A demonstration of extrusion bioprinting was performed using the mixed bioinks. \nResults:\nThe SMX-style mixer provided the most uniform mixing and yielded the lowest simulated shear stresses among the designs investigated. A549, NIH-3T3, and primary human lung fibroblasts maintained viabilities above 96% post-mixing using the SMX-style mixer with a more homogenous cell distribution compared to the CELLMIXER. The bioprinting demonstration validated our mixing system for producing viable tissue constructs with evenly distributed cells.\nConclusions: \nWe present a simple, reproducible, and flexible system for mixing cells into viscous biomaterial inks. Our approach facilitates standardized fabrication of cell-laden tissue constructs to ensure consistency in the growing field of extrusion 3D bioprinting.\n", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Biocompatible Materials; Biological Materials; Materials Processing; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we establish a kinetic blueprint for apatite-wollastonite glass-ceramics (A-W GCs) by programming their initial phase composition through controlled sintering (700\u20131100\u00b0C). We then systematically tracked the subsequent bio-interfacial cascade in simulated body fluid (SBF), quantifying ion exchange kinetics, surface biomineralization, and material degradation. Our findings demonstrate a direct link between the initial phase composition and the material's bioactivity profile. Specifically, A-W GCs sintered at 1100\u00b0C, rich in crystalline wollastonite, exhibited controlled ion release and served as a superior template for rapid, uniform hydroxyapatite (HA) layer formation. In contrast, lower-temperature, amorphous-rich samples displayed rapid, uncontrolled dissolution and poor subsequent mineralization. This study demonstrates that the entire therapeutic lifecycle of a bioceramic, from initial ionic signaling to final surface maturation, can be precisely programmed through a single fabrication variable.

However, conventional electrochemical approaches that use ion exchange membranes (IEMs) have excessive energy demand, low productive current densities, and poor impurity tolerance. These shortcomings can be addressed by using a diaphragm flow cell (DFC), which has lower resistance than IEM-based systems and improved impurity tolerance.

However, the high-valence cations present in most highly conductive solid electrolytes facilitate reductive decomposition at low potentials, leading to significant irreversible lithium-inventory loss. Preventing this requires the development of solid electrolytes that are thermodynamically stable at low operating potentials, while providing high ionic conductivity and sufficient oxidative stability. To realize this, we explored a new family of Li-rich antifluorite irreducible solid electrolytes, Li2.65S0.35NxP0.65-x, the first reported nitrido-phosphido-sulfide, and investigated their application in all-solid-state batteries. We find that the optimized composition Li2.65S0.35N0.15P0.5 possesses a remarkably high ionic conductivity of 1.05 mS cm-1 as well as a relatively high oxidative stability of 1.15 V vs. Li/Li+ for this class of materials. Ab initio molecular dynamic and density functional theory simulations reveal that the enhanced Li-diffusion is the result of enlarged diffusion bottleneck sizes. These are a consequence of, (i) substitution with smaller anions or (ii) increased electrostatic repulsion from the substitution with high-valence anions. Importantly, the oxidative stability makes Li2.65S0.35N0.15P0.5 exhibit good compatibility with Si anodes, and in conjunction with the high ionic conductivity, this enables a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.2% as well as stable cycle life of a full cell with a micron silicon-Li2.65S0.35N0.15P0.5 anode and a LiCoO2-Li3InCl6 cathode.

The present study provides a systematic analysis of the ROE of mono and polycycloalkane by leveraging density functional theory. Total observed 75 cycloalkane molecules were curated from literature, including mono-, bi-, tri-, tetra-, or higher-order cyclic structures. Then, each cycloalkanes\u2019 ring bonds were identified, and its corresponding diradical structure after the ring opening reaction was generated automatically using Python and RDkit. Comparing the ground energies of diradicals and their parent cycloalkanes, the ROE of all ring bonds was calculated in the M06-2X/cc-pVTZ level of theory, yielding a compressive database with 597 ROEs. The curated database shows that the ROE of monocycloalkanes spans 56.6 \u2013 86.4 kcal/mol, while those of polycycloalkanes spans 36.3 \u2013 99.0 kcal/mol, indicating the intricacy of polycycloalkane\u2019s ring opening kinetics. The constructed database was utilized to draw the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) pertaining to the ROEs of mono and polycycloalkane.

These innovations improve energy transfer, control bubble dynamics, and enhance catalytic activity under ultrasound. Furthermore, we implement molecular modelling to gain fundamental insights into the mechanisms fundamental to the effectiveness of sonocatalysts. This approach provides a deeper understanding of how nanostructured catalysts interact with ultrasonic fields, guiding the design of next-generation catalytic materials. The integration of nanostructured catalytic cavitation agents, microfluidic reactor technologies, and computational molecular modelling forms a trilateral synergistic platform that unlocks new potential in sonocatalysis. This multidisciplinary framework paves the way for significant advancements in sustainable chemistry, offering innovative solutions to global challenges in energy, health, and environmental sustainability.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, achieving accuracies comparable to traditional quantum mechanical methods at a fraction of the computational cost. Models tackling different tasks, from reaction outcome prediction to retrosynthesis, have been developed, leveraging different representations like molecular graphs or text-based notations. However, this progress has led to a fragmented ecosystem of specialized, incompatible codebases. The lack of a unified framework and standardized evaluation protocols makes it difficult to compare methods fairly, limits the development of new approaches, and hinders the assessment of the true real-world performance of models. Here, we introduce ChemTorch, a modular open-source framework designed to unify and streamline the development and benchmarking of deep learning models for chemical reactions. Using ChemTorch, we conduct a systematic study on reaction barrier height prediction and demonstrate how common but unrealistic benchmarking practices, such as providing ground-truth atom-to-atom mappings or 3D geometries at test time, lead to overly optimistic performance estimates. By re-evaluating models in a setting that withholds such privileged information, we reveal significant performance drops that better reflect the challenges of real-world deployment. We therefore propose a new set of benchmarking guidelines that promote end-to-end evaluation, where models must operate on readily available 2D chemical structures without relying on computationally expensive data. ChemTorch provides the community with a powerful tool to accelerate research and promote reproducibility, and by adopting these more rigorous evaluation standards, the field can shift its focus towards developing models that are not only accurate in benchmarks but are genuinely applicable in practice.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}
{"title": "An Obscure Natural NAD\u207a-Boosting Sirtuin Activator: N\u00b9-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA)", "doi": "10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0hgzw", "published_doi": "N.A.", "published_url": "N.A.", "authors": "Faruk Alpay", "abstract": "N\u00b9-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA), a quaternary pyridinium derivative of nicotinamide (vitamin B\u2083), represents a largely overlooked naturally occurring compound with remarkable potential as a next-generation anti-aging therapeutic. This comprehensive review examines 1-MNA's unique chemical properties, natural occurrence, biological mechanisms, and comparative advantages over established NAD\u207a precursors, while investigating the factors responsible for its scientific obscurity despite promising bioactivity profiles.  1-MNA occurs naturally in trace quantities (\u22643 mg per 100g dry weight) in select plant sources including brown seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida), green tea leaves, shiitake mushrooms, and celery. Its quaternary pyridinium structure, formed through N-methylation of nicotinamide's pyridine ring, confers a permanent positive charge that facilitates cellular uptake via organic cation transporters, potentially enhancing bioavailability compared to anionic NAD\u207a precursors.  The compound operates through a sophisticated dual mechanism distinct from conventional NAD\u207a boosters like nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). First, 1-MNA functions as a feedback inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), the enzyme responsible for nicotinamide methylation. By inhibiting NNMT activity, exogenous 1-MNA preserves nicotinamide availability for the NAD\u207a salvage pathway, optimizing endogenous NAD\u207a production rather than merely supplementing substrate pools. Second, 1-MNA directly stabilizes and upregulates SIRT1 protein expression, enhancing sirtuin activity beyond what would be predicted from NAD\u207a elevation alone. Additionally, 1-MNA serves as a \"sink\" for nicotinamide accumulation, preventing nicotinamide-mediated sirtuin inhibition that can limit NAD\u207a supplementation efficacy.  \n\nPharmacokinetic analysis reveals superior characteristics compared to NMN. While NMN requires gram-scale dosing (250-1000 mg daily) due to degradation and limited absorption, preliminary human studies demonstrate 1-MNA bioactivity at 50-100 mg daily\u2014representing an order of magnitude dose reduction. Animal studies corroborate enhanced potency, showing significant lifespan extension and healthspan improvements with modest supplementation levels. The compound's rapid renal elimination minimizes accumulation concerns while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.  \n\nDespite these promising characteristics, 1-MNA remains remarkably obscure in biomedical literature. Several factors contribute to this scientific neglect: (1) extreme natural rarity requiring kilogram quantities of source materials to extract milligram amounts, (2) challenging chemical synthesis as a quaternary pyridinium salt with low-yield methylation reactions and complex purification requirements, (3) minimal commercial development with only recent regulatory approval (2018) of the chloride salt form as a novel food ingredient in the European Union, and (4) absence from mainstream longevity research discourse lacking the extensive publication record and patent portfolio associated with established NAD\u207a precursors.  \n\nThis review reveals 1-MNA as a compelling example of a \"hidden in plain sight\" therapeutic opportunity\u2014a naturally occurring molecule with potentially superior anti-aging properties that has escaped scientific attention due to practical rather than biological limitations. The compound's unique regulatory mechanism, enhanced bioavailability, and reduced dosing requirements position it as a promising candidate for next-generation NAD\u207a/sirtuin-targeted therapeutics. However, comprehensive clinical investigation is urgently needed to validate its theoretical advantages and establish safety profiles for broader therapeutic applications. 1-MNA exemplifies how overlooked natural products may harbor significant therapeutic potential awaiting discovery through systematic chemical and biological investigation.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Natural Products; Biochemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

These non-homogeneous electrolyte systems have altered ion distributions compared to their respective bulk phases. Due to high energy barriers for ion exchange between phases, achieving interfacial ion equilibration can be an issue when classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques are employed at temperatures relevant for battery applications (e.g. 300\u2013360 K), as the accessible timescales are limited to < \u03bcs. In this work, we present MD simulations at elevated temperatures (400\u2013700 K) to reach equilibrium ion distributions in CSEs and evaluate whether these high-temperature simulations can also provide insight into the structural and dynamic properties at lower temperatures. Specifically, we selected Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) as the ceramic and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) dissolved in polyethylene oxide (PEO) as the polymer electrolyte. We demonstrate that, at temperatures equal to or above 600 K, the interfacial structures reach a state of equilibrium that is essentially independent of temperature, involving a significant Li+ transfer to the ceramics relative to the bulk phase. Below 600 K, the Li+ distribution is not equilibrated. Furthermore, even below 600 K, the TFSI\u2212 distribution within the polymer phase follows the Li+ distribution in the two phases. This results in apparent equilibrium ion distributions at temperatures below 600 K. From the equilibrium Li+ free energy curve at 700 K, together with the transition rates at 600 K and 700 K, we can estimate the free energy barrier for Li+ entering the LLZO phase at lower temperatures, and thus predict the expected hopping rates at experimentally relevant temperatures. The results suggest that simulations at 400 K or lower require initial high-temperature simulations to achieve an appropriate lithium partitioning. The resulting structure can then be used for simulations at lower temperatures.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study we use magneto-optical spectroscopy to assess the magnetic response of excitons in defective, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite-like (HOIP) materials self-assembled into quantum well (SAQW) superlattices. Samples were grown at liquid-liquid interfaces to form specific vacancy defect densities. By applying large magnetic fields in Faraday configurations during the collection of photoluminescence (PL) at 10 K, we assess the magnetic properties of excitons in hexyl ammonium lead iodide (HA2PbI4) SAQWs as a function of their I\u2212 vacancy content. For samples shown to possess fewer I\u2212 vacancies, the PL spectra are consistent with high quality 1 surfaces like those prepared by encapsulation with 2-dimensional (2D) insulators. These high- quality surfaces allow us to measure sharp doublets of PL peaks possessing full-width-at- half-maximum values as low as 0.65 meV. The sharp, narrow doublets of PL peaks merge into broader individual peaks when we make the same measurements on HA2PbI4 SAQW samples grown to possess more I\u2212 vacancies, which is consistent with the presence of a more strongly fluctuating electromagnetic environment. We use the response of the PL spectra of both pristine and defective HA2PbI4 SAQW samples to changes in light field polarization states and applied magnetic field to assign specific PL features to the mJ = 0 manifold of excitons that are coupled via the exchange interaction. Additionally, we assign lower energy features in these samples\u2019 PL spectra to excitons trapped at defect sites, which possess larger exchange interactions and couplings to the applied magnetic field. We support our conclusions with the results of density functional theory calculations on supercells of the proposed defective HA2PbI4 SAQW structure.

Many methods capture structural features well but often overestimate pressure, as computed by the virial theorem, due to thermodynamic representability issues. This limits utility, particularly for studying phenomena using the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble. Here, we present and analyze straightforward extensions of iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) that include pressure corrections during parameter optimization. Two new approaches are explored: iterative length scale rescaling (iLS) and iterative linear correction (iLC). These approaches differ from the more common practice of adding long-range attractive forces only after CG potential optimization. Performance is evaluated across diverse molecular systems, including polymer melts and molecular liquids, at varying CG resolutions. Both methods retain structural fidelity while enhancing  thermodynamic consistency through reasonable modifications of the pair potential. In particular, resulting CG models accurately reproduce radial distribution functions, densities, and density fluctuations, with iLS exhibiting improved stability and faster convergence. Analysis of isothermal compressibility reveals a general resolution-dependent trend, with significant deviation from atomistic behavior emerging below a critical CG resolution. These findings demonstrate that iLS and iLC are practical, transferable methods for constructing coarse-grained models with consistent thermodynamic behavior.

Accurate process models are essential for design and optimisation, yet they are often hindered by overparameterisation stemming from mismatches between model complexity and data quality or availability. This overfitting results in models that fail to capture the underlying physics, leading to poor predictive capabilities, limited extrapolation beyond controlled laboratory conditions, and inefficient use of experimental resources.\n\nThis work discusses a rigorous, valuable methodology and introduces a tool to address practical modelling challenges, guiding practitioners in academia and industry toward more predictive models. We propose a comprehensive framework for identifiability analysis to diagnose and enhance model feasibility, demonstrated through a case study of cooling crystallisation involving needle-like particles. A digital twin was developed to simulate the crystallisation process and replicate measurement devices, followed by an extensive identifiability analysis at both theoretical and practical levels, yielding actionable insights for real-world applications.\n\nOur results are threefold. First, we emphasise the constraints that identifiability imposes on modelling when parameters are not uniquely determinable (i.e., ill-posed).

Moreover, what little benchmarking studies are available primarily focus on the docking aspect of the pipelines, which is usually only the beginning or near the beginning, and even there, authors tend to use flawed data sets that artificially inflate performance metrics. Herein, we present an alternative method to pipeline validation and data set generation that requires no additional experimental work and expenditure, yet offers negative data that is vastly superior both in terms of quality and quantity to any data set used in vHTS pipeline validation up to now. By randomizing ligands across published experimental structures and generating structural isomers of known binders, practically unlimited amounts of negative data can be generated. Such sets of positive and negative data points match closely in molecular properties and are much more suitable for pipeline validation and have far greater evidentiary value than any of the current sets. Once such sets are generated, they are to be run through any proposed pipeline, assessing performance at every step. We stress the importance of using negative data of adequate quality and quantity in validation studies to definitively and verifiably demonstrate the utility of a given tool or workflow.

Despite the increasing use of these sulfur-rich polymers, there are limited methods to synthesize them with control of structure and molecular weight. In this study, we disclose novel photopolymerization methods to make poly(trisulfides) with well-defined sulfur-rank and stereochemistry, narrow dispersity, and controlled molecular weights. The reaction features photochemical cleavage of an S\u2013S bond in a 1,2,3-trithiolan (a cyclic trisulfide) to generate a diradical that can undergo ring-opening polymerization. To generate polymers with molecular weights exceeding 20,000 g/mol, spatial or temporal control of irradiation is required because the same wavelengths of light that initiate the reaction also cleave S\u2013S bonds in the target polymer. Spatial control of photoinitiation was achieved using a photochemical flow reactor that physically separates the polymer products from the light source after synthesis. Temporal control of photoinitiation also allowed these polymers to be made in batch reactors. This control was imparted with pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation with precisely controlled on and off times. This innovative strategy allowed initiation during short (100 ms) bursts of light, and propagation during longer dark periods (e.g. 900 ms). The pulsed light strategy allowed preservation of the polymer chains during the reaction. In contrast, continuous irradiation led to cleavage of S\u2013S bonds in the polymer and rapid depolymerization. Previously published attempts to make a poly(trisulfide) by photochemical ring-opening polymerization were not viable because continuous irradiation always resulted in depolymerization; our spatially and temporally controlled irradiation methods solve this long-standing problem and provide ready access to decagram quantities of several poly(trisulfides). The reversibility of the polymerization also prompted us to develop new applications of these polymers as recyclable coatings and adhesives, and photoresists for lithography. More generally, we argue that spatial and temporal control of irradiation during photochemical reactions should be considered as a design principle in photochemical synthesis. Pulsed laser techniques have long been used for the study of kinetics and mechanisms of reactions, but the deliberate control of irradiation on and off times has seldom been applied to preparative chemical synthesis. Our photochemical polymerizations using pulsed light reported here illustrate the value of controlling irradiation in space or time to make useful products not accessible with continuous irradiation.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH) is an efficient technique for hyperpolarization of 13C and 15N nuclei in various biologically relevant compounds. Nitroimidazole antibiotics are prone to reduction in anaerobic conditions, making them prospective molecular contrast agents for visualization of hypoxic tumors. In this work, we systematically studied 15N SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization of ornidazole antibiotic at natural abundance (n.a.) of 15N isotope and in the isotopically 15N3-labeled form. Optimization of such experimental conditions as polarization transfer magnetic field, temperature, parahydrogen pressure, and flow rate resulted in average 15N polarization levels of 9.3 \u00b1 0.5% for n.a. ornidazole and 5.3 \u00b1 0.2% for [15N3]ornidazole. T1 polarization decay time of 7.4 min was achieved for the 15NO2 group of [15N3]ornidazole at a clinically relevant 1.4 T magnetic field, allowing for detection of the 15N NMR signal more than 20 minutes after hyperpolarization. DFT calculations of 15N chemical shifts for ornidazole and plausible intermediates and products of its reduction under hypoxic conditions showed that it should be feasible to discriminate these compounds using 15N NMR.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we present exact analytical expressions relating the pressure drop and volumetric flow rate for steady, laminar flow of power-law fluids through five different two-dimensional converging\u2013diverging channel geometries: linear wedge, parabolic, hyperbolic, hyperbolic cosine, and sinusoidal. The analysis is performed under the lubrication approximation for low-Reynolds-number Stoke flow regime. It is noticed that when the flow viscosity is taken as a constant, the method approaches the Newtonian flow physics. Our results demonstrate how flow rate, velocity profile and pressure drop are influenced by fluid rheology and geometric shape of the channel. {\\color{black} It is observed that the flow rate is maximum for the wedge profile followed by hyperbolic and sinusoidal geometries, then parabolic and minimum for the cosine hyperbolic profile. Additionally, as the value of power index increases, i.e. as the fluid transitions from shear-thinning to shear-thickening, the flow rate decreases. The velocity profiles show accelerated flow in the converging section and deceleration in the diverging section, with sharper peaks as the power-law index increases. The pressure gradient is negative throughout the channel, steeper in the converging part and gradually approaching zero at the exit. It becomes more negative with increasing $n$, indicating enhanced resistance to flow in shear-thickening fluids.} The present method can be utilized for several types of fluids ranging from shear thinning to shear-thickening and specific channel profiles. In cases where complex mathematical and practical considerations pose a challenge in obtaining analytical expressions, the present investigation provides a strong frame of reference for obtaining accurate numerical results.

This can be improved by leveraging explainability of ML models, which, at the same time, would increase the chance of ML to offer new insights into the chemistry and physics of materials. Hence, the next generation of ML models in these realms must guarantee explainability by embedding explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools into their pipelines. Specifically, ML-assisted materials discovery and design can take great advantage of the use of XAI. Enabling explanations would increase the impact of these approaches by providing not only a set of candidates, but also insights into what makes a given material better than others. With this in mind, on the example of heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogen production and energy generation, here we propose a novel strategy for materials design based on counterfactuals explanations. We were able to find materials featuring properties close to the design targets that were later validated with density functional theory calculations. Explanations were devised by comparing original samples, counterfactuals, and discovered candidates. Such explanations allowed us to unveil subtle relationships between the most relevant features, other, in principle, less important features, and the target property.

The present study leverages the in-house artificial intelligence (AI) model, HEAT-UP, to build the QSPR for polymers and systematically identify alternative polymeric binders that satisfy multiple property criteria. First, we curated a database of the polymer\u2019s pyrolysis and mechanical properties \u2013 the thermal decomposition temperature (TD), char yield (YC), tensile stress at break (\u03c3B), and tensile stress at yield (\u03c3Y) \u2013 as well as the ecotoxicity of monomers \u2013 a lethal concentration that kills 50% of Fathead Minnow and Bluegill Sunfish (LC50FM and LC50BS, respectively).

The trained GNN models were used to screen out novel polymeric binder candidates under multiple criteria of TD, YC, \u03c3B, and \u03c3Y. The initial screening process recognized only 147 out of 18,596 polymers meet the multiple criteria. Further screening was conducted with the process toxicity; the synthetic route of each polymer candidate was identified from the literature, and the ecotoxicity of the monomers required for the polymer processing was estimated from the GNN model.

SMP-10 is a preceramic polymer that transforms into SiC upon pyrolysis, offering significant flexibility in fabricating thermal-resistant materials with complex geometries. Despite its wide range of applications, there is limited understanding of the mechanistic details of the polymer-to-ceramic conversion process of SMP-10. The present study aims to provide a theoretical simulation of SMP-10 pyrolysis based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and density functional theory (DFT). First, we conducted an MD simulation on the high-temperature (2000 \u2013 2500 K) pyrolysis of SMP-10. The simulation at 2500 K demonstrated the rapid formation of char with a yield of 83 %wt. by 500 ps, showing excellent agreement with the experimental char yield of 82 %wt. Furthermore, MD results indicated that SMP-10 quickly loses the substituted allylic group right at the start of pyrolysis and undergoes a series of H2 elimination reactions, resulting in an unsaturated structure. The reaction pathway inferred from the MD simulation was further analyzed using the theoretical potential energy surface calculated from DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. We found that the allylic groups in SMP-10 can be eliminated via a 6-membered transition state with a low energy barrier (50 kcal/mol), creating a double bond in the backbone of SMP-10. This double bond further promotes a series of H2 elimination reactions, resulting in a diene and triene structure, with the energy barrier gradually decreasing from 75 kcal/mol to 20 kcal/mol as the reaction progresses. Eventually, SMP-10 forms a 1,3,5-trisilabenzene structure, which can serve as a precursor for \u03b2-SiC. Further analysis of the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of SMP-10, conducted at M06-2X/def2tzvp, revealed that the Si-H bond in the backbone of SMP-10 has approximately 10 kcal/mol lower BDE than the C-H bond, facilitating the H2 elimination reaction.

This work details how the pH-responsiveness is then transferred from the molecular to the nanoscale, and all the way up to the macroscale through self-assembly. In particular, the protonation of the vermellogen moiety is responsible for hydrogelation, while that of the peptide fine-tunes the matrix nanostructure and viscoelastic properties. Hence, whilst V-FfFH22+/V-FfFH+ form hydrogels in the broad 1 to 6 pH range, the material can be reversibly disassembled from pH 7 onwards upon formation of the zwitterionic V-FfF with overall neutral charge. Electron microscopy investigations enabled the correlation of varying viscoelastic properties with the nanostructure of the hydrogel matrices. Self-assembly of V-FfFH2\u00b72Cl undergoes a peculiar evolution from nanofibers to nanotubes as regards its nanostructuration. This process depends on the degree of C-terminal deprotonation, notably with the gradual increase in the internal diameter of the resulting nanotubes as the deprotonation progresses to completion. State-of-the-art characterization techniques confirmed that the nanostructured gels are predominantly comprised of parallel \u03b2-sheets as primary self-assembling motifs, arranging VH2+ units in a clockwise helical pattern, which minimizes electrostatic repulsions. The evolution from nanofibers to nanotubes appears to be driven by a long-range hydrogen bonding interaction, involving the hydrazone group and the deprotonated C-terminus of adjacent \u03b2-sheets.

We find that conformational variations in P3HT:F4TCNQ dimers can modulate the amount of ground-state charge transfer between P3HT and F4TCNQ by more than 0.5 C. The amount of charge transfer in P3HT:F4TCNQ dimers exhibits a linear correlation with the difference between the ionization potential (IP) of P3HT and the electron affinity (EA) of F4TCNQ, when using geometries extracted from DFT-optimized dimer aggregates. We find that most variation in IP \u2013 |EA| that governs the amount of ground-state charge transfer is due to conformational variations of P3HT's IP (~0.35 eV) compared with F4TCNQ's EA (~0.15 eV). Finally, we show that the free energy of charge generation of the dimer, when treated as the sum of IP \u2013 |EA| and electrostatic energies derived from atomic partial charges, correlates linearly with the amount of charged transfer in the dimer.

Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we generate an ensemble of structures from 10,800 unique SCNPs, some formed  under quiescent conditions and some in shear flow--the latter of which has not been previously studied. We then characterize morphologies by analysis of a three-dimensional embedding space obtained through unsupervised learning of the simulated structures. This reveals how SCNP morphology depends on dimensionless parameters, related to precursor-chain attributes and shear rate, and offers insight into their relative influence.

Furthermore, shear, which can be externally controlled independent of precursor chain synthesis, can have persistent effects on morphology, such as enhancing compaction of SCNPs based on stiff chains.

Herein, we illustrate a simple strategy to stabilize coacervate microdroplets via interfacial formation of solid polyelectrolyte complexes mediated by addition of a strong polyelectrolyte. The generality of this method was illustrated using several coacervate microdroplets. The solid polyelectrolyte membrane formed allowed rapid exchange of small molecules and charge-selective permeability in case of macromolecules. The addition of salt triggered network swelling within the membranized coacervate droplets and removal of salt allowed the deswelling of the droplets. This salt-mediated chemomechanical actuation of the membranized droplets was around twice that of native membraneless droplets and reversible actuation for over 20 cycles was illustrated using alternating flows of salt and water. The actuating droplets maintained the coacervate interior in a loosely cross-linked state allowing faster mass transport and enhanced the rate of enzymatic reactions hosted within by a factor of two with respect to non-actuating droplets. The cross linking can be increased simply by flowing water to regulate diffusion within the coacervate droplets.

By employing an ionic liquid-based extraction method, isolated suberin retains nearly native levels of its cross-linking component, glycerol. These highly esterified polymeric particles exhibit antimicrobial activity. This study aims to further understand the innate antimicrobial properties of suberin particles. Suberin particles were isolated, and their complex polymeric chemistry was comprehensively characterized using a range of analytical methods. Their interaction with model gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, was investigated through growth assays and microscopy. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted using keratinocyte cells. Coarse-grained models of suberin polymers were constructed; their action on membrane mimics, as nanoparticle suberin aggregates, was then tested using molecular dynamics simulations. The results demonstrate that suberin particles are non-cytotoxic to keratinocytes but effectively kill both types of bacteria by interacting with their membranes, without causing significant cell lysis. Remarkably, reduced esterification in suberin enhances its activity against gram-positive bacteria but leads to cell lysis. Simulations identified a suberin nanoparticle-mediated membrane disruption process, involving adsorption/absorption into the target membranes. A stark contrast was observed for bacterial vs mammalian membrane mimics, with clear disruption of the former but much weaker interaction with the latter. The balance between surface hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of suberin particles is critical for membrane activity, and, presumably, bactericidal efficacy. These findings raise important questions about the role of suberin-bacteria interactions in soil ecosystem services.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Biopolymers; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used but remains slow, expensive and difficult to scale. This work presents a multi-channel and multi-frequency electrical response (MMER) technique that delivers equivalent impedance-related insights at a fraction of the time and cost. MMER enables the simultaneous diagnosis of entire battery modules in just one second, independent of cell count. It uses a binary multi-frequency excitation signal, easily implemented on compact hardware such as programmable logic devices. And bypasses the need for complex impedance fitting or frequency-domain conversion. Instead, MMER directly compares raw voltage responses under a shared excitation current to detect performance variations. Experiments demonstrate that MMER accurately identifies cell performance and health, consistent with EIS results, while reducing measurement time by over 99%. It also supports diagnostics during high-rate cycling without the need for steady-state conditions.

Boisseau Gomez; Jesus A. Anaya; Jaeyoung Cho", "abstract": "As the commercial space industry continues to grow, polymeric ablative materials (PAM) for thermal protection systems (TPS) for re-entry need to be able to meet the higher demands of various spacecraft. Novolac phenolic resin (NPR) is the most common PAM, which possesses a high thermal decomposition temperature (TD) of 500 \u00b0C and char yield (YC) of 55 %wt. to resist high temperatures during the fight, as well as dissipate the heat from the rocket\u2019s surface. However, this conventional PAM possesses drawbacks in high thermal conductivity and substantial water uptake owing to its hydroxyl functional group and highly crosslinked nature. In this regard, the present study looks for a novel polymeric for PAM that mitigates such drawbacks of NPR while holding comparable pyrolysis characteristics through theoretical analysis. First, we analyzed the pyrolysis mechanism of NPR using density functional theory (DFT) calculation to understand the underlying physics that leads to a high YC of 55 %wt. As a result, we found that the radical species from NPR\u2019s initial pyrolysis step undergoes intramolecular cyclization, forming tricyclic intermediates (such as 9H-xanthene), irrespective of the initiation mechanism, whether bond fission or hydrogen abstraction. Second, we compared NPR\u2019s pyrolysis pathway to those of two other potential PAMs \u2013 poly(dimethyl phenol) (PPO) and poly(diphenyl phenol) (PPPO) \u2013 which possess an improved water resistance and thermal conductivity while yielding less char upon pyrolysis (25 %wt. for PPO and 45 %wt. for PPPO). A mechanistic study on PPO pyrolysis indicates that it forms tricyclic intermediates (1,3,5-trimethyl-4a,9a-dihydro-9H-xanthen-2-ol) only if initiated by hydrogen abstraction. The bond fission of PPO has a substantial energy barrier to the formation of the tricyclic intermediate, explaining the lower YC of PPO than other polymers. Meanwhile, despite the similarity in the molecular structure of PPO and PPPO, the bond fission of PPPO forms tricyclic intermediates owing to the substituted phenyl group facilitating intermolecular cyclization. In other words, we found that a polymer\u2019s YC depends on its structural capacity to form radicals that cyclize to form a polycyclic structure. The present study provides theoretical insights into structure-property relationships of polymer\u2019s YC that can guide the accelerated discovery of novel PAM with superior pyrolysis characteristics for TPS application.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study provides mechanistic and kinetic insights into how organo-mineral associations influence glyphosate adsorption, desorption, bonding configurations, and abiotic oxidation pathways. We employed time-resolved in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and microfluidic experiments coupled with LC-MS quantification to track glyphosate and its oxidation byproducts. A model protein (bovine serum albumin; BSA) and two Mn oxide minerals (K-birnessite and hausmannite) were used to represent environmentally relevant interfaces. Our results show that protein adsorption onto mineral surfaces (BSA-Mn oxide associations) favors the AMPA oxidation pathway over the glycine and sarcosine pathways, particularly under acidic pH. This shift in pathway selectivity correlates with changes in glyphosate coordination at the surface where the presence of protein promotes mononuclear monodentate binding via the phosphonate group. Additionally, protein association diminishes glyphosate oxidation by passivating Mn oxide active sites and forming glyphosate-protein complexes. Kinetic modeling further reveals that BSA association reduces glyphosate adsorption, desorption, and oxidation rate constants at both pH 4.6 and 7.2. Given the prevalence of organo-mineral associations in natural and engineered systems, the observed shift toward AMPA formation, a toxic and persistent byproduct, has important implications for glyphosate fate, mobility, and potential risks to human and ecosystem health.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Environmental Science; Soil Science; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Copper-based electrodes are uniquely suited for this purpose yet achieving high selectivity toward C\u2013C coupled products such as ethylene, over undesired byproducts like methane and hydrogen, remains a major challenge. For CO\u2082 reduction to ethylene, we introduce here a modular hybrid electrode architecture composed of copper nanowires (CuNWs) coated with a thin, functional organic shell formed via electroreduction of ethylene-bridged dipyridophenazine (dppz) dication derivatives. This core\u2013shell system enables fine-tuning of the interfacial catalytic environment through rational molecular design. We demonstrate that subtle structural variations affecting the electronic distribution of the phenazine moiety, particularly electron-donating or hydrophilic substituents, have a profound impact on the ethylene selectivity. Notably, electrodes incorporating electron-donating groups achieved nearly a tenfold increase in Faradaic efficiency for ethylene relative to pristine CuNWs, while hydrophilic functionalities favored hydrogen production and suppressed C\u2081 and C\u2082 products. \nEx-situ characterization of core-shell electrodes further reveals that that the polymeric coating stabilizes the Cu surface against corrosion and provides valuable insights into the structural reconstruction of CuNWs during the electrocatalytic process. Our findings highlight a powerful and scalable approach for decoupling catalyst selectivity from the intrinsic properties of the metal surface, offering a tunable platform for next-generation CO\u2082 electroreduction.

In these devices, MOF structure strongly influences performance, often through MOF\u2013electrolyte interactions.

Recent work showed that 19F NMR spectroscopy can probe organic electrolyte environments in the layered MOF Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene), revealing that the chemical shifts of in-pore anions are influenced by specific chemical interactions with the MOF functionality.

As the MPI community continues to grow and diversify, there is an increasing recognition of the need for standardized approaches in signal quantification to ensure reproducibility, comparability, and reliable interpretation of results across studies. A key area where standardization is particularly needed is in the construction of calibration curves for quantitative MPI. Traditional MPI signal quantification methods typically rely on calibration curves constructed using SPIONs in solution, assuming that signal response remains consistent across environments. This overlooks key factors such as interparticle interactions and changes in the SPION magnetic behaviour that can occur in complex biological contexts, such as inside cells. In these environments, SPIONs may aggregate, experience restricted motion, or interact with intracellular structures, all of which can alter their MPI signal characteristic and affect quantification accuracy. In this study, we demonstrate that calibration curves derived from SPIONs in solution differ markedly from those obtained in cellular environments. We therefore propose calibrating MPI signal against the number of labelled cells, a strategy that accounts for altered SPION behaviours in the cellular environment and enables more accurate estimation of intracellular iron content. \nAnother critical but often overlooked factor in MPI quantification is the influence of SPION concentration and their spatial distribution within the sample. We show that even modest variations in concentration can significantly affect MPI signal intensity challenging the commonly assumed linear relationship between signal and iron content. Our findings reveal that variations in concentration can introduce nonlinearities in signal response, thereby altering calibration curves and impacting the accuracy and reproducibility of MPI-based quantification. These observations highlight the importance of accounting for dilution effects, particularly when evaluating or comparing novel MPI tracers. By systematically examining the effects of environmental context and SPION concentration, our study provides a framework for biologically relevant MPI calibration strategies and supports the development of more standardized, reproducible quantification protocols.\n", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Cell and Molecular Biology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our study computationally integrated the leveraging framework of pharmacophore modeling, free energy estimations, and molecular dynamics simulations to enhance fluoroquinolone derivatives for their better antibacterial potency while mitigating cardiotoxicity. Binding studies demonstrated that moxifloxacin engages deeply within the hERG channel\u2019s inner cavity, primarily stabilized by van der Waals attractions and cation-\u03c0 interactions with key residues TYR545, PHE551, and ARG541.

The designed polar modification served dual purposes: (1) electronically perturbating of the TYR545 aromatic system and (2) conservation of the pharmacologically essential interactions with gyrase's catalytic pocket and divalent cation. Cross-conformational docking analysis revealed persistent pharmacophore compatibility and binding site plasticity between 5CDR and 2XCT gyrase states, highlighting the mechanistic importance of conserved hydration-shell interactions and charge-based stabilization in molecular recognition.

The divergent biosynthesis of vitamin D and tachysterol from pre-vitamin D, leveraging positional or geometric isomerization, is a powerful exemplar. Inspired by this venerable blueprint, a deconjugative isomerization of borylated dienoates has been developed under the auspices of photochemical activation. Alleviating ground-state thermochemical restrictions through light-induced reactivity enables facile bifurcation of the diene and carbonyl chromophores: this occurs by a sequential geometric isomerization / [1,5]-hydrogen shift sequence that emulates pre-vitamin D photobiology. Broad functional group tolerance is observed, allowing the process to be leveraged in complex settings that would otherwise require multi-step approaches.

In this work, we present an automated approach to determine \u03bb by implementing the Dis- crete Picard Condition (DPC), a method designed to stabilize solutions for ill-posed inverse problems. DPC ensures that the decay rate of the solution coefficients aligns with the singular values of the fitting matrix, enabling ro- bust regularization without manual intervention. We validate this method by comparing intermolecular interactions for water dimers and ionic liquid systems against reference quantum mechanical and previously reported data. Results demonstrate that DPC-derived \u03bb values yield interaction energies in close agreement with manually optimized parameters, achieving agreeable er- rors for most ABSs.

Notably, the conductance of junctions comprising an osmium(IV) wire can also be electrochemically modulated by a factor of 47, to values 80\u00d7 higher than for a silane analogue, by opening the bias window asymmetrically about the electrode Fermi level. Our experimental results are supported by first principles calculations, which predict the osmium(IV) wires can be substantially more conductive than their all-organic counterparts while also identifying specific challenges associated with modelling frozen tetraaryl compound geometries. Together, this work highlights the promising potential of transition metal tetraaryl complexes as isotropically conducting building blocks for functional circuits and extended materials.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Organometallic Compounds; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Enhancing the performance of n-type OMIECs is crucial for advancing next-generation technologies that rely on mixed conduction, including bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and energy storage. Here, we investigate how blending two n-type conjugated polymers with oligoglycol and alkyl side chains impacts OECT performance. Specifically, we examine NDI(biOE2)-T2, which has branched oligoglycol side chains, and N2200, which has branched alkyl side chains. Blending these polymers in a 90:10 NDI(biOE2)-T2:N2200 ratio results in a twofold increase in the electronic mobility volumetric capacitance product (\u03bcC*) compared to pure NDI(biOE2)-T2. However, at higher N2200 concentrations, the \u03bcC* product declines sharply. The enhancement in \u03bcC* arises from an increase in electronic mobility (\u03bc), likely due to reduced polymer swelling upon N2200 addition. Using nanoscale infrared imaging with photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM), we visualize the spatial distribution of the two polymers and observe that higher N2200 content leads to phase separation, contributing to the drop in \u03bcC*.

While smooth trends exist for properties like total and formation energies, bandgaps exhibit inherent fragmentation, leading models to memorize localized correlations rather than learn universal physical laws.

In this work, a schema-based extraction is attempted for which an object-oriented fatigue data schema is designed. The schema provides labels, definitions and type-constraints for the target entities as contextual domain knowledge to the VLM/RLM model. The importance of nuanced target field definitions within the schema and constrained decoding is explored. Furthermore, the schema-based approach is gradually extended to form two agentic language model systems, one which utilizes a step-wise, human-inspired approach to first determine discriminative cues from fatigue S-N diagrams and one further applying dynamic knowledge augmentation. The latter dynamic workflow exploits the synergy of reasoning language models and ontologies by performing logical reasoning and web-search for dynamic knowledge augmentation and hallucination detection.

Through comprehensive structural analysis combining pair distribution function analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and solid-state NMR, we uncover the molecular basis for this superior performance. Comparative studies with analogous thiol-free Zr-MOFs reveal that DMSA's thiol groups enable strong covalent sulfur-arsenic interactions. Moreover, DFT calculations and XAS analysis illuminate an unexpected mechanism; framework defects, namely dangling DMSA ligands in the MOF pores, enhance As(III) chelation. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that high crystallinity is essential for MOF performance, suggesting instead that controlled defect engineering can dramatically enhance functional properties.

In particular, the multilayer-dependent degradation behaviour of phosphorene in the presence of common environmental species such as hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and hydroxyl (OH) has received little attention. In this work, we perform a systematic density functional theory (DFT) investigation to explore how these chemical species interact with monolayer to 4-layer phosphorene, including systems with and without phosphorus vacancies.

To understand this difference, we have studied short o-arylenes with different sequences of benzene and pyrazine units.

At 1500\u202f\u00b0C and 1550\u202f\u00b0C, iron (Fe) nucleates as dendrites via supersaturation-driven anisotropic growth within a liquid slag pool, mechanism usually reported during cooling events rather than H2 reduction of iron ore. The solid Fe layer, however, inhibits reduction and the maximum reduction degree reached after 20 min is 70%. In contrast, at 1590\u202f\u00b0C, Fe precipitates exclusively as spherical droplets, marking a transition to fully liquid-state reduction. Convection driven by temperature-induced surface tension gradients, possibly Marangoni convection, facilitates Fe droplet migration toward cooler crucible regions, enabling a distinct slag-metal separation. Additionally, while this mechanism is know in metallurgical processes, this is the first report of it during H2-driven iron ore reduction. DFT-based molecular dynamics reveal a ~61% increase in the diffusivity of oxygen atoms in liquid FeO at 1500\u202f\u00b0C compared to solid-state conditions at 1300\u202f\u00b0C, supporting the observed enhancement in reduction kinetics once FeO is in the liquid state. This is reflected in the high reduction degree of ~90%, metallization degree of ~86%, and microstructural uniformity achieved at 1590\u202f\u00b0C.

Notably, reactions with lower activation barriers exhibit smaller relative rate enhancements. Furthermore, local heating contributions dominate for low-barrier reactions while the vibrationally-assisted component is more prominent for high-barrier reactions (precise statements of what low- and high- barriers depend on thermal diffusivity of the solvent).

Multiple electronic states are suggested to play a significant role in the decomposition of HEMs. Therefore, exploring both ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces (PESs) describing the dissociation processes is essential for gaining mechanistic insight. 1- nitropene (NP) can be considered as a minimal model for studying the photochemistry of nitro compounds such as nitrobenzene (NB) and ortho-nitrotoluene (oNT). The photochemical pathways of trans- and cis-NP starting from the lowest bright state, have been investigated using the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method combined with second-order perturbative energy corrections (CASPT2). This involves the optimization of various stationary points and minimum energy crossing points on the PESs of relevant singlet and triplet electronic states. Our results sug- gest that both the trans and cis isomers have similar photo-decay channels except in the case of cis-NP, additional excited-state intramolecular hydrogen transfer (ESIHT) path competes with dissociation and reduces the yield of photoproducts. A total of four distinct energy transfer channels have been identified on the S 1 PES for both the trans and cis isomers of NP: (1) adiabatic pathways leading to NO 2 ( 2 B 2 ), (2) inter- system crossing to the lowest triplet state (3) internal conversion to the ground-state reactant in trans-NP or a hydrogen-transferred product in cis-NP, and (4) internal con- version resulting in dissociated photoproducts. Among the four processes, intersystem crossing has been found to be dominant, suggesting a high triplet quantum yield. The molecule on the ground state can undergo nitro-nitrite isomerization followed by the dissociation into NO and CH 3 \u2013CH\u2013CHO. Two different mechanisms are identified for the nitro-nitrite isomerization: one involves a roaming transition state characterized by the partially dissociated NO 2 moiety, and the other proceeds through a conventional transition state.

The architecture we have developed, the Cartesian Equivariant Orbital Network (CEONet), shows how molecular orbital coefficients are readily featurized as equivariant node features common to all graph-based machine learned potentials. We find that CEONet performs well at predicting difficult quantitative labels such as the orbital energy and orbital entropy. Furthermore, we find that the CEONet representation provides an intuitive latent space for differentiating orbital character for the qualitative assignment of e.g. bonding or antibonding character. In addition to providing a useful representation for further integrating deep learning with electronic structure theory, we expect CEONet to be useful for automatizing and interpreting the results of advanced electronic structure methods such as complete active space self-consistent field theory.

It is found in all vertebrates and many invertebrates. It is localized in the Golgi apparatus, and in the extra cellular space. It functions in the biosynthesis of a diverse group of cellular proteins that includes hormones, growth factors, matrix metalloproteases, and coagulation factors.  Additionally many viral pathogens have co-evolved exploiting host cell Furin in the cleavage of their coat proteins and enhancing the viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Furin activates specific proteins by cleaving them at paired basic amino acid site containing the minimal structure of Arg-X-[Arg/Lys]-Arg, where X represents any amino acid. A 20 amino acid definition of the Furin cleavage site was later introduced based on the crystal structure of Furin. Lately, Furin has received much attention, because of the presence of a four amino acid insert \u201cprra\u201d in the spike protein of the Covid-19 pathogen SARS-CoV-2. Together with an adjacent arginine residue the insert created a polybasic \u201cprrar\u201d motif that is favored by Furin for cleavage. Many laboratories have confirmed the involvement of Furin-mediated cleavage of the spike protein at the \u201cprrar\u201d site in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The origins of \u201cprra\u201d insert is unclear because so far no known protein is found to carry \u201cprra\u201d, although many proteins contain other versions of the Furin cleavage site.\u201d  In this study using a combination of BLAST and a previously described software program, compare, the author has identified a large number of GenBank annotated non-viral proteins carrying \u201cprrar\u201d motifs. The search resulted in the identification of several proteins containing \u201cprrar\u201d motif both from bacteria, and higher animals. Interestingly none of the proteins identified are annotated in the GenBank in the context of Furin studies. Therefore the information obtained is new to the investigators. In this report the data are compiled into tables with all the essential information listed for each protein.

A comprehensive suite of electrochemical techniques (chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) and surface characterization methods (SEM, XRD) was employed. The results revealed that WW exhibited enhanced cathodic activity and the formation of a more stable, protective surface film on SS316, attributed to complex ionic interactions that mitigate chloride-induced corrosion. In contrast, SS316 in the NaCl solution showed significant susceptibility to passive layer breakdown and localized corrosion.

F4_MIL-140A(Ce), a recently discovered MOF, displays a cooperative CO2 adsorption mechanism driven by concerted rotation of the aromatic rings of the tetrafluoroterephthalate linkers, giving rise to a step-shaped isotherm. Here, we shed light on the key role played by the degree of fluorination of the organic linker in such mechanism by synthesising novel Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) (x = 2 or 3) analogues and characterising them with a wide range of experimental techniques, including in situ powder X-ray diffraction, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas sorption analysis, in situ infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry. We found that reducing the degree of fluorination of the linker switches off the cooperative adsorption mechanism observed in the perfluorinated prototype, leading to conventional Langmuir-type CO2 isotherms for Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) and lower CO2/CH4 selectivity. No structural response is triggered by CO2 adsorption in Fx_MIL-140A(Ce), despite the availability of similar adsorption sites to those found in perfluorinated F4_MIL-140A(Ce), i.e., CeIV open metal sites generated upon removal of the coordinated water found in the as-synthesised MOFs. Reduced steric hindrance around these sites in Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) MOFs makes them accessible already at low pressure, thus bypassing the concerted ring rotation underpinning the cooperative CO2 adsorption mechanism.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Solid State Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These monomers are in high demand in various industries, including additives in polymer production, cosmetics, and flavoring. PADs offer an efficient and scalable method for producing these compounds under mild reaction conditions. Establishing a viable industrial process requires a thermostable enzyme that shows robustness under operational conditions. Therefore, in this study, we assessed five thermostable ancestors towards their activity and stability for conversion of ferulic acid and sinapic acid at different temperatures. A combinatorial active site library was prepared for the most thermostable ancestor. Among the diverse hydroxystyrene monomers, especially 4-vinyl syringol (4-VS) the decarboxylation product from sinapic acid, exhibits interesting properties. Its polymers demonstrate similar thermal stability characteristics and higher glass transition temperatures compared to those based on vinyl guaiacol, the decarboxylation product from ferulic acid. For this potential, we expanded the substrate scope of the selected PAD ancestor to include sinapic acid through directed mutagenesis. A trade-off between ferulic/caffeic acid and sinapic acid was observed and further investigated via molecular dynamics simulations. The most thermally stable ancestor was identified with a half-life time of 3.65 days, analyzed at 50 \u00b0C. We found the Ile29Ser-Leu80Ser-Ile93Ala triple mutation (SSA) to effectively expand the substrate scope with an almost 7-fold increase in activity for sinapic acid, with a half-life time of 1.12 days at 50 \u00b0C, being approximately 1,610-fold higher than the PAD from Bacillus subtilis.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we present a mild and sustainable photocatalytic method for depolymerizing sodium lignosulfonate (LS) using sodium anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQ2S), a non-toxic, water-soluble, and commercially available photocatalyst. The reaction proceeds under UV LED irradiation at room temperature and ambient pressure in saline aqueous media, including untreated Baltic Sea seawater, without the need for organic solvents, acids, bases, or hazardous additives.

Computational methods at the density functional theory (DFT) level provide insight into the reaction mechanism and catalyst behavior, showing that in the absence of salt, AQ2S is deactivated via hydroxylation reactions. Conversely, in saline media it remains catalytically active in mediating LS depolymerization. The process is successful while yielding lower-molecular-weight lignin fragments, as confirmed by SEC, UV-vis spectroscopy, NMR, and FTIR, with evidence of decreased aromaticity and preserved structural motifs.

Investigations to date have focused on the 20-carbon eicosanoids and 22-carbon docosanoids. However, more recently, interest has grown into the 18-carbon octadecanoids. A significant obstacle in the study of these compounds is a lack of authentic standards for functional studies as well as for development of methods for their quantification. To address this limitation, we developed a fast and simple one step synthetic strategy to produce mono-hydroxylated metabolites based on the photosensitized oxidation of 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Four different PUFAs including \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA, \u03c93), \u03b3-linolenic acid (GLA, \u03c96), stearidonic acid (SDA, \u03c93), and octadecapentaenoic acid (ODPA, \u03c93) were photooxidized in the presence of methylene blue and oxygen under exposure of light from a halogen lamp. The uncommon PUFA ODPA was prepared from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, \u03c93) in a 6-step synthesis with 30% overall yield. The hydroperoxide products were reduced with sodium borohydride and the mono-hydroxylated octadecanoids were separated by HPLC. Product identification was performed by GC-MS. The final purities of isolated products ranged from 80-98%, with oxidation of non-terminal double bonds being preferred. It is likely that this approach could be extended to PUFAs of varying chain length, suggesting that photosensitized oxidation could be employed to rapidly prepare hydroperoxides from multiple unsaturated fatty acids.

This large body of work leads to a conclusion that asymmetric OH stretches should be largely silent in sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra. Nonetheless, our recent studies show chiral-specific SFG response of water originated from the first hydration shell of proteins and DNA arising from a sum of equal-magnitude and opposite- phase symmetric and asymmetric OH stretches, resulting in an oppositely-signed couplet. Motivated initially by this apparently inconsistent behavior for chiral-specific versus conventional (achiral) SFG, we demonstrate herein a fundamental argument for the appearance of the oppositely-signed couplets in chiral-specific vibrational SFG. The interplay between two foundational optical relations, Kramers-Kronig relations and Kleinman symmetry, is shown to require the imaginary resonant contributions to the tensors describing chiral-specific SFG responses to collectively sum to zero. In brief, all indices within the surface susceptibility must become interchangeable in the degenerate, zero-frequency limit. From Kramers-Kronig relations connecting the real and imaginary susceptibility, this asymptotic limit in the real susceptibility can only be met if the imaginary-valued resonant contributions over the relevant spectral range sum to zero. These symmetry constraints were found to agree with density functional theory calculations on small water clusters and with experimental and computational phase-resolved chiral-specific SFG spectra. These symmetry requirements provide constraints for analyzing phase-resolved chiral-specific SFG spectra for extracting structural information about chiral molecules at interfaces.", "date": "2025-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Optics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Due to its multiplicative nature, \ud835\udc611-noise presents a particular challenge for NA samples, as cross-peaks from correlated spins may be obscured by noise contributions from uncorrelated nuclei, leading to spectral ambiguities and compromised data interpretation. Here, we introduce a novel strategy to suppress \ud835\udc611-noise in 13C -13C DQ-SQ correlation spectroscopy acquired on samples at NA. The method relies on converting DQ coherences into longitudinal two-spin order (\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67-terms), allowing the selective elimination of transverse magnetization from uncoupled 13C nuclei via a \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67-filter.

By exploiting the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs, the diazonium salts were efficiently grafted onto the nanoparticle surface without the use of external reducing agents or photocatalysts. Optimization of experimental parameters, such as irradiation wavelength, power, and reaction time, enabled rapid and robust functionalization while minimizing nanoparticle degradation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that both hot electron generation and localized photothermal effects contribute to the grafting process. The method was successfully extended to other diazonium salts, with calix[4]arene derivatives yielding densely packed, highly stable organic shells. Compared to conventional chemical reduction, this laser-assisted approach significantly reduces reaction time and reagent consumption. Overall, the method provides a fast, efficient, and versatile strategy for the covalent functionalization of plasmonic nanoparticles in suspension.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanodevices; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The present study investigates the process of formation of a thin iron oxide shell from an iron nitrate ethanolic solution. The results of this study indicate that the formation of the shell appears to initiate by the attachment of iron cations to specific, though unidentified binding sites on the silica surface. Once these sites are fully occupied, further incorporation of iron appears to cease. In order to examine how synthesis conditions affect shell thickness, a 2\u00b2 factorial design was utilized to vary the water content in ethanol and the concentration of the iron precursor. Shell thickness was estimated from the diameters of particles measured in scanning electron microscopy images. The results indicate that, subsequent to the initial binding of iron to the silica surface, alterations in the amount of water or the concentration of the precursor do not result in the continued growth of the shell. This finding suggests that the primary factor impeding shell formation is the number of available binding sites on the silica surface.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, zeolite catalyst deactivation by the concentrated alkali metals in these feedstocks is a critical technical challenge limiting the implementation of such strategies at scale. Further complicating this challenge is the lack of fundamental, scientific knowledge around the behavior of concentrated alkali metals in zeolite catalysts, as the petroleum industry where zeolites are utilized most prevalently operates at low levels of metal contaminants. To bridge this knowledge gap and probe the possibility of operating biomass conversion processes at higher levels of alkali contaminants (>1000 ppm), we incorporated controlled amounts of potassium into ZSM-5 catalysts via wet impregnation with KNO3. The pristine framework had a silicon to aluminum ratio of 26 with a corresponding Bronsted acid site density 956.7 mmol/g as determined by ammonia titration and temperature programed desorption. We show that as potassium accumulates up to 2 wt% on the catalyst, the Br\u00f8nsted acid site density decreases proportionally, consistent with the known tendency of alkali metal ions to titrate acid sites. However, when only 50% of the acid sites are titrated (1 wt% potassium), the carbon yield of aromatics from pine wood biomass decrease from 18% to nearly zero, suggesting a change in the per-site selectivity of the remaining acid sites. To investigate this effect, we carried out reaction kinetics studies using ethanol dehydration into hydrocarbons as a probe into the rates of dehydration, carbon-carbon coupling and hydride transfer reactions. We demonstrate that the per-proton rates of reverse-beta scission reactions (carbon-carbon coupling) decrease rapidly as potassium accumulates in the framework, explaining the decreased aromatic yields from biomass over partially exchanged ZSM-5. We furthermore carried out x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, finding that the binding energies of O1s electrons in framework oxygens decreased with incorporation of up to 10 wt% potassium, suggesting a change in the electronegativity of anionic oxygens at Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. We show that the per-proton activity of reverse beta scission reactions correlate with this decrease in framework electronegativity as potassium accumulates in the catalyst. We interpret these results to suggest that potassium ions polarize surrounding framework oxygens and weaken the binding energy of more electronegative olefins at nearby acid sites. Consistent with our hypothesis, we show that ethanol dehydration at an elevated temperature of 500\u00b0C yields less aromatics with increasing potassium content in the ZSM-5; and that this yield decrease is proportional to the O1s binding energy determined by XPS. We demonstrate that processing ZSM-5 with up to 10 wt% potassium in concentrated HNO3 removes all but 0.5 wt% of K+ ions, regenerating a corresponding amount of framework surface area and acid site density without removing detectible amounts of framework Al nor destroying the ZSM-5 crystal structure. However, the electronegativity decrease effected by wet impregnation of potassium is only partially reversed by acid leeching, suggesting that some initial catalyst deactivation impacts may not be fully reversible.

This work focuses on the use of machine learned force fields (MLFFs) to model CO\u2082 adsorption in flexible MOFs, with a focus on SIFSIX-3-Cu, an anion-pillared MOF known for its high CO2 affinity. A preliminary high-throughput screening of over 900 anion-pillared MOFs was performed using rigid UFF+DDEC6 force fields to predict zero-loading heats of adsorption for CO2 and H2O. SIFSIX-3-Cu was selected for further computational study due to its predicted CO2 heat of adsorption and experimental relevance. A DeePMD-based MLFF was trained to reproduce DFT (PBE+D3) energies and forces, with an iterative sampling scheme combining molecular dynamics, geometry optimization, random geometric insertion and NVT Monte Carlo-based configuration generation to capture both attractive and repulsive regions of the potential energy surface. Flexibility of the MOF was explicitly included, contrasting with previous models approximating the MOF as rigid. Hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations with the MLFF produced CO2 adsorption isotherms in good agreement with experimental data at direct air capture (DAC) pressures (e.g., 40 Pa), in contrast to previous overestimations of CO2 sorption by models with rigid structures. Bond and angle histogram analysis showed that MOF flexibility increased the variance of fluorine-fluorine diagonal distances at adsorption sites, resulting in a lower predicted sorption for flexible, asymmetric SIFSIX-3-Cu pore geometries as compared to the rigid, symmetric DFT-optimized SIFSIX-3-Cu pore geometry. A detailed description of flexibility afforded by the MLFF resulted in an accurately predicted CO2 uptake (1.05 mmol/g) at low pressure (40 Pa) compared to the experimentally measured value (1.24 mmol/g). These results underscore the importance of including framework flexibility when modeling adsorption phenomena in MOFs, particularly for low pressure applications.", "date": "2025-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While consistent improvements have been made in rationalizing experimental OER activity and selectivity trends -- even qualitatively predicting OER performance -- the community has been unable to sufficiently describe or predict material aqueous (in)stability and degradation mechanisms, despite their importance to device lifetime and thus economic viability. In this work, we investigate the interplay, or lack thereof, between OER activity and material aqueous stability across rutile oxides, with a particular focus on iridum oxide (IrO2). By developing a Born-Haber thermodynamic cycle analogous to the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, we enable facile prediction of the thermodynamic driving force for metal dissolution as a function of the applied bias and electrolyte conditions.  We apply machine learning techniques, including principal component analysis and symbolic regression, to analyze trends across rutile oxides and find that key thermodynamic descriptors for OER activity and material aqueous stability are only very weakly correlated. Instead, the local atomic environment -- especially electronic structure signatures for interactions between the active site and its neighbors -- play a more important role in predicting material aqueous stability. Leveraging these insights, we investigate the impact of doping IrO2 with a range of transition metals and show that the stability of Ir active sites can be tuned largely independently of its predicted OER activity. These insights lay the foundation for material design to improve stability with respect to corrosion, with the ultimate aim to enhance long-term stability without sacrificing catalytic performance in the OER.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Energy Storage; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One example is the production of pellets from organic materials, like wood residues and cereal grains, for biofuel and animal feed applications. However, the handling and processing of these organic powders is complex, and the binding mechanisms between particles remain poorly understood at physicochemical level. In this work, we address this knowledge gap by analyzing the energy consumption of physicochemical binding mechanisms during reactive extrusion of biomass pellets, by conducting experiments in an industrially relevant pilot plant. Understanding the mechanisms that drive this agglomeration process under various conditions and within various application domains are therefore important subjects of research into granular material dynamics. \n\nWe focus on the heat flow into the organic ingredients during the agglomeration process induced by reactive extrusion and find that not all the heat increases the product temperature. Instead, some heat is absorbed by internal changes such as phase transitions or chemical reactions. We identify that the energy absorption mechanism changes significantly once the material reaches the so-called stickiness temperature (T \u2217). Below T \u2217, the ingredient temperature increases linearly with the energy input and pellets do not bind well; above T \u2217, the material absorbs energy to undergo transformations that greatly improve the agglomerate strength. \n\nOur findings indicate how further work can probe agglomeration kinetics in more detail and show that industrial processes can fine-tune product quality by controlling heat flow during steam conditioning and extrusion.

Almost invariably, an atomic orbital basis is specified (through a set of fixed parameters that might be optimized) and this basis is used to construct an overlap metric matrix which is then used to construct the Hamiltonian matrix. However, the electronic Schrodinger equation which is solved usually proceeds to assume the basis set was orthogonal (i.e., the overlap metric matrix is set to an identity in the solution of the electronic Schordinger equation). This led early on to the assertion that the parameterized Hamiltonian corresponded to a Lowdin-orthogonalized basis (as atomic-like as possible while being orthonormal). Workers have repeatedly tried to improve the behavior of semiempirical methods by explicit or implicit orthogonalization, with varying degrees of success. We take a radically different viewpoint in this work, rejecting the assertion that one has any hope to determine the basis which corresponds to the parameterized Hamiltonian. Free of the chains of this common assertion, we can exploit the uncertainty in the basis to regularize fitting of the semiempirical parameters. Specifically, we show that the accuracy of a semiempirical method can be improved by demanding that it is stationary (or as much so as possible) with respect to general linear basis transformations. This correction replicates the invariance of ab initio results with respect to such transformations and sets the stage for new strategies to fitting semiempirical Hamiltonians.", "date": "2025-07-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In contrast, analagous FROMP copolymerizations to produce soluble thermoplastics containing polar repeat units have yet to be explored. Herein, we report the frontal copolymerization of cyclooctadiene (COD) with 1\u20135 mol % of a lower ring-strain oxazolidinone-fused cyclooctene (Oxa) to synthesize polybutadiene-based copolymers. As expected, as the Oxa loading increased, the front velocity decreased by up to 50% and maximum front temperature decreased by ~16 \u00b0C compared to pCOD homopolymer. While the degradation and glass transition temperatures were minimally affected, the polar Oxa units greatly influenced crystallization and tensile properties of the resulting materials. In particular, the ductility dramatically increased from 220% strain at break for pCOD to 1900% for copolymers with 5 mol % Oxa. This study provides an easy method to incorporate polar functionality into ubiquitous polyolefins and further demonstrates the impact of dipoles on material properties towards future applications.

Here, we report an easily tunable biomimetic multicatalytic system combining robust Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and simple, commercially available (hydro)quinone-type co-catalysts, which mimics the cooperative action of enzyme/coenzyme pairs in a confined environment. A Zr-MOF-808/1,8-Dihydroxynaphthalene semiheterogeneous system enables the aerobic oxidation of anilines to azoxybenzenes, products that are typically elusive under aerobic conditions, with excellent yields and selectivity. Ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) triggers the formation of active oxidation sites in the MOF/(hydro)quinone interface, able to generate reactive oxygen species from O2 under mild conditions without the need for light or other external stimuli. The generality of this novel multicatalytic approach is demonstrated by expanding it to different reactions and catalytic systems. In particular, the aerobic oxidation of thiols to disulfides is achieved by changing the organic co-catalyst, whereas benzylamines are aerobically oxidized to their corresponding coupled products by employing a Ti-based MOF (Ti-MIL-125).

It is argued that this is justified by the different nature of nuclear motion compared to electronic structure, which must be described quantum-mechanically. The underlying approximation leads directly to the theory that is mainly used nowadays to simulate chemical reactions.

This study investigates a formic acid (FA) production process through CO2 hydrogenation, mediated by amines. Appropriate selection of the mediating amines is a crucial factor that determines the economic feasibility of the system, since the amount of steam energy required in the purification process of FA depends significantly on the FA-amine interactions. In this study, a systematic screening process for identifying the optimal amine which enhances FA production while minimizing energy consumption, is proposed. The four-step screening process comprises the following: 1) a preliminary screening step based on boiling points and pKa values, 2) COSMO-RS simulations for examining the azeotropic points, 3) rigorous VLE experiments to model the FA-amine relationships, and 4) process modeling to determine the FA production efficiency of candidate amine systems. Experimental VLE data confirmed the presence of azeotropes in most FA-amine systems, highlighting the need of exploration for efficient separation techniques, including pressure-swing distillation (PSD). 1-butylimidazole emerged as the most promising SA for recovering only the light component, while 1-ethylimidazole was optimal for recovering both light and heavy components, providing a cost-effective solution due to the azeotrope's pressure sensitivity in a binary system with FA.

These compartments spatially sequester enzymes within semi-permeable shell proteins, and are packed full of enzyme cargoes and metabolites as they fulfill their function. Coupling together recent SAXS and proteomics work, it is possible to develop molecular models for these microcompartments and interrogate enzyme and metabolite dynamics within.  Our primary goal of this study is to quantify the permeability of metabolite Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) across the BMC shell through classical molecular dynamics simulation.  The Haliangium ochraceum model of BMC shell (PDB: 6MZX) was used to modeling an intact BMC of approximately 10 million atoms.  Working at this scale presented its own challenges in managing large datasets, with multiple challenges and hardware advances discussed that facilitated this work. Over approximately 750ns of aggregate simulation, we see multiple permeation events for these metabolites that were added at high concentration through the pores. When compared to independent permeability estimates for the same metabolites determined through replica exchange umbrella sampling simulations, the permeabilities varied by approximately three orders of magnitude. Regardless, the permeability coefficients for both G3P and DHAP are highly similar and very high, such that only very small concentration gradients can be maintained across the BMC shell between the cytosol and BMC interior. The large simulation systems also facilitated comparisons for molecular diffusivity in the crowded environment within the BMC shell. By our estimates, the viscosity within a packed BMC shell is at least ten-fold higher than it would be in neat solution, and is the real driver for varying permeability estimates we obtain through simulation. These findings will be used as design inputs for future bioengineering efforts to make products from BMCs.

Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), a widely used ceramic, is particularly sensitive to such defects at the atomic scale. In this work, to investigate these nanoscale features in YSZ we employ Atom Probe Tomography (APT) focusing on the Local Atomistic Environment (LAE) of yttrium atoms. We introduce a computational framework that constructs atomic neighborhoods using Voronoi tessellations, represents them as graphs, and quantifies their structure through customizable signature functions. These signature functions, when integrated with unsupervised learning techniques, enable the extraction of meaningful patterns and defect signatures from APT datasets. By representing LAEs as graph-based structures, our approach captures intricate local details of composition, coordination, and connectivity. This representation is particularly effective for indirectly identifying defects such as oxygen vacancies. Our analysis reveals significant differences in yttrium environments of YSZ sample at grain boundaries compared to those within grains, with grain boundary regions showing fewer and less connected oxygen ions. Additionally, we distinguish between two distinct types of grain boundaries of YSZ sample based on their local atomic environments. Finally, we demonstrate that a graph based order parameter derived from the LAE enables the detection of subtle variations in oxygen ion coordination and connectivity features indicative of potential vacancies that are otherwise difficult to resolve. While applied here to YSZ, the framework is generalizable to other material systems.

A wave-optics-based approach was developed to extract both the dielectric function and the chirality admit-tance function from infrared and VCD spectra. VCD is defined as the difference in negative decadic transmittance between left- and right-circularly polarized light, preserving linear de-pendence on optical path length even within wave optics. For classical interpretation, Max Born\u2019s oscillator model\u2014featuring magnetically coupled, perpendicularly arranged damped oscillators\u2014was applied. Using this model, infrared and VCD spectra could be simultaneous-ly fitted, enabling the extraction of oscillator strengths, damping constants, transition frequen-cies, coupling constants, and intermolecular distances. The resulting methodology extends dispersion analysis to chiral materials and enhances our understanding of their optical behav-ior. The second part of the project aims to develop an achiral substrate, such as elliptical na-nopores in a gold film, that can be used to measure the chiral response, mainly VCD of chiral molecules under the illumination of linearly polarized light. This structure should generate chiral optical near fields locally in the proximity of the nanostructures under linear polarized excitation. This avoids most of the noises from chiral light and chiral structures and also would enable circular dichroism measurement on an optical microscope, which is not friendly for circularly polarized light. We have studied two different structures. The first structure is the originally proposed elliptical nanopores on a gold film. We optimized and characterized the chiral optical field generated in the nanohole and measured the transmission spectrum of R6G dye molecules and found clear Raman signals. We have also explored the possibility of using the elliptical nanopores for enantioselective optical trapping. We theoretically showed that polymer nanobeads coated with densely packed chiral surfactants can be trapped or re-pelled by the elliptical nanoholes according to the handedness of the near field relative to the handedness of the surfactants, making the elliptical nanohole illuminated by linearly polarized light an enantioselective optical trap. This part has been published. In the second structure, we show a single achiral dielectric disc array covered with diagonally aligned stripes can be used as a simple scheme for circular dichroism with linearly polarized light. This approach is particularly useful for using cavity-ring down spectroscopy for circular dichroism measure-ment because in cavity-ring down spectroscopy, circularly polarized light cannot survive. Therefore, our approach of using well-designed dielectric nanostructures to locally covert linearly polarized light with extremely low scattering, low absorption and low depolarization becomes very attractive.

The proposed dual-site BET (DSBET) isotherm model is described in detail, along with multiple possible simplifications for real systems, including modeling humid carbon capture (CO2/H2O mixtures) using amine-functionalized chemisorbents and activated alumina. These simplifications allow nonideal binary equilibrium predictions of single-site Langmuir or dual-site Langmuir isotherm models (type-1 isotherms) coadsorbing with type-2 or type-3 isotherms as either a single-site BET or a dual-site BET isotherm model. The GAB isotherm could also be utilized in the proposed model via a change of variables. Many of the same advantages seen by the extended dual-site Langmuir isotherm are found for the dual-site BET isotherm. These include at least two distinct multicomponent equilibrium predictions per binary gas pairing and the ability to predict nonideal coadsorption. The choice of nonlinearity parameters (and their corresponding adsorption-site) is discussed along with their implications in coadsorption equilibrium prediction.

After breaking down intact biomass through physical or chemical means, the resulting pretreatment product contains a wide variety of small molecules that can be funneled into engineered microbes that convert these building blocks into preferred products. Zymomonas mobilis is one such biorefinery chassis, which is resistant to ethanol stress but may be inhibited by organic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and amides found in biomass hydrolysate.  One hypothesis is that these molecules interact with or disrupt the bacterial membrane, triggering stress responses and hindering growth. To test this hypothesis at the molecular level, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the interactions of small molecules with a biologically relevant Z. mobilis membrane model. Simulations were conducted across a range of inhibitor concentrations from 0\u20132.5 mol%, analyzing key membrane properties such as area per lipid (APL), membrane thickness, lipid order parameter, lateral diffusion coefficient, and permeability coefficient.  From simulation, we observe altered membrane structure and dynamics at high small molecule concentrations. Generally, the membranes become thinner, with a higher area per lipid and lower order parameter as the small molecule concentration increases. These trends are stronger for more hydrophobic molecules with greater hydrophobic bulk, as isobutanol, propanol, and propanoic acid showed greater membrane perturbations as the concentration increased compared with other small molecules. Tracking small molecule distributions directly in our equilibrium simulations allows us to determine concentration-dependent free energy profiles for these molecules. While the trends are noisy, generally the barriers to crossing the membrane decrease as the concentration increases, indicating that the membranes become leakier as small molecule concentrations rise. Comparing between native Z. mobilis membranes with hopanoids and membranes sharing the same phospholipid composition but without hopanoids, hopanoids stabilize and order the membrane for smaller molecules to maintain membrane structure, but appear insufficient for larger hydrophobic molecules like isobutanol. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how small molecules found in biomass degradation streams interact with the Z. mobilis membrane, offering valuable insights for future strain engineering efforts to optimize biofuel and bioproduct synthesis from biomass feedstocks. Modifying membrane composition could enhance microbial robustness, improving microbial survival and thus yields in industrial contexts.

Most compounds entering the clinic represent already discovered classes of compounds, to which bacteria have already established resistance mechanisms. We urgently need novel therapeutic modalities to address these resistances. Targeted protein degradation, typified by the highly successful proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is a promising approach that has already been successfully employed in oncology. Recently, the development of bacterial PROTACs (BacPROTACs) has shown that this modality can also be adapted to bacteria. A significant hurdle faced by these methods, however, is the complexity inherent in recruiting the host cell\u2019s proteolytic processes. We herein describe an approach where the proteolysis is performed directly by a light-activated ruthenium complex, termed LAMP-D (Light-Activated Metal-dependent Protein Degradation), thus circumventing the need for ligase recruitment. Additionally, this method allows precise spatiotemporal control of protein degradation and may be adapted to degrade other proteins of interest. In a proof-of-concept study, New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) was chosen as a target protein for LAMP-D inhibition and degradation. NDM-1 is employed by Gram-negative bacteria to hydrolyse and inactivate \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and is considered one of the most clinically relevant \u03b2-lactamase targets due to its global prevalence. In in vitro assays, the complex Ru1 demonstrated a greater than 100-fold improvement in NDM-1 inhibition on exposure to light (450 nm, 20 J cm-2). Detailed analysis by SDS-PAGE, intact mass spectrometry and trypsin digest mass spectrometry show that Ru1 induces highly specific degradation of the protein adjacent to the active site. Ru1 was shown to inhibit NDM-1 in Escherichia coli expressing NDM-1 and demonstrated excellent rescue of antibiotic activity upon co-treatment with meropenem, exhibiting a 53-fold improvement in meropenem MIC with light irradiation (450 nm, 60 J cm-2). Furthermore, the complex was found to be highly selective, exhibiting no toxicity toward mammalian cells. Given the versatility, specificity, and controllability of LAMP-D, we believe that this degradation strategy will find broad application in combating antibiotic resistance and beyond.\n", "date": "2025-07-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Compared to conventional thermochemical DAC methods, electrochemically induced CO2 capture and release using redox-active sorbents is particularly attractive due to the significantly reduced energy consumption as it operates under ambient conditions. However, the limited availability of redox- active sorbents that are both oxygen-tolerant and highly water-soluble across a broad pH range (4\u2013 14) has long hindered the development of such electrochemical DAC systems. Herein, we report electrochemically induced DAC using a redox-mediated aqueous flow system that incorporates a solid proton\u2013electron carrier (SPEC) undergoing a proton-coupled electron transfer process. The new design physically isolates the oxygen-sensitive SPEC from air while allowing the oxygen- tolerant aqueous alkaline solution to capture ambient CO2, overcoming the oxygen sensitivity issue commonly associated with redox sorbents. Furthermore, the incorporation of SPEC theoretically enhances the volumetric CO2 capture capacity by up to an order of magnitude. In a 21-day, seven- cycle of continuous DAC experiment, the system consistently demonstrated an average CO2 capture capacity of 38.6 mL with a Coulombic efficiency of 100%. Moreover, the CO2 capture capacity was increased fourfold by utilizing more of capacity from SPEC without altering the electrolyte volume or composition. The highest CO2/e molar ratio was 0.54 and the lowest energy consumption for CO2 release and sorbent regeneration was 175.8 kJ mol-1 .

Kurur", "abstract": "Singlet states in NMR are discovered earlier and they show greater lifetime as compare to normal spin lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) relaxation time constants. Singlet states have to be sustained by the application of pulses which serve to remove the chemical shift while retaining the coupling. This is usually achieved by applying a continuous wave (CW) radiofrequency field to remove the chemical shift difference between the two spins. A windowed alternative (multiple \u03c0 pulses with larger delay than pulse length for sustaining the long lived states-WDW) is considered here because of the power deposition in the sample, which leads to deleterious effects on the sample, would be lesser than the CW sequence. We have studied the efficiency of various composite pulse sequences, developed for heteronuclear decoupling or isotropic mixing, for sustaining singlet states. CW, WDW, WALTZ-16, FLOPSY-8 and MLEV-16 sustaining pulses were used for sustaining the long-lived states or singlet states in two spin systems, one with weak J- coupling, dibromothiophene (DBT), and another with strong J- coupling, citric acid. On comparing experimental and simulated data we inferred that WALTZ-16 sustaining pulse is working well (compared for TLLS values at on resonance and off resonance) for off-resonance locking of the LLS, whereas CW and WDW locking pulses are not suitable for off resonance locking as LLS decays at faster rate on increasing offset. One could use WDW pulse for sustaining long lived states instead of CW.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Immunotherapy utilizing immune stimulating cytokines such as IL12 holds great promise for the treatment of cancer. However, clinical use of IL12 is hampered due to severe toxicity following systemic administration. We here present a novel treatment strategy in which IL12 is chemically silenced by conjugation to PEG masks that can be released on demand using a bioorthogonal click reaction, restoring the native cytokine. This \u201cclick-to-release\u201d approach is based on the IEDDA pyridazine elimination reaction between a tetrazine and a trans-cyclooctene (TCO). Selective activation in the tumor microenvironment is achieved by pretargeting one component of this reaction to the tumor, triggering local activation of the masked IL12 once it is given in a secondary i.v. injection. Methods. IL12 masking and unmasking was evaluated in vitro with PAGE and HEK-Blue reporter cells and ex vivo with ELISA. Biodistribution in mice was evaluated with I-125 radiolabeling and biotin-click histochemistry.  Results. Several designs were evaluated and optimized in vitro resulting in an IL12-TCO-PEG construct that exhibited superior masking- and subsequent re-activation upon reaction with a tetrazine bound to a TAG-72-targeted diabody. In tumor-bearing mice, we demonstrated that this diabody-tetrazine could efficiently pre-localize tetrazine in the tumor. Administration of IL12-TCO-PEG 24 hrs later afforded efficient and selective unmasking in tumors, but not in blood. Conclusions. These results demonstrate proof of principle of the click-cleavable IL12 prodrug approach and showcase the versatility of the click-to-release reaction.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Underwood", "abstract": "The selective conversion of CH4 and CO2 to liquid fuels is constrained in thermal catalysis by linear scaling relationships, overoxidation of oxygenate intermediates, and irreversible surface poisoning. Nonthermal plasma-enabled catalysis circumvents some of these limitations by introducing non-equilibrium excitation (e.g., vibrational, electronic, and dissociative) of molecular reactants. However, performance remains hindered by catalyst deactivation due to carbon and oxygen accumulation on active sites, driven by distinct mechanisms tied to metal-adsorbate interactions. Here, we show how continuous active-site regeneration during plasma-catalysis can be achieved by coupling plasma-driven dissociative chemisorption with targeted co-reactant activation.  This strategy enables selective removal of surface poisons and is applicable across distinct catalyst regimes. On weakly binding catalysts like Cu, plasma-generated species remove adsorbed oxygen atoms, restore CH3O* intermediates and triple methanol selectivity. On strongly binding catalysts like Ni, accumulated CHx* fragments are selectively removed, doubling C2 hydrocarbon yields by reactivating C-C coupling. Unlike thermal systems, plasma excitation decouples regeneration from equilibrium constraints that correlate adsorption and desorption kinetics to a single gas temperature, enabling continuous, in situ removal of poisons without cycling and disrupting steady-state conversion. Using a combination of surface characterization methods and density functional theory calculations, we identify the mechanism by which plasma-co-reactant synergy tunes surface intermediates and redefines the design space of heterogeneous catalysis under mild conditions (Tsur = 473 K, Tvib = 4200 K, p = 1 atm).", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, even when experiments follow standard guidelines, the Km obtained from nonlinear regression can be substantially inaccurate (differing markedly from the parameter value that would describe noise-free data under the Michaelis\u2013Menten model) while still appearing precise, as indicated by a small standard error (SE). Standard software tools such as GraphPad Prism and Origin report only standard error and offer no way to gauge accuracy. As a result, inaccurate Km values can lead to selecting suboptimal enzyme variants, misestimating inhibitor potency, mispredicting pathway fluxes, or introducing costly inefficiencies in bioprocesses. Here, we address this gap by demonstrating that the binding-isotherm framework, commonly used for affinity constants, can be directly transferred to Km determination, enabling accuracy assessment using the recently developed Accuracy Confidence Interval (ACI) framework. By recasting the classical velocity-versus-substrate fit as a binding-isotherm regression, the method propagates routine concentration uncertainties (\u03b4S0/S0 and \u03b4E0/E0, as supplied by the user) into an interval expected to enclose the model-implied true Km. The workflow requires no additional kinetic experiments and applies across a wide range of enzyme concentrations, including cases where E0 is equal to or greater than Km, thus overcoming key limitations of the traditional Michaelis\u2013Menten formulation. A free, user-friendly web application (https://aci.sci.yorku.ca) fully automates the analysis without requiring custom coding or advanced mathematical expertise. We analyzed synthetic data with known kinetic parameters and showed that Km \u00b1 SE values from standard software can severely underestimate the true uncertainty in Km, whereas the ACI provides reliable bounds for decision-making.

Classical approaches have been limited to measuring the surface forces by recording the effective film thickness as a function of disjoining pressure. However, the molecular origins of these interactions, like the film composition, and the adlayer thickness and structure, has remained elusive. Here we introduce a novel approach that combines UV/Vis, infrared, and Raman spectroscopies in a Thin Film Pressure Balance to provide unique molecular information on the structure of foam films under confinement. Analysis of the IR spectra provides a direct, quantitative, model-free estimation of the water core thickness. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to the adsorbed surfactant species, making it suitable for determining the surface excess and structural changes due to confinement. This combined spectroscopic approach was used to study films stabilised by alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants, where the effects of halide counterions (Br\u00af, Cl\u00af, and F\u00af) as well as the alkyl chain length (C12, C14, and C16) were systematically investigated. Although adsorbed amounts and molecular orientation were shown to be independent of the applied disjoining pressure (up to 6.5 kPa), the identity of the anion had a marked effect on the observed behaviour, with the degree of dissociation in the monolayers ordering as Br\u00af< Cl\u00af< F\u00af, in connection with their abilities to bind to the trimethylammonium headgroup.

While molecular design strategies have focused extensively on enhancing RISC, the spatial dynamics of excitons in the solid state remain less explored. Here, we report direct visualization of exciton diffusion in a crystal of a donor-acceptor type TADF emitter, MA-TA, revealing a counterintuitive phenomenon of negative exciton diffusion, in which the spatial distribution of excitons becomes narrow over time. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and microscopy were employed to track the evolution of singlet and triplet excitons with nanometer-scale resolution. The diffusion coefficient of singlet excitons was found to be two orders of magnitude larger than that of triplet excitons, reflecting distinct transport mechanisms: F\u00f6rster transfer for singlets and Dexter electron exchange for triplets. Crucially, the mean square displacement (MSD) of excitons initially increased but showed a transient decrease around 60 ns, indicating negative diffusion. To elucidate the origin of this behavior, we developed a kinetic model composed of singlet and triplet excitons, which are interconverted by intersystem crossing (ISC) and RISC processes. The simulation quantitatively reproduces the experimental MSD profile and demonstrates that interconversion between excitons with distinct diffusivities gives rise to negative diffusion, in the absence of nonlinear interactions such as triplet\u2013triplet annihilation. These results provide a new mechanistic basis for controlling exciton transport in solid-state materials and indicate that negative diffusion is a ubiquitous feature in systems where mobile and immobile excitons dynamically interconvert.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the corrosion process has previously been shown to be anisotropic, we observe that etching mainly occurs at undercoordinated step edges, rather than into the plane. Such a dependence on the local energetics of the platinum surface atoms is also evident by a pit nucleation barrier on the (100) facet, where nucleation occurs preferentially on dislocations in the crystal lattice. On the (100) facet we also observe an etching instability which results in both rapid downward etching and material redeposition.   The observed nucleation-and-growth nature of cathodic corrosion implies the possibility of directing the process using methods known from electrodeposition.

We have recently demonstrated that simulations using a state-of-the-art force field can accurately describe the thermophysical properties of seawater by employing a detailed chemical model of the solution. Here we extend our previous work by investigating additional properties that require simulations on larger samples and time length scales. First, the extended time and size scales of our simulations allow for a relatively precise determination of the electrical conductivity, a fundamental property of seawater for which accurate experimental data are available, serving as a further test of the employed force field. Second, the incorporation of CO2 to the sample enables us the evaluation of its diffusion coefficient. No experimental measurements or computational simulations have yet provided estimates of carbon dioxide diffusivity at salinity levels and composition representative of actual oceanic environments. To validate our results, we have also determined DCO2 in pure water. Our simulation results show excellent agreement with experimental data in pure water, which reinforces our confidence in the predicted CO2 diffusivity in seawater. This study, provides a rigorous test of the reliability of the Madrid-2019 force field (together with TraPPE for CO2 ) in saline environments.

In H2O/0.1 M Na2SO4, the 2e\u2013 oxidation of C2O42\u2013 yields two CO2 molecules via a classical ECE mechanism, resulting in a single oxidation wave at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl. In contrast, two distinct oxidation waves are observed in DMF/0.1 M TBAP at ~0.1 V and ~0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl. The second wave at more positive potentials in DMF was first assigned by Maran and co-workers to the oxidation of the adduct C2O42\u2013\u2022CO2 formed from generation of CO2 during the first wave. Electronic interaction of C2O42\u2013 and CO2 stabilizes C2O42\u2013, making it more difficult to oxidize than free C2O42\u2013. Herein, we present cyclic voltammetry (CV), finite difference (FD) simulations, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to determine the thermodynamics and kinetics of C2O42\u2013\u2022CO2 formation, as well as the adduct structure. FD simulations of the voltammetric data provide approximate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for C2O42\u2013\u2022CO2 formation in DMF, as well as a new value for the diffusion coefficient of C2O42\u2013 in DMF that differs substantially from previously reported values. Raman spectroscopy directly demonstrates C2O42\u2013\u2022CO2 formation in DMF, while AIMD simulations predict that the solvent-dependent thermodynamics and mechanism for C2O42\u2013 oxidation can be explained by C2O42\u2013\u2013solvent and C2O42\u2013\u2013CO2 interactions. A by-product of this investigation is the prediction from AIMD simulations that the C2O42\u2013\u2022CO2 interaction in DMF destabilizes CO2. Consistent with this finding, cyclic voltammetry demonstrates that the thermodynamic potential for CO2 reduction in DMF at a Hg electrode decreases by ~0.3 V upon addition of C2O42\u2013 to the solution.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Furthermore, data for standard peptides (composed of the 20 canonical amino acids) is more abundant than for modified ones. Thus, we set out to identify whether predictive models fitted to standard data are reliable when applied to modified peptides. To do this, we first considered two critical aspects of the modeling problem, namely, choice of similarity function for guiding dataset partitioning and choice of molecular representation. Similarity-based dataset partitioning is an evaluation technique that divides the dataset into train and test subsets, such that the molecules in the test set are different from those used to fit the model. We demonstrate, across four peptide function prediction tasks, that chemical fingerprint-based similarity measures outperform traditional sequence alignment-based metrics for partitioning standard peptide datasets, challenging usual practices. Similarly, we have found that chemical fingerprints are the best option for building predictive models able to interpolate between classes (standard to standard and modified to modified). Despite a 50% drop in performance, chemical fingerprints are also the best choice in the more challenging extrapolation scenario (standard to modified).

However, they suffer from instability with respect to growth and deactivation via sintering. The atomistic processes which comprise the early stages of sintering are difficult to access, as the timescales are too long for traditional electronic structure calculation methods and too short for most experimental techniques to probe. Pinning via hydroxyl groups has been suggested as a means to stabilize small clusters, but the means and extent of this sintering resistance is currently unclear. In this work, neural network potentials (NNPs), trained at the dispersion-corrected metaGGA level of theory, are employed to probe the dynamic behaviour of sub-nanometre Ptx species (x = 1, 3, 15) on a model flat oxide support: silicatene. We observe that mobility is surprisingly lowest for the single Pt atom and highest for the larger cluster, which influences the sintering routes, leading to non-Ostwald ripening coalescence pathways. When a silanol defect is introduced to the surface, the clusters are stabilised by the defect via hydrogen transfer from the surface to the clusters, thereby suppressing sintering via electrostatic trapping. These findings provide a mechanistic underpinning of sintering routes and stabilisation mechanisms on a model non-reducible oxide support and provide insights into the mechanisms of sub-nanometre metal particle mobility at the atomistic scale.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Clusters; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the original KPGT framework was developed for general molecular property estimation, KPGT-Fluor expands its capabilities by integrating solvent representations, allowing the model to better capture environmental effects that influence dye behavior. KPGT-Fluor demonstrates strong predictive performance, with Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 18.91 nm and 18.56 nm for absorption and emission wavelengths, respectively. For the logarithm of the extinction coefficient and quantum yield, the RMSE values are 0.159 and 0.126, demonstrating high accuracy.

Yet, most supply chain assessments of LNG do not incorporate measurement data. In this work, we develop a probabilistic, geospatial, and measurement informed life cycle assessment model to estimate the GHG EI of global LNG supply chains covering over 90% of LNG trade.

This study establishes that link by quantifying the energy supplied to the bubble through compressive work, and the resulting distribution of that energy as internal energy. Work and internal energy changes are determined by simulating ultrasound-induced bubble expansion and compression. The amount of H2O vapor consumed and the total yield to radical products both increase linearly with the total internal energy change associated with chemical reactions, termed as the reaction energy. This linear trend persists across wide ranges of wave frequency (200-1100 kHz), wave pressure amplitude (1-10 bar), surface tension (20-72 mN m-1), and liquid density (700-1200 kg m-3).

Using three orthogonal descriptors (second eigenvalue \u03bb\u2082, Shannon entropy, and mean run length), we characterize sequence statistics across experimentally achievable synthesis conditions. Parameter space exploration reveals that accessible sequences form a curved three-dimensional manifold with distinct regions accessed by different synthesis strategies.

We demonstrate this framework using cationic polymers for gene delivery, where sequence statistics correlate with transfection efficiency and salt resistance.

This complex exhibits dual charge transfer absorption through well-resolved 2LMCT and 2MLCT absorption bands at 600-800 and 400-500 nm wavelengths, respectively. The dual charge transfer absorber motif combines ligands with a comparatively narrow -* gap, together with a central Fe(III) metal ion with a set of partially filled metal t2g levels capable of acting as both electron acceptors and donors. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that ground state recovery is dominated by conversion from the lower 2LMCT state with a 13 ps time constant, independently of which of the two charge transfer bands is initially excited.  The measurements further reveal that the initial dynamics following excitation into the higher 2MLCT state through 400 nm excitation results in efficient internal conversion into the lower 2LMCT state on a sub-ps timescale. This ultrafast conversion involves a two-electron internal conversion process that changes the orbital configuration from (L)2(t2g)4(L*)1 in the 2MLCT state to (L)1(t2g)6(L*)0 in the 2LMCT state.

REEs are critical for energy, electronics, and defense technologies due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one such source that has attracted interest because of the presence of a wide range of REEs. The concentration of REEs in these sources is, however, dilute (at the ppb level), and while conventional processes, such as solvent extraction, effectively recover them, they are associated with high energy and chemical usage. In this work, a hardwood biochar-based adsorption process is described for REE recovery from AMD. A number of adsorption parameters were tuned to identify the optimum operating conditions, and the biochar was characterized using various morphological and transport-based techniques, using La3+ as a representative REE. The thermodynamic and kinetic interactions of the REEs with the biochar are evaluated based on equilibrium adsorption uptakes and adsorption kinetics, using selected ions with similar size and charge as probe ions. These results demonstrate that intra-REE separation is possible due to differences in the adsorption kinetics behavior of these ions, showing the synergistic role of ion size and charge on the overall performance. Beyond ideal single ion solutions, the biochar performance was also evaluated for synthetic multi-ion solutions and real AMD solutions. Finally, some preliminary results on the weak acid-induced desorption behavior and its effects on biochar reusability were included. Overall, this study shows that biochar adsorption offers an effective, sustainable method for REE recovery from AMD, supporting efforts in developing the domestic REE supply chain while addressing environmental challenges raised by AMD.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Environmental Science; Wastes; Natural Resource Recovery", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Chem. Int. Ed., 2025, 64, e202418884), is shown to gain a significantly improved photocatalytic performance upon ligating iodide instead of chloride to give Pt2(bpia)I3. Upon iodide ligation, the absorption and emission energies both show a red shift basically due to destabilization of the HOMO by mixing of the iodide orbitals having essentially higher orbital energies compared to those of chloride. Consequently, the triplet lifetime and the luminescence quantum yield both decrease by obeying the energy gap law.

Simulation accuracy depends on the parameters employed in the force field. Every new molecule must have parameters generated for it, either by using a general force field or fitting a custom parameter set for that system. While fitting custom parameter sets can provide superior accuracy compared to a general force field, the process of single-molecule force field fitting is often tedious, expensive, and bespoke. We present an automated and iterative procedure for fitting single-molecule force fields. This program optimizes the parameters with respect to a dataset of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, runs dynamics with the new parameters to sample new conformations, computes QM energies and forces on those conformations, adds them to the dataset, and returns to the parameter optimization step. Unlike previous attempts at iterative optimization, we employ a validation set to determine convergence. Using a validation set circumvents problems with parameter convergence, and flags when overfitting occurs. As an example, we find that Boltzmann sampling at 400 K is sufficient to fit a force field for a tri-alanine peptide, a system with a rugged potential energy surface. Last, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method by fitting a custom force field for each molecule in a library of 31 photosynthesis cofactors.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, their practical application is limited by challenges such as the poor cycling stability of organic anodes when redox-active molecules are not covalently anchored to the electrode, and interfacial side reactions at the zinc cathode (e.g., hydrogen evolution, dendrite growth, corrosion). Among the strategies proposed to simultaneously address these issues at both electrodes, \u201cwater-in-salt\u201d electrolytes (WiSEs) stand out as particularly attractive. Yet, their impact on the long-term cycling stability and suppression of parasitic reactions in Zn//organic batteries remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the performance of a Zn//chloranil battery in ZnCl\u2082 electrolytes ranging from dilute (0.5 mol/kg) to WiSE concentrations (30 mol/kg). We show that highly concentrated ZnCl\u2082 electrolytes effectively suppress the dissolution of reduced chloranil, especially when combined with a hydrophobic binder such as polytetrafluoroethylene. An optimal ZnCl\u2082 concentration is identified, yielding excellent cycling stability, high coulombic efficiency, low self-discharge, and good rate capability. Mechanistic studies reveal that charge storage at the chloranil electrode proceeds via reversible proton-coupled electron transfer, facilitated by the strong acidity of concentrated ZnCl\u2082 solutions. At the Zn anode, we provide a quantitative explanation for the huge potential shift observed at increasing ZnCl\u2082 concentrations, attributed to reduced water activity and decreased hydration of Zn\u00b2\u207a ions. These mechanistic insights allow to rationalize the nearly constant cell voltage across a wide concentration range and to better understand the marked suppression of zinc corrosion at high salt concentrations, primarily due to kinetic effects.

Among the cathode candidates, Fe- and Mn-rich layered oxides free of Co and Ni are particularly attractive but suffer from poor electrochemical performance due to Fe migration and irreversible structural phase transformations. Biphasic O3/P2 cathodes attempt to improve the performance by leveraging the synergistic advantages of each phase. However, they usually do not have sufficient Na content. Further, studies typically lack a design strategy to tune the O3:P2 phase fraction to optimize performance. Here, we introduce design principles to control O3:P2 phase fractions in high-Na-content NaTMO2 materials without altering the overall composition. Using Na0.78(Li0.04Mg0.02Fe0.38Mn0.5)O2 (NLMFM) as a model system, we demonstrate that tuning the calcination temperature from 600\u202f\u00b0C to 1000\u202f\u00b0C systematically increases the O3:P2 fraction by modifying the chemical potential of O2 (\u03bcO2) in the calcination environment, which in turn influences the O stoichiometry in the materials and changes the TM oxidation states. We show that higher temperature (lower \u03bcO2) synthesis results in a P2 phase with increased Na content, delaying detrimental P-O transitions and suppressing Fe migration. As a result, the O3-rich samples exhibit superior structural stability and electrochemical performance compared to the samples synthesized at lower temperatures (higher \u03bcO2).

The influence of SrTiO3/SrCO3 heterojunctions should therefore be considered for any photocatalytic application. Herein, we address this phenomenon in the context of photocatalytic overall water splitting, and we introduce a new sol-gel synthesis which allows for more control over SrCO3 formation and lower calcination temperatures than common SrTiO3 molten salt syntheses.

We have identified tert-butanol as a very efficient proton donor at an op-timum concentration in the near absence of mass transfer limitations. Tert-butanol helped to achieve up to 93% Faradaic efficiency and up to 246 nmol cm-2 s-1 ammonia production rate. To understand why tert-butanol outperformed other proton donors, a new methodology was developed in this work: i) all electrochemical experiments were performed in a cell specifically designed to minimize nitrogen and alcohol mass transport limitations to the electrode surface; ii) commercial lithium nitride was chemical-ly reacted with alcohols, with and without added lithium metal, allowing to assess chemical yields of ammonia, completely decoupled from mass transfer and electrochemistry; and iii) thermodynamic analysis was performed. The novel methodology used in this work revealed that weaker nucleophiles, such as tert-butanol, which are less reactive with lithium metal, promote very selective conversion of lithium nitride to ammonia, unaffected by the presence of lithium metal. On the other hand, alcohols that react more readily with lithium, showed lower Faradaic efficiency and chemical yields when metal-lic lithium was present. Finally, this study is not only the first to establish a correlation between chemi-cal yields and Faradaic efficiency, but it also highlights the need for a much broader screening of proton donors and deeper mechanistic understanding to confirm the validity of such a correlation.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Finding assembly principles orthogonal to base pairing is thus desirable not only to organize DNA in a sequence-independent manner but also to bring additional levels of control over preformed DNA self-assembled structures. Here, we report that self-assembled DNA nanotubes, upon the addition of DNA condensing multivalent cations, including the naturally occurring polyamines spermidine and spermine, spontaneously condense to form higher-order structures including well-defined micrometer-sized rings and 30 to 60 nm wide bundles, in which DNA strands are parallelly packed with an interspacing ranging from 2.5 to 3 nm. In the semi-dilute regime, a new organization into vast tridimensional networks is observed for a specific range of charge ratios, prior to the formation of highly clustered bundles. We demonstrate that the process is electrostatically driven, conferring a ubiquitous character to this assembly principle. We report in particular a pivotal role of the counter-ion valency (the higher it is, the lower the charge ratio required), emphasizing the role of DNA neutralization through the entropically driven exchange between DNA counter-ions and the condensing agents. We also show an important role of DNA concentration for controlling the individual or interconnected nature of the formed structures, as well as favoring the nanotube assembly.

In BMCs to facilitate catalysis, reactant and products must transit across the protein shells, which are made up of multimeric protein tiles. Quantifying the permeability for transport of small molecules across the shell is a key engineering consideration to design novel catalytic microcompartments. We examine the permeability for reactants and products for two reaction pathways, the degradation of 2-aminophenol by AmnAB, and the reduction of nitrate to ammonium by NrfA, through a computational lens to quantify permeability for these metabolites at the nanoscale. From Hamiltonian replica exchange umbrella sampling simulations, we determine that the energetic barriers to permeation for the relevant metabolites along both pathways are small, with permeability coefficients in the range of 0.1-4 cm/s.

Directly constructing a tetracoordinate B(sp3) center in a catalytic enantioselective manner remains challenging and underdeveloped, as controlled asymmetric reactions on a flat B(sp2) center are virtually unknown. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging the inherent structural features of commonly used boron compounds, which often contain an iminium or iminium-like moiety10-12. In our approach, an iminium, formed between a salicylaldehyde substrate and an amino-thiourea organic catalyst, activates the phenol oxygen of the salicylaldehyde as an effective nucleophile for enantioselective addition to the B(sp\u00b2) center of a B,N-heterocyclic substrate.

A reduction in the Li/SE contact area during stripping will increase the local current density during subsequent plating, fostering dendrite nucleation. This contact area is influenced by the rates of Li transport within the anode towards the interface. Relevant transport mechanisms include diffusion and creep, with faster rates for these processes resulting in improved performance. Given the importance of these transport modes, predicting them as a function of the anode\u2019s microstructure, stress state, and temperature will be helpful in the design of LMSSB. Towards this goal, the present study predicts the rates of diffusion and creep in Li using atomic scale simulations. First, molecular dynamics simulations are used to estimate the rate of Li diffusion along dislocation cores and in grain boundary triple junctions. By combining this data with that from a prior study of grain boundary diffusion, the dominant diffusion mechanisms and overall rates of self-diffusion in Li polycrystals are predicted as a function of grain size, grain shape, dislocation density, and temperature. Secondly, the dominant creep deformation mechanisms are predicted as a function of applied stress, grain size, and temperature using the computed atomistic data as input to constitutive equations from the literature. Grain boundary sliding and coble creep are predicted to be the dominant mechanisms for micron-sized grains. Finally, a 1D model for Li interfacial contact loss is parameterized with atomistic diffusion data for dislocations, triple junctions, grain boundaries, and the bulk. The model predicts that high dislocation densities of ~1012/cm2 enable achieving battery performance targets for Li grain sizes on the order of 10 \u03bcm.", "date": "2025-07-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Theory - Computational; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In fact, the optical absorption studies and finite-difference time-domain simulations establish an enhanced absorption and light\u2013matter interaction upon thin uniform carbon encapsulation. Photoluminescence quenching (~80%) indicates reduced electron\u2013hole recombination, facilitated by defect-induced charge transfer from ZnO to carbon. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements identify superoxide radicals (O\u2082\u2022\u207b) as the dominant reactive species, driving a selective radical-mediated degradation pathway. Compared to pristine ZnO, the ZnO@C system exhibits over 60% higher degradation efficiency. Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analyses elucidate the sequential degradation pathway driven by O\u2082\u2022\u207b. The ZnO@C demonstrates excellent photostability and reusability across multiple cycles, with a sixfold increase in kinetic rate constants over pristine ZnO. These improvements highlight the potential of ZnO@C core@shell nanostructures for sustainable environmental remediation", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Nanoscience; Carbon-based Materials; Catalysts; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that demonstrates how differences in model performance are fundamentally bounded by their representational alignment. Our theoretical argument predicts the existence of an exclusion zone, a region in the alignment\u2013performance difference space where large performance gaps do not occur if alignment is high. We validate this prediction empirically across a large number of datasets and find that the exclusion zone extends beyond what theory alone would suggest. We also examine model ensembling through the lens of representational alignment.

Prior EOF analyses have focused on Newtonian fluids in fractal network or numerical analysis of power-law fluid flows in complex geometries; here, we extend the scope to non-Newtonian fluids and complex hierarchies using theory and derived scaling laws. Assuming fully developed, steady, axisymmetric, and incompressible EOF in cylindrical microchannels, the model incorporates the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel approximation to linearize electrokinetic behavior and neglects pressure-driven components. The resulting electroosmotic flow rates $Q$ for power-law fluid enhances for shear-thinning fluids (lower $n$) compared to Newtonian or shear-thickening fluids. Under volume constraints, we show that the optimal branching radius ratio \\(\\beta^*\\) scales as \\(N^{-1/2}\\), yielding uniform mean velocity across all generations. This configuration yields a maximum normalized conductance \\(E_{\\text{vol}} = 1\\), independent of the number of bifurcations \\(N\\), length ratio \\(\\gamma\\), or generation count \\(m\\).

Here, we have evaluated the possibility of generating aptamers equipped with ruthenium polypyridyl complexes against entire Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. This combination is hypothesized to improve the poor specificity of photosensitizers, increase local ROS concentration, and potentially penetrate biofilms. Towards these aims, we first prepared nucleotides equipped with various ruthenium complexes and investigated their capacity at serving as substrates for polymerases for enzymatic DNA synthesis. Depending on the nature of the polypyridyl ligands, strong intercalation into dsDNA was observed even when connected to negatively charged nucleotide backbones. We then carried out SELEX and identified two unmodified aptamers that bound to the fixed bacterial target with Kd values of 118 nM and 541 nM. The SELEX experiment with the ruthenium-modified nucleotide led to the identification of one aptamer. The enzymatic synthesis of the modified aptamer was complicated by the formation of a very stable secondary structure confirmed by UV melting experiments (Tm of 84\u00b0C). The modified aptamer displayed a high affinity (Kd value of 125 nM) for fixed Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. Collectively, these results highlight the possibility of using nucleotides equipped with large modifications such as ruthenium polypyridyl complexes in SELEX to raise potent aptamers against entire bacterial targets.

Dust in an area of 1 square foot was wiped up and a calibration curve was constructed by analyzing the folded tape on XRF (in ppm) versus the amount of Pb on the wipe that was determined by digestion and ICP-OES (in \u00b5g).\nThe proposed test method has been validated with 63 field samples collected by 15 users and 2 XRF analysts. Validation was carried out by comparing the calibrated XRF results from the tape, to results of the same tape post digestion and ICP-OES analysis. In the validation study, when the threshold was set to 5 \u03bcg (current EPA action level for floors), a false positive rate (FPR) of 13% and a false negative rate (FNR) of 0% was obtained.

This investigation focuses on AB\u2082-type clusters within Magnesium-Nickel and Magnesium-Titanium systems\u2014specifically MgNi\u2082, NiMg\u2082, MgTi\u2082, and TiMg\u2082\u2014to identify the most promising candidate for future deployment. By integrating advanced computational chemistry methods with economic modeling, this study aims to evaluate the practical potential of these clusters in next-generation technologies. Economically, data on historical market prices for Magnesium, Nickel, and Titanium spanning the last 15 years were collected and analyzed. Employing both linear and polynomial regression models for Time Series Analysis, I forecasted future price trends. Model effectiveness was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to ensure the robustness of the chosen models. These analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel. Results indicated that, despite its superior chemical properties, Titanium is projected to be greatly more costly than Nickel over the next 20 years. Consequently, Magnesium-Titanium clusters appear less economically favorable compared to Magnesium-Nickel counterparts. Regarding chemical efficiency, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out employing the B3LYP functional combined with the def2-SVPD basis set. All calculations assumed a neutral charge with multiplicities ranging from 1 to 3. Geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency analyses were performed through ChemCompute to identify most stable structures based on binding energy and infrared spectra. Electronic structure analyses included Mulliken charge evaluations to understand electron distribution and reactive hotspots. The theoretical gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity was also estimated by assuming two H\u2082 molecules per cluster, with accessible molecular surface areas calculated via MOPAC in Winmostar V11.11.4. Notably, the TiMg\u2082 cluster demonstrated the most advantageous attributes: a stable geometry, optimal electron distribution, highest theoretical gravimetric density, and considerable surface area, indicating its superior potential for hydrogen storage or catalytic purposes. Safety and reactivity considerations were analyzed using global reactivity descriptors derived from Koopmans\u2019 theorem approximations. These included electronegativity (\u03c7), chemical hardness (\u03b7), and electrophilicity index (\u03c9). Higher electronegativity and hardness were interpreted as indicators of greater stability and lower reactivity, while enhanced electrophilicity suggested increased reactivity and potentially reduced safety. Among the clusters, TiMg\u2082 again showed the greatest stability and moderate reactivity, followed by NiMg\u2082. In summary, although MgNi\u2082 and NiMg\u2082 clusters are more economically appealing due to the lower cost of Nickel, the TiMg\u2082 system emerges as overall the most promising when considering stability, efficiency, and safety. Despite higher predicted costs, the TiMg\u2082 cluster exhibits attributes that make it a compelling candidate for further exploration in hydrogen storage and catalytic applications. \n", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Alloys; Hydrogen Storage Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, pharmaceutical companies continue manufacturing racemic medicines, among others, due to the lack of tools for in situ determination of the optical purity and the absolute configura-tion, which is necessary for approval of drug substance by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Currently used methods for the absolute configuration and enantiomeric excess determination have significant limitations (require single crystal, UV-active chromophores, chiral reagents, etc).\nResults: Addressing this need of pharmacological industry for the effective analysis of chiral drugs in situ in solu-tion, we have designed and constructed the at-line setup based on Raman Optical Activity (ROA) and equipped with the 3D-printed flow reactor dedicated for fast in situ and in-flow analysis of chiral compounds. We have validated our approach by the determination of the enantiomeric excess (EE) of pure and multi-component chiral samples showing that the developed solution combines the excellent stereosensitivity, possibility to measure chi-ral samples in-flow, and a rather unique capability of direct discrimination of components of chiral mixtures. The quantitative analysis based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression has demonstrated that the accuracy and pre-cision of the method is very high with the average prediction error from cross-validation (RMSECV) not exceeding 1.35% (for R2 at least 99.95) for ROA spectra recorded in 20 minutes.\nSignificance: According to our best knowledge, our work is a first example of successful in-flow and in situ ROA evaluation of chiral purity in chiral mixtures. Our direct approach does not require sample preparation, preliminary separation of enantiomers or derivatization.

Here we present guanidinylated chitin nanocrystals (GCNCs) that are dispersible at neutral pH. GCNCs were synthesized by guanidinylating partially deacetylated chitin nanocrystals (CNCs) using 1-amidinopyrazole hydrochloride. The degrees of guanidinylation and acetylation of the GCNCs were 4.6% and 75.7%, respectively. A 1.0% GCNC dispersion was prepared in 0.5% acetic acid and subjected to sonication. Although slight white turbidity from light scattering was observed, no visible macroscopic precipitates were detected. Dynamic light scattering analysis indicated that the average GCNC diameter was 327.2 nm. Upon neutralization with 0.1 M NaOH, the GCNC dispersion reduced transmittance due to aggregation. Nonetheless, the dispersion remained more stable than that of CNCs, suggesting that the guanidino group\u2019s strong basicity and positive charge helped mitigate aggregation. Interestingly, GCNCs also dispersed uniformly in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) up to 0.5% after sonication, although the average diameter increased to 1115.1 nm, 3.4 times greater than at pH 3.0. In contrast, guanidinylated chitin nanofibers did not exhibit the same dispersibility despite the presence of guanidino groups. This result indicates that guanidinylation enhances the dispersion of low-aspect-ratio nanochitins such as CNCs.

In addition, silicone elastomers should ideally have an inherent closed-loop lifecycle or reversible controllability in their physical properties upon applying spatial and temporal external stimuli. To tackle this, here we developed a new class of star-shaped poly(dimethyl siloxane)s (PDMSs) with visible- and ultraviolet light-responsive styrylpyrene (StP) end groups and examined their applicability as functional and circular cosmetics. The storage and loss moduli (G\u2019 and G\u201d) of the star-shaped PDMS immediately increased upon irradiation with visible light  (\u03bb = 436 nm) (VIS), demonstrating that star-shaped PDMS networks (SPNs) were formed upon intermolecular dimerization between StP end groups.

Certain BrC chromophores act as photosensitizers, producing reactive oxidants such as singlet oxygen (SO) and triplet excited states (TP) upon solar irradiation. However, most studies rely on water extractions, potentially overlooking water-insoluble chromophores that contribute to this photochemistry.  In this work, we developed a new organic-solvent extraction method to probe water insoluble chromophores and their ability to sensitize SO and TP, and to understand the ability of multi-phase aerosols to produce these in situ oxidants. Primary organic aerosol (POA) filters from the combustion of beechwood, cow dung, straw, and plastic, collected during the BAMBE campaign, were extracted. We analyzed them using a two-probe photochemical method with furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and syringol as probes to quantify SO and TP steady-state concentrations and quantum yields, respectively, under UVA irradiation. Acetonitrile extraction captured a broader range of chromophores than water, leading to both higher absorbance and enhanced reactive oxidants production. Solvent ratios modulated SO deactivation, with higher acetonitrile content increasing steady-state concentrations through reduced quenching, showing up to 6-fold increase in SO concentrations. Fuel type significantly influenced oxidant yields; beechwood and plastic extracts showed the highest SO and TP production, up to 4.9+/-0.1% for SO and 4.2+/-0.2% for TP. These trends were not solely explained by combustion efficiency, indicating that BrC chemical composition plays a dominant role.

Scott Hartley", "abstract": "Foldamers, oligomers that adopt well-defined conformations, represent an efficient strategy toward nanoscale structural complexity. While most foldamers fold into (chiral) helices, many abiotic foldamers are built from achiral repeat units. They therefore do not have a preferred twist sense. The handedness can, however, be controlled by attaching groups with chirality centers to the foldamer backbone. This process allows the chiral information from readily available compounds to be amplified into larger-scale structural asymmetry and translated into functional behavior. This review describes mechanisms whereby the point chirality of chiral \u201ccontroller\u201d groups directs the helicity of the foldamer to which they are attached. We highlight examples of aromatic oligoamides, oligohydrazides, oligoindoles, oligo(ortho-phenylenes), oligooxymethylenes, and oligo(aminoisobutyric acids), examining cases where the controller groups are attached at either the helices\u2019 termini or sides. Our emphasis is on applying intuitive concepts from conformational analysis and, where appropriate, computational modeling of small substructures. In each case, we consider first short-range interactions that orient the controller group in space relative to its direct point of attachment to the foldamer. We then consider long-range interactions between the controller group and more-distant parts of the oligomer, typically one turn farther along the helix. Together, these interactions allow the twist sense to be predicted (or at least rationalized). Understanding these mechanisms should facilitate the design of systems with dynamic control over helicity.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Stereochemistry; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

We developed a polymer conjugate with multiple reducing functionalities by integrating dithiobutylamine (DTBA) into a reportedly biocompatible dendritic polyglycerol scaffold, which could be synthesized in gram scale. After a physicochemical compound characterization, we assessed the influence of dPG-conjugation of DTBA on cytotoxicity and thiol stability.

The material was incubated in agricultural soil in two different forms: cryomilled fragments and 1 cm2 film pieces. Fragment formation was quantified using \u00b5-FTIR microscopy. Biodegradation as well as fragmentation kinetics were modelled by the open-source mechanistic FRAGMENT-MNP model. Results demonstrate that fragmentation is a transient phase within the biodegradation process, with particle counts transitionally peaking, then declining as mineralization progresses. Cryomilled fragments exhibited faster biodegradation and more pronounced fragmentation than larger film pieces. When biodegradation experiments were stopped, more than 90 % of the polymeric carbon was converted into CO2 and residual fragments showed comparable chemical composition to the original material but showed significantly reduced molar masses, indicating that the biodegradation was still progressing. This is supported by the model, predicting that particle concentrations will decrease to below one particle per gram of soil within 600-700 days for both scenarios.

Internal standards are generally used to balance selectivity and sensitivity during NTA sample preparation and method development, assuming linearity between structure and behavior of all chemicals of interest. Since this assumption does not hold for wide and complex chemical subspaces, the actual measured space by NTA methods is consequently narrowed to a reduced set of chemically/structurally similar compounds.

We show that increasing the diversity of the training set (from 1k to 10k templates) significantly increases top-5 round-trip accuracy while reducing top-10 accuracy, impacting prediction feasibility and recall, respectively. In contrast, increasing dataset size without increasing template diversity yields minimal performance gains for LocalRetro and MEGAN, showing that these architectures are robust even with smaller datasets. Moreover, reaction templates that are less common in the training dataset have significantly lower top-k accuracy than more common ones, regardless of the model architecture.

Bimolecular reactions offer a challenge to quantum control, which is not encountered in the unimolecular case, due to their complex scattering dynamics and the averaging of their observables over a thermal distribution of reactant states. Our approach bypasses these hurdles; it involves the interaction of a nonresonant, polarized field with the molecular coordinate-dependent polarizability tensor to generate spatially nonuniform Stark shifts of the potential energy surfaces. We focus on the commonly encountered case, where the reaction dynamics involves complicating features such as several coupled electronic states, deep potential wells, high density of vibronic states and several transition states en route from reactants to products. We consider highly averaged observables including the canonical and microcanonical rate constants. It is shown that the complexities of polyatomic bimolecular reactions introduce new opportunities for reaction enhancement and control. In particular, the occurrence of one or more potential wells combine with the spatial structure of the polarizability tensor to introduce a vast enhancement that is subject to control by choice of the field parameters. Our results are based on a quantum mechanical theory and ab-initio calculations of the potential energy and polarizability tensor.

This study evaluates the performance of hybrid-PINNs against traditional NNs for modeling the adsorption step of a Direct Air Capture (DAC) process. As the complexity of the modeled system increases, larger datasets and longer computational times are required for numerical methods. Therefore, the study aims to develop approaches that minimize data requirements while maintaining accuracy, which is crucial for efficient modeling of complex physical systems. While both AI models can achieve high accuracy with abundant data, the advantages of hybrid-PINNs become more evident as data becomes scarce. In the intermediate and low-data regimes, the physics constraints embedded in hybrid-PINNs significantly improves generalization and predictive accuracy. For extreme low-data conditions, a curriculum learning strategy is implemented, progressively enforcing physics constraints to mitigate underfitting and enhance model stability.  Despite these benefits, hybrid-PINNs exhibit a computational cost approximately one order of magnitude higher than traditional NNs, as enforcing physics constraints increases training complexity. The results suggest that PINNs hold potential for modeling complex multi-physics problems in DAC and beyond, provided challenges related to gradient balancing and computational efficiency are addressed.

However, electrosynthesis methods rely on volatile organic solvents such as acetonitrile to solubilize the reagents, combined with expensive and non-recyclable electrolytes which compromise the environmental and economic viability of the approach. Taking the electrosynthesis of 2-arylsulfinylquinolines as representative case, we addressed the aforementioned issues by incorporating a deep eutectic solvent that functions simultaneously as the reaction medium and supporting electrolyte. The method delivered excellent yields, and products were isolated at gram scale via simple water washing and filtration. Interestingly, the eutectic solvent was recovered and reused for up to five cycles without significant loss in reaction yields. In a more general vein, this strategy affords not only to eliminate volatile organic solvents throughout both the reaction and purification stages, but also to integrate a recyclable solvent-electrolyte system, therefore enabling a fully sustainable electrosynthetic process.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we report a divergent electrochemical strategy for the bioinspired synthesis of mavacurane- and akuammiline-type alkaloid frameworks from a common indole\u2013malonate precursor. By tuning the redox mediator, selective N\u2013C or C\u2013C bond formation was achieved. Iodide-mediated electrolysis promoted iodination of the malonate carbanion, followed by intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization to furnish the mavacurane core. In contrast, ferrocene-mediated oxidation generated a malonate-centered radical that underwent regioselective addition to the indole ring, leading to the akuammiline skeleton. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the radical cyclization proceeded via a favorable 5-exo-trig pathway followed by a 1,2-rearrangement. Mechanistic insights from cyclic voltammetry and control experiments further support this mediator-dependent divergence in reactivity. This study highlights the potential of electrochemical control in guiding selective skeletal rearrangements and provides a method for the efficient synthesis of architecturally complex indole alkaloids under mild and tunable conditions.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Natural Products; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

By extending mutual information (MI) analysis to amino acid fragments, FMI provides a detailed map of electronic interactions beyond classical descriptors such as van der Waals forces. We first validated FMI on 400 dipeptides, demonstrating a correlation with atomization and bonding energies. Expanding this approach to the 10-mer Neh2 peptide, we analyze molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and reveal how inter-atomic correlations evolve during folding. Our results show that FMI distinguishes stabilizing interactions such as salt bridges and variable hydrogen bond strengths, providing deeper insight into peptide stability. These findings suggest that FMI could enhance molecular modeling and force field development by incorporating quantum electronic effects into biomolecular analysis.", "date": "2025-07-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

By coupling the QM and MM regions through the instantaneous MM electrostatic polarization response to QM charge density fluctuations, DREEM enables consistent treatment of ground and excited electronic states, capturing electronic state-specific polarization and dispersion effects absent in conventional mean-field or linear response approaches. The use of electrostatic potential fitting (ESPF) approximation method to describe charge density fluctuations significantly improves the computational efficiency compared the integral-exact direct reaction field. In this work, we present two methodological advancements to extend the applicability of DREEM to realistic condensed-phase simulations. Firstly the development of efficient analytic energy gradients, enabling geometry optimization, transition state searches, and molecular dynamics, and secondly a formulation of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) compatible with the DREEM framework. These capabilities are implemented in the open-source OpenESPF code, interfacing PySCF and OpenMM for high-performance QM and MM calculations. We demonstrate that the resulting implementation enables practical simulations of excited-state optical properties in periodic polarizable environments, where we calculate the fluorescence spectrum of acetone in water including quantum vibronic and non-Condon effects.

Conformers are identified as density peaks in torsional angle space, and convergence is assessed via systematic consistency metrics. We validate this approach by reproducing the paradigmatic FES of alanine dipeptide and extend it to explore molecules with 4-, 7-, and 11-dimensional torsional angle spaces. As a key application, we investigate the solvent-dependent conformational preferences of bicalutamide in vacuum, chloroform, and DMSO.

Two representative RNA-azobenzene complexes are \ninvestigated, both of which contain the azobenzene chromophore \ncovalently attached to an RNA double strand via a beta-deoxyribose \nlinker.

By contrast, cis-to-trans isomerization remains in a sub-picosecond regime. A volume-conserving isomerization mechanism is found, similarly to the pedal-like mechanism previously identified for azobenzene in solution phase. Strikingly, the chiral RNA environment induces opposite right-handed and left-handed helicities of the ground-state cis-azobenzene chromophore in the two RNA-azobenzene complexes, along with an almost completely chirality conserving photochemical pathway for these helical enantiomers.", "date": "2018-01-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The specific molecular interactions between the polymers and the hydrophobic drugs are diverse and recently it has been discussed that macromolecular engineering can be used to optimize drug loaded micelles. Specifically, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between small molecules and polymers has been discussed as an important interaction that can be employed to increase drug loading and formulation stability. Here, we test this hypothesis using four different polymer amphiphiles with varying aromatic content and various natural products that also contain different relative amounts of aromatic moieties. While in the case of paclitaxel, having the lowest relative content of aromatic moieties, the drug loading decreases with increasing relative aromatic amount in the polymer, the drug loading of curcumin, having a much higher relative aromatic content, is increased. Interestingly, the loading using schizandrin A, a dibenzo[a,c]cyclooctadiene lignan with intermediate relative aromatic content is not influenced significantly by the aromatic content of the polymers employed. The very high drug loading, long term stability, the ability to form stable highly loaded binary coformulations in different drug combinations, small sized formulations and amorphous structures in all cases, corroborate earlier reports that poly(2-oxazoline) based micelles exhibit an extraordinarily high drug loading and are promising candidates for further biomedical applications.

To this end, we report on a modular 2-step approach based on the synthesis of AuNPs in oleylamine (OAm) followed by the subsequent functionalization with target thiol ligands. The synthesis of OAm-capped AuNPs enables fine tuning of the core size in the range of 2\u20137nm by varying the reaction temperature. The subsequent thiol-for-OAm ligand-exchange allows a reliable generation of thiol-capped AuNPs with target surface functionality. The compatibility of this approach with a vast library of thiol ligands provides detailed control of mixed ligand composition and solubility in a wide range of solvents ranging from water to hexane. This decoupled control over the AuNP core and ligand shell provides a powerful toolbox for the methodical screening of optimal design parameters and facile preparation of AuNPs with target properties.", "date": "2018-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

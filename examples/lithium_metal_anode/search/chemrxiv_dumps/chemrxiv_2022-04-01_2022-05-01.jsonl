Biochar preparation is among the practical solutions aiming to valorize this agrowaste and make it of a high added value functional material (FM). Herein, we propose a novel zero-waste pathway where sugarcane bagasse was first dispersed in a hydroalcoholic solution and the dispersion was then ultrasonicated in order to extract natural reducing and capping agents. Subsequently, silver and copper ions were added to get adsorbed under a controlled atmosphere prior to heat treatment. The suspension was later filtered to provide (i) Ag/Cu-Ag+/Cu2+-loaded biomass sludge, and (ii) a clear filtrate containing residual metal ions which was microwaved in order to generate unsupported Ag/Cu nanoparticles (NPs). The free Ag/Cu nanoparticles (FM2) were tested as anti-kinetoplastid material against two flagellate models namely Leishmania spp and Trypanosoma cruzi. Free Ag/Cu nanoparticles showed the highest leishmanicidal and trypanocidal effects with an IC50 of 2.909 \u00b1 0.051; 3.580 \u00b1 0.016 and 3.020 \u00b1 0.372 ppm for L.donovani, L. amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi, respectively.

To sum up, sugarcane bagasse agrowaste was valorized as a source of natural reducing agents of metal ions into free and biochar-supported metallic nanoparticles.

There are several open questions related to the comparative oxidative abilities of these species, and a unifying concept that could accommodate various factors influencing the reactivity is lacking. To shed light on these open questions, here we have used a combination of the DFT (B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP) and ab initio (DLPNO-CCSD(T); CASSCF/NEVPT2) calculations to study a series of high-valent metal-oxo/hydroxo species, [Mn+H3buea(X)] (M = Fe and Mn, n = II to V, X = O/OH; H3buea = tris[(N'-tert-butylureaylato)-N-ethylene)]aminato) towards the activation of dihydroanthracene (DHA).  Detailed analysis unveils the following reactivity trend FeV=O > MnIII=O > MnIV=O > FeIII=O > MnV=O > FeII-OH > MnII-OH > MnIV-OH > FeIV-OH > FeIV=O > FeIII-OH  > MnIII-OH and suggests that neither higher oxidation nor high-spin ground state yields superior reactivity. The secondary coordination sphere is found to play a vital role in controlling the reactivity wherein the H-bonding interactions reduce the crystal field strength, and this brings several excited states of the same spin multiplicity closer to the ground state resulting in the observation of identical spin multistate reactivity (ISMR) in MnIII/IV=O and FeII-OH species. For FeV=O species, strong ligand spin polarization was detected, diminishing the crystal field leading to the exhibition of ISMR reactivity. The ISMR is found to control the basicity of the oxo/hydroxo group as well as the redox potentials.  Further, when pKa > 15, a PT-ET mechanism for C-H bond activation is detected, and a higher E1/2 value directs the reaction via the concerted HAT/PCET mechanism. On the other hand, for species that exhibit classical SSR/TSR reactivity, such as MnII-OH, FeIV=O, the secondary coordination sphere effect is found to be lethal. As the multireference character is absent in these species, they lack the electronic flexibility that ISMR species enjoy during the reaction, leading to sluggish/no reactivity for many species, including the popular FeIV=O species. As metalloenzymes' active sites have several H-bonding networks resembling the species studied here, this unlocks the possibility of having ISMR type reactivity for metalloenzymes to rationalize their superior catalytic abilities.

Spatially targeted proteomics is a technology for analyzing the proteome of specific cell types and functional regions within tissue. While spatial context is often essential to understanding biological processes, interpreting complex protein profiles (e.g., of key tissue subregions) can pose a challenge due to the high-dimensional nature of the data. To address this challenge, we developed a multivariate approach to explore such data and applied it to analyze a published spatially targeted proteomics dataset collected from Staphylococcus aureus-infected murine kidney, 4-days and 10-days post-infection. The multivariate data analysis process we developed rapidly filters complex biological data to determine the most relevant species from hundreds to thousands of measured molecules avoiding the more traditional univariate and targeted viewpoint of tracking individual proteins. We employ principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and grouping of correlated and anticorrelated proteins among regions and timepoints previously measured by mass spectrometry through micro-liquid extraction surface analysis (microLESA). Subsequently, k-means clustering of the PCA-processed data was used to group samples in an unsupervised manner. Interpretation of the resultant cluster centers revealed a subset of proteins among those detected that differentiate among spatial regions of infection over two timepoints.  These proteins are involved in the glycolysis and TCA metabolomic pathways, calcium-dependent processes, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene ontology analysis of the protein subsets in each cluster uncovered patterns in the dataset used related to tissue damage and repair as well as calcium-related defense mechanisms during staphylococcal infection.

These results raised questions on the mechanisms of formation of such phases, for instance, whether they arise from a specific pre-organization in the liquid state, probably following a non-classical nucleation path and, most importantly, opened discussions on whether this family of structures can be extended.\nHere we report the results from a classical molecular dynamics investigation aimed to give more insights on this matter. In particular, we modelled the thermal behaviour of an arbitrary FK phase of 4-aminopyridinium chloride prior the melting and after cooling the molten phase, exploring the mechanisms of dehydration of these phases and nucleation from the melt. The results, also confirmed by experiments, suggest that the dehydration of these phases can occur without dramatic changes in the crystal packing. This is also confirmed by simulating a stable anhydrous FK phase of 4-aminopyridinium chloride. Most importantly, molecular dynamics simulated by cooling the melt of this anhydrous phase, showed the formation of mainly two types of aggregates identical to those observed in the experimental crystal structures. These results confirm that other unknown FK structures might be obtained for our system, either from the melt or by dehydration of the known phases. Moreover, they provide further evidence that their crystallisation follows a non-classical path with a probable formation of two types of highly symmetric clusters that assemble into the solid-state only when the relative ratio of these reaches a threshold. \n", "date": "2022-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although they are earth-abundant and inexpensive, they are comparatively less explored due to their limitations such as ease of surface oxidation, poor colloidal stability, and high toxicity. To overcome these constraints, we established a facile synthetic route by optimizing the reaction parameters, especially altering the effective concentration of the reducing agent to influence their optical characteristics.

Moreover, the as-synthesized Cu NCs showed a significant reduction of toxicity in both in vitro and in vivo models.

Perdew; Francesco Paesani", "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method, due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness. The accuracy of a DFT calculation de- pends not only on the choice of the density functional approximation (DFA) adopted but also on the electron density produced by the DFA. SCAN is a modern functional that satisfies all known constraints for meta-GGA functionals. The density-driven errors, defined as energy errors arising from errors of the self-consistent DFA electron density, can hinder SCAN from achieving chemical accuracy in some systems, including water. Density-corrected DFT (DC-DFT) can alleviate this shortcoming by adopting a more accurate electron density which, in most applications, is the electron density obtained at the Hartree-Fock level of theory due to its relatively low computational cost. In this work, we present extensive calculations aimed at determining the accuracy of the DC-SCAN functional for various aqueous systems. DC-SCAN (SCAN@HF) shows remarkable consistency in reproducing reference data obtained at the coupled cluster level of theory, with minimal loss of accuracy. Density-driven errors in the description of ionic aqueous clusters are thoroughly investigated. By comparison with the orbital-optimized CCSD density in the water dimer, we find that the self-consistent SCAN density transfers a spurious fraction of an electron across the hydrogen bond to the hydrogen atom (H\u22c6, covalently bound to the donor oxygen atom) from the acceptor (OA) and donor (OD) oxygen atoms, while HF makes a much smaller spurious transfer in the opposite direction, consistent with DC-SCAN (SCAN@HF) reduction of SCAN over-binding due to delocalization error. While LDA seems to be the conventional extreme of density delocalization error, and HF the conventional extreme of (usually much smaller) density localization error, these two densities do not quite yield the conventional range of density-driven error in energy differences. Finally, comparisons of the DC-SCAN results with those obtained with the Fermi-Lowdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLOSIC) method show that DC-SCAN represents a more accurate approach to reducing density-driven errors in SCAN calculations of ionic aqueous clusters.", "date": "2022-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Properties; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, DMSO can be trapped during perovskite film formation and induce voids and undesired reaction byproducts upon later processing steps. Here, we show that we can reduce the amount of residual DMSO in as-spin-coated films significantly - by 30 times - through use of pre-heated substrates, or a so-called hot-casting method. Hot-casting increases the perovskite film thickness which allows us to reduce the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot-casting, we are able to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite-substrate buried interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers.

Some of the difficult points include the preparation of buffers at the right molarities and pH and the serial dilution of test compounds to achieve desired final concentrations. Valuable time and large sums of money are spent on experiments, therefore, a fool-proof method that precludes human errors in the design of the experiment and the preparation of the reagents is desired. The software tool, developed by the author and referred to as \u201cPrototype-A-1\u201d in this communication, meets this goal to a larger extent. The user of this software tool enters only readily available variables into the program and performs no prior computations. Modification of the basic dilution equation to facilitate the programming of serial dilutions is one of the major accomplishments of this program. Some important functions of the program are: (a) to generate custom instructions for the preparation and dilution of solutions with minimum inputs from the user; (b) to provide 25 custom buffer calculators; (c) to provide a protocol-writer for writing protocols for cell culture testing, antibody titrations, compound assays and animal experimentation. In this program, in all cases, the user enters only numbers from the keyboard or the keypad and selects units from the keypad menu. The user can enter stock and final concentrations in different standard units. The program requests the molecular weight of the compound when required and performs the necessary conversions. The program verifies the serial dilution instructions for accuracy by calculating the dilution factor from the mixing instructions of the output. In most cases of the queries, the output includes a display of the actual calculations. Windows 10 or higher operating system is required. The results of the queries and protocols generated can be saved as Microsoft Windows documents. The saved documents can be retrieved also by Microsoft\u2019s word, WordPad and Notepad.

Here, we present a modified protocol of Multiple Time Step (MTS) method to accelerate ai-QM/MM MD simulations of condensed-phase reactions. Within a previous MTS protocol [Nam, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2014, 10, 2175], reference forces are evaluated using a low-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian and employed at inner time steps to propagate the nuclear motions. Correction forces, which arise from the force differences\nbetween high-level (ai-QM/MM) and low-level Hamiltonians, are applied at outer time steps, where the MTS algorithm allows the time-reversible integration of the correction forces. To increase the outer step size, which is bound by the highest-frequency component in the correction forces, the semi-empirical QM Hamiltonian is re-calibrated in this work to minimize the magnitude of the correction forces. The remaining high frequency modes, which are mainly bond stretches involving hydrogen atoms, are then removed from the correction forces. When combined with Langevin or SIN(R) thermostat, the modified MTS-QM/MM scheme remains robust with an up to 8 fs (with Langevin) or 10 fs (with SIN(R)) outer time step (with 1 fs inner time steps) for the chorismate mutase system.

Herein, to gain theoretical insights into the experimentally observed potential-dependent activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on the popular single-iron-atom catalyst, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, constrained MD sampling and the thermodynamic integration to acquire the free energy profiles for the proton and electron transfer processes of CO2 at different potentials. We have demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 is significantly coupled with the electron transfer from the substrate while the further protonation does not show distinct charge variation. This strongly suggest that CO2 adsorption is potential-dependent and optimizing the electrode potential is vital to achieve the efficient activated adsorption of CO2. We further identified a linear scaling relationship between the reaction free energy (\u0394G) and the potential for key elementary steps of CO2RR and HER, of which the slope is adsorbate-specific and not as simple as 1 eV per Volt as suggested by the traditional Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model. The derived scaling relationship can reproduce the experimental onset potential (Uonset) of CO2RR, potential of the maximal CO2-to-CO Faraday Efficiency (FECO), and the potential where FECO = FEH2. This suggests that our state-of-the-art model could precisely interpret the activity and selectivity of CO2RR/HER on Fe-N4-C catalyst under different electrode potentials. In general, our study not only provides an innovative insight into the theoretical explanation of the origin of solvation effect from the perspective of charge transfer but also emphasizes the critical role of electrode potential on theoretical consideration of catalytic activity, which offers a profound understanding of the electrochemical environment and bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experiment results.

While titanium dioxide is widely used in the photocatalytic field, its yield is still low due to the fast recombination of the photo-generated charge carriers.

This is mostly owing to the cost and technical difficulty of synthesizing such computationally designed molecules. To overcome such barriers, various methods for synthetic route design using deep neural networks have been studied intensively in recent years. However, little progress has been made in designing molecules and their synthetic routes simultaneously. Here, we formulate the problem of simultaneously designing molecules with the desired set of properties and their synthetic routes within the framework of Bayesian inference. The design variables consist of a set of reactants in a reaction network and its network topology. The design space is extremely large because it consists of all combinations of purchasable reactants, often in the order of millions or more. In addition, the designed reaction networks can adopt any topology beyond simple multistep linear reaction routes. To solve this hard combinatorial problem, we present a powerful sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that recursively designs a synthetic reaction network by sequentially building up single-step reactions. In a case study of designing drug-like molecules based on commercially available compounds, compared with heuristic combinatorial search methods, the proposed method shows overwhelming performance in terms of computational efficiency and coverage and novelty with respect to existing compounds.", "date": "2022-04-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In the mid-term future, a huge amount of H2 will be produced from a variety of hydrocarbon sources including biomass through the in-depth purification of crude H2, which is a gaseous mixture of H2, CO, CO2, and other components. Processes for the removal of such contaminants prior to H2 storage are of particular importance to prevent the deactivation of metal-based catalysts used in fuel cells and the chemical industry; however, bypassing these purification processes is desirable, given their energy consumption and environmental impact, which ultimately increases the cost of the produced H2. Here, we demonstrate a molecular-based strategy to separate H2 from a gaseous mixture of H2/CO/CO2/CH4 and simultaneously store it in N-heterocyclic compounds that act as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), which can be applied for the production of H2 by subsequent dehydrogenation. A shelf-stable triaryl borane successfully catalyzes the hydrogenation of these N-heteroaromatic compounds in the co-presence of substantial amounts of CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O, which is commensurate to a simultaneous separation and storage of H2 (catalyst turnover number of up to 1480), and the subsequent dehydrogenation (H2 recovery), both of which proceed without solvents. Our results demonstrate that LOHCs can potentially be used for H2 purification in addition to their well-established use in H2 storage.", "date": "2022-04-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Acid Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis; Organocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We have modelled the mechanism of CH4 dissociation on (111), (110), (100), and (001) \u03b3-Al2O3 surfaces.

The overall mechanism involves the formation of the reactive intermediate CH2* that then can couple to form CnH2n* (n = 2-6) species. The unsaturated CH2 end promotes the sustained carbon growth in a nearly barrierless process. Also, the short length between terminal carbon atoms leads to strong interactions, which might lead to the high activity among unsaturated CH2* of hydrocarbon chain.

However, they are not often utilized because it is difficult to ascertain which vibrational frequencies are important, even in describing fundamental parameters such as the activation barrier. This is perpetuated by the fact that it is difficult to tune vibrational frequencies directly, without changing the chemical structure, in order to study underlying phonon relations. Using isotopic substitution of 6Li for 7Li, we are able to change the mobile ion vibrations in the two exemplary ion conductors Li10SnP2S12 and Li6PS5Cl without altering their structure. Using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to characterize temperature-dependent ion transport, it is demonstrated that the isotopic substitution of 6Li for 7Li increases the activation barrier for Li-ion transport. The magnitude of this isotope effect cannot be explained by changes in the zero-point vibrational energy alone. Therefore, we propose that the observed change in the activation barrier is related to the differences in the average critical phonon occupation needed to overcome the activation barrier. Our hypothesis is supported by an analytical model, based on the physics of quantum harmonic oscillators, that gives good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, isotopic substitution provides unique insights into the vibrational perspective and frequency dependence of the activation barrier in fast Li-ion conductors.", "date": "2022-09-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that the Ru(II)-aqua moiety undergoes PCET to form Ru(IV)-oxo moiety in the anodic region, while the bpm ligand undergoes PCET to form bpmH2 in the anodic region. The photophysical behavior of Ru-bpm was studied using steady-state and femtosecond transient UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The lowest-lying excited state of Ru-bpm is described as a (Ru\uf020\uf0ae bpm) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state, while the metal-centered (MC) excited state was found computationally to be close in energy to the lowest-energy bright MLCT state (MC state was 0.16 eV above the MLCT state). The excited state kinetics of Ru-bpm were found via transient absorption spectroscopy to be short-lived and were fit well to a biexponential function with lifetimes \uf0741=4 ps and \uf0742=65 ps in aqueous solution. Kinetic isotope effect of 1.75 was observed for both decay components, indicating that the solvent plays an important role in the excited-state dynamics of Ru-bpm. Based on the pH-dependent studies and the results from prior studies of similar Ru-complexes, we hypothesize that the 3MLCT state forms an excited-state hydrogen-bond adduct with the solvent molecules and that this process occurs with the 4 ps lifetime. The formation of such hydrogen-bond complex is consistent with the electronic density accumulation at the peripheral N atoms of the bpm moiety in the 3MLCT state. The hydrogen-bonded state 3MLCT\u2019 decays to the ground state with a 65 ps lifetime. Such short lifetime is likely associated with the efficient vibrational energy transfer from 3MLCT state to the solvent.", "date": "2022-04-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Redox mediation is an effective strategy to drive oxygen chemistry into solution, avoiding surface-mediated Li2O2 film growth and extending discharge lifetimes. However, to continue improving upon prior research, exploration of new classes of redox mediators and discovery of novel selection criteria is required. Herein, we report a new class of triarylmethyl cations which are effective at enhancing discharge capacities up to 26-fold. Surprisingly, we observe that redox mediators with more positive redox mediator reduction potentials, and thus more sluggish kinetics for reaction with oxygen, lead to larger discharge capacities because of their improved ability to suppress the surface-mediated reduction pathway. This result provides important structure- property relationships for future improvements in redox-mediated O2/Li2O2 discharge capacities. To aid future redox mediator discovery, we applied a chronopotentiometry model to investigate the zones of redox mediator standard reduction potentials and concentrations needed to achieve efficient redox mediation at a given current density.

To address this need we conducted a focused screening effort that identified compound 1 as a weak PKMYT1 inhibitor. Introduction of a dimethylphenol dramatically increased potency on PKMYT1.

Magnetic susceptibility and magnetisation data shows an absense of exchange in the presence of the diamagnetic guest triflate. However, replacement of the bound triflate by ReBr62- switches on antiferomagnetic exchange between the Cu and Re ions, leading to an S = 1/2 ground state for the non-covalent complex [ReBr62-\u2e26CuII2L4]2+. Comparison of this complex to a \u201ccontrol\u201d palladium-cage host-guest complex, [ReBr62-\u2e26PdII2L4]2+, shows that the encapsulated ReBr62- anions retain the same magnetic anisotropy as in the free salt.

Here we report the first attempt to quantify the membrane-to-lumen partition of proteins in EVs. A semi-quantitative model based on available well-established compositional and microstructural data is formulated. The model allows for estimation of the overall protein content of an EV as well as of the partition between membrane (surface) associated and lumen (bulk) contained proteins as a function of the EV size and shape. It further identifies 180 nm as a key diameter, below which EVs result composed by more membrane than luminal proteins. At larger diameters the partition is reversed, reaching predominance of luminal proteins (> 80 %) in large EVs (diameter > 800 nm). The model is successfully tested to analyze and describe a real preparation composed of subpopulations of small EVs (diameter < 200 nm), including exosomes and ectosomes, and large EVs including large oncosomes (diameter > 1000 nm) from human prostate cancer cells.

These systems have demonstrated their capacity to treat excreta from tens of thousands of people using thermal treatment processes, but their relative sustainability is unclear. In this study, QSDsan (an open-source Python package) was used to characterize the financial viability and environmental implications of fecal sludge treatment via OP technology treating mixed and source-separated human excreta, and to elucidate the key drivers of system sustainability. Overall, the daily user cost for the treatment of mixed excreta (pit latrines) via the OP was estimated to be 0.05 [0.03 \u2013 0.08] USD\u00b7cap-1\u00b7d-1, while the treatment of source-separated excreta (from urine-diverting dry toilets) was estimated to have a user cost of 0.09 [0.08 \u2013 0.14] USD\u00b7cap-1\u00b7d-1. Operation and maintenance of the OP is a critical driver to total user cost; whereas the contribution from capital cost of the OP is much lower because it is distributed over a relatively large number of users (i.e., 12,000 people) for the system lifetime (i.e., 20 yr). The total emissions from the source-separated scenario were estimated to be 11 [8.3 \u2013 23] kg CO2 eq\u00b7cap-1\u00b7yr-1, compared to 49 [28 \u2013 77] kg CO2 eq\u00b7cap-1\u00b7yr-1 for mixed excreta. Both scenarios fall below the estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for anaerobic treatment of fecal sludge collected from pit latrines. Source-separation also creates opportunities for resource recovery to offset costs through nutrient recovery and carbon sequestration with biochar production. For example, when carbon is valued at 150 USD\u00b7Mg-1 of CO2, the user cost of sanitation can be further reduced by 44% and 40% for the source-separated and mixed excreta scenarios, respectively.

Among synthetic supramolecular cyclic structures, porphyrin nanorings have attracted considerable attention as they have a resemblance to naturally occurring light-harvesting structures but offer the ability to control ring size and the level of disorder. Here, broadband femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, with pump pulses in resonance with either the high or the low energy sides of the inhomogeneously broadened absorption spectrum, is used to study the population dynamics and ground and excited state vibrational coherence in large porphyrin nanorings. A series of fully conjugated, alkyne bridged, nanorings constituted of between ten and forty porphyrin units is studied. Pump-wavelength dependent fast spectral evolution is observed. A fast rise or decay of the stimulated emission are observed when large porphyrin nanorings are excited on, respectively, the high or low energy side of the absorption spectrum. Such dynamics are consistent with the hypothesis of a variation in transition dipole moment across the inhomogeneously broadened ground state ensemble. Oscillatory dynamics on the sub-ps time domain are observed in both pumping conditions. A combined analysis of the excitation wavelength-dependent transient spectra along with the amplitude and phase evolution of the oscillations allows assignment to vibrational wavepackets evolving on either ground or excited states electronic potential energy surfaces. Even though porphyrin nanorings support highly delocalized electronic wavefunctions, with coherence length spanning tens of chromophores, the measured vibrational coherences remain localised on the monomers. The main contributions to the beatings are assigned to two vibrational modes localised on the porphyrin cores: a Zn-N stretching mode and a skeletal methinic/pyrrolic C-C stretching and in-plane bending mode.", "date": "2022-04-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Optics; Quasiparticles and Excitations; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, most of the traditional modulators are not selective and present adverse side effects.

The regioselectivity of the interrupted cyclization cascade for bis-helicenes confirms that relief of antiaromaticity is a dominant force for these facile ring closures.

Ubiquitination can signal for several regulatory pathways including protein degradation. Ubiquitination occurs by a series of reactions catalyzed by three types of enzymes: ubiquitin activating enzymes, E1; ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, E2; and ubiquitin ligases, E3. E2 enzymes directly catalyze the transfer of Ub to the target protein \u2013 the RING E3 improves the efficiency. Prior to its transfer, Ub is covalently linked to the E2 via a thioester bond and the Ub~E2 conjugate forms a quaternary complex with the RING E3. It is hypothesized that the RING E3 improves the catalytic efficiency of ubiquitination by placing the E2~Ub conjugate in a \u201cclosed\u201d position, which tensions and weakens the thioester bond. We interrogate this hypothesis by analyzing the strain on the thioester during molecular dynamics simulations of both open and closed E2~Ub/E3 complexes. Our data indicate that the thioester is strained when the E2~Ub conjugate is in the closed position. We also show that the amount of strain is consistent with the experimental rate enhancement caused by the RING E3. Finally, our simulations show that the closed configuration increases the populations of key hydrogen bonds in the E2~Ub active site. This is consistent with another hypothesis stating that the RING E3 enhances reaction rates by preorganizing the substrates.", "date": "2022-04-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Each of these degrees of freedom alters the interplay between several key magnetic interactions to produce disparate collective electronic and magnetic phases.  The array of magnetic and electronic behavior typified by these systems renders them distinctive platforms for realizing tunable magnetism in solid-state materials and promising candidates for spin-based electronic devices. This Perspective provides an overview of the rich magnetism displayed by transition metal-intercalated TMDs by considering Fe- and Cr-intercalated NbS2 and TaS2. These four exemplars of this large family of materials exhibit a wide range of magnetic properties, including sharp switching of magnetic states, current-driven magnetic switching, and chiral spin textures. An understanding of the fundamental origins of the resultant magnetic/electronic phases in these materials is discussed in the context of composition, bonding, electronic structure, and magnetic anisotropy in each case study.", "date": "2022-04-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Magnetism; Solid State Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we apply a multiscale approach that leverages the powerful cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) technique to reveal new insights that were previously inaccessible with conventional methods. We discover that the proton donor (e.g. ethanol) governs lithium reactivity toward nitrogen fixation. Without ethanol, the SEI passivates lithium metal, rendering it inactive for ammonia production. Ethanol disrupts this passivation layer, enabling continuous reactivity at the lithium surface. As a result, metallic lithium is consumed via reactions with nitrogen, proton donor, and other electrolyte components. This reactivity across the SEI is vital to device-level performance of lithium-mediated ammonia synthesis.

Due to the importance of the surface ligand in stabilizing nanocluster and sensing target metal ions, there is a great need of further investigations into possible surface ligands to develop selective and sensitive sensors. In this study, we designed very simple tripeptides to form fluorescent AuNCs by taking advantage of the reduction capability of tyrosine under alkaline conditions. In addition to studying the role of tyrosine in forming AuNC, we also investigated the role of tyrosine in sensing metal ions. Two tripeptides, tyrosine-cysteine-tyrosine (YCY) and serine-cysteine-tyrosine (SCY), were prepared and used for the formation of AuNCs. We obtained AuNCs with blue and red fluorescence from YCY peptides and AuNCs with blue fluorescence from SCY peptides. We found that the fluorescence of blue fluorescence-emitting YCY- and SCY-AuNCs is selectively quenched with Fe3+ and Cu2+, while the fluorescence of the red fluorescence-emitting YCY-AuNC is stable with 13 different metal ions. We have observed that the number of tyrosine residues affects the response of sensors. In the presence of different metal ions, different aggregation propensities were observed from DLS measurement. These results suggest the chelation between the peptide on the AuNC surface and the target ions results in aggregation and causes fluorescence quenching. Our study has shown that very simple and short peptides can be designed rationally for the formation of fluorescent AuNCs and utilized as the surface ligand for the metal ion sensing.

Despite over a decade of research, the exact NO reduction steps remain unknown. Herein, using combined spectroscopic, catalytic and DFT approach we show that nitrosyl ions (NO+) in the zeolitic micropores are the key intermediates for NO reduction. Remarkably, they react with ammonia even below room temperature producing molecular nitrogen (the reaction central to turning NO pollutant to benign nitrogen) through the intermediacy of the diazo N2H+ cation. Experiments with isotopically labeled N-compounds confirm our proposed reaction path. No copper is required for N2 formation to occur during this step. However, at temperatures below 100 \u2070C, when NO+ reacts with NH3, the bare Br\u00f8nsted acid site becomes occupied by NH3 to form strongly bound NH4+ and, consequently, this stops the catalytic cycle, because NO+ cannot form on NH4-Zeolites when their H+ sites are already occupied by NH4+. On the other hand, we show the reaction becomes catalytic on H-zeolites at temperatures when some ammonia desorption can occur (>120 \u2070C). We suggest that the role of Cu(II) ions in Cu/Zeolite catalysts for low-temperature NO reduction is to produce abundant NO+ by the reaction: Cu(II) + NO \uf0e0 Cu(I)---NO+. NO+ then reacts with ammonia to produce nitrogen and water. Furthermore, when Cu(I) gets re-oxidized the catalytic cycle then can continue. Our findings provide novel understanding of the hitherto unknown steps of the SCR mechanism pertinent to N-N coupling.

We show that syringol binds very tightly in the WT enzyme which blocks the conformational rearrangement needed for the second step of O-demethylation. The F169A creates an extra room favoring the conformational rearrangement in the demethylated syringol (3MC) and second dose of the dioxygen insertion.

Despite the variations in composition, primarily associated with the difference in the carrier solvents, all three formulations gave similar sensitivity. However, BKA was identified as the most effective formulation in consideration of cost and supply chain issues, which could be adopted for use in resource-limited micro-jurisdictions with minimum modification. Further experiments also found that using ethanol as a substitute co- solvent to methanol did not significantly reduce sensitivity, which could provide a safer modification of the CAST formulation used in other regions.

This process allows endergonic reactions to be driven by exergonic ones and is an alternative, less recognised, mechanism of energy coupling to the well-known chemiosmotic principle. The electron-bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (HydABC) requires both NADH and ferredoxin to reduce protons generating hydrogen. The mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC remains enigmatic in spite of intense research efforts over the last few years. Structural information may provide the basis for a better understanding of spectroscopic and functional information. Here, we present a 2.3 \u00c5 electron cryo-microscopy structure of HydABC.

A rational approach to further improving sensing detection limits relies on the nanostructuration of the sensor surfaces. To this end, inorganic inverse opals (IOs) derived from colloidal self-assembly present a highly tuneable and scalable nanoarchitecture of suitable feature sizes and surface chemistry. This work systematically investigates their use in 2D and 3D for enhanced QCM-D exosome detection. Precise tuning of the architecture parameters delivered improvements in detection performance to sensitivities as low as 6.24 x 10^7 particles/ml.

In the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) it has become increasingly important to address novel targets such as DXPS, the first enzyme of the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which affords the universal isoprenoid precursors. This pathway is absent in humans but essential for pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, making it a rich source of drug targets for the development of novel anti-infectives. Standard computer-aided drug-design tools, frequently applied in other areas of drug development, often fail for targets with large, hydrophilic binding sites such as DXPS. Therefore, we introduce the concept of pseudo-inhibitors, combining the benefits of pseudo-ligands (defining a pharmacophore) and pseudo-receptors (defining anchor points in the binding site), for providing the basis to perform a LBVS against M. tuberculosis DXPS. Starting from a diverse set of reference ligands showing weak inhibition of the orthologue from Deinococcus radiodurans DXPS, we identified three structurally unrelated classes with promising in vitro (against M. tuberculosis DXPS) and whole-cell activity including extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. The hits were validated to be specific inhibitors of DXPS and to have a unique mechanism of inhibition. Furthermore, two of the hits have a balanced profile in terms of metabolic and plasma stability and display a low frequency of resistance development, making them ideal starting points for hit-to-lead optimization of antibiotics with an unprecedented mode of action.", "date": "2022-04-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We have recently developed an integrated glass microfluidic probe (iMFP) for nano-DESI MSI, which simplifies the experimental setup and enables imaging with a spatial resolution of 25 \u00b5m. Herein, we describe an improved design of the iMFP for the high-throughput imaging of tissue sections. We increased the dimensions of the primary and spray channels and optimized the spray voltage and solvent flow rate to obtain a stable operation of the iMFP at both low (0.04 mm/s) and high (0.4 mm/s) scan rates. We demonstrate the performance of the high-throughput iMFP by imaging mouse uterine and brain tissue sections. We observe that the sensitivity, molecular coverage, and spatial resolution obtained using the iMFP do not change to a significant extent as the scan rate increases. Using a scan rate of 0.4 mm/s, we obtained high quality images of mouse uterine tissue sections (scan area: 3.2 mm\u00d72.3 mm) in only 9.5 minutes and of mouse brain tissue (scan area: 7.0 mm\u00d75.4 mm) in 21.7 minutes, which corresponds to a 10-15-fold improvement in the experimental throughput. We have also developed a quantitative metric for evaluating the quality of ion images obtained at different scan rates. Specifically, by defining regions of interest (ROI) in both a representative ion image and optical image of the tissue section, we calculated the spatial deviation between the two ROIs by counting the number of mismatched pixels. Using this metric, we demonstrate that the percent deviation increases slightly from 6.7% to 10.2 % with an increase in the scan rate from 0.02 to 0.4 mm/s. The maximum experimental throughput achieved in this study is limited by the acquisition rate of a mass spectrometer necessary to achieve the desired spatial resolution and may be further improved using a faster instrument.

In this work, we have rigorously computed the surface excess of adsorption for six binary liquid mixtures on silica gel at 303 K using the frameworks of the adsorbed solution theory and the generalized Langmuir isotherm model. The six binary liquid mixtures studied in this work were formed by the pair-wise combinations of four components: benzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, cyclohexane, and n-heptane. We have based our calculations by considering simultaneous equilibria of three phases: saturated binary vapor phase, binary liquid phase, and the adsorbed phase. The composition of the corresponding saturated vapor phase was determined by correlating the experimental vapor-liquid equilibria data using the Non-Random Two-Liquid activity coefficient model. The activity coefficients of the adsorbed phase were calculated using the adsorption Non-Random Two-Liquid activity coefficient model.

In this study, we report on the results of the SAMPL8 host-guest blind challenge for predicting absolute binding affinities. SAMPL8 focused on two host-guest datasets, one involving the cucurbituril CB8 (with a series of common drugs of abuse) and another involving two different Gibb deep-cavity cavitands. The latter dataset involved a  previously featured deep cavity cavitand (TEMOA) as well as a new variant (TEETOA), both binding to a series of relatively rigid fragment-like guests. Challenge participants employed a reasonably wide variety of methods, though many of these were based on molecular simulations, and predictive accuracy was mixed. As in some previous SAMPL iterations (SAMPL6 and SAMPL7), we found that one approach to achieve greater accuracy was to apply empirical corrections to the binding free energy predictions, taking advantage of prior data on binding to these hosts. Another approach which performed well was a hybrid MD-based approach with reweighting to a force matched QM potential. In the cavitand challenge, an alchemical method using the AMOEBA-polarizable force field achieved the best success with RMSE less than 1 kcal/mol, while another alchemical approach (ATM/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/HREM) had RMSE less than 1.75 kcal/mol.

However, the labeling process or selective chemical reaction of carbohydrates have been a challenging task because of their chemical, functional, and structural diversities, and no single chemical modification tool can be universally applicable to all the target substrates in different environments. In this report, we have developed a bioconjugation strategy for labeling of carbohydrate derivatives through a phosphine-mediated three-component coupling reaction in an ionic liquid medium. The multiple characterization methods identified a urea group as the reaction product of the phosphine-mediated coupling through the installation of carbonyl group from carbon dioxide in air and loss of nitrogen gas from the azide group. We have developed purification protocols to facilitate the cleanup and analysis of ionic liquid-based bioconjugation processes, which can be used for a diverse set of carbohydrate derivatives. The phosphine-mediated urea-forming reaction was applied to a variety of amine- and azide-containing carbohydrates such as antibiotics, anti-tumor agent, and polysaccharide with corresponding azide- and amine-based reagent, respectively. The ionic liquid-based bioconjugation was amenable for the chemical modification of the mammalian cell lysate in an azide-dependent manner. Thus, the present report represents not only the advancement of the nonaqueous bioconjugation method for carbohydrate derivatives from the reaction development perspectives, but also their practical utility for creation of carbohydrate conjugates as well as a study tool of the biomolecule through the bioorthogonal chemistry-like reactivity.", "date": "2022-04-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One popular approach is using reinforcement learning to update a recurrent neural network or language-based de novo molecule generator. However, reinforcement learning can be inefficient, sometimes requiring up to 10^5 molecules to be sampled to optimize more complex objectives, which poses a limitation when using computationally expensive scoring functions like docking or computer-aided synthesis planning models. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning strategy called Augmented Hill-Climb based on a simple, hypothesis-driven hybrid between REINVENT and Hill-Climb that improves sample-efficiency by addressing the limitations of both currently used strategies. We compare its ability to optimize several docking tasks with REINVENT and benchmark this strategy against other commonly used reinforcement learning strategies including REINFORCE, REINVENT (version 1 & 2), Hill-Climb and best agent reminder. We find that optimization ability is improved ~1.5-fold and sample-efficiency is improved ~45-fold compared to REINVENT while still delivering appealing chemistry as output. Diversity filters were used, and their parameters were tuned to overcome observed failure modes that take advantage of certain diversity filter configurations. Lastly, we find that Augmented Hill-Climb outperforms the other reinforcement learning strategies used on six tasks, especially in the early stages of training or for more difficult objectives. Overall, we hence show that AHC improves sample-efficiency for language-based de novo molecule generation conditioning via reinforcement learning, compared to the current state-of-the-art.

We have performed simulations at two temperatures using six MD systems representing two equilibrium lipase conformers in three solvents. Because the open and\nclosed conformations differ in geometry, recruiting both lipase forms provided a broader understanding of the molecular effect of SDS on thermoalkalophilic lipases. Low temperature simulations underscored the potential of SDS for maintaining the active form of thermoalkalophilic lipases through binding to the sn-1 acyl-chain binding pocket in the open conformation similar to non-ionic surfactants and also transforming the closed conformation to an open-like state. Consistent with MD findings, experimental analysis showed increased lipase activity upon SDS incubation at room temperature, suggesting SDS as an activator of this lipase family. High temperature simulations suggested a partial denaturating effect of SDS on thermoalkalophilic lipases monomers such that only surface structures including a \u03b2-hairpin motif which carries one of the catalytic amino acids were unfolded while the lipase core stayed intact regardless of SDS concentration or lid conformation. Simulations of lipase dimers, on the other hand, showed less flexible surface structures including the catalytically important \u03b2-hairpin, implying that intermolecular interactions within lipase dimers protects the structure against SDS-induced unfolding.

In native top-down MS, the extent of protein charging is low. Given that ions with more charge fragment more readily, increasing charge can enhance the extent of sequence information obtained by top-down MS. For \u03b8-nanoESI, dual-channelled nanoESI emitters are used to mix two solutions in low to sub-\u03bcs prior to MS. The mechanism for \u03b8-nanoESI mixing has been reported to occur in the Taylor cone prior to ESI-droplet formation, or by the fusion of droplets formed from separate Taylor cones. Using \u03b8-nanoESI-ion mobility-MS, native protein solutions were rapidly mixed with denaturing supercharging solutions to form protein ions in significantly higher charge states and with more elongated structures than those formed by pre-mixing the solutions prior to nanoESI-MS. If \u03b8-nanoESI mixing occurred in the Taylor cone, then the extent of protein charging and unfolding should be comparable or less than that obtained by pre-mixing solutions. Thus, these data are consistent with mixing occurring via droplet fusion rather than in the Taylor cone prior to ESI droplet formation. The presence of supercharging additives in pre-mixed solutions can suppress volatile electrolyte evaporation, limiting the extent of protein charging compared to when the additive is delivered via one channel of a \u03b8-nanoESI emitter. In \u03b8-nanoESI, the formation of two Taylor cones can presumably result in substantial electrolyte evaporation from the ESI droplets containing native-like proteins prior to droplet fusion, thereby enhancing ion charging.", "date": "2022-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An accepted mechanism includes Ca2+-triggered aggregation of the DP molecule to form oligomers. DP and its oligomers have so far defied structural analysis at a molecular level, and we studied the process by the combined use of dynamic light scattering in water and atomic-resolution cinematographic imaging of DP molecules captured on a carbon nanotube on which the DP molecule is installed as a fishhook. We found that the DP molecule aggregates weakly into dimers, trimers, and tetramers in water, and strongly in the presence of calcium ions, and that the tetramer is the largest oligomer in a homogeneous aqueous solution. The dimer remains as the major species under a variety of conditions, and we propose a face-to-face stacked structure based on dynamic imaging using millisecond and angstrom resolution transmission electron microscopy. The tetramer is the largest oligomer observed both in the absence and in the presence of a large excess of calcium ions. Taken together with statistical data, the microscopic structural information obtained at a single-molecule level favors a cyclic form of the dimer and the tetramer over a linear or stacked form. Such experimental structural information is new and will serve as a platform for future drug design.

Both (E)- and (Z)-alkenes were obtained efficiently and highly-selectively, under very mild conditions, using a single homogenous acridine-based ruthenium catalyst.

Thus, the absence or presence of catalytic thiol controls the stereoselectivity of this alkyne semihydrogenation, affording either the (E)-isomer as the final product, or halting the reaction at the (Z)-intermediate. The developed system, which is also applied to the controllable isomerization of a terminal alkene, demonstrates how selective metal catalysis can be achieved by reversible inhibition of the catalyst with a simple auxiliary additive.", "date": "2022-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These materials are exploited for biomedical applications such as biosensors, injectable scaffolds, drug delivery and tissue engineering. Recently, our group reported firefly-inspired hydrogel matrices for 3D cell culture. This platform exhibited certain advantages like rapid gelation rate and tunability of mechanical and biological properties. However, this firstly reported system did not allow for fine control of the gelation onset because the crosslinking reaction started as soon as the two precursors were mixed. Moreover, one of its precursors demonstrated poor storage stability in aqueous solution. These limitations restrict its application as injectable matrices. In this article, we endow the luciferin-inspired hydrogels with redox-triggering capability, to overcome the limitations of the previous system and to widen its application range. We achieve this goal by introducing protected macromers as hydrogel polymeric precursors that can be activated in the presence of a mild reductant, to trigger gel formation in situ with high degree of control. We demonstrate that the regulation of intrinsic (e.g., structure of protecting group, reductant type) and extrinsic (e.g., pH, temperature) parameters of the triggering reaction can be used to modulate key materials properties. This novel upgraded redox-triggerable system enables precise control over gelation onset and kinetics, thus facilitating its utilization as injectable hydrogel without negatively impacting its cytocompatibility. Our findings expand the current toolkit of chemically-based stimuli-responsive hydrogels.

Its NH4-form ion-exchanges higher amount of isolated divalent M(II) ions than the conventional one: this is the consequence of increased number of Al pairs in the structure induced by the +2 charge of Sr(II) cations in the synthesis gel that force two charge-compensating AlO4- motives to reside closer together. We characterize the +2 state of Co(II) ions in these materials with infra-red spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, and show their utility for NOx pollutant adsorption from ambient air: the ones derived from SSZ-13 with higher Al pair content contain more isolated cobalt(II) and thus, perform better as ambient-air NOx adsorbers. Notably, Co(II)/SSZ-13 with increased number of Al pairs is significantly more hydrothermally stable than its NaOH-derived analogue. Loading Pd(II) into Co-SSZ-13(Sr) produces an active NOx adsorber (PNA) material that can be used for NOx adsorption from simulated diesel engine exhaust. The critical issue for these applications is hydrothermal stability of Pd-zeolites. Pd/SSZ-13 synthesized in the presence of Sr(OH)2 does not lose its PNA capacity after extremely harsh aging at 850 and 900 \u2070C (10 hours in 10% H2O/air flow) and loses only ~55% capacity after hydrothermal aging at 930 \u2070C.  This can be extended to other divalent metals for catalytic applications, such as copper: we show that Cu/SSZ-13 catalyst can survive hydrothermal aging at 920 \u2070C without losing its catalytic properties, metal dispersion and crystalline structure. Thus, we provide a new, simple, and scalable strategy for making remarkably (hydro)thermally stable metal-zeolite materials/catalysts with a number of useful applications.

Herein, we determined and evaluated the minimum distance of two epitopes in sandwich immunoassays for small molecules. Briefly, nine model analytes comprising two hapten epitopes, i.e., melamine (MEL) and p-nitroaniline (NIA), were designed by increasing the linear chain linkers brick by brick. Two groups of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced with different recognition properties toward MEL and NIA using 12 new haptens with different spacer arms. The results indicated that two epitopes of the analyte with a distance of only 2.4 \u00c5 could be simultaneously bound by two mAbs, which is the known limit of epitope distance in sandwich immunoassays thus far. We further found that an epitope distance of below 8.8 \u00c5 for the analyte generally induces noticeable steric hindrance of antibodies, preventing a sandwich immunoassay with high probability. These observations were investigated and evaluated by molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and surface plasmon resonance and using model and real analytes.

It reduces the radiation burden to healthy tissue. Pretargeting is based on bioorthogonal chemistry. The most attractive reaction for this purpose is currently the tetrazine ligation, which occurs between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) tags and tetrazines (Tzs). Pretargeted imaging beyond the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) has not been reported thus far. In this study, we developed Tz imaging agents that are capable to ligate in vivo to targets beyond the BBB. We chose to develop 18F-labeled Tzs as they can be applied to positron emission tomography (PET) - the most powerful molecular imaging technology. Fluorine-18 is an ideal radionuclide for PET due to its almost ideal decay properties. Fluorine-18 also allows - as a non-metal radionuclide - to develop Tzs with physicochemical properties enabling passive brain diffusion. In order to develop these imaging agents, we applied a rational drug design approach. This approach was based on estimated and experimental determined parameters such as the BBB score, pretargeted autoradiography contrast, in vivo input and washout curves as well as on metabolism studies. From initially 18 developed structures, five Tzs were selected to be tested on their in vivo click performance. Whereas all selected structures clicked in vivo into the brain, [18F]18 displayed the most favorable characteristics with respect to brain pretargeting. [18F]18 is our lead compound for future pretargeted imaging studies based on BBB-penetrant monoclonal antibodies. Pretargeting beyond the BBB will allow us to image targets beyond the BBB that are currently not imageable. For example, soluble protein isoforms could be imaged. These proteins are valuable drug targets for several neurodegenerative diseases and can currently not be imaged. Imaging would allow for diagnosis of these diseases, identifying responders from non-responders or to monitor treatment. Consequently, imaging will provide valuable information to accelerate drug development and greatly benefit patient care.", "date": "2022-04-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, it is challenging for conventional batch crystallization approaches to effectively control the polymorphism of obtained crystals. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for controlling polymorphic crystallization by using quasi-double-emulsions (QDEs) as programmable microcrystallizers. The QDEs utilize a thin oil layer to separate aqueous droplets trapped in a high-density microwell array from the continuous aqueous phase, forming a large number of water-oil-water (W/O/W) structures similar to double emulsions. Benefitting from the semi-permeability of its middle oil film, the QDEs platform can facilely and flexibly vary the supersaturation rate and solvent composition of its inner aqueous phase (IAP) via changing its outer aqueous phase (OAP). Such variations can tune the kinetics of crystallization in the IAP, thus achieving highly controlled polymorphic crystallization and obtaining desired crystal polymorphs. In a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrated the convenience and versatility of the QDE platform by applying it for regulating the polymorph of glycine. Compared to traditional crystallizers, the QDEs platform provides more controllability and flexibility in polymorphic crystallization, being a powerful tool for solid form screening in pharmaceutical, fine chemicals, and food industries.", "date": "2022-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This article reports on the development of a versatile on-substrate electrode setup for spectroelectrochemical Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measurements on redox conductive polymers for ORBs. Quantitative in-operando EPR experiments performed on electrochemical cells with a di-TEMPO Ni-Salen polymer as active electrode material demonstrate a strong decrease in the number of paramagnetic centers upon oxidizing the film. The distinct EPR signatures of the TEMPO-containing polymer and its fragments in different molecular environments are used to study its degradation upon repeated cycling. A comparison between the number of EPR-active sites and the number of electrochemically active charges, as measured by cyclic voltammetry, provides information on the nature of the degradation process. Low-temperature ex-situ pulse EPR measurements on the oxidized polymer film reveal the spectrum of dilute nitroxide species, which may be associated with electrochemically inactive islands. These experiments pave the way for advanced EPR techniques for accurately determining distances between adjacent paramagnetic centers and thus for identifying performance-limiting loss mechanisms, which can eventually help develop strategies for making ORBs powerful contenders on the path towards sustainable electrochemical power sources.", "date": "2022-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Bio-based polymers, obtained from renewable biomass resources, have received wide attention in the past two decades. Bioplastics formulated using bio-based polymers are a promising sustainable alternative to oil-based plastics, and may particularly benefit countries that are heavily dependent on foreign oil. This paper provides a brief overview of the three types of bio-based polymers, discusses the strengths and limitations of each type, highlights the latest research progresses, and evaluates recent trends in related scientific publications. The annual publication volumes of most bio-based polymers analyzed share the common pattern of steady growths, followed by stabilization or declines starting from the mid-2010s. The trends may be ascribed to changes in the prices of fossil fuel-based plastics, which in turn reflect the fluctuations in crude oil prices. Without strong financial support or technological breakthroughs, the manufacture of bioplastics is still too costly to compete against oil-based materials. Aside from economic challenges, bio-based polymers often face skepticism from the public, likely a result of misconceptions.

Owing to both weak intermolecular interactions and complicated interplay between molecules, the manipulation of inter-molecular motion to realize specific structures and properties as well as applications, is challenging but attractive. Here, we reported that the photoluminescence property of luminogens could be tuned by the manipulation of the inter-molecular motion based on the dynamic ionic bond between the cation of acridinium and the anion of tetraphenyl boron. The free inter-molecular motion and the strong attraction of the ionic bond in the non/less polar solvents enabled the formation of a dark state in the excited state with faint emission. In contrast, multiple ionic bonds between cation and anion together with non-covalent interactions were observed in the crystalline state. This directly contributed to the restriction of the inter-molecular motion (RIMM), and eventually gave rise to bright aggregation-induced emission. Such a RIMM model for efficient solid-state emission can be validated by several organic ionic species. More importantly, this type of \u201cmulticomponent luminogens\u201d showed remarkable reactive oxygen species generation, which enabled them to kill bacteria even superbugs upon white-light irradiation.

Selective glycosylation of unprotected sugars and other polyhydroxylated nucleophiles is a particularly significant goal, requiring not only control over the stereochemistry of the forming bond but also differentiation between similarly reactive nucleophilic sites in stereochemically complex contexts. Chemists have generally relied on multi-step protecting-group strategies to achieve site control in glycosylations, but practical inefficiencies arise directly from the application of such approaches. We describe here a new strategy for small-molecule-catalyst-controlled, highly stereo- and site-selective glycosylations of unprotected or minimally protected mono- and disaccharides using precisely designed bis-thiourea small-molecule catalysts. Stereo- and site-selective galactosylations and mannosylations of a wide assortment of polyfunctional nucleophiles is thereby achieved. Kinetic and computational studies provide evidence that site selectivity arises from stabilizing C\u2013H/\u03c0 interactions between the catalyst and the nucleophile, analogous to those documented in sugar-binding proteins. This work demonstrates that highly selective glycosylation reactions can be achieved through control of stabilizing noncovalent interactions, a potentially general strategy for selective functionalization of carbohydrates.", "date": "2022-04-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Increasing the fluorine content from NbO2F to NbF3 leads to a transition from semiconducting, through metallic, to half-metallic behaviour as x increases. The effect of pressure on this behaviour is also investigated, finding a transition from cubic to rhombohedral symmetry for all compositions below a maximum transition pressure of 5 GPa for x = 0.35. Additionally, we reveal that compositions close to NbF3 are expected to retain rhombohedral symmetry under ambient pressure. The structural phase transition and electronic behaviour are independent for most compositions except those close to NbO1.65F1.35.

Protein lysine acetylation regulates metabolism, gene expression, and microtubule formation and has been extensively studied; however, the understanding of the biological significance of other acyl posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is still in its infancy. The acylation of lysine residues is either mediated by acyltransferase \u2018writer\u2019 enzymes or through non-enzymatic mechanisms and hydrolase enzymes, termed \u2018erasers\u2019, cleave various acyl PTMs to reverse the modified state. We have studied the human lysine deacylase enzymes, comprising the 11 Zn2+-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the 7 NAD+-consuming sirtuins (SIRTs), over the last decade. We have thus developed selective inhibitors and molecular probes as well as studied the acyl substrate scope of each enzyme using chemically synthesized peptide substrates and photo-crosslinking probes. Recently, we have turned our attention to lysine PTMs containing a stereogenic center, such as \uf065-N-\uf062-hydroxybutyryllysine (Kbhb) and \uf065-N-lactyllysine (Kla), that each comprise a pair of mirror image stereoisomers. Both modifications are found on histones, where they affect gene transcription in response to specific metabolic states, and they are found on cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (Kbhb) and glycolysis (Kla), respectively. Thus, chiral modifications to lysine side chains give rise to two distinct diastereomeric products, with separate metabolic origins and potentially different activities exhibited by writer and eraser enzymes. Lysine L-lactylation derives from L-lactate, a major energy carrier produced from pyruvate after glycolysis, and it is highly induced by metabolic states such as the Warburg effect. L-Lactate can possibly be activated by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetases and transferred to lysine residues by histone acetyltransferases such as p300. D-Lactylation, on the other hand, arises primarily from a non-enzymatic reaction with D-lactylglutathione, an intermediate in the glyoxalase pathway. In addition to their distinct origin, we found that both K(L-la) and K(D-la) modifications are erased by HDACs with different catalytic efficiencies. Also, K(L-bhb) and K(D-bhb) arise from different metabolites but depend on interconnected metabolic pathways, while the two stereoisomers of \uf065-N-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryllysine (Khmg) derive from a single precursor that may then be regulated differently by eraser enzymes. Distinguishing between the individual stereoisomers of PTMs is therefore of crucial importance. In the present Account, we will (1) revisit the long-standing evidence for distinct production and dynamics of enantiomeric forms of chiral metabolites that serve as epsilon-N-acyllysine PTMs and (2) highlight the outstanding questions that arise from the recent literature on chiral lysine PTMs resulting from these metabolites.", "date": "2022-04-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, NMR and single crystal diffraction data show that the equilibrium still prefers the closed dimer state. Interestingly, the emission profile of RSL2 shows solvatochromic blue fluorescence. Control studies of model compounds with similar structural motifs do not display similar blue fluorescence, indicating that this optical behavior is unique to the dimeric form.

Here we present a novel approach for denoising ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra using conditional generative adversarial neural networks (cGANNs). The cGANN approach is able to eliminate shot-to-shot noise and reconstruct the lineshapes present in the noisy input spectrum. We present a general approach for training the cGANN using matched pairs of noisy and clean synthetic 2D IR spectra based on the Kubo-lineshape model for a three-level system. Experimental shot-to-shot laser noise is added to synthetic spectra to recreate the noise profile present in measured experimental spectra. The cGANNs can recover lineshapes from synthetic 2D IR spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2:1, while largely preserving the key features such as center frequencies, linewidths, and diagonal elongation. In addition, we benchmark the performance of the cGANN using experimental 2D IR spectra of an ester carbonyl vibrational probe and demonstrate that by applying the cGANN denoising approach, we can extract the frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) from reconstructed spectra using a nodal-line slope analysis.

However, it is exceedingly challenging to synthesize membrane materials that are high-performing, scalable, and processable. As a class of materials, microporous organic polymers (MOPs), which combine the gas sieving ability of microporous materials with the solution-processability of organic polymers, are highly desirable. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of linear microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) via Pd-catalyzed C-O polycondensation reaction. The scaffold of these microporous polymers consists of rigid three-dimensional triptycene and highly stereocontorted spirobifluorene, which endow these polymers with large internal free volume as well as high porosity with angstrom-sized pores. Unlike classic polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), this robust methodology for the synthesis of poly(arylene ether)s allows for the facile incorporation of functionalities and branched linkers for control of permeation and mechanical properties. CO2-philic groups, such as nitrile and tertiary amine groups, can be incorporated into this microporous polymeric scaffold for enhancing CO2 separation performance. In addition, a solution-processable branched polymer prepared using this synthetic strategy showed good gas separation performance and enhanced mechanical properties, which allowed for the formation of a submicron defect-free film with permeance-selectivity property sets that are comparable to high-performance ultrathin polymer membranes that have been optimized at industrial scale. In contrast with commercially available polymer membranes, the easily accessible PAE branching motif endows these materials with plasticization resistance.

The RASAR method has so far been used only in the case of graded predictions or classification modeling. In this work, we attempt, for the first time, to apply RASAR for quantitative predictions (q-RASAR) using a case study of androgen receptor binding affinity data. We have computed a number of error-based and similarity-based measures such as weighted standard deviation of the predicted values, coefficient of variation of the computed predictions, average similarity level of close training compounds for each query molecule, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of similarity levels, maximum similarity levels to positive and negative close training compounds, a concordance measure indicating similarity to positive, negative or both classes of close training compounds, etc. We have clubbed these additional measures along with the selected chemical descriptors from the previously developed QSAR model and redeveloped new partial least squares (PLS) models from the training set, and predicted the endpoint using the query data set. Interestingly, these new models outperform the internal and external validation quality of the original QSAR model. In this study, we have also introduced a new similarity-based concordance measure that can significantly contribute to the model quality. A q-RASAR model also has the advantage over read-across predictions in providing easy interpretation and indicating quantitative contributions of important chemical features.

Elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of KI formation reactions facilitates the design of KI intermediates that give access to complex compounds. In this study, in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of KI formation, various mechanisms were investigated using a density functional theory approach. Particularly, Ghosez\u2019s KI formation mechanism, by activation of an amide with triflic anhydride, was extensively elaborated, since this procedure occurs under mild conditions and is, by far, the most frequently used method. Moreover, a broad range of substituents was examined to give insight on their potential contributions to the ease of formation of KIs. The effect of substituents on the reactivity of the corresponding starting amides was inspected by means of energetics, population analysis, frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) and reactivity descriptors. Computed data shows that electron donating groups lower the activation barrier by increasing the electron density of the amide carbonyl oxygen. Additionally, distortion/interaction model also confirmed the energetic outcomes. In addition, investigation of KI reactivity using FMO, and reactivity descriptors displayed that KI reactivity is inversely correlated with amide reactivity. Lastly, experimental outcomes are in line with computational predictions. We suggest that the reactivity of the amide has a crucial impact on the ease of KI formation and the reactivity of the corresponding KIs.

For example, in-plane piezo-response of TiOBr2 (both e11 and d11) is about an order of magnitude larger than that of widely studied 1H-MoS2 monolayer, and also quite comparable to giant piezoelectricity of group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers e.g., SnS.

Operando studies such as photoemission electron microscopic investigations have, however, provided evidence for (a)periodic surface concentration profiles and adspecie mobility. Consequently, the ubiquitous steady-state approximation used in nearly all (micro)-kinetic models may not be universally applicable. Furthermore, on unsupported and unpromoted catalyst surfaces, variations in the nature, quantity, and mobility of active sites are observed leading to various forms of site heterogeneity, induced heterogeneity, or both, as well as (a)periodic heterogeneity in the form of oscillatory waves and self-organised patterns. The relationship between surface-site distribution and the ensuing homogeneity and/or heterogeneity and product distribution and the resulting modelling tools used for analysis have not been explored comprehensively. Consequently, we provide a framework for cataloguing catalysts for advanced kinetic characterisation and modelling. The catalogue has two functions: (1) it relates surface models with reactor models, and (2) for any specific reaction, it shows (visually) the dynamicity of adspecie formation and evolution on the catalyst surface. Indeed, this second advantage has been exemplified by archived studies of carbon monoxide oxidation over Pd(111) catalysts. Using the homotattic patch model that leads to the adsorption integral equation, we catalogue catalysts according to evolving active sites on catalyst surfaces with varied homogeneity. We observe that the conventional microkinetic models are only accurate for a very small subset of chemical reactions where the standard model of catalysis applies. However, for many redox catalytic transformations, these models lose their applicability with respect to the dynamics of the active site, catalyst surface, and reaction. As a substitute, we present microdynamic models which not only account for every elementary reaction step but incorporate a multi-scale approach within kinetic models allowing for changing catalyst states, charge transport, as well as active site, catalyst surface, reaction, and reactor dynamics.", "date": "2022-04-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Reaction Engineering; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Here, we report a methionine-directed ABPP platform using Redox-Activated Chemical Tagging (ReACT), which leverages a biomimetic oxidative ligation strategy for selective methionine modification. Application of ReACT to the cancer-driver protein cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a representative high-value drug target identified three new hyperreactive, ligandable methionine residues, including an allosteric M169 site that is proximal to an activating T172 phosphorylation site. With this information in hand, we designed and synthesized a new methionine-targeting covalent ligand library based on oxaziridine fragments bearing a diverse array of heterocyclic, heteroatom, and stereochemically-rich substituents. ABPP screening of this focused library against a clickable broad-spectrum ReACT probe identified 1oxF11 as a covalent modifier of the CDK4/Cyclin-D1 heterodimer at the M169 site. This compound inhibited CDK4 kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner on purified protein and in live cells. Further biochemical analyses with a phospho-specific CDK4 antibody revealed crosstalk between M169 oxidation and T172 phosphorylation upon 1oxF11 treatment, where M169 oxidation prevented phosphorylation of the activating T172 site on CDK4 and blocked cell cycle progression at the S-phase checkpoint.

In this perspective it will be argued on the basis of a grand-canonical approach that such a Nernstian behavior can only be reproduced if the free energy of the adsorbate phase is independent of the electrochemical control parameters. In general, this should not be true so that the Nernstian behavior should be the exception rather than the rule. Still, structural and chemical factors will be discussed that might lead to a Nernstian behavior. This requires an analysis of the electrochemical electrolyte/electrode interface on the atomistic level.

Expected overpotentials from these bulk components are minimal relative to that from charge-transfer resistance. However, literature reports show that cell overpotentials are often much more sensitive to conductive additives than the expected level from bulk or\npercolating-network transport. This discrepancy motivates a detailed examination of the contact resistance between the active material and conductive additive. We simultaneously\nmeasure contact and bulk resistances using dense bar samples of lithium layered oxides (LixNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 and LixNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2) in contact with carbon black. We find that the contact resistance dominates the overall electronic resistance when the length scale is smaller than millimeters; after correcting for contact effects, bulk conductivity of layered oxides is determined to be orders-of-magnitude higher than previously reported. In porous\nelectrodes, we find from three-electrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that the carbon content most heavily influences the low-frequency regime (around 0.01 Hz), as opposed to the high frequency (>10^3 Hz) regime expected from electronic percolating properties. We identify constriction effects within the layered oxide as the dominant mechanism for contact resistance and investigate its implication for porous electrodes.", "date": "2022-04-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, the dry frameworks of these hydrates, especially for non-stoichiometric or isostructural dehydrates, can often be predicted from a standard anhydrous crystal structure prediction (CSP). Inspired by developments in the field of drug binding, we introduce an efficient data-driven and topologically aware approach for predicting organic molecular crystal hydrate structures through a mapping of water positions within the crystal structures. As such, the method does not require a priori specification of water content and can, therefore, predict stoichiometric, fractional, and non-stoichiometric hydrate structures.  This approach, which we term MACH (Mapping of Crystalline Hydrates), establishes a set of rules for systematic determination of favorable positions for water insertion within predicted or experimental crystal structures based on considerations of the chemical features of local environments and void regions. The proposed approach is tested on hydrates of three pharmaceutically relevant compounds that exhibit diverse crystal packing motifs and void environments characteristic of hydrate structures.  Overall, we show that this mapping approach introduces a new advance in the efficient performance of hydrate CSP through generation of stable hydrate stoichiometries at low cost and should be considered an integral component for CSP workflows.", "date": "2022-04-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The AuNCs significantly impact the electrochemical performance of the investigated electrode (ITO, GC, bulk gold) systems driven by surface electrons promoting the catalytic effect. Cyclic voltammetry jointly with scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) allowed us to decipher the molecular mechanism of substrate-induced electrostatic assembling of gold nanocube arrays, revealing that the accelerated electrocatalytic effect should be attributed to the confinement of the heterogeneous diffusion fields with tremendous electrochemically active surface area variations. The AuNC drop-casting at ITO, GC, and Au led to various mechanisms of heterogeneous charge transfer, where only in the case of GC, the decoration significantly increased both the electrochemically active surface area (EASA) and ferrocyanide redox kinetics. For ITO and Au substrates, AuNC drop-casting lowers system dimensionality rather than expanding the EASA, where Au-Au self-diffusion was also observed.

The 31P spectra reveal that ATP binds strongly in the pre-hydrolytic state to both ATP-binding sites as inferred from the analysis of the non-hydrolytic E504A mutant.

However, the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena remain elusive. It is remarkable that the magnetic energies implicated in these effects are much smaller than thermal energies. Here we review these observations, of which there are now hundreds, and we suggest that a viable explanation is provided by the radical pair mechanism, which involves the quantum dynamics of the electron and nuclear spins of naturally occurring transient radical molecules. While the radical pair mechanism has been studied in detail in the context of avian magnetoreception, the studies reviewed here show that magnetosensitivity is widespread throughout biology. We review magnetic field effects on various physiological functions, organizing them based on the type of the applied magnetic fields, namely static, hypomagnetic, and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as isotope effects. We then review the radical pair mechanism as a potential unifying model for the described magnetic field effects, and we discuss plausible candidate molecules that might constitute the radical pairs. We review recent studies proposing that the quantum nature of the radical pairs provides promising explanations for xenon anesthesia, lithium effects on hyperactivity, magnetic field and lithium effects on the circadian clock, and hypomagnetic field effects on neurogenesis and microtubule assembly.

The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 is an attractive approach in this context, because of the added potential benefit of addressing its rising atmospheric concentrations. In previous experimental and computational studies, we have described the mechanism of the first molecular Cr complex capable of electrocatalytically reducing CO2 to CO in the presence of an added proton donor, which contained a redox-active 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) fragment, CrN2O2. The high selectivity for CO in the bpy-based system was dependent on a delocalized Cr(II)(bpy\u2022\u2212) active state. Subsequently, we became interested in exploring how expanding the polypyridyl ligand core would impact selectivity and activity during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Computational analyses indicate that although the stoichiometry of both reactions is identical, changes in the observed rate law are the combined result of a decrease in intrinsic ligand charge (L3X vs L2X2) and an increase in ligand redox activity, which result in increased electronic coupling between the doubly reduced tpy fragment of the ligand and the Cr(II) center. The strong electronic coupling enhances the rate of protonation and subsequent C\u2013OH bond cleavage, resulting in CO2 binding becoming the rate-determining step, which is an uncommon mechanism during protic CO2 reduction.", "date": "2022-04-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The divalent Pd2+ cations upon elevated temperature (>800 \u00b0C) calcination occupy sterically constrained cationic position that render them inactive for the adsorption of probe molecules such as NO.

Nevertheless, generative models are known for sometimes generating unrealistic, unsynthesizable or unstable structures. This calls for methods to constrain those algorithms to generate structures in reasonable portions of the chemical space. While the concept of applicability domains (AD) for predictive models is well studied, its counterpart for generative models is not yet defined. In this work, we examine empirically various possibilities and propose applicability domains suited for generative models. Using both public and internal datasets, we use state-of-the-art generative methods to generate novel structures that are predicted actives by a corresponding QSAR model, while constraining the generative model to stay within a given applicability domain. Our work looks at several applicability domain definitions, combining various criteria, such as structural similarity to the training set, similarity of physico-chemical properties, unwanted substructures, and Quantitative Estimate of Drug- Likeness (QED). We assess both from a qualitative and quantitative point of view the structures generated, and find that the applicability domain definitions have a strong influence on the chemical beauty of generated molecules. An extensive analysis of our results allows us to identify applicability domain definitions that are best suited for generating drug-like molecules with generative models.

The new shapeshifting antibiotics are not disadvantaged by the common mechanism of vancomycin resistance resulting from the alteration of the C-terminal dipeptide with the corresponding D-Ala-D-Lac depsipeptide. Further, evidence suggests that the shapeshifting ligands destabilize the complex formed between the flippase MurJ and lipid II, inferring the potential for a new mode of action for polyvalent glycopeptides.

It is based on time-lapse fluorescence microscopy which facilitates following reaction kinetics in individual cells. The current CRRC workflow utilizes a single fluorescence image to manually identify cell contours; these contours are then used to determine fluorescence intensity of individual cells in the entire time-stack of images. This workflow can only be used reliably if the cells maintain their positions during the time-lapse measurements; if the cells move, the results of a CRRC experiment will be inaccurate. The requirement of invariant cell positions during a prolonged imaging is impossible to satisfy for motile cells. Here we report on developing an advanced workflow that makes CRRC applicable to motile cells. The new workflow combines fluorescence microscopy with brightfield (BF) microscopy and utilizes automated processing and analysis of images. A BF image is taken right after every fluorescence image and used to determine cell contours. The contours are tracked through the time-stack of BF images to account for cell movement. A set of contours, which is unique for every image, is then used to determine fluorescence intensity of cells in the associated fluorescent image. Finally, time dependencies of intracellular fluorescence intensities are used to determine the rate constant and plot a kinetic histogram \u201cnumber of cells vs rate constant\u201d. The robustness of the new workflow to cell movement was confirmed experimentally by conducting a CRRC study of cross-membrane transport in motile cells. The new workflow makes CRRC applicable to a wide range of cell types and eliminates the influence of cell motility on the accuracy of results.", "date": "2022-04-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Imaging; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this approach, an exchange-correlation functional is evaluated using a Hartree-Fock density rather than the DFT density, to incorporate correlation while avoiding self-interaction error.  Results for an electron-polaron in TiO2 and a hole-polaron in Al-doped silica demonstrate that geometry optimization with semilocal functionals drives significant structural distortion including elongation of several bonds, such that subsequent single-point calculations with hybrid functionals fail to afford a localized defect even when hybrid functional optimizations do localize the polaron.

Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) offers a fast and cost-efficient way of hyperpolarization.

This shortcoming is mainly due to problems in the synthesis of the corresponding PHIP precursor molecules. The most widely used DNP tracer in clinical studies, particularly for the detection of prostate cancer, is 1-13C-pyruvate. The ideal derivative for PHIP is the deuterated vinyl ester because the spin physics allows for 100% polarization. Unfortunately, there is no efficient synthesis for vinyl esters of \uf062-ketocarboxylic acids in general and pyruvate in particular. Here, we present an efficient new method for the preparation of vinyl esters, including 13C labeled, fully deuterated vinyl pyruvate using a palladium catalyzed procedure.

In past, most conjugated molecular wires exhibit low conductance that decays as the wire length increases. To overcome this limitation, we studied a family of oligophenylene-bridged bis(triarylamines) with tunable and stable (mono-/di-)radicaloid character. The wires can undergo one- and two-electron chemical oxidations to the corresponding monocation and dication, respectively. We found that the oxidized wires exhibit high reversed conductance decay with increasing length, consistent with the expectation for the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type one-dimensional (1D) topological insulators. The champion 2.6 nm long dication displays a significantly high conductance greater than 0.1 G0 (2e2/h, the conductance quantum), 5400-fold greater than the neutral form. The observed conductance-length relationship is similar between monocation and dication series.

The basic dilution equation (C1V1 = C2V2) alone is not amenable for the programming and computerization of the serial dilutions. The best solution to this dilemma is to develop an equation with the delivery volume as one of the variables. We present here a modified dilution equation (MDE) that has the delivered volume as one of the variables. We demonstrate with examples how the equation can be used in delineating serial dilution steps either manually or through programming. The equation is D = C1p/C2V2, where D is the fold dilution required of a stock solution of C1 concentration which is diluted and delivered (pipetted) at a volume p to cell culture media, assay mixture etc., of volume (V2 \u2013 p), to achieve a final concentration of C2.

Herein, we report on a novel in liquid plasma electrolysis approach for the growth of hierarchical nanostructures on nickel foam. Under retention of the morphology, iron could be incorporated into this high surface area electrode. For the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and benzyl alcohol, the iron free plasma treated electrode is more suitable reaching current densities up to 800 mA/cm\u00b2 with Faradaic efficiencies above 95%. For the OER, the iron incorporated nickel foam electrode reached the industrially relevant current density of 500 mA/cm\u00b2 at 1.473\u00b10.013 VRHE (60 \u00b0C) and showed no activity decrease over 140 h. The different effects of the iron doping is rationalised using MeOH doping and in situ Raman spectroscopy.  Furthermore, we could separate changes in intrinsic activity per active site and number of active sites for the OER as well as reveal diffusion limitations of the organic oxidation reactions which we explain with respect to the surface morphology.

Tripolyphosphate was a stronger complexing agent for lead than trimetaphosphate (1 \u00b1 0.01 vs 0.07 \u00b1 0.01 molPb/molPolyphosphate), and hexametaphosphate was associated with greater lead solubility (1.6-2.1 \u00b1 0.1 molPb/molPolyphosphate). \nAt equivalent orthophosphate and polyphosphate concentrations (as P), orthophosphate-trimetaphosphate had minimal impact on lead release, while orthophosphate-tripolyphosphate increased dissolved by 554 \u00b1 29 and 213 \u00b1 22 \u03bcg Pb0.2\u03bcm m-2  at 30-min and 24-hr reaction times, respectively. Meanwhile, orthophosphate-hexametaphosphate increased dissolved lead only at the 24-hr reaction time (by 256 \u00b1 13 \u03bcg Pb0.2\u03bcm m-2). Both orthophosphate-tripolyphosphate and orthophosphate-hexametaphosphate increased small colloidal lead concentrations over a 24-hr stagnation. Except with orthophosphate-trimetaphosphate, having more polyphosphate than orthophosphate increased dissolved lead release. \nAll three polyphosphates inhibited the formation of hydroxypyromorphite and reduced the phosphorous content of the resulting lead solids. We attribute the impacts of orthophosphate-polyphosphates to a combination of complexation, adsorption, colloidal dispersion, polyphosphate hydrolysis, and lead mineral precipitation.\n", "date": "2022-04-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Hydrology and Water Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In order to accurately model sulfur\u2019s mechanisms using computational approaches, it is necessary to identify Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods that are accurate on these systems.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to monitoring a range of AMR targets in communities through analysis of wastewater. This longitudinal study provides insight into antimicrobial (AA) usage within two communities in the South West of the UK, one city (Bath) and one town (Keynsham). AAs, including metabolites, from a range of different classes were quantified over the study period. Average loads of AAs were higher in Bath than for Keynsham (difference on average was 88 \u00b1 6%) which reflected the larger population. Several AAs experienced seasonal fluctuations, such as the macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin that were found in higher loads in the winter, whilst other AA levels, including sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine, stayed consistent over the study period. Several antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) were also studied within the city area, in order to determine how closely the abundance of these genes correlates with the levels of relevant AAs. Several genes including ermB, sul1 and intI1 were not found at statistically significant different loads in winter 2018/19 when compared to summer 2019. Due to relatively stable AA and ARG levels across 13 months monitoring time, no clear correlation was observed between absolute loads of ARGs and total loads of associated AAs by class. Hospital effluent within the city catchment was also investigated for AAs and ARGs. Several AAs were more common in hospital wastewater than in community wastewater, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. This work can help establish baselines for AA usage in communities, providing community-wide surveillance and evidence for informing public health interventions.

In contrast, self-assembled structures based on inorganic nanoparticles typically rely on physical packing and drying effects to achieve uniform superlattices. By combining these two chemistries to access inorganic-organic nanostructures, we aim to understand the key factors that govern the assembly pathway and structural outcomes in hybrid systems. In this work, we outline two assembly regimes between quantum dots (QDs) and reversibly binding peptoids. These regimes can be accessed by changing the solubility and size of the hybrid (peptoid-QD) monomer unit. The hybrid monomers are prepared via ligand exchange, assembled, and the resulting assemblies are studied using ex-situ transmission electron microscopy as a function of assembly time. In aqueous conditions, QDs were found to stabilize certain morphologies of peptoid intermediates and generate a final product consisting of multilayers of small peptoid sheets linked by QDs. The QDs were also seen to facilitate or inhibit assembly in organic solvents based on the relative hydrophobicity of the surface ligands, which ultimately dictated the solubility of the hybrid monomer unit. Increasing the size of the QDs led to large hybrid sheets with regions of highly ordered square packed QDs. A second, smaller QD species can also be integrated to create binary hybrid lattices. These results create a set of design principles for controlling the structure and structural evolution of hybrid peptoid-QD assemblies and contribute to the predictive synthesis of complex hybrid matter.", "date": "2022-04-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Aggregates and Assemblies; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here, we investigate the properties of photo-excited InP/ZnSe QDs using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. We show that the evolution of the band-edge bleach with increasing exciton number can be interpreted as state filling of the conduction- and valence-band edge states by delocalized electrons and holes. In line with this interpretation, net stimulated emission is observed once the average exciton number exceeds 1. We account for this lower-than-expected gain threshold and for the spectral properties of the gain band by reckoning that the Stokes shift between band-edge absorption and emission is the dominant spectral shift. The underlying exciton-phonon coupling leads to a stimulated emission mechanism, where also single excitons could lead to net optical gain. To fully profit from this advantageous stimulated emission scheme, we argue that InP/ZnSe QDs with more narrow emission lines are needed and spurious trapping of electron-hole pairs at high exciton numbers must be suppressed, for example by better controlling the composition of the core/shell interface.", "date": "2022-04-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Quasiparticles and Excitations; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Upon heating the mixture, the 5CB mesogens underwent a nematic-isotropic transition and eventually became homogeneous with MeOH, while the polymerised RM257 preserved its radial configuration.

Calculating the overall PMI or step PMI for a given synthesis from a process description is more and more common across the pharmaceutical industry, especially in process chemistry departments. Our company has established a strong track record of delivering on our Corporate Sustainability goals, being recognized with eight EPA Green Chemistry Challenge Awards in the last 15 years and we show how these routes help define aspirational PMI tar-gets. While green chemistry principles help in optimizing PMI and developing more sustainable processes, a key challenge for the field is defining what a \u2018good\u2019 PMI for a molecule looks like given its structure alone. An existing tool chemists have at their disposal to predict PMI requires the synthetic route be provided or proposed (e.g., via retrosynthetic analysis) which then enables practitioners to compare predicted PMIs between routes. We have developed SMART-PMI (in-Silico MSD Aspirational Research Tool) to fill the gap in predicting PMI from molecular structure alone. Using only a 2D chemical structure, we can generate a predicted SMART-PMI from a measure of molecular complexity. We show how these predictions correlate with historical PMI data from our company\u2019s clinical and commercial portfolio of processes. From this SMART-PMI prediction, we have established target ranges which we termed \u201cSuccessful\u201d, \u201cWorld Class\u201d, and \u201cAspirational\u201d PMI. The goal of this range is to set the floor for what is a \u201cgood\u201d PMI for a given molecule and provide ambitious targets to drive innovative green chemistry. Using this model, chemists can develop synthetic strategies that make the biggest impact on PMI. As innovation in chemistry and processes lead to better and better PMIs , in turn, this data can drive ever more aggressive targets for the model. The potential of SMART-PMI to set industry-wide aspirational PMI tar-gets is discussed.

Overall, the binding is very moderate, slightly weaker for Ca2+ than Mg2+, and the solvent-shared ion pair is the most stable. Our results thus suggest practical ways to capture the divalent cations with biomolecular phosphate groups in complex biochemical systems.

However, one significant limitation of most spatial proteomics workflows is the requirement of large sample amounts that blurs cell-type-specific or microstructure-specific information. In this study, we developed an improved sample preparation approach for spatial proteomics and integrated it with our previously-established laser capture microdissection (LCM) and microfluidics sample processing platform. Specifically, we developed a hanging drop (HD) method to improve the sample recovery by positioning a nanowell chip upside-down during protein extraction and tryptic digestion steps. Compared with the commonly-used sitting-drop method, the HD method keeps the tissue voxel away from the container surface, and thus improves the accessibility of the extraction/digestion buffer to tissue sample. The HD method can increase the MS signal by 7 fold, leading to a 66% increase in the number of identified proteins. An average of 721, 1489, and 2521 proteins can be quantitatively profiled from laser-dissected 10-\u00b5m-thick mouse liver tissue voxels with areas of 0.0025, 0.01, and 0.04 mm2, respectively.

Upon binding of Ca2+, cTn undergoes a conformational shift that allows the troponin I switch peptide (cTnISP) to be released from the actin filament and bind to the troponin C hydrophobic patch (cTnC). Mutations and modifications to this complex can change its sensitivity to Ca2+ and alter the energetics of the transition from the Ca2+-unbound, cTnISP-unbound form to the Ca2+-bound, cTnISP-bound form. We utilized targeted MD (TMD) to obtain a trajectory of this transition pathway, followed by umbrella sampling to estimate the free energy associated with the cTnISP-cTnCHP binding and the cTnCHP opening events for wild-type (WT) cTn. We were able to reproduce experimental values for the cTnISP-cTnCHP binding event and obtain cTnCHP opening free energies in agreement with previous computational measurements of smaller cTnC systems. This excellent agreement for WT cTn demonstrated the strength of computational methods in studying the dynamics and energetics of cTn complex. We then introduced mutations to the cTn complex that cause cardiomyopathy or alter its Ca2+-sensitivity and observed a general decrease in the free energy of opening the cTnCHP. For these same mutations, we observed no general trend in the effect on the cTnISP-cTnCHP binding event.

BDD electrodes serve as an ideal electrocatalyst support due to their low background currents, wide solvent window in aqueous solution and chemical and electrochemical stability in acid and alkali solutions. The BDD RRDE configuration is employed to investigate the importance of surface incorporated non-diamond carbon in BDD on hydrogen peroxide generation via the oxygen reduction reaction in acid solutions.", "date": "2022-04-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Energy; Analytical Apparatus; Electrochemical Analysis; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be used with a variety of methods to collect structural data for proteins. One example is surface-induced dissociation (SID), which is used to break apart protein complexes (via a surface collision) into intact subcomplexes and can be performed at multiple laboratory frame SID collision energies. These energy-resolved tandem MS/MS experiments have shown that the profile of the breakages depends on the acceleration energy of the collision. It is possible to extract an appearance energy (AE) from energy-resolved mass spectrometry (ERMS) data, which shows the relative intensity of each type of subcomplex as a function of SID acceleration energy. We previously determined that these AE values for specific interfaces correlated with structural features related to interface strength. In this study, we further examined the structural relationships by developing a method to predict the full ERMS plot from structure, rather than extracting a single value. First, we noted that for proteins with multiple interface types, we could reproduce the correct shapes of breakdown curves, further confirming previous structural hypotheses. Next, we demonstrated that interface size and energy density (measured using Rosetta) correlated with data derived from the ERMS plot (R^2 = 0.71). Furthermore, based on this trend, we used native crystal structures to predict ERMS. The majority of predictions resulted in good agreement, and the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.20 for the 20 complexes in our dataset. We also show that if additional information on cleavage as a function of collision energy could be obtained, the accuracy of predictions improved further. Finally, we demonstrated that ERMS prediction results were better for the native than for inaccurate models in 17/20 cases. An application to run this simulation has been developed in Rosetta, which is freely available for use.", "date": "2022-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we show the importance of metal-ligand exchange coupling as an example of charge delocalization that can determine efficiency for photocatalytic CO2RR. A comparative evaluation of iron and cobalt complexes supported by the redox-active ligand tpyPY2Me establishes that the two-electron reduction of [Co(tpyPY2Me)]2+ ([Co]2+) occurs at potentials 770 mV more negative than the [Fe(tpyPY2Me)]2+ ([Fe]2+) analog by maximizing exchange coupling in the latter compound. The positive shift in reduction potential promoted by metal-ligand exchange coupling drives [Fe]2+ to be among the most active and selective molecular catalysts for photochemical CO2RR reported to date, maintaining up to 99% CO product selectivity with total turnover numbers (TON) and initial turnover frequencies (TOF) exceeding 30,000 and 900 min\u20131, respectively. In contrast, [Co]2+ shows much lower CO2RR activity, reaching only ca. 600 TON at 83% CO product selectivity under similar conditions accompanied by rapid catalyst decomposition. Spin density plots of the two-electron reduced [Co]0 complex implicate a paramagnetic open-shell doublet ground state compared to the diamagnetic open-shell singlet ground state of reduced [Fe]0, rationalizing the observed negative shift in two-electron reduction potentials from the [M]2+ species and lowered CO2RR efficiency for the cobalt complex relative to its iron congener. This work emphasizes the contributions of multielectron metal-ligand exchange coupling in promoting effective CO2RR and provides a starting point for the broader incorporation of this strategy in catalyst design.", "date": "2022-04-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The RBD-PD interaction has been targeted by antibodies and nanobodies to prevent viral infection, but their effectiveness against the Delta variant remains unclear. Here, we investigated RBD_Delta-PD interactions in the presence and absence of nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing 21.8 \u00b5s of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Among these nanobodies H11-H4 and H11-D4 bind RBD without overlapping ACE2. They were unable to dislocate ACE2 from RBD_Delta when bound side by side with ACE2 on RBD. Steered MD simulations at comparable loading rates to atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments estimated lower rupture forces of the nanobodies from RBD_Delta compared to ACE2.

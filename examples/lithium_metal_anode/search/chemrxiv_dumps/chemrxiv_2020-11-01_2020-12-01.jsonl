In this study, a hybrid theranostic nanosystem named TTPY-Py\u00ccCP5@AuNR is constructed via facile host-guest interactions, where TTPY-Py is a photosensitizer with aggregation-induced emission and CP5@AuNR represents the carboxylatopillar[5]arene (CP5)-modified Au nanorods. TTPY-Py\u00ccCP5@AuNR integrates the respective advantages of TTPY-Py and CP5@AuNR such as the high performance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and photothermal conversion, and meanwhile shows fluorescence responses to both temperature and pH stimuli due to the non-covalent interactions. The successful modification of CP5 macrocycles on AuNRs surfaces can eliminate the cytotoxicity of AuNRs and enable them to serve as the nanocarrier of TTPY-Py for further theranostic application. Significantly, both in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrate that this supramolecular nanotheranostic system possesses multiple phototheranostic modalities including intensive fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT), indicating its great potentials for FLI-PAI imaging-guided synergistic PDT-PTT therapy. Besides, TTPY-Py can be released from the nanocarriers upon activating by the acidic environment of lysosomes and then specifically light up mitochondria. This study brings up a new strategy into the design of versatile nanotheranostics for accurate tumor imaging and cancer therapies.", "date": "2020-11-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we reveal the origins of electronic conductivity (s<sub>e</sub>) in solid electrolytes (SEs), which is deemed responsible for solid-state battery degradation, as well as more drastic short-circuit and failure.

Upon electrochemical reduction in the presence of CO2 and a proton source, Re(bpy-TAz-PDI) exhibited significant current enhancement, where the onset of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for Re(bpy-TAz-PDI) occurred at a much less negative potential than standard Re(bpy) complexes. At an applied potential of -1.8 V vs. Fc+/0, 400 mV lower than the benchmark Re(dmbpy) catalyst, Re(bpy-TAz-PDI) was able to achieve the same catalytic activity (TONco = 24) and Faradaic efficiency (FE = 92 %) during controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments. Through a combination of UV-visible-nearIR spectroelectrochemistry (SEC), FTIR SEC, and chemical reduction experiments, it was shown that the PDI-moiety served as an electron-reservoir for Re(bpy), thereby allowing catalytic activity at lower overpotentials. Density functional theory (DFT) studies probing the optimized geometries, frontier molecular orbitals, and spin-densities of various catalytic intermediates revealed that the geometric configuration of PDI, relative to the Re(bpy)-moiety, plays a critical role in accessing electrons from the electron-reservoir.

Non-hysteretic excess capacity has been demonstrated in Na<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>3</sub>, making these materials key to understanding the electronic, chemical and structural properties that are necessary to achieve reversible excess capacity. Here, we use high-fidelity random-phase-approximation (RPA) electronic structure calculations and group theory to derive the first fully consistent mechanism of non-hysteretic oxidation beyond the transition metal limit, explaining the electrochemical and structural evolution of the Na<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>3</sub> model materials. We show that the source of anomalous non-hysteretic capacity is a network of pi-bonded metal-d and O-p orbitals, whose activity is enabled by a unique resistance to transition metal migration. The pi-network forms a collective, delocalized redox center. We show that the voltage, accessible capacity, and structural evolution upon oxidation are collective properties of the pi-network rather than that of any local bonding environment. Our results establish the first rigorous framework linking anomalous capacity to transition metal chemistry and long-range structure, laying the groundwork for engineering materials that exhibit truly reversible capacity exceeding that of transition metal redox.", "date": "2020-11-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Theory - Inorganic; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The front can engulf the object, trapping it into the growing crystal, or the front can repel the object, pushing it ahead of itself. Therefore, the object-front confrontation can have a strong influence on the properties of the solidified material. In particular, the spatial distribution of the objects in the resulting microstructure determines the material's structural and functional properties. The past theoretical models and experimental studies have mostly investigated the interaction of isolated, spherical, and hard objects in pure melts. However, the outcome of object-front interactions in complex (more realistic) systems, where multiple objects and solutes are present, is still poorly understood. Here we show the interaction of multiple oil droplets with an ice-water front in the absence and presence of solute effects using in situ cryo-confocal microscopy. We observe the formation of a compact agglomerated layer resulting in a force equilibrium different from the isolated object approach. We elucidate the role of solute during the evolution of a material microstructure in the presence of foreign objects. We report on how the object size, number of objects, and bulk solute concentration influence the front morphology and the subsequent object spatial distribution. Our results depict how the presence of multiple objects with varying solute concentration can modify the object-front interactions and hence, can lead to the formation of complex microstructures, difficult to predict theoretically. We suggest that the volume fraction of objects suspended in a liquid melt in conjunction with the amount of bulk solute concentration are two important criteria to be incorporated in the development of object-front interaction models. Furthermore, our simplified approach of using oil-in-water emulsions can serve as a good analogue for studying the development of material microstructure in presence of foreign objects.  <br />", "date": "2020-11-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Composites; Imaging Agents; Materials Processing; Surfactants; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We show that the material quality of the deposited GaN is not affected by the B-pulse, but that the film growth per ALD cycle increase when a B-pulse is added. We suggest that this can be explained by removal of ethyl ligands from the surface by the B-pulse, enabling a more efficient nitridation by the ammonia plasma. We show that the B-pulsing can be used to enable GaN deposition with a thermal ammonia pulse, albeit of X-ray amorphous films.", "date": "2020-11-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Thin Films; Organometallic Compounds; Ligands (Organomet.); Main Group Chemistry (Organomet.); Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Processes; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A photoelectrochemical device is proposed to transform wastewater nitrates to ammonia and nitrous oxide, coupled with water oxidation.  Numerical models were developed to quantify the dependence of process efficiencies and nitrogen-removal rates on light absorber band gaps, electrocatalytic kinetic parameters, competing oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, and the reacting nitrate species concentrations that affect the mass-transfer limited current densities. With a single light-absorber and state-of-the-art catalysts, optimal solar-to-chemical efficiencies of 7% and 10% and nitrogen-removal rates of 260 and 395 g<sub>N</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> are predicted for nitrate reduction to ammonia and nitrous oxide respectively. The influence of competing reactions on the performance depends on the nitrate concentration and band gap of the light absorber modeled. Oxygen reduction is more dominant than hydrogen evolution to compete with the nitrate reduction reaction, but is mass-transfer limited. Even with kinetic parameters that enhanced the driving forces for the competing reactions, the performance is only minimally affected by these reactions for optimally selected band gaps and nitrate concentrations larger than 100 mM. Theoretically predicted peak nitrogen removal rates and specific energy intensities are competitive with reported estimates for bioelectrochemical and Sharon-Anammox processes for ammonia recovery and nitrogen removal respectively.

The OQS account of local spin that we offer yields a rigorous, yet easily accessible way to rationalize local spin values. A fragment is found in a mixed state direct sum of sectors characterized by different number of electrons that occur with different probabilities. The local spin is then a weighted sum of otherwise standard <i>S</i>(<i>S</i>+1) values. With OQS glasses, it is obvious that atomic or fragment spins should not vanish. Our approach thus casts doubts on any procedure used to annihilate them, like those used by Mayer and coworkers. OQS local spins allow for a fruitful use of models. One can propose easily sector probabilities for localized, covalent, ionic, zwitterionic, etc. situations, and examine their ideal local spins. We have mapped all 2c-2e cases, and shown how to do that in general multielectron cases. The role of electron correlation is also studied by tuning the Hubbard U/t parameter for H chains.

OER catalyst optimization is hindered because in the desirable acidic conditions the sole active catalysts are the expensive RuO2 and IrO2-based materials. Thus, the understanding of the factors controlling the reactivity of IrO2 is mandatory. In this contribution, we carried out spin polarized DFT (PBE-D2) periodic calculations to analyze the catalytic activities of the main ((110), (011), (100) and (001)) IrO2 surfaces. We considered the oxo-coupling (I2M) and water nucleophilic attack (WNA) mechanisms and computed the energy barriers of the chemical processes. Results show that the oxo-coupling and the water attack should be viewed as homolytic couplings and thus, the two processes only occur if the Ir=O species on the surfaces exhibit oxyl character. In these cases, the WNA mechanism is always easy and it becomes the most favorable pathway on the (110), (100) and (001) surfaces. In contrast, for the (011) facet the oxo-coupling is preferred. The required overpotentials for the four IrO2 surfaces depends on the feasibility to oxidize the Ir-OH to Ir-O species. However, if the oxidation is too favorable the resulting Ir=O species has no oxyl character and thus it does not further react. Therefore, the optimal catalyst shows a trade-off between the Ir-OH oxidation feasibility and the oxyl character of the surface Ir=O species. These two factors are tuned by the coordination of the unsaturated iridium sites: the (100) and (001) surfaces are more active than the (110) and (011). The key role of oxyl species has been shown to be important for molecular catalysts. However, the implications of oxyl species on IrO2 have rarely been mentioned. Present results show that the homogeneous and heterogeneous processes seem to have important similarities, thus suggesting that strategies used in one of the two fields could be transferred to the other.", "date": "2020-11-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To address this unmet need, we introduced\na Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC) platform that enables targeted activation\nof drugs at a specific site in the body, i.e., a tumor.

This fraction is related to diverse problems in crude oil exploration, transportation, and refining. Two asphaltene architecture motifs are commonly discussed in literature, \u201cisland\u201d (single core) and \u201carchipelago\u201d (multicore) type structures. The thermal desorption and pyrolysis behavior of island- and archipelago-enriched as-phaltenes and their extrography fractions was investigated. For this purpose, the evolved chemical pattern was investigated by thermal analysis coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Soft atmospheric pressure chemical ionization preserved the molecular information of the thermal emission profile. Time/temperature-resolved analysis allowed the chemical characterization of occluded material as well as of asphaltene building blocks during pyrolysis.</p><p>Regarding the thermogravimetric information, the island-type enriched sample (Wyoming asphal-tenes) revealed a significantly higher coke residue after the pyrolysis process compared to the archi-pelago-type enriched sample (Athabasca asphaltenes). In contrast to whole asphaltenes, extrograph-ic fractions revealed occluded material evolved during the desorption phase. For the acetone frac-tion, this effect was most abundant and suggests cooperative aggregation.</p><p>Pyrolysis revealed a bimodal behavior for most of the compound classes suggesting the presence of both architecture motifs in each asphaltene.

Chemically defined delivery vehicles such as cationic polymers are versatile alternatives to engineered viruses, but their clinical translation hinges on rapidly exploring vast chemical design spaces and deriving structure-function relationships governing delivery performance. Here, we discovered a polymer for efficient ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery through combinatorial polymer design and parallelized experimental workflows. A chemically diverse library of 43 statistical copolymers was synthesized via combinatorial RAFT polymerization, realizing systematic variations in physicochemical properties. We selected cationic monomers that varied in their pK<sub>a</sub> values (8.1 to 9.2) as well as in the steric bulk and lipophilicity of their alkyl substituents. We also incorporated co-monomers of varying hydrophilicity and elucidated the roles of protonation equilibria and hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance. We screened our multiparametric vector library through image cytometry and rapidly uncovered a hit polymer (P38), which outperforms state-of-the-art commercial transfection reagents, achieving nearly 60\\% editing efficiency via non-homologous end-joining. Structure-function correlations underlying editing efficiency, cellular toxicity, and RNP uptake were probed through unbiased statistical learning approaches to uncover the physicochemical basis of P38's performance. Although cellular toxicity and RNP uptake were solely determined by polyplex size distribution and protonation degree respectively, these two polyplex design parameters were found to be inconsequential during RNP delivery. Instead, polymer hydrophobicity and the Hill coefficient, a parameter describing cooperativity-enhanced polymer deprotonation, were identified as the critical determinants of RNP delivery. Our unconventional approach not only discovered a novel polymeric vehicle that may have remained inaccessible to chemical intuition, but also yielded statistically derived design rules to guide the synthesis of future polymer libraries.", "date": "2020-11-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biocompatible Materials; Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The potential energy surfaces of these torsions vary significantly due to steric and electronic effects, ultimately affecting the relative stability of the molecular conformations in the protein-bound and solution states. Simulations of protein--ligand binding require accurate computational models to represent the intramolecular interactions to provide accurate predictions of the structure and dynamics of binding. In this paper, we compare four force fields (Generalized AMBER Force Field (GAFF), Open Force Field (OpenFF), CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF), Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS)) and two neural network potentials (ANI-2x, ANI-1ccx) in their ability to predict the torsional potential energy surfaces of 88 biaryls extracted from drug fragments. The mean of the absolute deviation over the full PES (MADF) and the mean absolute deviation of the torsion rotational barrier height (MADB) relative to high-level ab initio reference data was used as a measure of accuracy. In comparison to high-level ab-initio data, ANI-1ccx was most accurate for predicting the barrier height (MADF: 0.5~kcal/mol, MADB:~0.8~kcal/mol), followed closely by ANI-2x (MADF: 0.5~kcal/mol, MADB:~1.0~kcal/mol), then CGenFF (MADF: 0.8~kcal/mol, MADB: 1.3~kcal/mol), OpenFF (MADF: 1.5~kcal/mol, MADB: 1.4~kcal/mol), GAFF (MADF: 1.2~kcal/mol, MADB: 2.6~kcal/mol), and finally OPLS (MADF: 1.5~kcal/mol, MADB: 2.8~kcal/mol). Significantly, the NNPs are systematically more accurate and more reliable than any of the force fields. As a practical example, the neural network potential/molecular mechanics (NNP/MM) method was used to simulate the isomerization of ozanimod, a drug used for multiple sclerosis. Multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit aqueous solvent were performed, as well as umbrella sampling and adaptive biasing force enhanced sampling techniques.

For evaluation and optimization, PAH standard mixtures introduced by gas chromatography were used. Atmospheric pressure laser ionization (APLI) approaches with laser wavelengths above 200 nm induce a multiphoton process, and ionization yields are strongly dependent on the heteroatom-content and isomeric structure. The presented technique using VUV photons allowed for the selective ionization of semi- to non-polar compounds in a single photon ionization process. Consequently, molecular radical cations were found as base peak, whereas protonated species were almost absent. Even though the ionization chamber is flushed by a high flow of pure nitrogen, remaining oxygen and water traces caused several side-reactions, leading to unwanted oxidized ionization artifacts. Installation of a water and oxygen filter cartridge significantly reduced the abundance of those artifacts, whereas the laser beam position was found to have a substantially lower effect. For evaluating complex mixture analysis, APSPLI was applied to characterize a light crude oil subjected to the ionization source by thermogravimetry and gas chromatography hyphenation. In addition to aromatic hydrocarbons, APSPLI also allowed for the sensitive ionization of sulfur-containing aromatic constituents, and even species with two sulfur-atoms could be detected. A comparison of APSPLI to APLI conducted at 266 nm revealed the additional compositional space accessible by the single photon process. This novel ionization concept is envisioned to have a high analytical potential further explored in the future.<br />", "date": "2020-11-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A good quality homo-pentameric structure of SARS-Cov2-E was modelled from its homologue with more than 90% sequence identity followed by symmetric docking. The pentameric structure was embedded in a DPPC membrane and subsequently energy minimized. The minimized structure was used for blind molecular docking of CDC and UDC to obtain the best scoring SARS-Cov2-E\u2013CDC/UDC complexes, which were subjected to 230ns molecular dynamics simulations in triplicates in DPPC membrane environment. Comparative analyses of structural and enthalpic properties and molecular interaction profiles from the MD trajectories revealed that, both CDC and UDC could stably bind to SARS-Cov2-E through H-bonds, water-bridges and hydrophobic contacts in the transmembraneresidues.T30 was observed to be a key residue for CDC/UDC binding. The polar functional groups of the bound CDC/UDC facilitated entry of a large number of water molecules into the channel and affected the H-bonding pattern between adjacent monomeric chains, loosening the compact transmembrane region of SARS-Cov2-E.

To map\nchemical space, we calculated the MA of <i>ca.</i> 2.5 million compounds, and\ncollected data which showed the complexity of a molecule can be experimentally determined\nby using three independent techniques including infra-red spectroscopy, nuclear\nmagnetic resonance, and by fragmentation in a mass spectrometer, and this data\nhas an excellent corelation with the values predicted from our assembly theory.\nWe then set out to see if this approach could allow us to identify molecular\nbiosignatures with a set of diverse samples from around the world, outer space,\nand the laboratory including prebiotic soups. <a>The\nresults show that </a><a>there\nis a non-living to living threshold in MA complexity and the higher the MA for\na given molecule, the more likely that it had to be produced by a biological\nprocess</a>. This work demonstrates it is possible to use this approach\nto build a life detection instrument that could be deployed on missions to\nextra-terrestrial locations to detect biosignatures, map the extent of life on\nEarth, and be used as a molecular complexity scale to quantify the constraints\nneeded to direct prebiotically plausible processes in the laboratory. Such an\napproach is vital if we are going to find new life elsewhere in the universe or\ncreate <i>de-novo</i> life in the lab. </b></p>", "date": "2020-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Combinatorial Chemistry; Natural Products; Space Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Analytical Apparatus; Chemoinformatics; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It provides an engaging environmental context for students to develop knowledge of reaction kinetics and photochemistry, as well as skill using analytical instrumentation. This versatile experiment consists of two basic modules, three optional advanced modules, and additional add-ons that may be performed in various combinations to meet the unique learning objectives of general, analytical, physical, and environmental chemistry courses and science outreach activities. It may be performed as a traditional lab experiment or as an entirely remote exercise with an increased focus on data analysis and interpretation using provided example data sets. All photolysis experiments are carried out by preparing solutions of ranitidine or cimetidine in various matrices, irradiating the samples, and periodically removing subsamples for HPLC analysis of the compound of interest. Pseudo-first-order kinetic plots are then generated to determine rate constants that are used to draw conclusions about photolysis pathways or to calculate additional kinetic parameters. In the two basic modules, cimetidine is found to degrade appreciably only when irradiated in the presence natural organic matter (NOM), indicating an indirect, photosensitized degradation pathway. In contrast, ranitidine degrades in pure buffer and in the presence of NOM with comparable rate constants, highlighting the predominant role of direct photolysis. In the advanced modules, students calculate ranitidine direct photolysis quantum yields and examine the significance of singlet oxygen as a photochemically produced reactive intermediate. The two basic modules may be completed in two three- to five-hour lab periods while the advanced modules require additional time. This experiment requires only a HPLC, inexpensive chemicals, and common glassware and lab equipment if performed in person, and a personal computer if performed remotely.</p>", "date": "2020-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education - General; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

There have been many successes in the design of porphyrin-binding proteins, however crystallographic characterization has been elusive, limiting what can be learned from such studies as well as the extension to new functions. Moreover, formation of highly oxidizing high-valent intermediates poses design challenges that have not been previously implemented: 1) purposeful design of substrate/oxidant access to the binding site and 2) limiting deleterious oxidation of the protein scaffold. Here we report the first crystallographically characterized porphyrin-binding protein that was programmed to not only bind a synthetic Mn-porphyrin but also maintain binding site access to form high-valent oxidation states. We explicitly designed a binding site with accessibility to dioxygen units in the open coordination site of the Mn center. In solution, the protein is capable of accessing a high-valent Mn(V)-oxo species which can transfer an O-atom to a thioether substrate.

In this study, we employ quantum chemical simulations to investigate the structure of Pd species in cation-exchange sites at isolated Al and Al pairs in the 6-ring and 8-ring of the CHA framework, before the introduction of NO<sub>x</sub>. Our calculations show that the speciation of Pd in these exchange sites strongly depends on the precise Al arrangement within the framework, as well as the operating conditions.

Here we describe another pathway for growth and division that depends simply on differences in composition of fatty acid membranes. Growth is driven by the entropically-favored mixing of lipids between two populations. Division is the result of growth-induced curvature. Importantly, growth and division are cyclic and bidirectional, meaning that vesicles made from one type of lipid, e.g. short-chain fatty acids, grow and divide when fed with vesicles consisting of another type of lipid, e.g. long-chain fatty acids, and vice versa. After equilibration, additional rounds of growth and division are possible through the addition of compositionally distinct vesicles. Since prebiotic synthesis likely gave rise to mixtures of lipids, the data are consistent with the presence of growing and dividing protocells on the prebiotic Earth.</p></div>", "date": "2020-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Chemical Biology; Biophysical Chemistry; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We evaluate the robustness of these models and improve them using data from three existing oil sands projects (mining + upgrading, mining + dilution, and steam assisted gravity drainage, SAGD, + dilution). The models are then applied to estimate the GHG emissions reduction potential for two emerging in situ oil sands technologies. We find that, when boundaries are aligned, OPGEE can generate upstream GHG emissions estimates for the projects modeled within 1-4% of company reported GHG emissions data. Extending the boundary to include indirect (life cycle) emissions can lead to a doubling in upstream GHG emissions intensity. The two emerging technologies evaluated in the study can reduce upstream emissions by 14-19% compared to a SAGD project operating at the same reservoir, or 1.4-1.9% on a well-to-wheel basis.

Using this approach, we can perform long time AIMD simulations and structure refinement MD simulation for metalloproteins. In 1 ns AIMD simulation of four common coordination mode of zinc-containing metalloproteins, the statistical average structure is in good agreement with statistic value of PDB Bank database. The neural network approach used in this study can be applied to construct potentials to metalloproteinase catalysis, ligand binding and other important biochemical processes and its salient features can shed light on the development of more accurate molecular potentials for metal ions in other biomacromolecule system.  </p>", "date": "2020-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Biophysical Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

By analyzing the EIS data of TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> photocathodes, we were able to obtain information about the constituent semiconductors and interfaces such as recombination processes, carrier lifetimes, doping densities, and flat band potentials under <i>operando</i> conditions.

However, their applications\nare limited by a low catalytic activity due to inefficient charge separation and insufficient visiblelight absorption. Here we show a new method to generate the electron polarization of CNx toward\nthe edge via the chemical conjugation of catechol to CNx for enhanced photochemical activity.\nThe electron-attracting property of catechol/quinone pairs induces the accumulation of photoexcited electrons at the edge of conjugated catechol-CNx hybrid nanostructure (Cat-CNx), ,\nserving as an electron hot spot, as demonstrated by positive open-circuit photovoltage, which\nincreases electron transfer through the conjugated catechol while suppressing charge\nrecombination in the CNx.

Accordingly, Cat-CNx reveals a 6.3\uf0b4 higher reductive\nphotocurrent density than CNx. Gold ion reduction dramatically increased due to the enhanced\nelectron transfer activity of Cat-CNx in cooperation with the inherent hydrophilicity and metal\nchelating property of catechols.

Resonance is commonly discussed within the electronic structure framework of valence bond theory as the stabilizing effect of mixing different Lewis structures. Yet, most computational chemists work with delocalized molecular orbitals, which are also usually employed to explain the concept of aromaticity, a special kind of ring delocalization that shows up in cyclic planar systems which abide certain number rules. As an intuitive picture for aromaticity, an electronic ring current has been hypothesized. However, all three concepts lack a real space definition, that is not reliant on orbitals or specific wave function expansions. Here, we outline a redefinition from first principles: the concepts are of kinetic nature and related to saddle points of the all-electron probability density |\u03a8|\u00b2. Delocalization means that likely electron arrangements are connected via paths of high probability density in the many-electron real space. In this picture, resonance is the consideration of additional electron arrangements, which offer alternative paths of higher probability. Most notably, the concept of aromatic ring currents in absence of a magnetic field is rejected and the famous 4n+2 H\u00fcckel rule is derived from nothing but the antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions.

However, assessment of methods for predicting binding affinities is often hampered by computational challenges such as conformational sampling, protonation state uncertainties, variation in test sets selected, and even lack of high quality experimental data. SAMPL blind challenges have thus frequently included a component focusing on host-guest binding, which removes some of these challenges while still focusing on molecular recognition. Here, we report on the results of the SAMPL7 blind prediction challenge for host-guest affinity prediction. In this study, we focused on three different host-guest categories -- a familiar deep cavity cavitand series which has been featured in several prior challenges (where we examine binding of a series of guests to two hosts), a new series of cyclodextrin derivatives which are monofunctionalized around the rim to add amino acid-like functionality (where we examine binding of two guests to a series of hosts), and binding of a series of guests to a new acyclic TrimerTrip host which is related to previous cucurbituril hosts. Many predictions used methods based on molecular simulations, and overall success was mixed, though several methods stood out. As in SAMPL6, we find that one strategy for achieving reasonable accuracy here was to make empirical corrections to binding predictions based on previous data for host categories which have been studied well before, though this can be of limited value when new systems are included. Additionally, we found that alchemical free energy methods using the AMOEBA polarizable force field had considerable success for the two host categories in which they participated. The new TrimerTrip system was also found to introduce some sampling problems, because multiple conformations may be relevant to binding and interconvert only slowly. Overall, results in this challenge tentatively suggest that further investigation of polarizable force fields for these challenges may be warranted.", "date": "2020-11-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This comparative study indicates that the formation mechanism of silver clusters occurs through both monomer and ion addition growth pathways. Also, we calculated free energy of formation of small cationic and neutral clusters using density functional theory (DFT) which shows the thermodynamic stability of cationic clusters. In a conventional experimental system with the common reducing agents, the formation of cationic clusters is kinetically favored owing to the dominance of charged ions relative to neutral atoms in the system. While we show the stability of small cationic clusters relative to neutral clusters, collectively, we deduce that the monomer addition along with ion addition growth pathway is involved in silver cluster formation mechanism.

However, the production and use of such fertilizers are environmentally unfriendly and unsustainable; synthetic fertilizers are produced via non-renewable resources and fertilizer runoff causes groundwater contamination and eutrophication. A promising alternative to synthetic fertilizer is bacterial inoculation. In this process, a symbiotic relationship is formed between a crop and bacteria species that can fix nitrogen, solubilize phosphorus, and stimulate plant hormone production. The bacteria carrier developed here aims to maintain bacteria viability while in storage, protect bacteria while encapsulated, and provide a sustained and controllable bacterial release. This novel bacterial delivery method utilizes inorganic nanomaterials, silica microbeads, to encapsulate symbiotic bacteria. These microbeads, which were produced with aqueous, non-toxic precursors, are sprayed directly onto crop seeds and solidify on the seeds as a resilient silica matrix. The bacterial release from the carrier was found by submerging coated seeds in solution to simulate degradation in soil environments, measuring the number of bacteria released by the plate count technique, and comparing the carrier to seeds coated only in bacteria. The carrier\u2019s effectiveness to enhance plant growth was determined through greenhouse plant assays with alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) plants and the nitrogen-fixing <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> Rm1021 strain. When compared to bacteria-only inoculation, the silica microbead carrier exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) increased holding capacity of viable bacteria and increased plant growth by a similar amount, demonstrating the capability of inorganic nanomaterials for microbial delivery.

Further cyclic voltammetry and laser flash photolysis experiments unveiled the chameleonic behavior of TBADT that features a three-fold role: HAT photocatalyst to activate alkanes, photoredox catalyst to activate the 2-alkylbenzothiazoline and electrocatalyst to promote the oxidation of short-lived radical intermediates. The adopted potentiostatic mode allowed to tame the multi-faceted reactivity of TBADT and to ensure its recovery after each catalytic cycle with a very high faradaic efficiency.

Currently, there are no approved vaccines, and recently Veklury (remdesivir) was approved for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) of the virus is an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics because it is required for proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins. Furthermore, the M<sup>pro</sup> has no human homologues, so drugs designed to bind to this target directly have less risk for off-target reactivity. Recently, several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with inhibitors have been determined \u2014 to guide drug development and to spur efforts in structure-based drug design. One of the primary objectives of modern structure-based drug design is the accurate prediction of receptor\u00ad-ligand binding affinities for rational drug design and discovery. Here, we perform rigorous alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations and QM/MM calculations to give insight into the total binding energy of two recently crystallized inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, namely, N3 and \u03b1-ketoamide 13b.

The N3 inhibitor has more favourable non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, in the binding site of the M<sup>pro</sup> than the \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor. But the Gibbs energy of reaction for the M<sup>pro</sup>\u2013\u03b1-ketoamide covalent adduct is greater than the Gibbs reaction energy for the M<sup>pro</sup>\u2013N3 covalent adduct. These differences in the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions for both inhibitors could be a plausible explanation for their in vitro differences in antiviral activity. Our findings highlight the importance of both covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions to the absolute binding affinity of a covalent inhibitor towards its target.", "date": "2020-11-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Similar electrochemical water oxidation performance is observed for each of the FeOOH, Ni(Fe)OOH and FeOOHNiOOH electrocatalysts studied, which is found to result from a balance between degree of charge accumulation and rate of water oxidation. Once added onto BiVO4 photoanodes, a large enhancement in the water oxidation photoelectrochemical performance is observed in comparison to the un-modified BiVO<sub>4</sub>. To understand the origin of this enhancement, the films were evaluated through time-resolved optical spectroscopic techniques, allowing comparisons between electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. For all three catalysts, fast hole transfer from BiVO<sub>4</sub> to the catalyst is observed in the transient absorption data. Using operando photoinduced absorption measurements, we find that water oxidation is driven by oxidised states within the catalyst layer, following hole transfer from BiVO<sub>4</sub>. This charge transfer is correlated with a suppression of recombination losses which result in remarkably enhanced water oxidation performance relative to un-modified BiVO<sub>4</sub>. Moreover, despite similar electrocatalytic performance of all three electrocatalysts, we show that variations in water oxidation performance observed among the BiVO<sub>4</sub>/MOOH photoanodes stem from differences in photoelectrochemical and electrochemical charge accumulation in the catalyst layers. Under illumination, the amount of accumulated charge in the catalyst is driven by the injection of photogenerated holes from BiVO<sub>4</sub>, which is further affected by the recombination loss at the BiVO<sub>4</sub>/MOOH interface, and thus leads to deviations from their behaviour as standalone electrocatalysts.", "date": "2020-11-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Protein structures can be determined by experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or cryogenic electron microscopy. As an alternative, in silico methods can be used to predict protein structures. Those methods utilize protein structure databases for structure prediction via template-based modeling or for training machine-learning models to generate predictions. Structure prediction for proteins distant from proteins with known structures often results in lower accuracy with respect to the true physiological structures. Physics-based protein model refinement methods can be applied to improve model accuracy in the predicted models. Refinement methods rely on conformational sampling around the predicted structures, and if structures closer to the native states are sampled, improvements in the model quality become possible. Molecular dynamics simulations have been especially successful for improving model qualities but although consistent refinement can be achieved, the improvements in model qualities are still moderate. To extend the refinement performance of a simulation-based protocol, we explored new schemes that focus on an optimized use of biasing functions and the application of increased simulation temperatures. In addition, we tested the use of alternative initial models so that the simulations can explore conformational space more broadly.

Here, we developed a strategy for selective inhibition of SIRT3 in cells, over its structurally similar isozymes that localize primarily to nucleus (SIRT1) and cytoplasm (SIRT2). This was achieved by directing the inhibitors straight to the mitochondria through incorporation of sequences inspired by previously described mitochondria-targeting peptides. Our inhibitors exhibited excellent mitochondrial localization in HeLa cells as indicated by fluorophore-conjugated versions and target engagement was demonstrated by a thermal shift assay of SIRT3 using western blotting. The acetylation state of documented SIRT3 target MnSOD was shown to be perturbed in cells with little effect on known targets of SIRT1 and SIRT2, showing that our lead compound exhibits selectivity for SIRT3 in cells.

Machine learning offers a solution through iterative suggestions of new experiments based on past experimental data, but knowing which machine learning strategy to apply in a particular case is still difficult. Here, we develop chemically-motivated virtual benchmarks for reaction optimisation and compare several strategies on these benchmarks. The benchmarks and strategies are encompassed in an open source framework named Summit. The results of our tests show that Bayesian optimisation strategies perform very well across the types of problems faced in chemical reaction optimisation, while many strategies commonly used in reaction optimisation fail</p>\n<p>to find optimal solutions.</p>", "date": "2020-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Process Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Recently, photochemical transformations involving the excitation of open-shell species has become a reality. Photostimulated electron transfer (PET) from radical anions of organic dyes have been used in consecutive photoredox catalysis and electro-photocatalysis transformation, allowing the transformation of aryl halides in valuable compounds under mild conditions. The similarities of both techniques raises the question of the convenience of using one or other related and a close evaluation is necessary to drive further development and have been shyly done in previous works. However, an objective comparison of both approaches will require using the same chemical system. We present here a direct comparison of a \u201cpure\u201d photochemical and an electrophotochemical transformartion studying a model transformation, namely, a C-H substitution in (hetero)aromatic systems with a C-C bond formation through reaction of halogenated substrates. Through a detailed investigation of both mechanisms, we identify a system that could be applied in both approaches with minor (necessaries) changes in the reaction conditions and clearly identify the excitation of radical anion of naphthalene diimides as the key intermediates. Both approaches are comparable in yields and kinetics with slightly better yields for the consecutive PET reaction and better selectivity for the electro-PET process. Our work offers a system that could be used for a more profound comparison of the experimental setups which could include, for instance, the important factor of energy consumption.<br /></p>", "date": "2020-11-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Photochemistry (Org.); Physical Organic Chemistry; Electrocatalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the molecular recognition mechanism - critical information for drug and antibody design - has not been fully clarified at the amino acid residue level. Elucidating such a microscopic mechanism in detail requires a more accurate molecular interpretation that includes quantum mechanics to quantitatively evaluate hydrogen bonds, XH/\u03c0 interactions (X = N, O, and C), and salt bridges. In this study, we applied the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding interactions with not only ACE2 but also the B38 Fab antibody involved in ACE2-inhibitory binding. By analyzing FMO-based interaction energies along a wide range of binding inter-faces carefully, we identified amino acid residues critical for molecular recognition between S-protein and ACE2 or B38 Fab antibody. Importantly, hydrophobic residues that attribute to weak interactions such as CH-O and XH/\u03c0 interactions, as well as polar residues that construct conspicuous hydrogen bonds, play important roles in molecular recognition and binding ability. Moreover, through these FMO-based analyses, we also clarified novel hot spots and epitopes that had been overlooked in previous studies by structural and molecular mechanical approaches. Altogether, these hot spots/epitopes identified between S-protein and ACE2/B38 Fab antibody may provide useful information for future anti-body design and small or medium drug design against the SARS-CoV-2. </div><div><br /></div>", "date": "2020-11-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the case of 2, photoswitching is reversible through cycles of 365 nm and 520 nm excitation with little fatigue.

However, their toxicity is not well understood. In this study, oil was irradiated, chemically characterized, and tested for toxicity in three copepod species (A. tonsa, T. longicornis, C.finmarchicus). Irradiation led to a depletion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and n-alkanes in oil residues, along with an enrichment in aromatic and aliphatic oil photoproducts. Target lipid model-based calculations of PAH toxic units (TU-PAH) predicted that PAH toxicities were lower in water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of irradiated oil residues (\u201cirradiated WAFs\u201d) than in WAFs of dark-control samples (\u201cdark WAFs\u201d). In contrast, biomimetic extraction (BE) measurements showed increased bioaccumulation potential of irradiated WAFs compared to dark WAFs, mainly driven by photoproducts present in irradiated oil. In line with the BE results, copepod mortality increased in response to irradiated WAFs compared to dark WAFs. Low copepod toxicities were observed for WAFs produced with photooxidized oil slicks collected during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The results of this study suggest that while oil photoproducts have the potential to be a significant source of copepod toxicity, the water solubility of these products might mitigate their toxicity at sea.", "date": "2022-01-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Iridium oxide is the only material, which is active and stable. However, Ir is extremely rare and far from scalable. There exist both active materials and stable materials, but those that are active are not stable and vice versa. In this work, we present a strategy for making stable materials active. The stable materials are semiconductors that cannot change oxidation state at relevant reaction conditions. Based on DFT calculations, we find that by adding an n-type dopant, semiconductor surfaces can bind oxygen. However, after oxygen is adsorbed, the material is again in a state where it cannot bind or desorb oxygen. By combining n-type and p-type dopants, the reactivity can be tuned so that oxygen can be adsorbed and desorbed under reaction conditions. It turns out that the tuning can be understood from the electrostatic interactions between the dopants as well as between the dopants and the binding site. We experimentally verify that this strategy works in TiO2 by co-doping with different pairs of n- and p-type dopants. This encourages that the co-doping approach can be used to activate stable materials, without intrinsic oxygen evolution activity, to discover new catalysts for acid water electrolysis.", "date": "2022-01-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As the electrostatics derived from ab initio calculations often fail to reproduce the experimental behaviors of these functionalized solvents, a common treatment is scaling the atomic charges to improve the accord between experimental and computational results for some selected properties, e.g., the density of the liquids. Although there are many computational benchmarks on structural properties of bulk ionic liquids, the choice of the best scaling parameter remains an open question. As these liquids are designed to solvate solutes, whether the solvation thermodynamics could be correctly described is of utmost importance in practical situations. Therefore, in the current work, we provide a thermodynamic perspective of this charge scaling issue directly from solute-solvent interactions. We present a comprehensive large-scale calculation of solvation free energies via nonequilibrium fast-switching simulations for a spectrum of molecules in ionic liquids, the atomic charges of which derived from ab initio calculations are scaled to find the best scaling factor that maximizes the prediction-experiment correlation. The density-derived choice of the scaling parameter as the estimate from bulk properties is compared with the solvation-free-energy-derived one. We observed that when the scaling factor is decreased from 1.0 to 0.5, the mass density exhibits a monotonically decreasing behavior, which is caused by weaker inter-molecular interactions produced by the scaled atomic charges. However, the solvation free energies of external agents do not show consistent monotonic behaviors like the bulk property, the underlying physics of which are elucidated to be the competing electrostatic and vdW responses to the scaling-parameter variation. More intriguingly, although the recommended value for charge scaling from bulk properties falls in the neighborhood of 0.6~0.7, solvation free energies calculated at this value are not in good agreement with the experimental reference. By modestly increasing the scaling parameter (e.g., by 0.1) to avoid over-scaling of atomic charges, the solute-solvent interaction free energy approaches the reference value and the quality of calculated solvation thermodynamics approaches the hydration case. According to this phenomenon, we propose a feasible way to obtain the best scaling parameter that produces balanced solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions, i.e., first scanning the density-scaling-factor profile and then adding ~0.1 to that solution. We further calculate the partition coefficient or transfer free energy of solutes from water to ionic liquids to provide another thermodynamic perspective of the charge scaling benchmark. Another central result of the current work is about the widely used force fields to describe bonded and vdW terms for ionic liquids derivatives. These pre-fitted transferable parameters are evaluated and refitted in a system-specific manner to provide a detailed assessment of the reliability and accuracy of these commonly used parameters. Component-specific refitting procedures unveil that the bond-stretching term is the most problematic part of the GAFF derivatives and the angle-bending term in some cases is also not accurate enough. Astonishingly, the torsional potential defined in these pre-fitted force fields performs extremely well.

Traditional classical MD models lack reactivity to explore several important phenomena; while quantum mechanical (QM) models can be used for this purpose, they come with steep computational costs. The reactive force field (ReaxFF) model bridges the gap between these approaches by incorporating dynamic bonding and polarizability. To achieve realistic simulations using ReaxFF, model parameters must be optimized against high fidelity training data, typically with QM accuracy. Existing parameter optimization methods for ReaxFF consist of black-box techniques using genetic algorithms or Monte-Carlo methods. Due to the stochastic behavior of these methods, the optimization process can require millions of error evaluations for complex parameter fitting tasks, significantly hampering the rapid development of high quality parameter sets.  In this work, we present JAX ReaxFF, a novel software tool that leverages modern machine learning infrastructure to enable extremely fast optimization of ReaxFF parameters.

Critical to CPE design is the coupling between macromolecular conformations, ionic interactions, and electronic transport, the combination of which spans electronic to mesoscopic length scales, rendering coherent theoretical analysis challenging. Here, we utilize a recently developed anisotropic CG model in combination with a phenomenological tight-binding Hamiltonian to explore the interplay of single-chain conformational and electronic structure in CPEs.  Accessible single chain conformations are explored as a function of solvent conditions and chain stiffness, reproducing a rich landscape of rod-like, racquet, pearl necklace, and helical conformations observed in previous works. The electronic structure of each conformational archtype is further analyzed, incorporating through-bond coupling, through-space coupling, and electrostatic contributions to the Hamiltonian.  Electrostatics is observed to influence electronic structure primarily by modifying the accessible conformational space, and only minimally by direct modulation of on-site energies.  Electron transport in CPEs is most efficient in helical and racquet conformations, which is attributed to the flattening of dihedrals and through-space coupling within collapsed conformations.  Relatedly, kink formation within racquets does not significantly deteriorate electronic conjugation within CPEs - an insight critical to understanding transport within locally ordered aggregates.  These conclusions provide unprecedented computational insight into structure function relationships defining emerging classes of CPEs.", "date": "2022-01-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Conducting polymers; Polyelectrolytes - Polymers; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The stabilization energies of the carboxylic acid dimers are very weakly dependent on the nature of the substitution. However, the electric field experienced by the OH group of a particular carboxylic acid is dependent more on the nature of the substitution on the dimer partner. In general, the electric field was higher when the partner was substituted with electron-donating group and lower with electron-withdrawing substituent on the partner. The Stark tuning rate (\u2206\u03bc) of the O\u2013H stretching vibrations calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level was found to be weakly dependent on the nature of substitution on the carboxylic acid. The average Stark tuning rate of O\u2013H stretching vibrations of a particular carboxylic acid when paired with other acids was 5.7 cm\u20131 (MV cm\u20131)\u20131, while the corresponding average Stark tuning rate of the partner acids due to a particular carboxylic acid was 21.9 cm\u20131 (MV cm\u20131)\u20131. The difference in the Stark tuning rate is attributed to the primary and secondary effects of substitution on the carboxylic acid. The average Stark tuning rate for the anharmonic O\u2013D frequency shifts is about 40-50% higher than the corresponding harmonic O\u2013D frequency shifts calculated at B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level, much greater than the typical scaling factors used, indicating the strong anharmonicity of O\u2013H/O\u2013D oscillators in carboxylic acid dimers.

Ab-initio MD simulations reveal that for a spontaneous proton transfer process, the phenol molecule must be embedded in a cluster consisting of at least eight ammonia molecules, even though several local minima with proton transferred can be observed for clusters consisting of 5-7 ammonia molecules. Further, phenol solvated in large clusters of ammonia, the proton transfer is spontaneous with the proton transfer event being instantaneous (about 20-120 fs).

CubicGAN is a generative adversarial network where high-throughput analyses were done to uncover mechanically and dynamically stable materials with the assistance of DFT. In our work, we screened the semiconductors using a binary classifier from materials found from the CubicGAN. Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability based on energy-above-hull and formation energy.

Such ICP focusing has been shown to accomplish up to a million-fold enrichment of nucleic acids and proteins in single-stage preconcentrators. However, the rate at which the sample volume is swept is limited, requiring several hours to achieve these high enrichment factors. This limitation is caused by two factors. First, an ion depleted zone (IDZ) formed at a planar membrane or electrode may not extend across the full channel cross section under the flow rate employed for focusing, thereby allowing the analyte \u201cleak\u201d past the IDZ. Second, within the IDZ, large fluid vortices lead to mixing, which decreases the efficiency of analyte enrichment and worsens with increased channel dimensions. Here, we address these challenges with faradaic ICP (fICP) at a three-dimensional (3D) electrode comprising metallic microbeads. This 3D-electrode distributes the IDZ, and therefore, the electric field gradient utilized for counter-flow focusing across the full height of the fluidic channel, and its large area, microstructured surface supports smaller vortices. An additional bed of insulating microbeads restricts flow patterns and supplies a large area for surface conduction of ions through the IDZ. Finally, the resistance of this secondary bed enhances focusing by locally strengthening sequestering forces.

The evolved ketone synthase benefits from more than a dozen crucial mutations, most of them distal to the active site. Computational analysis reveals that all these mutations collaborate to facilitate the formation of a highly reactive carbocation intermediate by generating a confined, rigid and preorganized active site through an enhanced dynamical network. The evolved ketone synthase fully exploits a catalytic cycle that has largely eluded small molecule catalysis and consequently enables various challenging functionalization reactions of internal alkenes.

This phenomenon can lead to unphysical results, such as forming products without the ZPE in the internal vibrational degrees of freedom (DOFs). The ZPE leakage also permits reactions below the quantum threshold for the reaction. We have developed a new Hessian-free method, inspired by the Lowe-Andersen thermostat model, to prevent energy dipping below a threshold in the local-pair (LP) vibrational DOFs. The idea is to pump the leaked energy to the corresponding local vibrational mode, taken from the other vibrational DOFs. We have applied the new correction protocol on the ab initio ground-state molecular dynamics simulation of the water dimer (H20)2, which dissociates due to unphysical ZPE spilling from the high-frequency OH modes.

The large bond dissociation energy of the diamond lattice-oxygen bond is a challenge that prevents new bonds from forming and most researchers simply use oxygen-terminated ND (alcohols and acids) as a reactive species. In this work, we transformed a tertiary alcohol-rich ND surface to an amine surface with \uf07e50% surface coverage and was limited by the initial rate of bromination. We observed that alkyl-bromide moieties are highly labile on NDs and are metastable as previously found using density functional theory. The instability of the bromine terminated ND is explained by steric hindrance and poor surface energy stabilization. The strong leaving group properties of the alkyl-bromide intermediate were found to form diamond-nitrogen bonds at room temperature and without catalysts. The chemical lability of the brominated ND surface led to efficient amination with NH3\u2022THF at 298 K, and a catalyst-free Sonogashira-type reaction with an alkyne-amine produced an 11-fold increase in amination rate. Overlapping spectroscopies under inert, temperature-dependent and open-air conditions provided unambiguous chemical assignments. Amine-terminated NDs and folic acid were conjugated using sulfo-NHS/EDC coupling reagents to form amide bonds, confirming that standard amine chemistry remains viable. This work supports that a robust pathway exists to activate a chemically inert diamond surface at room temperature, which broadens the pathways of bond formation when a reactive alkyl-bromide surface is prepared.

The electronic, magnetic and optical characteristics are found to be critically dependent of the charge (electron density) at the narrow-gap sulfide layers containing Cu+ and Fe3+ cations, and can be tuned via the composition of hydroxide part.

We used as training data the thermal properties of 120 zeolites, calculated at the DFT level, in the quasi-harmonic approximation. We compared the statistical accuracy of trained models (based on the gradient boosting regression technique) using different types of descriptors, including ad hoc geometrical features, topology, pore space, and general geometric descriptors.

A hydrophilic rhodium-based cuboctahedral MOP (OHRhMOP) with 24 hydroxyl groups on its outer periphery can be controllably deprotonated to impart the MOP with tunable electrostatic repulsion in solution.

The virus contains a spike protein which has been shown to bind to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of human cells. Vaccines have been developed that recognize elements of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and they have been successful in preventing infection. Recently, the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was reported and quickly became a variant of concern due to its transmissibility. This variant contained an unusually large number (32) of point mutations, of which 15 of those mutations are in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. In order to assess the differential binding ability of the wild type and omicron variant of the RBD spike protein to human ACE2 receptors, we conducted 2 \u03bcs of molecular dynamics simulation to estimate the binding affinities and behaviors. Based upon MM-GBSA binding affinity, center of mass distance measurements, ensemble clustering, pairwise residue decomposition and hydrogen bonding analysis, we can conclude that the 15 point mutations in the receptor binding domain do not increase the affinity of the spike protein for the human ACE2 receptor. The MM-GBSA binding estimations over a 2 \u03bcs trajectory, suggest that the wild type binds to ACE2 with a value of -29.69 kcal/mol while the omicron mutant binds with an energy value of -26.67 kcal/mol. These values are within the error estimates of the MM-GBSA method.

This task is usually complicated by false positives caused by overlapping the target peaks with that of interferents, commonly associated with samples of interest. Shift reagents (SR) are species that selectively change ion mobilities through adduction with analyte ions when they are introduced in IMS instruments. This characteristic can be used to discriminate false positives because the interferents and illegal substances respond differently to SR depending on the structure and size of analytes and their interaction energy with SR. This study demonstrates that ion mobility shifts upon introduction of SR depend, not only on the ion masses, but on the interaction energies of the ion:SR adducts. In this study, we introduced five different SRs using ESI-IMS-MS to study the effect of the interaction energy and size on mobility shifts. The mobility shifts showed a decreasing trend as the molecular weight increased for the series of compounds ethanolamine, valinol, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tributylamine, tryptophan, desipramine, and tribenzylamine. It was proved that the decreasing trend was partially due to the inverse relation between the mobility and drift time and hence, the shift in drift time better reflects the pure effect of SR on the mobility of analytes. Yet the drift time shift exhibited a mild decrease with the mass of ions. Valinol pulled out from this trend because it had a low binding energy interaction with all the SR and, consequently, its clusters were short-lived. This short lifetime produced fewer collisions against the buffer gas and a drift time shorter compared to those of ions of similar molecular weight. Analyte ion:SR interactions were calculated using Gaussian. IMS with the introduction of SR could be the choice for the free-interferents detection of illegal drugs, explosives, and biological and warfare agents. The suppression of false positives could facilitate the transit of passengers and cargos, rise the confiscation of illicit substances, and save money and distresses due to needless delays.\n\nKeywords: Adduction, ion mobility spectrometry, mass spectrometry, shift reagent, valinol, buffer gas modifier\n", "date": "2022-01-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In the protocol of TeroGen, the synthetic accessibility is validated by reaction energetics (reaction barrier and reaction heat) based on the GFN2-xTB methods. Chemical interpretation is an intrinsic feature as the reaction pathway is bioinspired and triggered by the RMSD-PP method in conjunction with an encoder-decoder architecture.

Here we employ tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate local information of binary SAMs on Au(111) coadsorbed from an equimolar mixture of p-cyanobenzenethiol (pCTP) and p-aminothiophenol (pATP), including chemical composition, coadsorption behavior, phase segregation, plasmon-induced photocatalysis, and solvation effects. We found that upon competitive adsorption of pCTP and pATP on Au(111) from a methanolic solution, the coadsorption initially occurs randomly and homogeneously; eventually, pATP is replaced by pCTP through gradual growth of pCTP nanodomains. TERS imaging also allows for visualization of the plasmon-induced coupling of pATP to p,p\u2019-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) and the solvation-induced phase segregation of the binary SAMs into nanodomains, with a spatial resolution of ~9 nm under ambient conditions.

Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that quantum mechanical wave-like motion of excitons in the pigment-protein complex may be responsible for this quantum efficiency.

While it is known that the relative orientation of the chromophore units and reorganisation energy are important design elements, the role of a structured phonon environment is often not considered. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of a structured immediate phonon environment in determining the exciton dynamics and the possibility of using it as an optimal design element.

Electrochemical investigations in the presence of a proton source (trifluoroacetic acid) confirm that the catalytic activity of the fused metalloporphyrin occurs at a significantly lower onset potential, (overpotential decreased by ~320 mV), compared to the non-fused monomer.

Herein, we report a novel strategy called \u201cvirtual-ligand-assisted (VLA) screening\u201d that enables practical in silico ligand screening based on the transition state theory. We developed a virtual ligand, PCl*3, which parameterizes both the electronic and steric effects of monodentate phosphorus(III) ligands in quantum chemical calculations, and used it to assess how these effects perturb the energy profile of a reaction. This parameter-based ligand screening approach allowed us to identify the optimal electronic and steric effects for a reaction of interest, thereby affording guiding principles for rational ligand design. The VLA screening strategy was demonstrated for the selectivity-determining step of the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of a terminal olefin, and phosphorus(III) ligands with potentially high linear or branched selectivities were designed.

We investigated the methanation of various CO/CO2 (COx) feed gas mixtures under periodically changing gas compositions with emphasis on the effect of the frequency on the reactor response.

A sooting tendency can be used to quantify the extent of soot formation in a combustion device for a given fuel molecule, and therefore to quantify the soot reduction benefits of alternative fuels. However real fuels are complex mixtures of multiple components. In this work, we have used experimental methods to investigate how the sooting tendency of a blended fuel mixture is related to the sooting tendencies of the individual components. A test matrix was formulated that includes sixteen mixtures of six components that are representative of the main categories of hydrocarbons in diesel (eicosane (ECO) for alkanes, isocetane (ICE) for isoalkanes, butylcyclohexane (BCH) for cycloalkanes, 1-methylnaphthalene (1MN) for aromatics, tetralin for naphthoaromatics, and methyl-decanoate (MDC) for oxygenates). Most of the mixtures contain three to five components. The sooting tendency of each mixture was characterized by yield sooting index (YSI), which is based on the soot yield when a methane/air nonpremixed flame is doped with 1000 ppm of the test fuel. The YSIs were measured experimentally. The results show that the blending behavior is linear, i.e., the YSI of the mixtures is the mole-fraction-weighted average of the component YSIs. Experimental results have shown that the sooting tendency of a fuel mixture can be accurately estimated as the linear combination of the individual components. In addition, mass density of the mixtures is also measured, and a linear blending rule is applied to test whether mixing rules exist for mass density of diesel mixtures in this study. Results also have shown that the mixing rule tested in this study is valid and mass density of a mixture can be accurately estimated from the linear combination of the individual components.", "date": "2022-01-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Selective alteration of outer sphere steric at the d layers above and below the Cu site allows facilitated access of substrates, where a more pronounced effect on catalysis is observed when space is created at the d layer below the Cu site via Ile to Ala mutation producing a kcat of 6.2 s-1, TONmax of 14800 and catalytic proficiency (kcat/KM/kuncat) of 340 M-1 for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Independent spectroscopic studied revealed that the rate of formation of the Cu-oxygen species and the spectroscopic feature of the most active variant is distinct compared to the other ArCuPs. Systematic alteration of outer sphere hydrophobicity led to a correlated tuning of the T2 Cu site redox potentials by ~80 mV. The enhanced activity of the ArCuP variant is attributed to a combination of steric effect that allows easy access of substrates, the nature of Cu-oxygen species, and stability of this construct compared to others, where Ile to Ala mutation unexpectedly leads to a higher thermostability which is further augmented by Cu binding.", "date": "2022-01-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Small Molecule Activation (Inorg.); Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Encapsulation in capsules remains the method of choice, but its applicability in precise magnetometry is limited. This is particularly true for minute specimens in the single milligram range as they are outweighed by the capsules and are subject to large alignment errors. We present here a completely new experimental methodology that permits 30-fold in situ reduction of the signal of capsules by substantially restoring the symmetry of the sample holder that is otherwise broken by the presence of the capsule. In practical terms it means that the standard 30 mg capsule is seen by the magnetometer as approximately a 1 mg object, effectively opening the window for precise magnetometry of single milligram specimens. The method is shown to work down to 1.8 K and in the whole range of the magnetic fields. The method is demonstrated and validated using the reciprocal space option of MPMS-SQUID magnetometers; however, it can be easily incorporated in any magnetometer that can accommodate straw sample holders (i.e., the VSM-SQUID).

However, modern chemical reaction ML models, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), must be trained on a large amount of labelled data in order to avoid overfitting the data and thus possessing low accuracy and transferability. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage unlabelled data to learn accurate ML models for small labelled chemical reaction data. We focus on an old and prominent problem\u2014classifying reactions into distinct families\u2014and build a GNN model for this task. We first pretrain the model on unlabelled reaction data using unsupervised contrastive learning and then fine-tune it on a small number of labelled reactions. The contrastive pretraining learns by making the representations of two augmented versions of a reaction similar to each other but distinct from other reactions. We propose chemically consistent reaction augmentation methods that protect the reaction center and find they are the key for the model to extract relevant information from unlabelled data to aid the reaction classification task. The transfer learned model outperforms a supervised model trained from scratch by a large margin. Further, it consistently performs better than models based on traditional rule-driven reaction fingerprints, which have long been the default choice for small datasets. In addition to reaction classification, the effectiveness of the strategy is tested on regression datasets; the learned GNN-based reaction fingerprints can also be used to navigate the chemical reaction space, which we demonstrate by querying for similar reactions.

Conjugated push-pull copolymers consisting of alternating donor and acceptor moieties are at the heart of these applications, due to the large tunability of their electronic structure. Hence, knowing the repeat unit and thus the chromophore of these materials is essential for a detailed understanding of the structure--function relationship of conjugated polymers used in organic electronics applications. Therefore, spectroscopic tools providing the necessary molecular resolution that allows to discriminate between different building blocks and to decide which one actually resembles the electronic structure of the polymer are of utmost importance. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy is both, perfectly suited for this task and clearly superior to optical spectroscopy, particularly when supported by quantum-chemical calculations.

Then, the introduction of vibrational sampling, the effect of implicit and explicit solvation models, and the application of the Marcus theory have been analyzed through dynamic methods. The results revealed that the static direct determination provides more accurate results than thermodynamic cycles. Moreover, the effect of sampling has not shown to be relevant, and the results are improved within the dynamic framework when the Marcus theory is applied, especially in explicit solvent, with respect to the direct approach.

These challenges include: the propensity of proteins to aggregate during formulation, relatively low loading in traditional hydrophobic delivery vehicles, and inefficient cellular uptake. This last criterion is particularly challenging for anionic proteins as they cannot cross the anionic plasma membrane. Here we investigated the complex coacervation of anionic proteins with a block copolymer of opposite charge to form polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) micelles for use as a protein delivery vehicle. Using genetically modified variants of the model protein green fluorescent protein (GFP), we evaluated the role of protein charge and charge localization in the formation and stability of PEC micelles. A neutral-cationic block copolymer, POEGMA79-b-qP4VP175, was prepared via RAFT polymerization for complexation and microphase separation with the panel of engineered anionic GFPs. We found that isotropically supercharged proteins formed micelles at higher ionic strength relative to protein variants with charge localized to a polypeptide tag. We then studied GFP delivery by PEC micelles and found that they effectively delivered the protein cargo to mammalian cells. However, cellular delivery varied as a function of protein charge and charge distribution and we found an inverse relationship between the PEC micelle critical salt concentration and delivery efficiency.

Inorganic semiconductors\nhave been studied extensively as photocatalysts for overall water splitting, but polymer photocatalysts\nare also receiving growing attention. So far, most studies involving organic polymers report hydrogen\nproduction with sacrificial electron donors, which is unsuitable for large-scale hydrogen energy production. Here we show that a linear conjugated polymer photocatalyst can be used for overall water splitting\nto produce stoichiometric amounts of H2 and O2. We studied a range of different metal co-catalysts in\nconjunction with the linear polymer photocatalyst, the homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone\n(P10). Photocatalytic activity was observed for palladium/iridium oxide-loaded P10, while other co-catalysts resulted in materials that showed no activity for overall water splitting. The reaction conditions were\nfurther optimized and the overall water splitting using the IrO2-loaded P10 was found to proceed steadily\nfor an extended period (>60 hours) after the system stabilized. These results demonstrate that conjugated polymers can act as single component photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting when\nloaded with suitable co-catalysts, albeit currently with low activities. Significantly, though, organic polymers can be designed to absorb a large fraction of the visible spectrum, which can be challenging with\ninorganic catalysts. Transient spectroscopy shows that the IrO2 co-catalyst plays an important role in the\ngeneration of the charge separated state required for water splitting, with evidence for fast hole transfer\nto the co-catalyst.

Herein, we leverage non-saturated oxidation in plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition to tune structural, mechanical, and optical properties of biphasic CoOx thin films, thereby tailoring their catalytic activities and chemical stabilities. To optimize the resulting film properties, we systematically vary the oxygen plasma power and exposure time in the deposition process. We find that short exposure times and low plasma powers incompletely oxidize the cobaltocene precursor to Co(OH)2 and result in the incorporation of carbon impurities. These Co(OH)2 films are highly porous and catalytically active, but their electrochemical stability is impacted by poor adhesion to the substrate. In contrast, long exposure times and high plasma powers completely oxidize the precursor to form Co3O4, reduce the carbon impurity incorporation, and improve the film crystallinity. While the resulting Co3O4 films are highly stable under electrochemical conditions, they are characterized by low oxygen evolution reaction activities. To overcome these competing properties, we applied the established relation between deposition parameters and functional film properties to design bilayer films exhibiting simultaneously improved electrochemical performance and chemical stability. The resulting biphasic films combine a highly active Co(OH)2 surface with a stable Co3O4 interface layer. In addition, these coatings exhibit minimal light absorption, thus rendering them well suited as protective catalytic layers on semiconductor light absorbers for application in photoelectrochemical devices.

Wastewater-based epidemiology is a useful tool for evaluating public health, via the monitoring of chemical and biological markers in wastewater influent, such as antibiotics. Chemical analyses are used to determine sampled drug concentrations; measured daily flows then enable quantitation of analyte mass/day; and population estimates are utilised to calculate mass/day/1000inhabitants. These data allow for effective evaluations of drug presence and temporal trends, but do not fully represent the total quantity of drugs being consumed, i.e., human intake. Factors such as drug metabolism and physiochemical stability significantly decrease the quantity of parent drug that reaches wastewater treatment plants, leading to potential underestimations of community usage. A case study of 16 antimicrobials, and their metabolites was conducted in this study: including sulfonamides, trimethoprim, metronidazole, quinolones, nitrofurantoin, cyclines, and antiretrovirals. Correction factors (CFs) for human drug excretion, for various metabolite forms, were determined via a systematic literature review of pharmacokinetic research. Analyte stability was examined over a 24 h study. The estimation of community-wide drug intake was evaluated using the associated catchment prescription data. Overall, antimicrobials excreted in an unchanged form were often observed to over-estimate daily intake. This could be attributed to biotransformation, e.g., via glucuronide cleavage, or direct disposal of unused drugs. Acetyl-sulfonamides, trimethoprim, hydroxy-metronidazole, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, and oxytetracycline generally performed well in the estimation of drug intake, relative to prescription records. The low prevalence of quinolone and trimethoprim metabolites, and the low stability of nitrofurantoin, limited the ability to evaluate these metabolites and their respective CFs. CFs established in the systematic literature review could not be validated for some metabolites in the case study due to lack of available prescription data (lamivudine, emtricitabine); an inability to quantify biomarkers (nitrofurantoin, doxycycline); being excreted at too low levels (hydroxy-trimethoprim, ofloxacin-N-oxide, desethylene-ciprofloxacin); or insufficient pharmacokinetic literature sources (the nitrofurantoin metabolite, NPAHD).

Laser post-processing of colloidal nanoparticles has been employed previously to create defects in oxide nanoparticles, while the possibility of laser-based cation doping of colloidal nanoparticles without affecting their size, remains mostly unaccounted for. Consequently, at the example of doping iron into colloidal Co3O4 spinel nanoparticles, we developed a pulse-by-pulse laser cation doping method to provide catalyst series with gradual surface composition but maintained extrinsic properties such as phase, size, and surface area for catalytic studies. Laser pulse number-resolved doping series were prepared at laser intensity chosen to selectively heat the Co3O4-NPs to roughly 1000 K and enable cation diffusion of surface-adsorbed Fe3+ into the Co3O4 lattice while maintaining the spinel phase, particle size, and surface area. The combination of bulk-sensitive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm a surface enrichment of the Fe-dopant. XRD, Magnetometry, and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy revealed an increasing interaction between Fe and the antiferromagnetic Co3O4 with an increasing number of pulses, in line with a proposed laser-induced surface doping of colloidal Co3O4 with Fe.

Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) has been employed for a wide range of systems containing up to ca. 5000 atoms, and has an accuracy comparable to DFT but is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster. The efficiency of DFTB comes via pre-computed integrals, which are parameterized for each pair of atoms, and the requirement for this parameterization has previously prevented widespread use of DFTB for Metal-Organic Frameworks. The GFN-xTB (Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent interactions Tight Binding) method provides parameters for elements up to Z\u226486.

The aim was to see if ESM could help reduce the amount of NaCl that is usually added to this type of product. The effects of ESM were investigated in terms of cooking loss, water distribution, color, and texture properties using a simplified meat emulsion model with no other additives than ESM.  Emulsified meat samples were made with three different NaCl concentration (0.5, 0.1, 1.5%), without and with three levels of ESM (0.5, 1.0, 1.5%). In general addition of ESM reduced cooking loss (CL), improved texture, and increased redness. Effects of ESM were explained by structural changes in the protein matrix, as shown by two different histological methods. Addition of ESM explained 86% of the variation in LF-NMR T2 relaxation times in uncooked samples, while 97% of the variation in cooked samples was explained by the NaCl concentration. FTIR micro-spectroscopic measurements revealed that samples supplemented with ESM had a higher proportion of \u03b1-helical structures and reduced amount of protein \u00df-sheet aggregation in samples with 1.0 and 1.5% NaCl. It was shown that ESM increased the pH of the emulsified meat, and it was therefore suggested that increased negative repulsion effects had a positive heat stabilizing effect on the protein network. The fact that the cooked samples were redder was probably related to the antioxidant effect of ESM which was measured as MDA (malondialdehyde) equivalents after in vitro digestion of the samples. ESM can thus help reduce the salt content in sausages while ESM also has a positive antioxidant effect improving color.", "date": "2022-01-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, studies quantifying the timescales and nature of dark state behavior for commonly used FPs under conditions typical of widefield and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy remain scarce and pre-date many new SMLM techniques. FusionRed is a relatively bright red FP exhibiting fluorescence intermittency and has thus been identified as a potential candidate for SMLM. We herein characterize the rates for dark-state conversion and the subsequent ground-state recovery of FusionRed and its 2.5-fold brighter descendent FusionRed L175M M42Q (FusionRed-MQ) at low irradiances (1-10 W/cm2), which were previously unexplored experimental conditions.  We characterized the kinetics of dark state transitions in these two FPs by using single molecule blinking and ensemble photobleaching experiments bridged with a dark state kinetic model. We find that at low irradiances, the recovery process to the ground state is minimally light-driven and FusionRed-MQ has a 1.3-fold higher ground state recovery time indicating a conformationally restricted dark-state chromophore in comparison to FusionRed. Our studies indicate that the brighter FusionRed-MQ exhibits higher tendency in dark state conversion, thus it is potentially a better candidate for SMLM applications than its progenitor FusionRed.", "date": "2022-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This work systematically tackles them with a combination of electrocatalyst synthesis and characterization methodologies including thin-film rotating disc electrodes (TF-RDE), an electrochemical flow cell linked to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (EFC-ICP-MS) and testing in 50 cm2 membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs).

Using THz calorimetry the contributions due to cavity formation and hydrophilic interactions can be traced back to changes in the intermolecular hydrogen bond stretching region around 150-200 cm\u22121 and spectroscopic changes due to strong solute-water interactions in the frequency range of the librational modes, i.e. between 540 and 600 cm\u22121.

PLP has also been reported to react with substrates and catalyze some of these reactions independent of enzymes. One such catalytic reaction is the breakdown of cysteine to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the presence of multivalent metal ions. However, the catalytic activity of PLP in catabolizing cysteine in the absence of multivalent ions is unknown. In this study, we show that, under physiological conditions and in the absence of enzymes and multivalent metal ions, PLP reacts with cysteine to form a thiazolidine product. The formation of a thiazolidine product is supported by quantum chemical simulation of the absorption spectrum. The reaction of PLP with cysteine is dependent on ionic strength and pH. The thiazolidine product slowly decomposes to produce H2S and the PLP regenerates to its active form with longer reaction times (>24 hours), suggesting that PLP can act as a catalyst. We have proposed an enzyme-independent plausible reaction mechanism for PLP-cysteine catalysis which proceeds through the formation of thiazolidine ring intermediates that later hydrolyzes slowly to regenerate the PLP. This work demonstrates that PLP catalyzes cysteine in the absence of (i) enzymes, (ii) base, and (iii) multivalent metal ions to produce H2S.

Specifically, we quantify density-driven errors in two widely used dispersion-corrected functionals derived within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), namely BLYP-D3 and revPBE-D3, and two modern meta-GGA functionals, namely SCAN and B97M-rV. The effects of functional-driven and density-driven errors on the interaction energies are assessed for the water clusters of the BEGDB dataset. Further insight into the nature of functional-driven errors is gained from applying the absolutely localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO- EDA) to the interaction energies, which demonstrates that functional-driven errors are strongly correlated with the nature of the interactions. We discuss cases where density-corrected DFT (DC-DFT) models display higher accuracy than the original DFT models, and cases where reducing the density-driven errors leads to larger deviations from the reference energies due to the presence of large functional-driven errors. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations are performed with data-driven many-body potentials derived from DFT and DC-DFT data to determine the effect that minimizing density-driven errors has on the description of liquid water. Besides rationalizing the performance of widely used DFT models of water, we believe that our findings unveil fundamental relations between the shortcomings of some common DFT approximations and the requirements for accurate descriptions of molecular interactions, which will aid the development of a consistent, DFT-based framework for data-driven simulations of condensed-phase systems.", "date": "2022-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This alleviates spatial limitations, due to small element footprint and dominance of edge-beading, enabling arbitrarily complex microfluidic circuitry and complex world-to-chip interfaces while leaving the entire ATR element available for sensing. An optimized optical interface maximizes light transfer into the on-chip sensing chamber. This promotes low limits of detection, fast measurements and/or designs featuring multiple sensing sub regions. To demonstrate the approach, we conducted measurements on complex flow profiles generated from four separate proof-of-concept spectrofluidic devices.

Unlike most MFC types, those in a microfluidic format typically do not use a membrane to separate anode and cathode compartments, relying instead on the physics of laminar flow to maintain isolation of independent liquid streams. This lowers cost, device complexity, and should reduce internal resistance. However, to avoid solution crossover, which is likely to occur due to inevitable instabilities during long operational times, authors often separate electrodes by distances of several millimeters or more. This reverses benefits on internal resistance, undermining a prime advantage of microfluidic MFCs. This work demonstrates a facile method for the in-situ synthesis of a microscale membrane, supporting sub-milimeter electrode spacing. The membrane added only 68.5 \u03a9 to the cell internal resistance and its synthesis resulted in no measurable changes to Rct at either electrode. However, the method to grow the membrane after device synthesis greatly reduced complexity in device fabrication. Overall, the reduced electrode spacing that was facilitated by the membrane lowered internal resistance from 25 k\uf057 to 10 k\uf057 and provide stable operation even under non-ideal flow conditions. Compared to a state-of-the-art membraneless MFC with 6 mm electrode spacing, the membrane MFC provided approximately 45% higher power density, 290% higher current density and 7 times higher acetate conversation efficiency.

Using density functional theory and correlated wavefunction theory, we investigate the degree to which vanadium mimic electronic structure is comparable to catalytic iron intermediates. Our calculations reveal crucial structural and energetic differences between vanadyl and ferryl intermediates primarily due to differences in ground spin states of low spin and high spin, respectively. This difference in spin state leads to differences in energetics for accessing isomers that confer activity in non-heme hydroxylase and halogenase enzymes. While interconversion between monodentate and bidentate succinate isomers of the key metal-oxo/hydroxo intermediates is energetically favorable for Fe, it is strongly unfavorable in V mimics. Additionally, isomerization of a terminal metal-oxo between an axial and equatorial position is energetically unfavorable for Fe but favorable for V.

Many approaches rely on exogeneous triggers such as the irradiation of ultrasound, visible or even ionizing electromagnetic waves. However, such exogenous triggers can be challenging to implement in a specific manner. Therefore, designing carriers responsive to endogenous moieties, such as nucleic acid biomarkers, is a desirable step in the search of personalized drug delivery nanoplatforms. This study presents an approach to building a biocompatible DNA-liposome hybrid nanocarrier for potential triggered release purposes. We form a DNA mesh on large unilamellar liposomes incorporating a trigger-responsive DNA building block.

A series of complex polybenzimidazole derivatives with high absolute molecular weights of up to 24000 are efficiently produced in high yields within 2 hours. Benefiting from their unique imidazole-containing ring-fused structures with multiple aryl pendants, the obtained polymers show excellent thermal and morphological stability, good solution processability, high refractive index, small chromic dispersion, as well as remarkable acid-base-responsive fluorescence. Taking advantage of the ratiometric fluorescence response of the triphenylamine-substituted heteroaromatic polymer to pH variations, we successfully apply it as a sensitive fluorescence probe for the mapping and quantitative analysis of intracellular pH changes in live cells. Furthermore, through the simple N-methylation reaction of the ring-fused polybenzimidazoles, diverse azonia-containing polyelectrolytes are readily produced, which can efficiently kill cancer cells via the synergistic effects of dark toxicity and photo-toxicity.", "date": "2022-01-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers); Physical and Chemical Properties; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We find that the OER follows a bi-nuclear mechanism with adjacent top surface oxygen atoms as fixed adsorption sites, whereas the iridium atoms underneath play an indirect role and maintain their saturated 6-fold oxygen coordination at all stages of the reaction. The oxygen molecule is formed, via an Ir\u2013OOOO\u2013Ir transition state, by association of the outer oxygen atoms of two adjacent Ir\u2013OO surface entities, leaving two intact Ir\u2013O entities at the surface behind. This is drastically different from the commonly considered mono-nuclear mechanism where the O2 molecule evolves by splitting of the Ir\u2013O bond in an Ir\u2013OO entity. We regard the rather weak reducibility of crystalline IrO2 as the reason for favoring the novel pathway, which allows the Ir\u2013O bonds to remain stable and explains the outstanding stability of IrO2 under OER conditions. The establishment of surface oxygen atoms as fixed electrocatalytically active sites on a transition-metal oxide represents a paradigm shift for the understanding of water oxidation electrocatalysis, and it reconciles the theoretical understanding of the OER mechanism on iridium oxide with recently reported experimental results from operando X-ray spectroscopy. The novel mechanism provides an efficient OER pathway on a weakly reducible oxide, defining a new strategy towards the design of advanced OER catalysts with combined activity and stability.", "date": "2022-01-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The molecular weight of the PEGSH ligand and particle core size were both varied to yield particles with hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 7 to 21 nm. Gel mesh size was varied from approximately 36 to 60 nm by controlling the crosslinking density of the gel. Because high molecular weight ligands are expected to yield more compressible particles, we expected the diffusion constants of the NPs to depend on their hard:soft ratios (where the hard component of the particle consists of the particle core and the soft component of the particle consists of the ligand shell). However, our measurements revealed that NP diffusion coefficients resulted primarily from changes in the overall hydrodynamic diameter and not the ratio of particle core size to ligand size. Across all particles and gels, we found that the diffusion coefficient was well-predicted by the confinement ratio calculated from the diameter of the particle and an estimate of the gel mesh size obtained from the elastic blob model. These results suggest that the elastic blob model provides a reasonable estimate of the mesh size that particles \u201csee\u201d as they diffuse through the gel.

Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 multi-spike trimers, an icosahedral DNA framework was assembled to spatially arrange up to thirty neutralizing aptamers (IDNA-30) with nanometer precision to inhibit viral infection. Each triangular plane of IDNA-30 is composed of three precisely positioned aptamers topologically matching SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer, thus forming a multivalent spatially patterned binding. Additionally, due to its multiple binding sites and moderate size, multifaced IDNA induces aggregation of viruses. Moreover, the rigid icosahedron framework afforded by four-helixes not only forms a steric barrier to prevent the virus from binding to host, but also limits the conformational transformation of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. Combining multivalent topologically patterned aptamers with structurally well-defined nano-formulations, IDNA-30 exhibits excellent neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 and a broad neutralizing activity against several mutant strains. Overall, this spatially matched neutralizing strategy provides a new direction for the assembly of neutralizing reagents to enhance the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection and combat other disease-causing viruses.

However, given the extremely flexible coordination sphere of lanthanides, it is often difficult to assess the number and nature of the active species. Here we show how such questions can be addressed by using a combination of ion mobility spectrometry, mass spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations to study the test systems PQQ and lanthanide-PQQ-crown ether ligand complexes.

Due to enol/keto tautomerization of the 1-arylhydrazone-2-naphthol skeleton, these pigments oftentimes crystallize as hydrazones (keto). Therefore, proper characterization is necessary for understanding their intrinsic physicochemical properties and chemical reactivity in the solid state, as well as stability and lightfastness.

Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we provide decisive proof that both of these pigments are keto/hydrazones in the solid state. Therefore, the frequent yet erroneous designation as azo pigments should be avoided. To confirm the bulk structure, we performed powder diffraction experiments, followed by Rietveld refinement. We complemented the diffraction experiments with spectroscopic (IR, Raman, UV-vis) and thermal (TGA, DSC) analyses. Furthermore, we studied the lightfastness of both chromophores in solution and solid state. While the solid state pigments were stable over the course of the experiment, UV irradiation of solutions resulted in degradation, which was studied by chromatographic and mass-spec techniques.

Similarly to all polymers prepared by radical polymerization, PS is constituted of a C-C backbone and thus is not degradable. To confer degradability to such materials, the copolymerization of vinyl monomers with cyclic monomer that could undergo radical ring-opening is an efficient methodology to introduce pur-posely cleavable bonds into the polymer backbone. Dibenzo[c,e]-oxepane-5-thione (DOT) is a cyclic thionolac-tone monomer known for its efficient copolymerization with acrylate derivatives but so far could not be incor-porated into PS backbones.

Thanks to favorable reactivity ratios allowing only a few mol% of thioester units to be randomly incorporated, there was no major modification of the thermal and mechanical properties of the PS.

A significant fraction of such efforts has been focused on distinguishing, understanding and enhancing specific energy transfer mechanisms from plasmonic nanostructures to their environment. Herein we report a synthetic strategy that brings together two of the main physical mechanisms driving plasmonic photocatalysis into an engineered system by rationally combining the photochemical features of energetic charge carriers and the electromagnetic field enhancement inherent to the plasmonic excitation. We do so by creating hybrid photocatalysts that integrate multiple plasmonic resonators in a single entity, controlling their joint contribution through spectral separation and differential surface functionalization. This strategy allows us to study the combination of different photosensitization mechanisms when activated simultaneously. Our results show that hot electron injection can be combined with an energy transfer process mediated by near-field interaction, leading to a significant increase of the final photocatalytic response of the material. In this manner, we overcome the limitations that hinder photocatalysis driven only by a single energy transfer mechanism, and move the field of plasmonic photocatalysis closer to energy-efficient applications. Furthermore, our multimodal hybrids offer a test system to probe the properties of the two targeted mechanisms in energy-related applications such as the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen and open the door to wavelength-selective photocatalysis and novel tandem reactions.", "date": "2022-01-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Nanoscience; Energy; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Platforms for LC-MS-based global profiling quantify hundreds or thousands of small molecule metabolites and/or lipids using combinations of distinct methods and analyses to develop broad coverage of the metabolome with high analytical sensitivity and specificity. However, the breadth of coverage provided by global profiling assays still outpaces efforts to characterise them by annotating profile signals with their respective metabolite identities. Fully realising the utility of metabolomics in biomedical research requires closing this gap by more accurately defining the finite metabolome coverage provided by common LC-MS-based global profiling methods. To date, method characterisation activities have progressed in the absence of broadly accepted standard LC methods as parallel efforts at building in-house libraries. While methodological diversity is a natural consequence of different design constraints and priorities observed across laboratories, it does tend to relegate in-house libraries to silos of information and investment that fail to advance the broader metabolomics community. Here, the National Phenome Centre\u2019s established platform for LC-MS-based global profiling of small molecule metabolites and lipids is made open in its entirety. Complete and detailed protocols for reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography LC-MS methods are offered alongside discussion of the rationale for their design specifics.

Chemical stability is typically reported as a combination of potency and degradation product. For peptide products, it is common to measure physical stability via aggregation or fibrillation using the fluorescent reporter Thioflavin T. Executing stability studies is a lengthy process and requires extensive resources. To reduce the resources and shorten the process for stability studies during the development of a product, we introduce a machine learning based model for predicting the chemical stability over time using both the formulation conditions as well as the aggregation curve. In this work, we explore the relationships between the formulation, stability time point, and the measurements of chemical stability and achieve a coefficient of determination on a random test set of 0.945 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.421 when using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network for total degradation. Similarly, we achieve a coefficient of determination of 0.908 and an MAE of 1.435 when predicting the potency using a random forest model. When measurements of physical stability are included into the model, the MAE in the prediction of TD decreases to 0.148 for the MLP model.

Using these analytic energy derivatives, one can efficiently compute the harmonic vibrational frequencies, infrared (IR) and Raman scattering (RS) spectra of the molecule in the proximity of noble metal clusters/nanoparticles. The validity and accuracy of these analytic implementations are demonstrated by the comparison of results obtained by the finite-difference method and the analytic approaches, and by the full QM and QM/DIM calculations. The complexes formed by pyridine and two sizes of gold clusters (Au18 and Au32) at varying intersystem distances of 3, 4, and 5 \u00c5 are used as the test systems, and Raman spectra of 4,40-bipyridine in the proximity of Au2057 and Ag2057 metal nanoparticles (MNP) are calculated by QM/DIM method and compared with experimental results as well. We find that the QM/DIM model can well reproduce the IR spectra obtained from full QM calculations for all the configurations, while though it properly enhances some of the vibrational modes, it artificially overestimates RS spectral intensities of several modes for the systems with very short intersystem distance. We show that this could be improved, however, by incorporating the hyperpolarizability of the gold metal cluster in the evaluation of RS intensities.

The aim of this study is to validate the recycling of disposable Zamak laryngoscope blades into new medical products by using a new \u2018all-in-one\u2019 affordable reprocessing setup as alternative for die-casting.  Methods: An \u201call-in-one\u201d casting set-up was designed and built. Laryngoscope blades, recovered from two hospitals, were disinfected, melted and casted into dog-bones and into new instrument parts. The quality of the casted material was evaluated using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The mechanical properties were obtained by assessing the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) and tensile tests. Results: A recovery of 93% Zamak was obtained using a melting temperature of 420 0C for three hours. The XRF Spectro data showed higher Zinc and silicon concentrations when compared with Virgin Zamak. The dog-bones tests resulted in an average UTS, Yield Strength (YS) and Young\u2019s Modulus (YM) of 236 \u00b161 (MPa), 70 \u00b143 and 9 \u00b13, respectively, representing 82%, 103% and 64% of the UTS, YS and YM of standard Zamak. Functional instrument parts with extensions and inner chambers were casted with a maximal shrinkage percentage of 1\u00b11%.\nDiscussion: This study demonstrates that the created \u201call-in-one\u201d reprocessing method can process contaminated disposable Zamak laryngoscope blades into new raw base material and new instrument parts. Although material and surface properties can deteriorate, reprocessed Zamak still has sufficient mechanical properties and can be used to cast complex parts with sufficient dimensional tolerances and minimal shrinkage. Conclusion: A circular micro reprocessing method was designed and used to turn disposed laryngoscope blades into new basis material and semi-finished products. Follow up studies are needed to scale and optimize this process towards a functional alternative for die casting. It should be further investigated how this process can contribute to further medical waste reduction and a circular healthcare economy.\n", "date": "2022-01-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Materials Processing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This work combines conventional and enhanced molecular dynamics simulations with empirical valence bond simulations to provide rich detail of the conformational behavior of the catalytic loops in HisA, PriA and TrpF, and the role of their plasticity in facilitating bifunctionality in PriA and evolved HisA variants. In addition, we demonstrate that, similar to other enzymes activated by ligand-gated conformational changes, loops 3 and 4 of HisA and PriA act as gripper loops, facilitating the isomerization of the large bulky substrate ProFAR, albeit now on much slower timescales.

The selectivity of the small molecule remains a challenge, especially when the target protein belongs to a homologous family, which can often lead to off-target side effects.\nResults: We have developed a multi-task deep learning model for predicting the selectivity of small molecules on the closely related homologs of the target protein. The multi-task model, which can learn from training data of the related tasks has been tested on the Janus kinase (JAK) and dopamine receptor family of proteins. To decipher the model decision on selectivity, the important fragments associated with each homolog protein were identified using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. The performance of the multi-task model was evaluated using various representation of small molecules such as fingerprints (ECFP4) and molecular graph representations. It was observed that the feature-based representation (ECFP4) with the XGBoost performed marginally better when compared to deep neural network models in most of the evaluation metrics. Both the models outperformed the graph-based models.

Surfactant molecules self-assemble into micellar macroions that are known to form complexes with oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes, and can undergo a bulk liquid-liquid phase separation known as complex coacervation. This process results in a `coacervate' phase that is rich in macroions, and a `supernatant' phase that is dilute in macroions. It is challenging to model this phase separation process, due to the disparate length scales and strong Coulombic interactions in these mixed macroion systems. In this work, we present a hybrid simulation and field theory model to describe polyelectrolytes/surfactants solutions, where the surfactant species has self-assembled into worm-like micelle structures. We use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to model the polyelectrolytes in the solution which interact with the surfactant micelles. The surfactant micelle structures are determined by performing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which are used to determine applied external fields in the SCFT portion of the model. We use these calculations to determine the system free energy and map the phase diagrams for polyelectrolyte-surfactant coacervates, and subsequently consider the effect of a number of molecular parameters such as polyelectrolyte chain length, the volume of the interacting micelle surface-sites, and the electrostatic binding energy between the polyelectrolyte and micelle surface. Our model shows that local charge-charge correlations are critical for phase separation to occur. Additionally, we evaluate the statistics of micelle bridging by the polyelectrolyte, and the relationship between bridging and the densities of the macroions and salt ions.

Systems are simulated in various ensembles, depending on the experimental conditions one aims to mimic. While constant energy, temperature, volume, and pressure are rather straightforward to model, pH, which is an equally important parameter in experiments, is more difficult to account for in simulations.  Although a constant pH algorithm based on the $\\lambda$-dynamics approach by Brooks and co-workers was implemented in a fork of the GROMACS molecular dynamics program, uptake has been rather limited, presumably due to the poor scaling of that code with respect to the number of titratable sites. To overcome this limitation, we implemented an alternative scheme for interpolating the Hamiltonians of the protonation states that makes the constant pH molecular dynamics simulations almost as fast as a normal MD simulation with GROMACS. In addition, we implemented a simpler scheme, called multisite representation, for modeling side chains with multiple titratable sites, such as imidazole rings. This scheme, which is based on constraining the sum of the  $\\lambda$-coordinates, not only reduces the complexity associated with parameterizing the intra-molecular interactions between the sites, but is also easily extendable to other molecules with multiple titratable sites. With the combination of a more efficient interpolation scheme and multisite representation of titratable groups, we anticipate a rapid uptake of constant pH molecular dynamics simulations within the GROMACS user community.", "date": "2022-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Rarely, carbonyl compounds are observed as a side product of the reaction. However, the selective formation of carbonyl compounds from alkenes using iron-oxo species and small molecule catalysts has not yet been achieved. Recently, a new P450-based enzyme (aMOx) has been engineered through laboratory directed evolution to directly oxidize styrenes to their corresponding aldehydes. This transformation uses an enzymatic iron-oxo species as catalytic oxidant and generates aldehydes with high activity and selectivity while suppressing epoxidation.\nHere, we combine extensive computational modelling together with experimental mechanistic investigations to study the reaction mechanism and unravel the molecular basis behind the selectivity achieved by the laboratory evolved aMOx enzyme. We found that alkene epoxidation and carbonyl formation pathways diverge from a common covalent radical intermediate generated after the first C\u2013O bond formation. Although both pathways are accessible and very similar in energy, intrinsic dynamic effects determine the strong preference for epoxidation. We discovered that aMOx overrides these intrinsic dynamic preferences by controlling the accessible conformations of the covalent radical intermediate. This disfavors epoxidation and facilitates the formation of a key carbocation intermediate that generates the aldehyde product through a fast 1,2-hydride migration. Computations predicted that the hydride migration is stereoselective due to the conformational control over the intermediate species when formed in the enzyme active site. These predictions were corroborated by experiments using deuterated styrene substrates, which proved that the hydride migration is cis- and enantioselective.\nOur results demonstrate that directed evolution tailored a highly specific active site that imposes strong steric control over key fleeting biocatalytic intermediates, which is essential for accessing the carbonyl forming pathway and preventing competing epoxidation.", "date": "2022-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, open-source software for techno-economic analysis (pyH2A) along with a Monte Carlo-based methodology for modelling of technological progress are developed. Together, these tools allow for the study of required technological improvement to reach a competitive target cost.

For PEC, it is found that cell lifetime improvements (> 2 years) and operation under high solar concentration (> 50-fold) are crucial, necessitating systems with high space-time yields. In case of PC, solar-to-hydrogen efficiency has to reach at least 6% and lowering catalyst concentration (< 0.2 g/L) by improving absorption properties is identified as a promising path to low-cost hydrogen.

This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi-step DNA reactions, because a small deviation from the optimal conditions slows down the process dramatically. Here we show how an ATP-dependent helicase, Rep-X, can drive certain dehybridization reactions in designed DNA reaction networks at rates independent of sequence length, thereby decoupling the rates of hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate this principle, we show that Rep-X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly: in the strong substrate-hairpin binding regime, Rep-X expedites the reaction almost one hundred-fold.

DNP NMR has been applied to small molecules with stable isotopes and has been used to obtain metabolic and physiological information in vivo. However, the hyperpolarized state exponentially decays back to the thermal equilibrium state, depending on the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1). This signal decay has remained a major problem associated with this technology. Therefore, DNP NMR molecular probes useful for in vivo analysis have been limited to naturally occurring small molecules that inherently show long T1. While peptides are promising targets for DNP NMR studies, because of the limitation in T1, DNP NMR molecular probes applicable in vivo have been limited to amino acids or dipeptides. Herein we propose a 13C-labeling strategy to utilize the C-terminal [1-13C]Gly-d2 residue for realizing long T1 in peptides. Structure-based T1 relaxation analysis of amino acids and peptides revealed that (1) T1 does not decrease monotonically with increasing molecular weight and (2) T1 is not significantly affected by a side chain on the neighboring amino acid residue. These findings suggest that the C-terminal [1-13C]Gly-d2 residue affords sufficiently long T1 for biological uses, even in oligopeptides, and allowed us to develop 13C-b- casomorphin-5 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-[1-13C]Gly-d2, T1 = 24 \u00b1 4 s at 3 T in H2O) and 13C-glutathione (g-Glu-Cys-[1-13C]Gly-d2, T1 = 58 \u00b1 3 s at 3 T in H2O) as DNP NMR probes with long T1.

The method is based on an oil-triggered, template-confined dewetting phenomenon. To realize the dewetting-induced sample digitization, an aqueous sample is firstly infused into a networked microwell array (NMA) through a predegassing-based self-pumping mechanism, and then an immiscible oil phase is applied over the surface of NMA chip to induce the templated dewetting. Due to a periodic interfacial tension heterogeneity, such dewetting ruptures the sample at the thinnest parts (i.e., con-nection channels) and spontaneously splits the sample into droplets in individual microwells. Without requiring any complex pump-ing or valving systems, this method can discretize a sample into tens of thousands of addressable droplets in a matter of minutes with nearly 98% usage. To demonstrate the utility and universality of this self-digitization method, we exploited it to discretize samples into 40,233 wells for digital PCR assay, digital quantification of bacteria, and self-assembly of spherical colloidal photonic crystals.

In most programs, this number of degrees of freedom is the default setting. However, if one carries out a molecular simulation in an external field, one needs to ensure that degrees of freedom are changed from this default setting to 3N, as in an external field the velocity of the center of mass can change. Using the correct degrees of freedom is important in calculating the temperature and in some algorithms to simulate at constant temperature.\nFor sufficiently large systems, the difference between 3N and 3N-3 is negligible in the way. However, there are systems in which the comparison with experimental data requires molecular dynamics simulations of a small number of particles. In this work, we illustrate the effect of an incorrect setting of degrees of freedom in molecular dynamic simulations studying the diffusion properties of guest molecules in nanoporous materials. We show that previously published results have reported a surprising diffusion dependence on the loading, which could be traced back to an incorrect setting of the degrees of freedom. As the correct settings are convoluted and counter-intuitive in some of the most commonly used molecular dynamics programs, we carried out a systematic study on the consequences of the various commonly used (incorrect) settings. Our conclusion, is that for systems smaller than 50 particles the results are most likely unreliable as these are either performed at an incorrect temperature or the temperature is incorrectly used in some of the results.\nFurthermore, a novel and efficient method to calculate diffusion coefficients of guest molecules into nanoporous materials at zero loading conditions is introduced.", "date": "2022-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Activated Borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially-available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make Activated Borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.", "date": "2022-01-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Inorganic Polymers; Polymers; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Clark", "abstract": "Amphiphile self-assembly in non-polar media is often enhanced by polar co-solutes. This is observed within many biphasic separations processes, where amphiphiles mediate transport of water and acid into organic solution. A myriad of competitive intermolecular interactions have thus far prevented a fundamental understanding of the individual and dual role of these polar solutes upon amphiphile self-assembly in non-polar media. Toward this end, the current work employs classical molecular dynamics and intermolecular network analyses to deconstruct the individual affects of water and nitric acid upon the self-assembly of N,N,N\\textsuperscript{$'$},N{$'$}-tetraoctyl-3-oxapentanediamide (TODGA), a prevalent amphiphile extractant used in metal ion separations. In the absence of acid, and at low water concentration, H$_2$O is found to promote local dimer and trimer formation of TODGA, however as [H$_2$O]$_{org}$ increases, preferential self-solvation leads to large (H$_2$O)$_n$ clusters that cause TODGA clusters to sorb to the (H$_2$O)$_n$  periphery and supports extended aggregation. Addition of HNO$_3$ to the humid solutions disrupts the water hydrogen bond network and inhibits the formation of large water clusters - thus preventing extended aggregation behavior and encouraging local aggregation. Prior experimental observations of enhanced TODGA self-assembly under these conditions are attributed primarily to the role of water rather than co-extracted HNO$_3$, thus providing valuable new insight into the means by which extractant aggregation can be tuned within separations processes. The different roles of polar co-solutes, that derive from their individual hydrogen bonding capabilities and competitive interactions in the context of preferred solvation environments, is of fundamental importance amphiphile behavior in non-polar media.

These different distortions give rise to two crystallographically-distinct K-ion channels with different mobilities. Variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction measurements show that K-ion slides are the lowest-energy distortion mechanism at play, as they are the only distortion to be switched off with increasing temperature. Electrochemically, the material operates as a K-ion cathode with a high operating voltage, and an improved initial capacity relative to higher-vacancy PBA alternatives.

Alchemical binding free energies represent a promising approach for virtual screening as they naturally incorporate the key effects of water molecules, protein flexibility, and binding entropy.

This was achieved by developing a fast linescanning vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) hyperspectral imaging technique in combination with neural network analysis. Rapid VSFG imaging enables polarization resolved images on a single sheet level to be measured within a short time period, circumventing technical challenges due to long term optical setup instability. The polarization resolved hyperspectral images were then used to extract the supramolecular tilt angle of a self-assembly through a set of spectra-tilt angle relationships which were solved through neural network techniques. This unique combination of both novel techniques offers a new pathway to resolve molecular level structural knowledge of self-assembled materials. Understanding these properties can further drive self-assembly design from a bottom-up approach for applications in biomimetic and drug delivery researches.

In this work, we apply all-electron phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) utilizing multi-determinant trial wavefunctions to six metallocene complexes to compare the computed adiabatic and vertical ionization energies to experimental results.

It is established that introduction of tetravalent doping atoms (Zr, Ti, Sn and Si) significantly modifies the optical response of CeO2 in the visible range by shifting the absorption edge which also effects on the refractive index of the material. For these systems, the water contact angle has been computed through adsorption energy of water layers. We report the intrinsic hydrophilicity of the low-index surfaces of CeO2, which is enhanced by introduction of the impurity atom. Influence of the dopants on the oxygen vacancy formation energy E_f (V_O ) is considered and discussed with respect to its possible effect on the hydrophobic behavior of CeO2. It is found out that all the considered doping atoms reduce E_f (V_O ) , resulting in enhanced adsorption of the air hydrocarbons at the surface, which leads to an increased water contact angle.

We explore the length effect of the carbon chain on the photoisomerization of hydrazone switches using UV-vis spectroscopy and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). The conversion efficiency (photostationary state, PSS, after irradiation at 415 or 340 nm) of the isomerization of Cn HAT monolayers on Au rises with increasing length of the alkyl chain, with an optimum result for n-octyl (C8) thiolate or longer linkers. The low PSS415 of C3 HAT is attributed to strong quenching by the metal surface, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on a one-dimensional double-well model. The partial trap of photo-induced hot carriers in the excited states of C3 HAT in the potential well of Au reduces the lifetime of its excited states. Such calculation results provide insight into the detailed mechanism of surface quenching effect. Furthermore, UV-vis results suggest that after irradiation at 415 nm, Cn HATs cannot isomerize when bound to Ag; higher photon energies are necessary in this case.

The STING signaling pathway is also a prominent activator of cancer-killing T cells that initiates a powerful adaptive immune response. Since biomolecular signaling pathways are complicated and not easily identified through traditional experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) has often been used to study these biological pathways\u2019 structural and dynamical responses. Here, we carried out MD simulations for full-length chicken and human STING (chSTING and hSTING) proteins. Specifically, we investigated ligand-bound closed and ligand-unbound open forms of each STING in the membrane system by comparing conformational and dynamical differences among them. Our research provides clues for understanding the mechanism of the STING signaling pathway by uncovering some detailed insights for the examined systems: the residues from each chain in the binding pocket are strongly correlated to one another in the open STING structure compared with those in the closed STING structure. Ligand-bound closed STING displays approximately 170\u00b0 rotation of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) relative to the open-STING structure. The detailed dynamical analysis of residue Cys148 in the linker region of hSTING does not support the earlier hypothesis that Cys148 can form disulfide bonds between adjacent STING dimers. We also reveal that using the full-length proteins is critical as the MD simulations of the LBD portion only cannot properly describe the global conformational properties of multiple domain proteins, such as STING.", "date": "2022-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The conversion from one conformer to the other involves substantial enthalpy-entropy compensation: one conformer is energetically-favored and the other is entropically-favored. Here, we take a multi-scale quantum mechanical (QM) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) approach to reveal residue-specific sources of these differences in stability. QM reveals that the two benenodin-1 conformers involve distinct hydrogen bonding networks, with the enthalpically-favored conformer having more intra-peptide hydrogen bonds between Gln15 sidechain and nearby residues. Evaluation of configurational entropy over the MD-sampled geometries reveals that the entropically-favored conformer has enhanced conformational flexibility. By computing the by-residue-sum entropies, we identify the role of Gln15 and neighboring Glu14 in mediating the entropic variation during the switching process. These computational insights help explain the effects of Glu14Ala and Gln15Ala mutations on the conformational population of benenodin-1 observed experimentally.

We synthesized thin films using solutions containing methylammonium iodide (MAI), PbI2, and NiI2 with varying Pb/Ni precursor ratios. We show that MAPbI3 retains its three-dimensional perovskite structure in the presence of Ni2+. We were able to incorporate up to 30% Ni2+ before we note the appearance of unconverted NiI2 via X-ray diffraction. Although the structures of NiI2 and PbI2 are isostructural and the metal ions have the same oxidation states, the bulk material did not behave as a solid solution. Furthermore, the addition of Ni2+ thoroughly quenched the emission of MAPbI3, suggesting that Ni2+ may act as a recombination center for excited charge carriers. Additionally, the materials displayed significant instability towards water. Thus, we conclude that there is a limited application for nickel and perhaps other transition metal ions as a replacement ion for lead in thin-film perovskite photovoltaic devices fabricated in these conditions.", "date": "2022-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Thin Films; Solid State Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This work presents a study of factors influencing the wetting properties of ceria. For this, CeO2 thin films were deposited on substrates with different morphologies and characterized by means of XRD, SEM, XPS and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. The obtained results on wetting behavior were expanded using different organic materials on top of the CeO2 thin films to enhance their hydrophobicity. The achieved WCAs were compared with those from samples without ceria to find the effect of the material on the water repelling properties. The results revealed that all factors \u2013 the surface material, adsorbed organic molecules and surface texturization \u2013 modify the wetting properties of CeO2 thin films independently. This indicates that to achieve a superhydrophobic condition it is necessary to assess all the parameters which may control water behavior on the surface.", "date": "2022-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Processing; Thin Films", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

For a wide variety of inter-particle interactions, temperatures, and substrate types within the range of typical organic semiconductors and their processing conditions, we find remarkable universal scaling of the orientation at the interface with the free energy calculated from pair interactions between close-packed nearest neighbours and an empirically derived universal relationship between the entropy and the shape anisotropy and bulk volume fraction of the fluid particles. The face-on orientation of fluid particles at the solid interface is generally predicted to be the equilibrium structure, although the alignment can be controlled by tuning the particle shape and substrate type, while changing the strength of fluid--fluid interactions is likely to play a less effective role. At the vapour interface, only the side-on structure is predicted, and conditions for which the face-on structure may be preferred, such as low temperature, low interaction anisotropy, or low shape anisotropy, are likely to result in little orientation preference (due to the low anisotropy) or be associated with a phase transition to an anisotropic bulk phase for systems with interactions in the range of typical organic semiconductors. Based on these results, we propose a set of guidelines for the rational design and processing of organic semiconductors to achieve a target orientation at a solid or vapour interface.", "date": "2022-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

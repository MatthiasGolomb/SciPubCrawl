This study conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of CNF-reinforced bio-polyethylene (CNF-BioPE) as an alternative to conventional talc-reinforced polypropylene (Talc-PP). The CNF-BioPE was produced using the pulp direct kneading method, which simultaneously disintegrates pulp and disperses CNF into the polymer matrix, enabling industrial-scale feasibility. An LCA was conducted to compare the environmental performance of CNF-BioPE and Talc-PP. The study analyzed process inventories from raw material extraction to molding, including energy consumption during kneading and injection molding. The results indicated that scaling up CNF-BioPE production significantly reduces life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions because of improved process efficiency and energy savings. While laboratory-scale production showed higher emissions than Talc-PP, industrial-scale production reduced emissions to nearly half of those for Talc-PP. Additionally, incorporating low-carbon electricity further reduced LC-GHG emissions by up to 43%. The study also examined the effects of land use change (LUC) associated with biomass cultivation, revealing that variations in LUC scenarios significantly influenced overall emissions. Furthermore, optimizing cooling time during injection molding resulted in energy reduction of 24% at the process level, with a reduction of 4% across the product life cycle. These findings suggest that CNF-BioPE has the potential to outperform Talc-PP in environmental performance when process improvements and renewable energy are applied.

We find that OER activity increases with increasing cation size (TMAOH > KOH > NaOH > LiOH). Operando optical spectroscopy reveals that the energetics of the redox transitions and the population of redox-active species are independent of the electrolyte. Instead, the intrinsic turnover frequency varies strongly with the nature of the cation. LICT, SEIRAS, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations suggest that the interfacial solvent structure is the origin of this difference. With increasing cation size, the fraction of isolated water molecules and cation-coordinated water molecules increases, producing a more disordered interfacial environment. LICT measurements confirm that the potential of maximum entropy shifts closer to the water oxidation potential in the presence of larger cations in the electrolyte. We propose that a more disordered interface results in more isolated and reactive OH- ions and faster reorganization of the interfacial solvent structure during the rate-determining O-O bond formation step, thereby accelerating OER kinetics.

Among them, the anion exchange membrane (AEM)-based systems offer the advantage of direct gas-phase CO2 capture. Fundamentally driven by pH swing, an AEM-based eDAC system requires a reduction reaction to generate hydroxides for CO2 capture and an oxidation reaction to consume hydroxides for CO2 release. Coupling the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is preferable due to zero thermodynamic equilibrium voltage, facile kinetics, and non-oxidative electrochemical environment, leading to high energy efficiency and long lifetime. However, this pairing remained unrealized because HER is incompatible with oxygen in air. Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical H2-redox-mediated CO2 separator (eHCS) that incorporates an anion-conducting isolation membrane between the cathode and airflow, which blocks O2 access to the HER side while supporting back-diffusion of hydroxides for CO2 capture, and simultaneously enables internal hydrogen recycling to the HOR side for CO2 release. Once optimized, the eHCS shows a CO2 flux of 330 kg/m2/yr with an electricity usage of 1.08 MWh/tCO2 and minimal H2 loss.

Zirconium based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) have long been regarded as the most effective catalysts for CWA simulant hydrolysis, owing to the open Lewis acidic sites of their robust Zr6-oxo clusters. This performance established MOF-808 as the accepted state of the art and has remained unsurpassed for the past decade. The Zr6 clusters in MOFs that enable high activity also bind products too strongly, which poisons active sites and restricts turnover, creating an apparent performance ceiling. Herein, we introduce a generalizable node-engineering strategy that achieves Nb substitution of Zr within canonical Zr6 clusters, creating mixed metal Zr6-xNbx clusters rarely realized in MOFs. This approach is demonstrated across four archetypal Zr-MOFs (UiO-66, UiO-68, MOF-808, NU-1000) while preserving framework integrity and porosity. The resulting Zr/Nb-MOFs accelerate phosphoester hydrolysis by up to two orders of magnitude, with MOF-808-Zr/Nb delivering the fastest rates reported to date. Under continuous-flow operation, MOF-808-Zr/Nb maintains superior catalytic activity and durability at concentrations down to 1 ppm. These results establish Nb node engineering as a generic approach for creating next generation heterogeneous catalysts in environmental remediation and chemical defense.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Biodegradable Materials; Catalysts; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Photogenerated radical pairs (RPs) exhibit spin hyperpolarization even under ambient conditions, making them valuable for quantum information science (QIS) and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). However, most studies have focused on isolated molecules in dense matrices, limiting their applicability. Here, we propose a new approach for integrating RPs into a metal-organic framework (MOF) as higher-order assemblies, enabling regulated generation of spin polarization at specific spin sublevels. An electron acceptor (A), N,N'-Di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (DPNDI), was incorporated into MOF-525 (Zn) composed of an electron donor (D), Zn-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (ZnTCPP), yielding MOF-525 (Zn)-DPNDI. The dense packing of D-A pairs enables efficient quenching of the singlet excited state of ZnTCPP, leading to the regulated photophysical pathway to form strongly-coupled triplet radical pairs (TRPs) with selective T0 state spin polarization. TRPs exhibit narrower EPR spectra than triplet states generated via intersystem crossing (ISC), which offers significant advantages for enhancing spectral addressability in QIS and improving efficiency of polarization transfer in DNP. The rigid intercalating structure of D-A in MOF prevents the relaxation of T0 state spin polarization even in the presence of various guest solvents and its spin-lattice relaxation time is modulated by adsorbed guest molecules.

Here, we improve DNA surface immobilisation by combining surfaces treated with a plasma-activated coating (PAC) and DNA probe strands with simple chemical modifications. It was found that DNA immobilisation on PAC-treated 96-well plates is improved 3-fold by high-yield click-chemistry modification of DNA probes with a glycine-polyethylene glycol (Gly-PEG) linker.

In contrast, the low-performance electrolyte exhibited a more rigid microphase with fewer small clusters, restricting Li-ion transport mainly to the microphase. These variations alter the pathways for ionic conduction, implying that even when identical chemical species are used, changes in the constituent composition can result in minor modifications in the physical properties of the microphase, significantly altering the performance. This insight underscores a key consideration for electrolyte design, not only for lithium-sulfur batteries but also for other battery systems.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Solution Chemistry; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Central to the viability of AAM is the selection and integration of suitable energy storage and conversion technologies, which directly impact safety, endurance, cost, and scalability. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state and future prospects of batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells in the context of AAM applications. Batteries, particularly lithium-ion chemistries, are currently the most mature technology, enabling near-term demonstrations and certification efforts. However, their limitations in energy density, charging time, and thermal management restrict endurance and necessitate innovations in solid-state and lithium\u2013sulfur variants. Supercapacitors, though limited in energy capacity, offer unparalleled power density and rapid response, making them ideal for handling transient loads during take-off, landing, and regenerative braking. Fuel cells present a promising long-term solution, providing high specific energy and zero carbon emissions at the point of use. Yet, their adoption depends heavily on the establishment of scalable hydrogen production, storage, and refueling infrastructure. The review further highlights hybrid architectures that combine these technologies, such as battery\u2013supercapacitor and battery\u2013fuel cell systems, to exploit complementary advantages. Integration challenges, including thermal management, power electronics, and intelligent energy management systems, are analyzed alongside safety considerations and certification requirements. Case studies of ongoing demonstrators illustrate the diverse strategies being pursued globally. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges and future directions, emphasizing material innovations, infrastructure readiness, supportive policy frameworks, and a roadmap for next-generation AAM energy systems. The findings underscore that while battery-powered air taxis are poised for near-term deployment, the long-term sustainability of AAM will rely on hybrid solutions and breakthroughs in advanced materials and hydrogen technologies.

In this work, molecular dynamics simulations with coarse-grained models were applied to study the penetration of eight ionic liquids based on 1,3-dialkyl-imidazolium cation with different alkyl groups size into DPPC bilayers from both dilute and concentrate aqueous solutions. Potential of mean force calculations were performed to evaluate the thermodynamics of cation penetration, and graph theory was used to characterize their non-homogeneous distributions inside the bilayers.

Nevertheless, its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is severely limited by the very short hole diffusion length. To mitigate this limitation, we prepared nanostructured mesoporous CuWO4 photoanodes using the Pechini method, aiming to shorten the transport distance for photogenerated holes and enhance collection efficiency. The optimized mesoporous electrodes achieved a photocurrent of 0.6 mA cm\u20132 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, nearly an order of magnitude higher than benchmark compact films and among the highest values reported for CuWO4. However, the performance remains far below the theoretical limit, both in terms of photocurrent (lower by a factor of ~15) and maximum achievable photovoltage, with a photocurrent onset potential at ca. +0.6 V vs. RHE. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the low efficiency arises from severe bulk recombination and inefficient electron transport, as indicated by charge-separation efficiencies below 10% and electron collection lengths ~5 times shorter than the thickness required for optimal light harvesting. While electron transport might be partially improved by doping, fast recombination via deep ligand-field\u2013induced mid-gap states appears intrinsic to CuWO4.

Different from conventional CVD strategies where growth promoters and Mo sources are mixed, our strategy employs heterogeneous precursors where the two components are introduced separately, in two layers. Using this technique, the coverage ratio of monolayer MoS2 and device yield increased significantly using a cost-effective tube furnace with powder precursors. The growth mechanism was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing that the pre-deposition of growth promoters significantly lowers the formation energy for in-plane MoS2 growth.

Importantly, we demonstrate strategies for sampling and training to examples of anion radicals of these species, which often are not centered on any atom (off-center radicals, or OCRs). We additionally discuss well known limitations of Qeq-based charge equilibration in erroneously de-localizing charge, and test methods to alleviate the impact on resulting dynamics. Simulations using these models reveal new insights into electrolyte reduction and considerations for the realistic simulation of electron transfer processes in the condensed phase.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The concerted type (CPET) offers unique kinetic advantages but remains challenging to model quantitatively within theoretical and computational frameworks, owing to the interplay of multiple quantum mechanical (QM) factors such as proton\u2013electron nonadiabatic dynamics, anharmonic proton transfer (PT) potentials, and multimode vibronic coupling.  When applied to CPET, standard simulation frameworks such as the Multistate Continuum (MSC) and Marcus-Levich-Jortner (MLJ) theories typically treat all solute vibrations other than the transferring-proton mode classically and neglect Duschinsky (mode-mixing) effects. Herein, we present the vibration correlation function with effective anharmonicity (VCF-H) method, which extends the VCF formalism to systematically incorporate multidimensional vibronic coupling and Duschinsky transformations together with effective anharmonic corrections.  Applications to CPET model systems---the phenoxyl/phenol and thymine-acrylamide complexes---reveal that Duschinsky coupling between the transferring-proton motion and the donor-acceptor stretching mode, ignored in MSC/MLJ treatments, can enhance the predicted rate constants by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, comparison across hierarchical approximations to VCF-H demonstrates that classical treatments of non-PT vibrational modes can substantially underestimate rate-constant predictions, whereas the fully QM description retained in VCF-H exerts a substantial influence on them. These results establish VCF-H method as a streamlined and physically transparent framework for modeling CPET reactions, clarify its theoretical relationship to MSC/MLJ formulations, and highlight the critical role of multidimensional vibronic and Duschinsky effects in modeling CPET dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Density distributions reveal, that single-file water chains form in the narrow (10,0) CNT, pentagonal ring structures form in the intermediate (15,0) CNT, and a two-layer arrangement forms in the wider (20,0) CNT.  Angular distributions show that the influence of carbon polarization on water orientation grows with CNT diameter, accompanied by a pronounced tilt of water molecules toward the CNT wall.  Comparisons with the TIP4P/2005f model indicate that while this classical model captures structural trends, MB-pol affords a deeper description of interfacial water behavior by enabling direct simulations of infrared spectra from dipole trajectories and consistently accounting for polarization effects.  Finally, simulations of vertically aligned CNT arrays demonstrate that inter-tube interactions significantly impact water dynamics: in stacked (20,0) configurations, intermittent hydrogen-bond lifetimes decrease by 20-25% and layer residence times drop by up to 20% relative to isolated CNTs.

The goal is to understand an electronic excitation as the union of a primary orbital excitation to convert a closed shell ground state into an open shell excited state (defined by an intermediate frozen state that is free of polarization effects), with the secondary polarization or relaxation of other electron pairs (defined by the change from the frozen ROKS state to the final ROKS state). Our theory attaches energy changes and electron promotion numbers to each component, and also separates the relaxation process into separate occupied-to-virtual contributions ranked by significance using the OVOCV approach. In this way, our ROKS excitation EDA can yield chemical insights from the energetic contributions of relaxation processes and the accompanying charge redistribution that are not otherwise accessible.

Despite extensive experimental investigations, the apparent lifetime of the exciton-polariton is not well understood.  We examined the steady-state population dynamics for a Holstein-Tavis-Cumming Hamiltonian to illuminate the long-term polaritonic dynamics and lifetime of the exciton polariton in an optical cavity.  To enable a realistic description of polariton relaxation, cavity loss, and various exciton decay channels are included in the model.  We found that in the presence of weak but finite exciton loss, the apparent lifetime of the lower polariton coincides with the out-of-cavity exciton lifetime and is independent of cavity-matter detuning. This is a simple explanation for the experimentally observed lifetimes for exciton polaritons, and theoretically justifies the dark state reservoir hypothesis.  Further, if the upper polariton is initially populated, the system reaches the steady state very quickly, leading to single-exponential polariton relaxation. Starting from the lower polariton leads to a longer pre-steady-state time period, leading to double-exponential relaxation. Finally, we considered the effect of site orientational disorders and the exciton frequency disorderers. Under the collective limit, the effects of this disorder can be included in Fermi's golden rule population dynamics without explicit sampling. For the exciton energy disorders, numerical calculations are needed.

Free radical acrylate polymers that can crosslinked either by photochemical or thermal pathway are used under the same illumination conditions on gold nanotriangles. The objective is to disentangle between photoinduced and thermal polymerization using the same acrylate chemistry. In photochemical regime, local photopolymerization is observed at the apex of the nanotriangles with spatial control depending on the excitation polarization. For the thermal polymer, at moderate power, nanometer-sized polymer lobes are observed on the apexes of the triangle, their position depending also on the direction of polarization. At higher power, anisotropic melting of the gold within the gold nanotriangles was observed, also depending on incident light polarization. These results are compared with theoretical calculations using modified three-temperature model, to study the nanotriangle particles time and space heat distribution. This new methodology reveals that ultrafast (< 300 fs) energy exchange can occur between the nanoparticle and the surrounding medium before temperature homogenization within the nanoparticle.

This view has fostered a long-standing assumption\u2014reflected even in the IUPAC definition\u2014that temperature plays only a minor role in mechanochemical transformations. In this work, we challenge this assumption by systematically determining activation energies (Ea) of organic reactions under ball milling, resonant acoustic mixing (RAM), and solution conditions. Using the Diels\u2013Alder reaction between anthracene and maleic anhydride as a benchmark, we found significantly higher Ea values in the solid state (~25\u201329 kcal\u00b7mol-1) than in solution (~15 kcal\u00b7mol-1). A similar trend was observed for the Knoevenagel condensation, indicating that elevated activation barriers are a general feature of mechanochemical systems. Progressive addition of solvent revealed a continuum from neat grinding to solution behavior, with Ea decreasing systematically as liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) content increased. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that mechanochemical reactions are not less, but more strongly influenced by temperature than solution reactions.

Here, we deconstruct nanoreactors into elementary components and investigate representative configurations, to quantify their impacts on both effects and scalability of overlapping EDLs.

Cytochalasans represent a large class of actin-targeting natural products that are readily cell-permeable with varying cytotoxicity and actin-targeting capabilities in mammalian cells. Their pharmacologic exploitation not only requires an understanding of their mode of action but also exact knowledge of how they can be derivatized without affecting their bioactivity. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of five fluorescently labeled [11]cytochalasan derivatives generated from pyrichalasin H (PyriH) and 19,20-epoxycytochalasin C (EpoxyCytoC). Guided by molecular docking, we identified the C21-OAc moiety as a promising site for tag attachment without disrupting actin binding. Semi-synthetic modifications enabled the conjugation of different dyes to PyriH and EpoxyCytoC scaffolds. Moreover, the effect of linkers separating cytochalasans and dyes was analyzed. Biological evaluation supplemented by in vitro assays to additionally interrogate their activities on the assembly of pure actin filaments revealed distinct activity profiles. Together, this study compares permeability, cytotoxicity, and actin binding of five novel [11]cytochalasan probes bearing substitutions of the C21-OAc moiety. Our findings establish the C21-OAc position as a versatile functionalization site and provide a framework for developing next generation cytochalasan-based actin targeting probes.

We tuned the potential for interfacial hydrogen bonding based on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on the glass surface as well as the copolymer acrylate content. We characterized stiffness using a method that relies on the local environmental sensitivity of a fluorescent pyrene-based dye label covalently attached at trace levels to the polymer. The P(S/nBA) results fit qualitatively with conventional expectations. In the absence of glass-surface hydroxyl groups and interfacial hydrogen bonding, P(S/nBA) exhibits a stiffness gradient length scale of ~60 nm, which remains invariant with nBA content and reflects the influence of the glass substrate rigidity. In the presence of glass-surface hydroxyl groups and thus interfacial hydrogen bonding, the perturbation length scales increase with nBA content and thus hydrogen bonding. In contrast, with P(S/EHA) films, the perturbation length scales are independent of glass surface hydrophilicity, consistent with an inability of EHA units to undergo significant hydrogen bonding with glass-surface hydroxyl groups, but increase with EHA content and exceed those of P(S/nBA) films with similar Tg values. The latter results indicate that the combined effects of the density of interfacial van der Waals interactions and the strength of each interaction from ethylhexyl groups in perturbing stiffness in P(S/EHA) films exceed the effects of interfacial hydrogen bonds involving nBA units in P(S/nBA) films. Thus, the ethylhexyl groups in P(S/EHA) exhibit unusually effective van der Waals interactions with substrates, which is significant for the technological applications of related copolymers as pressure-sensitive adhesives.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Dyes and Chromophores; Thin Films; Organic Polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our findings delineate three ligand domains and their individual SAR profiles: the bicyclic guanidine core, a substituted aryl ring that engages the catalytic site, and a biaryl group that interacts with flanking residues. We further show that previously reported IGUANAs are metabolically labile and rapidly effluxed from intestinal epithelial cells. To address these pharmacological limitations, we have explored bioisosteres of the biaryl moiety and modifications of the bicyclic guanidine core. These investigations have yielded next-generation IGUANAs that retain nanomolar potencies against ALDH1B1 while achieving enhanced metabolic stability and functional specificity.

Similarly, these features are maintained when beveled or dual-bevel chisel-tip UMEs are prepared, which are highly desirable features for UMEs employed in intracellular recordings.

Although the formation of RNA foci has been identified as a common hallmark of repeat diseases, their properties, dynamics, and mechanisms underlying toxicity differ for each disease and remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy for the optical control of UGGAA repeat RNA foci, a pathological hallmark of spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31), based on the modulation of RNA-RNA interactions by a photoswitchable RNA-binding ligand, NCTA. In the presence of NCTA, UV irradiation induced the growth of UGGAA repeat RNA foci in cells. Subsequent visible light irradiation dissolved the structure into the original smaller RNA foci. Reversible photoisomerization between E- and Z-NCTA is responsible for the photocontrol of RNA foci, where Z-NCTA, produced upon UV light exposure, is the active species that stabilizes the association between UGGAAs. These changes were accompanied by alterations in the composition of RNA-binding proteins within the RNA foci, suggesting that NCTA modulates their properties and functions by remodeling RNA foci. Our photocontrol system enables the spatiotemporal manipulation of dynamic structures containing RNA scaffolds, including other disease-related repeat RNA foci and membraneless ribonucleoprotein organelles, and will be a valuable technique for investigating and regulating their dynamic behavior.", "date": "2025-10-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate three representative TGs with different chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation: trioctanoin (8:0), triolein (18:1), and trilinolenin (18:3). Our results qualitatively reproduced the experimental viscosity ordering, with 18:1 being the most viscous and 8:0 showing a slightly higher viscosity than 18:3. Neither the cohesive energy density, melting point correlation, nor molecular size could account for these differences. Likewise, single-molecule conformational statistics and mesoscale cluster morphologies revealed no decisive distinctions that explain the observed viscosity variations. Instead, structural analyses revealed that the local parallel alignment of C-chain segments produced junctions that formed extended network structures.

The DFT results show that the intra-monomer coherence affects the E band and the B band as the number of fused benzene rings increases. When two monomers are covalently linked, a new absorption band, the K band, appears due to inter-monomer coherence arising from conjugation between the monomers. For monomers with a smaller number of fused benzene rings, i.e. naphthalene and anthracene, the influence of coherence is particularly significant.

This limits rational materials design, as \"feature importance\" scores from standard ML models can mislead experimentalists into optimizing non-causal variables.We propose a framework to move from correlation to causation in high-dimensional HTE data. Our approach integrates Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) to estimate the unconfounded causal effect of each synthesis parameter, one at a time, while controlling for all other parameters as confounders. We then apply the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to the resulting p-values, enabling high-dimensional hypothesis testing with rigorous control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR).Through a comprehensive simulation study designed to mimic the p >> n and confounded data structure of HTE, we demonstrate our framework's utility. We show that baseline ML models (e.g., Lasso, Random Forest) consistently misidentify non-causal but confounded parameters as \"important.\" In contrast, our DML + FDR approach robustly recovers the true causal parameters and correctly rejects the confounded ones, maintaining the target FDR. This statistically-grounded framework provides a robust \"causal compass\" for experimental design. By identifying the sparse subset of parameters that truly control a material's properties, it offers a clear path to accelerating rational materials discovery and optimizing experimental resources.

To address these limitations, we present a generic algorithm designed to be compatible across diverse LFA platforms.

However, current quality standards primarily rely on measurements of total proanthocyanidins or broad polyphenol groupings, which fail to capture the biologically relevant OPC constituents. This gap in analytical precision, combined with existing regulatory practices, has led to a substantial mismatch between product labeling and actual efficacy, limiting both consumer trust and scientific reproducibility. In this study, we established and validated an RP-UPLC-UV\u2013based molecular-level quantification method capable of simultaneously and accurately determining six key OPC components. Systematic analysis of 14 raw materials and five commercial supplements revealed striking variability in active molecules across samples. The results reveal that gallic acid ranged from 0.005\u20131.244%, catechin from 0.025\u20132.513%, epicatechin from 0.035\u20132.063%, and epigallocatechin gallate from 0.003\u20130.163%.

Thus, we propose an OPC-centered molecular coordinate system as a novel quality evaluation framework, enabling a paradigm shift from bulk quantification to precise molecular-level control of GSE.

Proposals have been made that polymer chain uniformity may be advantageous in reducing stochastics due to spatial inhomogeneities, and it is this aspect of the radiolysis examined in this work. We have simulated the initial sub-picosecond stages of the imaging process for a series of photoresist films that are identical in composition but vary in their polymer chain structures. We use detailed, physically accurate stochastic reaction-diffusion calculations to evaluate the influence of defined sequence and random copolymer structures on radiolytic spur formation, i.e. a cluster of species formed by electron-polymer interactions that defines the initial spatial characteristic of the imaging process. Predictions of electron thermalization in the present work are shown to be consistent with the literature, indicating that our overall computational approach for ultrafast, nanoscale processes is sound.

Stimuli-responsive systems that are controlled by, for example, light, pH, redox, enzymes or membrane potential offer the potential for targeted activation that is essential for therapeutic applications. Photo-activation of ion transport is particularly advantageous because of the possibility of achieving spatio-temporal control, remote ad-dressability, and reduced cytotoxicity. However, poor tissue penetration and undesired cytotoxicity are significant drawbacks to the photo-activated ionophores reported to date which are mostly triggered by UV or violet light. Here, we report BODIPY-based photo-responsive ion transport systems that are activated with 730 nm NIR light that falls in the biological window. The caged anionophores utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of a 4-hydroxyisophthalamide motif. Caging of the hydroxyl group of the active aniono-phore with BODIPY-photocages that are responsive to NIR light locks the amide proton through six-membered intramolecular hydro-gen bonding, rendering it unavailable for anion recognition and transport. Decaging with NIR irradiation reverses the hydrogen bond-ing pattern to switch on binding, with efficient off-on activation profiles observed in anion transport experiments in large unilamellar vesicles. Analogous experiments in cancer cells with NIR light revealed turn-on transmembrane chloride transport and a dramatic, dose-dependent decrease in cell viability following NIR decaging of the anionophore, demonstrating the potential for NIR-triggered ionophores as a new class of photodynamic therapy for cancer.

Studies on inter-ligand restraints are largely limited to the lanthanide contraction and the \u2018Gadolinium Break\u2019. In this work, we expand on inter-ligand restraints in a series of lanthanides, from large (La3+) to small (Yb3+), and solvents from small (H2O) to bulky (tBuOH) by means of X-ray total scattering, density-functional theory (DFT), optical spectroscopy and multiconfigurational computational methods.

This is rationalized via DFT by a decrease in coordination number counteracting the inherent increase in Ln-O bond distance as solvent bulk is increased, resulting in no changes in the average Ln-O bond distance being observed in experiment. These results are confirmed by qualitative shifts in spectral shape from absorption and luminescence spectroscopy and by direct comparison with simulated optical spectra for Yb3+.

Here, this study challenges this fundamental assumption through a comprehensive statistical analysis of 2,649 quantum-chemically optimized molecular complexes spanning hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-stacking, and dispersion interactions. Using the Kulkarni-NCI Fingerprint (KNF), a physics-informed 9-dimensional descriptor, we systematically deconstructed the relationship between molecular architecture and three distinct stability metrics: local interaction quality (SNCI), global binding energy, and electrostatic interactions (SCDI).

These comparisons demonstrate that the bath-orbital relaxation in GBCI is crucial for accurately describing both the energies and wavefunctions of charge-transfer states. For L-edge XAS, GBCI accounts for the core-hole relaxation neglected in SF-CAS, leading to a uniform energy shift across the spectral bands. For 2p3d RIXS, GBCI produces an energy shift in the charge-transfer band that corrects the overestimated energy in SF-CAS. Moreover, GBCI improves the wavefunctions of charge-transfer states, thereby correcting the RIXS intensities overestimated by SF-CAS.

We demonstrate the validity and generality of the principle through two distinct examples: (i) the vapor-liquid transition of argon in the canonical ensemble, and (ii) the crystallization of sodium chloride from solution under compositional confinement.  In both cases, thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are extracted from a small set of molecular dynamics simulations and used to compute absolute nucleation rates in excellent agreement with established computational and experimental results.  This work establishes CEP as a powerful and unifying framework for predicting nucleation rates from unbiased equilibrium simulations with minimal computational effort.", "date": "2025-10-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Processes; Statistical Mechanics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The Wittig synthesis yielded 90% of the cis-isomer of A-1. This study examines the cis-selectivity of stilbenes observed with mono-, di-, and trisubstituted benzaldehydes and phosphonium bromides. Substituents considered include alkoxy, alkyl, halo, and trifluoromethyls. In mono-substituted systems, a C-2 methoxy or C-2 bromo-benzaldehyde combined with an unsubstituted phosphorane typically results in approximately 70% cis-stilbene, while bulky alkoxy groups reverses the selectivity. The 2,2\u2019-disubstituted stilbene system, featuring C-2 substituents on both the benzaldehyde and the benzyl phosphorane, achieves 90\u201396% cis-selectivity, with steric bulk at C-2 on either or both reactants increase selectivity, even at the ambient temperature. These findings indicate that the steric factors primarily influence the high selectivity, not the electronic effects. For highly substituted combretastatin-type stilbene systems, 2,3,4-trialkoxybenzaldehyde determines cis-selectivity, and symmetrical 3,4,5-trimethoxy benzyl phosphorane enhances this effect. Additionally, 2-methoxy-5-iodo benzaldehyde alone governs the cis-selectivity regardless of benzyl phosphoranes used. In this case, the high cis-selectivity appears to result mainly from the iodo group, although the specific mechanism in not fully understood. These results are exemplified with 54 examples.

PEM degradation is commonly attributed to radical attacks initiated by Fenton reactions, where hydrogen peroxide reacts with transition-metal cations to produce radicals. These can chemically degrade the ionomer, deteriorating proton transport. Ex situ Fenton tests expose membranes to high concentrations of Fe^(2+) and H_2 O_2 to mimic years of chemical damage in days, but the harsh conditions can yield degradation pathways differing from those in operation. To investigate these discrepancies, long- and short side chain PEMs were examined under ion-exchange Fenton conditions. A multi-technique approach linked chemical, morphological, and functional changes across multiple length scales to underlying mechanisms. Results indicate chemical degradation occurs without significant preferential bond cleavage, suggesting uniform polymer breakdown, where the rate depends on the polar side chain structure. In contrast, morphological degradation, previously attributed to radical attack, originates from internal oxygen accumulation via secondary Fenton reactions. These insights underline the limitations of conventional ex situ protocols and establish guidelines for more realistic accelerated degradation tests for PEMs and related polymer electrolytes.

Modern CADD (Computer Aided Drug Design) methodologies, incorporating both ligand-based and structure-based approaches, offer valuable guidance for the design of novel PI3K\u03b1 inhibitors. Benzoxazepine and thiazole derivatives were investigated through a combination of molecular dynamics, ensemble docking, and 3D-QSAR (Three-Dimensional Quantitative Structure\u2013Activity Relationship) studies to identify structural features critical for PI3K\u03b1 activity and selectivity over PI3K\u03b2, PI3K\u03b3, and PI3K\u03b4. Subsequently, scaffold-hopping and R-group replacement were applied to design structurally diverse, potentially selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibitors with these defined characteristics. A structure-based virtual screening protocol was also implemented to identify new moieties with selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibitory potential. The study defined new chemotypes capable of binding to \u03b1Val851 in the hinge region, crucial for PI3K\u03b1 inhibition, including chromeno[3,4-d]imidazole, 2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine, and quinoline derivatives. Additional substructures binding to the hydrophobic region, particularly \u03b1Gln859, contributed to isoform selectivity as shown by 3D-QSAR predictions.

Achieving this requires imaging platforms capable of resolving both structural evolution and chemical specificity, non-invasively and in real time. Digital off-axis holography (DOAH) has emerged as a powerful, label-free technique for high-resolution quantitative phase imaging for monitoring chemical changes in solution and at solid\u2013liquid\u2013gas interfaces. However, DOAH inherently lacks chemical specificity, limiting their applicability to distinguish ionic species or map compositional gradients. Recent developments in multimodal holography combining DOAH with spectroscopic modalities such as fluorescence or Raman offer chemically sensitive imaging capabilities, but introduce challenges in data fusion, temporal synchronization, and computational throughput. In parallel, artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping DOAH with state-of-the-art models combining physics-based modules with data-driven neural networks to deliver fast and interpretable reconstructions. Here, we present a conceptual framework for intelligent multimodal holography that leverages physics-informed machine learning to enable sparse, adaptive acquisition and real-time chemical-structural inference. Collectively, these developments open new possibilities for employing DOAH in situ imaging across chemical separations and interfacial science.

However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding how coordination environments evolve under realistic operating conditions and how that affects their ability to participate in chemical and physical processes. This study used infrared spectroscopy to investigate the effect of thermal chemical preprocessing on the 13CO adsorption capacity of 0.034 wt.% Pd/CeO2 to yield monomeric palladium carbonyl complexes. While the (13CO) band frequency of the monomer was only slightly responsive to thermal chemical preprocessing, the monomer density spanned an order-of-magnitude. The breadth of the monomer density suggests that single-atom coordination environments are better described as a distribution that can be systematically manipulated to control chemical processes as opposed to static, uniform active sites. Changes in the Pd coordination ensemble, manifested as changes in the monomer density, represented distinct metastable states that were accessed through specific thermal chemical histories. The dependence of the coordination ensemble on thermal chemical history led to different monomer densities under identical experimental conditions. This observation revealed that thermal chemical preprocessing is non-deterministic and that the Pd coordination ensemble is kinetically controlled rather than thermodynamically determined. This work establishes a methodology that uses molecules as both sensitive diagnostics and synthetic tools to direct material properties. The ability to reversibly control coordination distributions opens new pathways for catalyst design and provides fundamental insights into the dynamic nature of atomically dispersed metals.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Kinetics; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, a 3D reaction-diffusion model was developed to explore the effects of electrode surface area and local geometry on the performance of a heterogeneous catalyst that performs a two-step CO2 reduction cascade reaction to CO and then methanol under aqueous conditions. Kinetic parameters for the model were directly motivated by experimental results that used carbon electrodes functionalized with cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) catalysts. 3D architectures composed of arrays of square pillars with varying dimensions and either smooth or periodically modulated surfaces were tested, revealing the extent to which geometry modulates the performance of the cascade reactions. Surprisingly, the model illustrates that electrochemically-active surface area, regardless of electrode geometry, is the primary factor dictating the overall cascade reaction yield. Moreover, the results suggest that supersaturation of CO, with concentrations up to ten-fold higher than the equilibrium solubility limit, is critical for more efficient conversion to methanol. For any given geometry, the spatially averaged ratio of [CO] to [CO\u2082] is dictated by the electrochemically active surface area and determines the yield of methanol. For a fixed surface area, geometries that spatially confine the electrolyte yield moderate local [CO] to [CO\u2082] ratios within small volumes. In contrast, less confining geometries result in a broader distribution of local ratios spread over larger volumes with both configurations yielding the same spatially averaged [CO] to [CO\u2082] ratio.

In a combinatorial sense, there exists an immense number of specific IL-solvent combinations. An exhaustive experimental or even simulation based-investigation of the chemical space spanned by such combinations can be\nextremely time-consuming, expensive, and nearly  impossible. An alternative approach is to employ machine-learning (ML) based models developed from existing databases. Although there exists prior literature that integrates machine learning to investigate mixtures of a specific solvent with ILs, these models lack generalization necessitating development of a large number of ML models to handle various solvents. To remedy this shortcoming, as a part of designing green electrolytes with high ionic conductivity that can have potential applications in next generation batteries and solar cells, this work aims to develop a unified ML model to predict ionic conductivity of any IL-solvent mixture system. In this regard, three models, namely, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network were formulated using a diverse dataset curated from the NIST ILThermo database. The dataset contained 549 unique ILs from 16 cation families, 81 unique solvents, representing a total of 23691 datapoints. SHAPLEY additive explanation (SHAP) method was used to assess the impact of various features on model prediction and their significance was compared with literature to gain physical insight about the model behavior. Finally, using the developed models approximately 2.5 million ILsolvent\nmixtures at five different compositions were screened at room temperature.

Organic cations, with their molecular tunability, provide a powerful platform for systematically probing these effects. Here, we leverage phosphonium-based geminal di-cations to control interfacial cation arrangement and identify the variables that most strongly influence catalytic rates. As a case study, we examine CO2 reduction (CO2R) to CO over polycrystalline silver electrodes in dry aprotic acetonitrile. Through a combination of rotating disk electrode measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, we decouple the effects of cation\u2013electrode distance and interfacial cation density on catalytic rates. We find that smaller, more densely packed cations induce stronger interfacial electric fields, which lower the activation barrier for CO2 adsorption and increase reaction rates. Using geminal phosphonium di-cations, we demonstrate that both the vertical and lateral positioning of organic cations within the electrical double layer independently influence reactivity. These results demonstrate that electrolyte cation identity primarily influences electrocatalytic kinetics by determining how efficiently charge can be arranged at the electrocatalytic interface.

However, the prebiotic selection favoring D-ribose over L-ribose remains a fundamental unresolved question.

At present, it is unclear how these fractions interact with each other at the aqueous surface. Here, we study the surface structure of alcohols (butanol and octanol) at a range of concentrations and in the presence of different simple salts, using surface tension and sum-frequency- generation spectroscopy. Using these techniques we characterise the surface coverage and structure across the solubility range of both organics. We find that the presence of ions does not affect organic surface coverage for these systems, but has a distinct impact on the hydrogen bond structure. This restructuring of the subsurface hydrogen bond network is more pronounced for octanol.

In solutions, they show polarity-dependent solvatochromism, with emissions ranging from 500 to 600 nm. Importantly, their luminescence persists even in restrictive environments, such as crystalline, aggregated states, mechanically treated solids, and solid polymer matrices (PMMA). This durable condensed-phase luminescence results from their non-planar structure, particularly the ortho-substituted acceptor and propeller-shaped donor components, which effectively hinder harmful H-type stacking interactions linked to aggregation-induced quenching (AIQ), leaning more toward characteristics similar to aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Crystallographic data and theoretical calculations confirm the presence of twisted biaryl D-A fragments with D-A angles of 41-45\u00b0, a structural feature vital for preventing efficient solid-state stacking.

The deacetylation process is generally incomplete and produces random distributions of acetylated and deacetylated units with significant variability in chain composition, which makes it difficult to understand the relation between polymer structure and properties. In principle, molecular simulations can aid in such task. However, atomistic simulations are computationally costly, and therefore generally limited to systems containing few short chains, while real materials often contain hundreds or thousands of repeating units. To extend the scope of simulations and further explore the properties of chitosan, we developed a coarse-grained model compatible with the Martini 3 force field. This model accurately captures variations in the degree of acetylation and protonation states, enabling simulations of fully deacetylated chitosan, chitin, and intermediate forms. The model reproduces key structural properties of chitosan chains in solution, captures chitosan's pH-dependent self-assembly behavior, and its interactions with lipid monolayers, highlighting distinct affinities for zwitterionic and anionic lipids, as well as its ability to bind to proteins.

To address this, we investigated the direct and indirect photolysis of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons in a model petroleum system in hydrophobic solvents. Photosensitizers (phenalenone, tetracene, xanthone, naphthol, and anthraquinone) and quenchers (furfuryl alcohol, sorbic acid, and DABCO) were used to probe reactive pathways. The effects of solvent type and oxygen saturation were also examined. Results indicated that PAHs with fewer than three rings exhibited limited direct photoreactivity due to minimal the solar absorption, whereas three- or more- ring PAHs were photoreactive. Alkylation substantially increased direct direct photolysis rates for anthracene, pyrene, and benzo(a)pyrene. For anthracene and 9-methylanthracene, oxygenation state did not affect direct photolysis, suggesting oxygen plays a minor role under the tested conditions. Except for 9-methylanthracene, photosensitizers markedly enhanced photolysis of most three-ring or larger PAHs, and this effect was suppressed by singlet oxygen quenchers, confirming the role of reactive oxygen species. Saturated and monoaromatic hydrocarbons showed no indirect photoreactivity. For indirect photolysis, reduced oxygen saturation decreased photolysis for anthracene, methyl pyrene, and methyl benzo[a]pyrene, while other compounds were unaffected. Methyl substitution produced position-specific effects across PAHs, leading to variable photoreactivity. The findings of this study highlight the complexity of PAH photodegradation that occur in an oil film, with multiple co-occurring direct and indirect pathways that can be highly substrate- and oxygen-dependent.

Conventional formulations, while offering some moisturization, are plagued by poor slip, a heavy and greasy sensory profile, and chronic physical instability leading to phase separation and pigment dulling. The scope of this work was to investigate and harness a novel phenomenon\u2014irreversible thermal transformations in silicone polymers\u2014to engineer a next-generation lip gloss that transcends these limitations. The project was conducted within a rigorous scientific and regulatory framework, adhering to both Egyptian (ES 5568/2006) and European (EC 1223/2009) cosmetic safety standards, and involved 478 systematically designed experiments to validate its core hypotheses.  Key Findings and Conclusions  The investigation yielded several groundbreaking findings that establish a new frontier in lip product development:  1. Discovery of Irreversible Thermal Transformation: The research provides robust experimental evidence that specific silicone polymers, notably dimethiconol, undergo a permanent structural reorganization when subjected to controlled high-temperature processing (exceeding 110\u00b0C) in a lipid-containing medium. This is not a mere viscosity change but a fundamental molecular shift from a viscous liquid state to a solid yet highly elastic, rubber-like network. This transformation, indicative of thermally-induced cross-linking, creates an entirely new material class with hybrid properties. 2. Unprecedented Performance Enhancement: The optimized silicone-based formulation, a direct result of this thermal processing, demonstrated a 12-fold improvement in slip performance compared to conventional lipid systems. Quantitative rheological analysis confirmed a final slip coefficient of 0.07-0.09, contrasting sharply with the 0.80-0.90 typical of lipid-based benchmarks. This translates to a silky, non-occlusive, and lightweight application experience, directly overcoming the primary sensory drawback of incumbent products. 3. Superior Physical and Temporal Stability: The newly formed silicone network exhibited exceptional physical integrity. When subjected to accelerated stability testing via clinical centrifugation (3500 RPM for 3 minutes)\u2014a condition that separates lipid systems in seconds\u2014the formulation resisted any phase separation. Long-term stability assessments projected a shelf life exceeding 12 months, resolving the critical issue of product failure that afflicts lipid architectures. 4. Validation of a Multi-Material Integration Strategy: The research successfully demonstrated that precise thermal and shear processing enables the creation of an integrated functional network from seemingly incompatible materials. This allowed for the combination of the superior slip and stability of silicones with the moisturizing efficacy of lipids (lanolin and ceramides), resulting in a sophisticated multi-layer architecture on the lip.  In conclusion, this work successfully bridges the critical gap between cosmetic elegance and high performance. It presents a scientifically-validated, platform technology for developing lip products that offer unparalleled sensory attributes, radical stability, and measurable efficacy, positioning them as a definitive advancement over existing market offerings.", "date": "2025-10-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Coating Materials; Elastic Materials; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

After proving its suitability, the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set is used to find the electronic and optical properties of biphenyl at various dihedral angles. It is determined that the twisting of the central C \u2013 C bond has a significant effect on the UV spectra of biphenyl, with the shape and \u03bbmax being affected. There is little electron/hole coherence when the dihedral angle exceeds 45o. with the dihedral angle greater than 45o, (i.e. lesser or no coherence), there is a consistent blue-shifting of the \u03bbmax and an increased HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Furthermore, the decrease in HOMO energy with increasing dihedral angle is due to reduced electronic repulsion between the two benzene dimers at larger angles.

However, a stable, low-cost, and energy-efficient method of separating MCFAs from other microbial products, including alcohols and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), remains a challenge. The main proposed methods rely on organic solvents to extract MCFAs, leading to toxicity, cost, and processing challenges. In this work, we explore the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes for robust and selective solvent-free extraction of MCFAs. We first performed fundamental transport experiments with model PDMS films, finding that PDMS membranes have high MCFA permeabilities and high selectivity of MCFAs over SCFAs (e.g., a selectivity of 230 \u00b1 46 for octanoic acid over acetic acid), comparable to solvent-based extractions. As PDMS can easily be formed as thin selective layers on porous supports, we then modeled the performance of PDMS-based selective layers of various thicknesses. A preliminary techno-economic assessment showed favorable economics for PDMS membranes compared to competing extraction technologies because of PDMS stability, simple implementation, and solvent-free nature. Commercial PDMS hollow fiber modules were then tested with synthetic MCFA solutions, showing robust separations with high selectivities matching the model films, albeit with lower than expected permeabilities. Last, we suggest an overall process design that could incorporate PDMS-based extraction. This work demonstrates a new path for the attainable selective separation and extraction of MCFAs, using commercially available membrane materials and/or fabrication techniques that are scalable to the industrial level.", "date": "2025-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Recent pump\u2013probe experiments interpret two peaks in the structure factor S(q) during and after decompression of high-density liquid (HDL) as evidence of coexistence with low-density liquid (LDL). However, this interpretation presents a fundamental puzzle: such coexistence is implausible at ambient pressure, below the estimated location of the liquid\u2013liquid critical point (LLCP). Here we use decompression simulations with ML-BOP to reconcile this contradiction. Even when water decompresses along the LLT, S(q) retains a single peak because HDL and LDL domains remain nanoscopic. We explain the two-peak S(q) observed experimentally as a single evolving liquid peak superimposed to a static high-density amorphous (HDA) background. The simulations reveal that the decisive LLT signature is a transient growth and decay of the apparent correlation length  at low q, which emerges only when decompression proceeds along the LLT and then Widom line, with maximum  near the LLCP. Importantly,  remains low when decompressing from Tc or above, or too rapidly.

A library of five amphiphilic block copolymers bearing increasing densities of DASA moieties was synthesized and self-assembled into vesicular membranes.

Here, we investigate the electrochemical reduction of AgCrSe2 and CuCrSe2 in non-aqueous Li- and Na-ion electrolytes using electrochemical measurements coupled with ex situ characterization (scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy).

Using a hierarchy of approximations \u2013 coarse-grained molecular simulations, self-consistent mean-field and a simple phenomenological model \u2013 we investigated the uptake of model ampholytic solutes into polyanionic brushes across varying pH, salt concentrations, pKa values and peptide sequences. In a narrow pH range on the wrong side of pI, charge regulation enables uptake of the ampholytes by inducing charge inversion, so that they become positively charge in the brush despite being negatively charged in the bulk. This charge inversion can be calculated from the pH difference between the brush and the bulk, related to the Donnan potential. It is strongest for ampholytes with small differences between acidic and basic pKa values and decreases with increasing salt. Our phenomenological model reproduces universal effect of charge regulation promoting ampholyte uptake into brushes, but fails to be quantitative. Mean field model is close to explicit simulations for alternating sequences but fails to describe the effect of charge patchiness, which is only captured by explicit simulations. Thus, our phenomenological framework offers a practical rule of thumb for estimating uptake from experimentally accessible parameters without sophisticated calculations.

Directly applying theoretical and data-driven approaches developed for solvents to these media is often challenging due to their complexity and limited experimental data. Linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs) using Abraham solute descriptors have achieved significant success in describing environmentally relevant partitioning systems. Yet, limited availability of high-quality experimental descriptors, particularly for structurally complex compounds, hinders their practical application and constrains the accuracy of descriptor prediction models. Here, we propose a four-parameter LSER (4SD-LSER) employing widely used logarithmic n-hexadecane\u2013air, n-octanol\u2013water and air\u2013water partition coefficients and topological McGowan molar volume as solute descriptors. To assess performance, we compiled 1,836 experimental partition coefficients for 792 neutral compounds across 12 representative environmentally relevant systems. The 4SD-LSERs were calibrated and demonstrated good descriptive performance for these systems. Remarkably, when combined with appropriate fragment- or machine learning-based descriptor predictive models, the 4SD-LSER achieves prediction errors largely within \u00b10.5 log units for structurally simple compounds, and within \u00b11.0 log unit for more complex compounds (e.g., pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and flame retardants), reaching state-of-the-art accuracy.

A clear trend emerges in which aryl endgroups with bulkier alkyl ortho-substituents offer more persistent [n]cumulenes. The enhanced stability is consistent with combination of steric shielding and disrupted electronic communication between the endgroups and cumulenic framework. Kinetically stabilized odd [n]cumulenes of the series [n]otBu (n is an odd integer, n = 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) are successfully synthesized. The longest derivatives, [11]otBu and [13]otBu, are studied in solution, and the electronic absorption properties are compared experimentally and computationally with polyynes. The terminal alkylidene groups of [n]cumulenes have significant effects on the optical properties and result in the observation of an additional optical state, S1, relative to oligoynes. Access to the S1 state in [n]cumulenes gives a lower fundamental optical energy gap (Eg) relative to oligoynes, although the intensity of S1 decreases as a function of length as the molecules transition from D2h to D\u221eh symmetry. The highest energy state of [n]cumulenes (S4) is fully allowed by symmetry at any length and shows a remarkable similarity to the analogous absorptions of polyynes. At infinite length, this state would be expected to dominate the spectra of both polyynes and cumulenes.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This behavior leads to oscillations in the dissolution profile and a generally poor fit to the Noyes-Whitney (N-W) equation.  Conversely, larger particles (e.g., r = 60 \u00c5), which are predicted to be thermodynamically stable per CNT, are more likely to exhibit classical N-W kinetics on the timescale of nanoseconds.  In either case, crystallinity is lost very rapidly, within the first ~ 20 ps of simulation time, due to water intrusion into the lattice.  For consistency, single-particle dissolution kinetics are investigated at similar concentrations (ibuprofen/water ~17% w/w).  Because saturation is expected in the long-time limit due to the poor water solubility of the drug, only the first 10 ns of dissolution time is used to quantitatively assess the kinetics where sink conditions are expected.  The H-bonding count between all molecules in each frame of the output MD trajectory is used as a surrogate measure of the extent of ibuprofen dissolution at each point in time, recognizing that it does not distinguish between particle swelling and the dissociation of ibuprofen molecules (or groups of molecules) from the particle surface.  While larger particles appear to obey N-W kinetics, our simulations demonstrate they prefer to form and maintain interior pockets of water on the time scale of our simulations rather than to dissolve completely in the traditional sense of that equation.  This finding could have implications on the biorelevant dissolution behavior of poorly water-soluble drugs and studies of drug delivery mechanisms of nanocrystals.

Although a number of methods for the preparation of AgBiS2 nanocrystals have been reported, there remains an ongoing need to develop improved controllable routes to size-tunable AgBiS2 nanomaterials without the presence of impurity phases. Here, we have expanded on the development of AgBiS2 nanocrystal synthesis using N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate complexes of Ag+ and Bi3+ as single-source precursors in oleylamine (OLA), establishing it as a reliable approach to high-purity and highly crystalline AgBiS2 nanomaterials. While a degree of size tunability could be achieved by tuning the reaction temperature, we found that adding dodecanethiol (DDT) to the reaction mixture dramatically decreased the precursor decomposition temperature and resulting nanocrystalline domain size. To understand the mechanism by which addition of thiol affects the precursor decomposition, in situ variable temperature NMR was employed in combination with DFT calculations, finding that the combination of DDT and OLA turns on acid-catalyzed pathways for dithiocarbamate transamidation with OLA, ultimately inducing low-temperature C-S bond cleavage. In addition to providing new routes to size-tunable AgBiS2 nanocrystals, these studies therefore provide potentially general insights regarding how the decomposition of dialkyldithiocarbamate complexes can be controlled and tuned.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In conformer generation and geometry optimization, the complexity of the conformer space arises from the underlying torsion-angle distributions, which, in the case of force fields and some in silico conformer generators like ETKDG, are derived from accumulated torsion profiles for a predefined set of torsion motifs (termed \"torsion motif angle distributions\", TMADs). Comparative studies of conformer generation and global optimization algorithms often neglect that the TMADs are sensitive to the environment they are extracted from, leading to comparisons of conformational ensembles and minimum-energy conformations from e.g. crystal versus vacuum environments. Here, we present a large-scale comparative study of TMADs across di\ufb00erent environments, namely crystal, vacuum, water, and hexane. Our results show that the e\ufb00ects in the di\ufb00erent environments, such as solvent-solute interactions in water and hexane, and packing e\ufb00ect in the crystal, produce strikingly distinct torsion distributions for most of the selected torsion motifs.

Since experimental measurements and first-principles simulations are time-consuming, machine learning (ML) based on existing high-fidelity data  is a fast alternative. In this contribution, we present a general ML framework for automated learning of Graph Neural Network (GNN) ensembles for predicting redox potentials of Fe complexes and quantifying the corresponding uncertainty.  Using a recently reported high-fidelity dataset of transition metal complexes by Janet et al. [ACS Cent. Sci. 2020, 6, 4, 513\u2013524], we leverage the DeepHyper hyperparameter optimization framework to optimize the hyperparameters of a user-defined GNN model to obtain a large set of high performing models in an automated way.  Through nested cross-validation, we show an improvement in single model prediction performance of 19% over Baseline. Further, this set of candidate models is used to generate model ensembles. We demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance in comparison to a single best-performing GNN model (improvement of 18%) and also over a varied set of ML model classes applied to a standard benchmark.  Overall improvement as a consequence of using the GNN ensemble over the Baseline stands at 32%. Further, the proposed framework offers insights into the confidence of model predictions through epistemic uncertainty measures.  In fact, we demonstrate that through effective uncertainty quantification, our framework can be used to identify molecular structures and attributes that significantly affect model performance, particularly in  challenging datasets with complex ligand environments.

Scavenger experiments confirmed that TCN generates singlet oxygen (\u00b9O\u2082) as the dominant oxidant, while TCN transformation products, particularly quinones, sustained photoreactivity over time. Application of the system to mixtures of hydrocarbons and crude oil showed that only larger PAHs (\u22653 rings) underwent significant, sensitizer\u2011enhanced loss, indicating that indirect photooxidation via \u00b9O\u2082 dominated over direct photolysis. In contrast, monoaromatics, naphthalenes, and saturated compounds remained stable under the studied conditions; after a spill, these compounds would instead be expected to undergo other weathering processes such as biodegradation, evaporation, or dissolution. In a complementary set of experiments, replacing TCN with crude oil as a sensitizer mirrored the degradation pattern observed in the TCN-based system, validating the role of indirect pathways in petroleum.

The design of electrolytes that are more robust against degradation and, thus, unlock longer-term high voltage cycling would decisively benefit from detailed knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms that commercial solvents can undergo upon oxidation. To this end, simplified single-salt, single-solvent formulations of LiClO4 and LiPF6 in dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylene carbonate (EC), or ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)) were anodically electrolyzed on inert electrodes and monitored for extended periods of time using 1H, 13C, 19F, and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The controlled environment of the experiments coupled to the unique sensitivity of NMR unveiled novel metastable intermediates and the formation of branching networks of products with widely varying amounts and temporal evolution. Oxidation of the pristine solvent primarily proceeds through a radical pathway that also produces highly reactive protons, but faces competition from a second pathway involving a radical carbocation intermediate. In all cases, the intermediates undergo a variety of different chemical degradation pathways that can also intersect with each other. The resulting network of reactions represents a significant increase in complexity of experimental descriptions in the literature, yet, critically, it helps explain the wide range of products typically identified in electrolyte oxidation studies.

Although first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), provide valuable insight into reaction free energies and rate constants, they commonly use idealizing assumptions. As an alternative, this study demonstrates the estimation of the rate constants of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from electrochemical impedance measurements of a photo-electrochemical cell with a hematite anode, providing insight into the rate constants directly from measurements. Estimation is conducted using maximum likelihood estimation, minimizing the weighted error between a microkinetic model of the OER and measurements at multiple frequencies and potentials. In this way, a single set of rate constants is obtained that is optimized for multiple potentials simultaneously. The effectiveness of the estimation method is shown using synthetic measurements. Furthermore, this study shows that rate constants can be estimated from experimental measurements. However, accuracy is limited, potentially because additional processes, such as diffusive transport, are not included in the current model. The estimated rate constants are best suited for comparative analysis, rather than as absolute values, which may be influenced by specific samples. This enables analysis of differences between materials, validation of models, and prediction of electrochemical data of different material systems.

We developed a droplet-based microfluidic system to control condensate size and isolate them for long-term observation, enabling continuous monitoring of both stable amyloids and metastable amorphous aggregates (AAs). Using the yeast prion protein Sup35 as a model, we found that condensates convert into both amyloids and AAs in a competitive manner, and that at the micrometer scale, which is typical scale for condensates in vivo, AA formation sup-presses amyloid formation. We further demonstrated that (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a well-known amyloid formation inhibitor, unexpectedly promoted amyloid formation at low concentrations in small condensates by altering the relative kinetics of AA and amyloid formation.

Experiments indicate that hydrothermal synthesis of silica zeolites from clear solution proceeds through amorphous nanoaggregates that gradually develop zeolite order, in an apparently continuous amorphous to crystal transformation.  Here, we combine molecular simulations with advanced algorithms that identify zeolite order and computer vision to elucidate the pathway from clear solution to zeolite nanocrystal. We show that at conditions of hydrothermal synthesis of silica zeolites, the transformation of precursor aggregate into zeolite is not limited by nucleation barriers but by the slow dynamics of reorganization in the glassy precursor matrix.  The negligible nucleation barriers result in spinodal-like crystallization that leads to a gradual formation of a mosaic of small crystallites that explain the seemingly continuous character of zeolite crystallization and the catalytic activity of X-ray amorphous, protozeolites and embryonic zeolites. We find that zeolite-like pores and short-range order emerge early within glassy precursors, well before crystallinity is detected in TEM images or X-ray diffraction.

In this work, we introduce PoroNet, an inherently interpretable graph neural network architecture built on a graph representation of the pore network (i.e., pore graph). In a pore graph, nodes represent individual pores and edges represent pore connections. PoroNet shows highly accurate predictions of hydrogen (H2) uptake and deliverable capacity in MOFs, as well as on a benchmark simulated adsorption dataset that contains spherical and linear alkane adsorbates. More importantly, accurate pore-level contributions to adsorption can be learned using PoroNet through both direct supervised learning and as emergent properties while fitting the total adsorption capacity. In the direct supervised learning, we show that PoroNet is data-efficient in some cases, achieving comparable performance to the standard approach with only a fraction of simulation runs needed for model training. The pore-level contribution helps interpret the ML predictions of the total adsorption behavior, identify the key pore properties that govern the adsorption, and provide significant insights into pore engineering.

These tools have enabled the inspection of structures, dynamics, and interactions, yet their reliance on two-dimensional (2D) interfaces imposes persistent limitations. Traditional screen\u2013mouse systems are poorly suited to conveying the inherently three-dimensional (3D) nature of molecules, and thoughtful manipulation of structures remains cumbersome even for expert users. Such barriers are particularly acute for students and occasional users, for whom intuitive understanding is critical. Immersive technologies under the umbrella of eXtended Reality (XR)\u2014including Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)\u2014offer a paradigm shift. By situating molecules directly in 3D space, XR facilitates both perception and manipulation, making abstract concepts more tangible. Educational benefits include heightened engagement and improved spatial reasoning, while for research XR offers more fluid collaborative exploration of molecular systems. Historically, adoption was limited by expensive, bulky hardware and complex software installation. The WebXR standard now addresses these issues by enabling cross-platform immersive experiences directly through browsers, eliminating installation barriers and improving accessibility. The MolecularWeb ecosystem (https://molecularweb.org) exploits these advances to deliver immersive molecular graphics and modeling widely. Its first platform, moleculARweb, brings \u201ccommodity AR\u201d to everyday devices such as laptops and smartphones. Using simple fiducial markers or markerless AR, students can view and manipulate molecular structures in real time. Modules cover orbitals, VSEPR geometries, hydrogen bonding, and biomolecular assemblies, while Virtual Modeling Kits provide rudimentary molecular mechanics. Teachers report that these activities improve engagement and help clarify difficult concepts. To expand flexibility, the companion tool PDB2AR allows users to generate custom AR/VR scenes from Protein Data Bank entries, AlphaFold models, or objects exported from visualization software. These can be explored in stand-alone AR/VR or within MolecularWebXR, a multiuser immersive platform. MolecularWebXR provides shared virtual rooms where participants, represented as avatars, can examine curated content on chemistry, materials, and biology, or import their own structures. This framework has been deployed in classrooms, outreach events, and scientific meetings, highlighting its value as a medium for collaborative discussion. The most recent development, HandMol, moves beyond static visualization. Its prototypes enable multiuser, bare-handed manipulation of molecular structures with real-time feedback from molecular mechanics engines. Features include on-the-fly minimization, collaborative docking, seamless file exchange, and natural language control through language models. Soon to be integrated into MolecularWebXR, HandMol transforms immersive visualization into an interactive modeling environment suitable for both education and research.

The integration of primitive metabolism-like reactions with molecular organization represents a crucial step in the transition from chemistry to biology in chemical evolution. Here we constructed a chemically fueled primitive thioesterification/hydrolysis reaction cycle by using propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P) as the chemical fuel. The reaction cycle is characteristic of quick thioesterification and slow hydrolysis. The hydrolysis rate is highly dependent on both the pH and the structure of the precursor carboxylate and varies over a broad range, suggesting that the lifetime of the thioester product can be tuned over a broad timescale. Consequently the product assemblies can thus be effectively regulated by the chemically fueled reaction cycles. Combined with the kinetics of the nucleation and fibrillation in the thioester product assembly, we found that the reaction cycles can block the fibrillation process by tuning the hydrolysis rate of the thioester product. This preliminary work expanded the toolkit for constructing dissipative assemblies and also indicated that primitive metabolic-like reactions can be integrated with molecular self-assembly processes and actively regulate the higher order molecular organization.

We study the nature of the optical excitation for these particles and how the optical and electronic properties of these particles change with the size of their inorganic core. We demonstrate that for all families of particle studied, except those where the corners are capped with aromatic ligands, the optical gap, the onset of light absorption, blueshifts with deceasing particle-core size. For the particles where the corners are capped with alkyl phosphines, phosphine oxides or amines the optical gap is predicted to correspond to an excitation where both the hole and excited electron are delocalised over the inorganic core of the particle, a core-to-core excitation, and hence resemble the cartoon picture of a quantum dot. In contrast, we predict that for particles exclusively capped with bisulfide or alkylthiolate ligands, the optical gap corresponds to a charge-transfer excitation with the hole localised on a subset of ligands and only the excited-electron delocalised over the inorganic core of the particle. For particles where the corners are capped with aromatic ligands the optical gap is predicted to correspond to a ligand-to-ligand excitation, which because of its localised nature does not significantly shift with particle size. However, for these particles with aromatic ligands, core-to-core excitation, lie only slightly higher in energy, and these excited states will shift with particle size and will likely become the optical gap for large(r) particles. Moreover, as core-to-core excitations are predicted to be much more intense than ligand-to-ligand excitations, experimentally one is likely to observe a blueshift with particle size even for particle sizes where the optical gap technically is a ligand-to-ligand excitation.

To bridge this gap, here we develop a unified multiscale simulation framework that integrates first-principles non-adiabatic dynamics, excited-state enhanced sampling, and ground-state alchemical free-energy calculations. We applied this approach to photostatins (PSTs), a class of photoswitchable tubulin inhibitors with promising light-regulated anti-cancer bioactivity, and validated our predictions against extensive experimental data, including ultrafast time-resolved crystallography, absorption spectra, and isomer-dependent bioactivity assays. Our simulations reveal, for the first time, that non-radiative decay rates correlate directly with equilibrium excited-state free-energy surfaces, which are modulated by substituents, protein electrostatics, and steric confinement. Specifically, protein electrostatic fields accelerate excited-state relaxation, whereas steric constraints oppose it. The balance of these factors determines the trend of excited-state dynamics across PST derivatives. Our results further show that the photoisomerization quantum yield depends on (1) the directional alignment of torsional motions with non-adiabatic coupling vectors during non-radiative decay, and (2) the propensity for backward ground-state isomerization, both of which are shaped by protein-ligand interactions. Finally, among the free-energy methods tested, thermodynamic integration most accurately captures subtle substituent effects on the contrast in binding affinities between isomers, a critical metric for minimizing their off-target effects in the dark-adapted state.

These samples were analyzed for traditional and emerging QACs using target and suspect screening approaches with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The total concentrations of 18 traditional QACs ranged from 7.34 to 145000 ng/g, with a median of 176 ng/g. Additionally, 16 emerging QACs were identified, with total concentrations ranging from 5.45 to 349000 ng/g and a median concentration of 346 ng/g. Under laboratory conditions, the leaching rates of QACs from underwear, towels, and socks to wash water reached 77%, 55%, and 81%, respectively. In real-life simulated laundry experiments, hand-wash released higher \u03a3QACs concentrations compared to machine-wash (medians: 42.1 vs. 22.4 ng/g, respectively), suggesting that manual laundering may lead to greater QAC release. The toxicity evaluation by whole-effluent toxicity approaches showed that laundry wastewater and equivalent QACs solution both caused immobilization of Daphnia magna in a dose-response relationship, with wastewater exhibiting lower toxicity than the standard solution. Furthermore, risk quotients derived from bioassay results and environmental dilution factors across 150 countries indicated that 10% of regions face high risk (RQ > 1) when laundry wastewater is discharged after WWTP treatment, whereas 51% of regions show high risk when laundry wastewater is directly discharged together with sewage, highlighting that the ecological risks of QACs released from textiles in laundry wastewater should not be overlooked.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Advances in automated high-performance computing have facilitated the use of quantum mechanical calculations to predict the electromechanical properties of crystalline molecular materials. Through efficiently assessing the electronic and structural properties of non-centrosymmetric MOF crystal structures using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), we have conducted a comprehensive, computational analysis of single-crystal MOFs and predicted their experimentally benchmarked electromechanical properties.

While chloroguaiacols exhibit substantial cytotoxicity (28\u00d7 greater than trihalomethanes and comparable to other aromatic DBPs), their low concentrations in drinking water suggest minimal contribution to overall toxicity compared to priority aliphatic DBPs.

To accelerate method screening, an uncertainty-aware graph-based neural network that predicts retention times across multiple column chemistries and buffer pH conditions is herein introduced. Specifically, the Multiple Condition Retention time model, MC-Retention, incorporates explicit column and buffer descriptors and is trained on a newly assembled dataset produced by screening 480 analytes under eight chromatography conditions. By being able to accurately model multiple chromatographic methods simultaneously, MC-Retention can substantially reduce the time and resources required for LC method screening and development.  With an aggregate R2 of 0.86 and MAE of 15.5 seconds during cross validation, MC-Retention's respectable performance is greatly enhanced for analytes made present during training for one the four column chemistries when those analytes are otherwise not associated the columns being validated.  This selective training of analytes for a single column chemistry reduces error by 50%, with an R2 of 0.95 and MAE of 8.2 seconds in aggregate.

When palladium is supported by a bulky ancillary ligand \u201cL\u201d, a competition exists between a second oxidative addition (leading to difunctionalization) and bimolecular displacement of Pd0 from the monofunctionalized product by a second smaller ligand. Because oxidative addition of aryl bromides is faster than aryl chlorides, more difunctionalization might be expected with dibromoarenes compared to dichloroarenes. However, the opposite has been reported in some Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings. Here, we investigate the mechanistic origin of this counterintuitive trend to explain why dibromoarenes can sometimes be less prone to diarylation, despite undergoing faster oxidative addition than their chlorinated analogues. The selectivity outcome is found to be closely tied to solvents: the discrepancy between the expected and actual selectivity with dibromoarenes primarily appears in oxygen-containing solvents of at least moderate polarity (like THF), whereas high selectivity for diarylation can be achieved in most aromatic and chlorinated solvents. The results suggest that, in polar oxygen-containing solvents, bromide anion (formally dissolved KBr, the byproduct of oxidative addition) displaces LPd0 from the mono-cross-coupled product as anionic [BrPd0L]\u2013. Based on product distributions in these solvents, the rate of this process is competitive with the rate of intramolecular oxidative addition en route to the diarylated product. In contrast, the analogous displacement of Pd0 by chloride (the byproduct when using dichloroarenes) appears to be a much slower process, if it occurs at all.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Homogeneous Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions; Ligands (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The content of each copper sulfide can be controlled by experimental conditions, e.g. providing sulfur over-stoichiometry leads to covellite with higher phase purity. The MSR ignition was precisely determined utilizing a self-made in situ temperature monitoring device. For the MSR to occur under the ball-free conditions, the following conditions have to be respected: jar filling ratio at least 40%, rotation speed at least 700 rpm and Cu:S molar ratio in the range between 0.625 and 1.00. When MSR is not ignited, the as-received powder contains a mixture of digenite and non-reacted sulfur, which is transformed into covellite with time. In specific cases, the MSR is ignited within a few minutes of storage. The scalability of the proposed methodology is verified on the 40 and 62.5 g scale utilizing a planetary and mixer mill, respectively.

Molecular packing structure is well-known to impact the electronic coupling that underlies triplet-pair generation, as well as pair separation and triplet transport that occur through singlet fission, ultimately affecting the potential to increase conversion efficiencies in light-harvesting devices. We previously demonstrated that templating the crystallization of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-Pn) films on a series of lead-halide perovskites provides a means to control intermolecular packing and alter the kinetics of triplet-pair separation and recombination. Here we contrast triplet transport with the ultrafast interconversion of the singlet exciton to the correlated triplet pair and the dependence of these processes on template-modified crystal packing.  We observe that rate constants for the conversion of singlet excitons to correlated triplet pairs likewise are sensitive to the template structure but with a trend that is anticorrelated with those for triplet-pair separation and triplet-triplet annihilation.  This observation is consistent with the divergent requisite frontier orbital overlap symmetries of adjacent chromophores that underlie the electronic coupling associated with the generation of triplet pairs and the subsequent triplet transport.  We examine how the template-dependent packing structures, as determined by molecular dynamics simulations of a film-template interface, alter figures of merit for electronic interactions (estimated by frontier-orbital overlaps) that underlie each step of the SF mechanism.

PROTACs facilitate targeted protein degradation by recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase to a protein of interest, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for previously undruggable intracellular targets. However, their size, flexibility, and cooperative binding requirements pose significant challenges for computational modeling. To address this, we systematically evaluated AF3 and Boltz-1 on 62 PROTAC complexes from the Protein Data Bank. Both models achieve high structural accuracy by integrating ligand input during inference, as measured by RMSD, pTM, and DockQ scores, even for post-2021 structures absent from AF3 and Boltz-1 training data.

We explore different input strategies by comparing molecular string representations and explicit ligand atom positions, finding that the latter yields more accurate ligand placement and predictions. By analyzing the relationships between ligand positioning, protein-ligand interactions, and structural accuracy metrics, we provide insights into key factors influencing AF3's and Boltz-1's performance in modeling PROTAC-mediated binary and ternary complexes. To ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our pipeline and results via a GitHub repository and website (https://protacfold.xyz), providing a framework for future PROTAC structure prediction studies.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Recent estimates indicate that approximately 7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia in 2025, a number projected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. Globally, over 57 million people are affected by dementia, with AD accounting for 60-70% of cases. This study integrates structure-based in silico drug design with ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling to identify and predict potent BACE1 inhibitors. Initially, a hierarchical in silico workflow screened ginsenoside analogues from Panax ginseng, identifying CHEMBL3594353 as a lead with a binding affinity of -9.7 kcal/mol, superior to Verubecestat (-8.3 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations con- firmed the stability of the BACE1-CHEMBL3594353 complex, though ADMET profiling indicated poor oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier permeability. Extending this, QSAR models were developed using a ChEMBL dataset of 8,057 unique BACE1 compounds, computing 202 RDKit descriptors.

Current methods, such as transient absorption spectroscopy, are highly complex and require intricate experimental setups, limiting their accessibility for routine examinations. Furthermore, direct experimental comparison of energy transfer efficiency between aggregate versus monomer exciton to acceptor is also lacking. Here, we demonstrate a simple spectroscopic approach that shows differentiation for different exciton populations in engineered organic dopant systems.  By using a pyrene derivative as the dopant within the crystal of a naphthalene derivative, the type of excitonic energy transfer from naphthalene to pyrene is strongly selective. Specifically, the coherent aggregate exciton population is almost entirely depleted despite a better energy match between the pyrene absorption and the naphthalene monomer emission, which largely persists in the presence of pyrene dopants. By chemically modifying the naphthalene energy donor, the populations of aggregate and monomer excitons can be systematically tuned, which directly correlates with the sensitivity of the pyrene photoluminescence in doped naphthalene crystals at a fixed concentration. These findings have important implications for understanding exciton dynamics in organic light-emitting devices.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These starting materials can be readily activated in the presence of a Lewis Acidic metal via a visible light-induced bond homolysis (VLIH) process. Despite its promise as a sustainable, benchtop catalyst the design of new Fe VLIH catalysts has been thwarted due to the lack of well-characterized Fe photocatalysts.  Many VLIH photocatalytic reactions are prone to catalyst speciation, making isolation and characterization challenging. Thus far, only dinuclear and trinuclear complexes have been isolated in the literature though none of them have proven to be catalytically competent. Herein, we elucidate the structures of mononuclear Fe carboxylates that have been previously proposed, yet are synthetically elusive in photodecarboxylative reactions. X-Ray crystallography and Ultra-Violet Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy support the formation of ((diethylenetriamine(dien))FeIII(OCOR)3 (R= t-Bu, CH3, CF3, and Ph) from (dien)FeIIICl3 in the presence of carboxylic acid and base. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrate that these complexes in the presence of visible light are competent radical sources, facilitating the generation of both stabilized and non-stabilized radicals. Additionally, an (dien)FeII carboxylate was synthesized and demonstrated to effectively regenerate the (dien)FeIII photocatalyst. This report provides evidence for the active photocatalyst in an Fe photodecarboxylative Giese reaction and communicates the first structural evidence for a discrete ligated mononuclear Fe photocatalyst for VLIH.

The objective of this research was fulfilled with the potential allosteric or secondary binding sites available upon protein-protein docking of VEGF-A and modified bevacizumab in the prevention of angiogenesis. Several 3D conformations of protein structures were obtained and analyzed through visualization alongside pharmacopore modelling by the deletion of the Fc region of the Bevacizumab complex. Upon protein-protein docking, the study found no alteration of binding affinity upon VEGF-A and modified Bevacizumab complex binding in comparison with unmodified Bevacizumab. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Fc region deletion does not affect the binding affinity. However, this is difficult to affirm since the Bevacizumab complex utilized was modified beforehand in the database. Therefore, it is suggested to obtain the Bevacizumab molecule without previous alteration to explore both primary and secondary binding sites.

Different from the previously proposed six-membered palladacyclic intermediate formed by the \u03b3-C(sp3)-H activation, the calculated results indicate that in this reaction the \u03b2-C(sp3)-H bond will be favorably activated at first to form a five-membered palladacyclic intermediate instead of the \u03b3-C(sp3)-H bond, and that the achieved \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated acid after the \u03b2- and \u03b3-C(sp3)-H activation is a key feasible transient intermediate for the following \u03b3-C(sp3)-H arylation.

We then examine the current landscape of quantum computing hardware and algorithms, clarifying what has actually been achieved with NISQ devices and where fundamental roadblocks remain. Building from this foundation, we analyze the foundations of QML algorithms\u2014quantum kernels, variational quantum circuits, and hybrid workflows\u2014and their putative advantages in polynomial scaling and Hilbert space expressivity.\nTo ground discussion in practice, we present a case study of H\u2082 molecular energies, contrasting classical ML\u2019s near instantaneous accuracy with quantum algorithms like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver.

PTMs expand the chemical repertoire from which new biomaterials can be constructed. Inspired by the post-translational addition of cholesterol to proteins, we have synthesized five new hybrid lipid-protein biomaterials called Sterol modified polypeptides (STaMPs). These STaMPs consist of an elastin like polypeptide (ELP) conjugated to a sterol, namely coprostanol, epicoprostanol, androstanol, galeterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone. We show that the STaMPs form self-assembled nanostructures such as spherical and cylindrical micelles, and vesicles. Furthermore, the sterols modify the typical LCST behavior of ELPs in a predictable fashion depending on the hydrophobicity of the sterol appended. STaMPs could expand the possibilities for drug delivery by enabling the physical encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs, increasing the solubility and half-life of sterol-based chemotherapeutics, and forming thermosensitive drug depots.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Biological Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the methanation reaction is strongly exothermic, requiring strict heat management to avoid catalyst degradation and carbon deposition. In such systems, the energy penalty of CO\u2082 compression and liquefaction typically reduces the net conversion efficiency from its theoretical value of ~80 % to ~50 %.\n\nIn this study, we propose a novel integrated process that directly couples methanation with an MgO\u2013MgCO\u2083 solid looping system. In this concept, MgCO\u2083 serves as both a CO\u2082 carrier and an endothermic medium: its decomposition at >400 \u00b0C absorbs the methanation heat release (\u2212185 kJ mol\u207b\u00b9) while simultaneously supplying CO\u2082 to sustain the reaction. A counter-current, multi-stage fluidized bed reactor is employed, enabling zoned temperature control (200\u2013500 \u00b0C) and sequential use of Ni- and Ru-based catalysts at their respective optimal temperature ranges.\n\nThermodynamic analysis demonstrates that heat balance can be achieved across all zones, eliminating the need for external cooling equipment. Furthermore, AMS-treated MgO exhibits rapid carbonation kinetics and long-term cyclic stability, ensuring practical CO\u2082 capture from flue gas streams. Energy efficiency calculations, including the logistics of solid transport, indicate that the overall hydrogen-to-methane conversion efficiency can reach ~85\u201390 %, significantly surpassing conventional CCUS routes.\n\nThis integrated MgO\u2013MgCO\u2083 looping approach thus provides a high-efficiency, safe, and logistically simplified alternative for large-scale CO\u2082 utilization, suitable not only for distributed stationary sources but also for mobile emitters such as ocean-going vessels.", "date": "2025-10-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

Amide coupling reaction data makes it well-suited for an approach involving machine learning, predicting optimal reaction conditions given a particular substrate feature set. Herein, we report a platform for standardizing and filtering open source reaction data from the ORD (Open Reaction Database) and using this machine-readable dataset to train thirteen machine learning models. These include linear, tree-based, kernel method, instance based, neural network, and ensemble architectures, in the yield prediction and classification of coupling agents in amide coupling reactions.

To further validate this approach, we deployed the classification models on literature reported  data not in the ORD database. Our results demonstrate that kernel methods and ensemble-based architectures perform significantly better than other models such as linear or single tree.

Using state-of-the-art multireference electronic structure theory combined with semiclassical surface-hopping dynamics, we elucidate the complete reaction mechanism. Nonadiabatic dynamics at the CASSCF level, performed with both [2,2] and [4,4] active spaces, reveal that upon S\u2081 photoexcitation, electron density migrates from the pyrrole \u03c0-system to the tetrazole \u03c0*, initiating N\u2013N bond activation and N\u2082 release via a conical intersection.

Unsaturated phosphorus-(V) (P(V)) compounds have recently emerged as powerful cysteine-selective bioconjugation reagents (P5-labeling).

Fortunately, the efforts of the community in obtaining experimental structures of ligand-protein complexes have now generated sufficient samples to rationalize isoform preferences. Herein, we provide our detailed structure-annotated meta-analysis of sulfonamide binding across CA II, CA IX, and CA XII that standardizes residue numbering and interaction taxonomy. We examine 130 X-ray cocrystal structures, CA II (47), CA IX (55), and CA XII (28), to quantify Zn\u2013sulfonamide geometry, entrance-zone contacts (Arg60, Thr199/Thr200, His64 \u03c0-cation), conserved water mediation, and occupancy/orientation within the 130s subpocket (residues 131/132/135) that provide the best opportunities for delivering selectivity. From these data, we extract concrete, structure-derived design rules: (i) lowering sulfonamide pKa boosts affinity across isoforms but does not confer selectivity; (ii) directing steric/hydrophobic bulk into the 130s subpocket exploits Phe131/Gly132/Val135 (CA II) versus Val131/Asp132/Leu135 (CA IX) versus Ala131/Ser132/Ser135 (CA XII) differences; (iii) favourable entrance-zone interactions, e.g., salt bridging to Arg60 (IX), halogen bonding to Thr199, and occasional His64 \u03c0-cation, enhances IX/XII bias; and (iv) compact, highly polar heads without tailored tails tend to default to preferring CA II.

However, designing electrolyte formulations remains a major challenge, as their performance arises from complex, non-additive interactions among lithium salts and organic solvents, requiring elegant molecular design and selection. Conventional trial-and-error strategies still dominate electrolyte design, but they are slow and resource-intensive. Recent machine learning approaches have improved electrolyte screening, yet many rely on coarse molecular representations that neglect fragment-level chemistry and explicit ratios, limiting interpretability and their utility for guiding experiments. Here we introduce a deep learning framework that integrates intermolecular attributions across solvents with intramolecular attributions from functional units. The framework builds a hierarchical representation, decomposing formulations into molecules and their functional units, while integrating ratios, physicochemical descriptors, and salt identity to generate mixture-invariant embeddings for accurate and interpretable conductivity prediction. Applied to benchmark datasets of lithium battery electrolytes, the framework achieves high accuracy in predicting ionic conductivity and enables large-scale virtual screening. Crucially, it provides chemically interpretable insights: fragment-level attentions align with functional units; composition-aware attention reveals the impact of mixing ratios; and counterfactual perturbations confirm causal roles of key motifs.

Combining molecular dynamics simulations with NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that N-terminal proline constrains backbone interactions, the central amino acid supports assembly, while C-terminal aromatics dictate conformational adaptability. Phenylalanine at the C-terminus (PXF peptides) restricts flexibility, yielding soluble aggregates, whereas tryptophan at the C-terminus (PXW peptides) enhances flexibility and promotes crystallization. Structural analyses further reveal that these molecular dynamics translate into distinct solid-state properties: tryptophan-containing peptides form stiff crystals with dynamic, wettable surfaces, whereas phenylalanine analogues yield static, hydrophobic materials.

Under the optimal condition, characterized by UV-visible- near infrared absorption spectrum, SWCNTs of (6,5) and (9,8) accounted for 28% and 30% of the total, respectively. TEM characterizations showed bimodal diameter distribution of the as-grown SWCNTs, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum. Due to the significant difference of tube diameter, SWCNTs of (6,5) and (9,8) could be separated in aqueous two-phase system to obtain (9,8)-enriched SWCNT dispersion. Catalyst preparation condition, reduction temperature, growth temperature and carbon source affected the chirality distribution of the as-grown SWCNTs. We proposed that under the optimal condition, the diameter distribution of Co clusters presented bimodal distribution. In addition, the growth kinetics of (n,n-1)-SWCNTs is favorable against other chiralities. Therefore, the selective growth of SWCNTs of (6,5) and (9,8) may be ascribed to the dual diameter distribution of Co nanoparticles and the higher growth rates of (n,n-1)-SWCNTs.

We compare this approach with the length gauge (LG) formalism that we presented in a previous work [APL Comp. Phys. 1, 026107 (2025)] in terms of theoretical analysis and computational results. Calculations on molecular systems with large Dunning basis sets including diffuse functions show a smooth convergence towards the complete basis set limit (CBS) with both formalisms, but LG and MVG converge to different values when CCSD provides an incomplete treatment of electron correlation. With the  small basis sets used in the PBC calculations, the difference between the gauge formalisms increases due to basis set incompleteness. For the PBC calculations on 1D periodic systems, the MVG formalism shows a faster convergence towards the thermodynamic limit with $k$ sampling compared to LG. Furthermore, the MVG formalism provides perfect agreement between PBC and long molecular cluster models. This is not the case for LG due to the so-called missing integer issue. However, a comparison with the molecular data suggests that the LG-PBC results with the small basis set affordable in this work are closer to the CBS results than those with MVG.

Recent methods for (hetero)arene trifluoromethylation generally required stoichiometric inorganic oxidants to promote the turnover of the photoactive iron catalysts, thereby limiting their broader applicability.

Herein, we report a simpler NHC-CDI framework for ROMs based on substituted diphenyl CDIs containing one dimethylamino group and one tunable handle.

This review provides an overview of modern nanoparticle synthesis technologies, including Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP), Continuous Hydrothermal Flow Synthesis (CHFS), Spark Discharge Generation (SDG), classical chemical synthesis, and Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid (PLAL). FSP enables large-scale production with high throughput and uniformity, but faces challenges of aggregation and high infrastructure costs. CHFS offers continuous, \u201cgreen\u201d synthesis in aqueous environments with fine control over particle properties, though it requires complex post-processing to ensure purity and sterility. SDG produces highly pure nanoparticles directly from conductive materials using compact equipment, yet its productivity remains limited. Traditional chemical synthesis excels in shape and size control and is cost-efficient, but sterility issues and organic residues hinder biomedical translation. By contrast, PLAL combines simplicity, compact instrumentation, and the ability to generate sterile, ligand-free colloidal nanoparticles in solution, eliminating many post-synthesis steps. Comparative analysis demonstrates that no single approach is universally optimal; instead, method selection must balance scalability, cost, sterility, and application-specific requirements. Among these, PLAL emerges as a particularly promising technique for biotechnology and medicine, where rapid, clean, and scalable nanoparticle production is critical.

However, public spectral libraries are scattered across disparate databases and contain spectra that are of low resolution or quality, missing critical metadata, or which have chemically incoherent annotations. Addressing these issues requires extensive preprocessing and considerable expertise in mass spectrometry, which presents a significant barrier to investigators interested in developing their own machine-learning models. Here we present Spectraverse, a comprehensive and extensively curated library of public MS/MS spectra from small molecules. We assembled reference spectra both from major repositories and previously overlooked resources, then developed a preprocessing pipeline to harmonize metadata, standardize chemical structures, and remove low-quality or redundant spectra. These efforts led us to identify previously undocumented pitfalls in existing public libraries that may have confounded prior comparisons of machine-learning models, or conversely have caused valid MS/MS spectra to have been discarded from the training sets of these models. The resulting resource affords the most comprehensive coverage of chemical space of any machine-learning-ready library of MS/MS spectra to date, while also expanding coverage of adducts and ionization modes encountered in metabolomic experiments. We intend to maintain and expand Spectraverse in order to encompass the growing number of publicly available reference MS/MS spectra that can be expected to accumulate in the future.

However, the most frequent intracellular vesicle bursts released only about half the ACh content compared to the presumed full exocytosis events, suggesting that partial release mechanism might also be dominant during intracellular vesicle bursting. Together, these results demonstrate the unique capability of the nanotip ACh biosensor to probe fusion pore dynamics at subcellular resolution and provide new insights into the quantal nature of cholinergic signaling in human neuronal models. \n", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Electrochemical Analysis; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

When conventional water treatment methods prove insufficient for removing harmful contaminants, Advanced Oxidation and Reduction Processes (AOPs/ARPs) offer a promising alternative by generating reactive species (RS) to degrade them. Liquid Chromatography coupled with High-Resolution tandem MS (LC-HR-MS/MS) has been widely employed to elucidate degradation pathways by detecting transformation products (TPs) produced during AOP/ARP. However, most reported studies are targeted at certain suspect TPs, rather than exploiting the whole information provided by LC-HR-MS/MS. Here, we applied an advanced computational metabolomics pipeline to explore non-targeted HR-MS/MS data, including molecular networking and chemical proportionality, to provide new insights and a more comprehensive view of the degradation pathways in AOP/ARP. We selected the cyclic-peptide cyanobacterial hepatotoxin, microcystin-RR (MC-RR) as a substrate and applied the principles of radiation chemistry of water to selectively produce RS in known yields. Degradation of MC-RR was observed with all RS and degradation rate constants followed the order: H\u2022 > eaq- > HO\u2022 > HOO\u2022/O2-\u2022, ranging from 0.0021 Gy-1 (HOO\u2022/O2-\u2022) to 0.0729 Gy-1 (H\u2022).

Given the ubiquity of water vapor in the environment, predicting water adsorption within MOFs is critical, but the classical force fields, such as the UFF, often fail. To overcome this problem, we propose a strategy to fine-tune a machine learning potential (MLP) from the pretrained MACE model for water adsorption within MOFs. We test our strategy on a dataset of 420 Al-MOFs with 439 distinct linkers. The fine-tuned model can predict heats of adsorption and Henry coefficients of six well-known Al-MOFs, in good agreement with experiments. We also show that these accurate predictions require not only the accurate description of MOF-H2O interactions but also the framework flexibility, which are missing in previous screening studies. From a case study on MIL-160, we established the accuracy thresholds of 8 kJ/mol on total energies and 50 meV/\u00c5 on atomic forces for heat of adsorption calculations, and our final model achieves it on 409 Al-MOFs. Using this model, we can escape the local minimum and obtain optimal configurations with significantly lower DFT-energy than DFT-optimized ones. To identify optimal MOFs for water harvesting, we also applied this model to calculate DFT-level heat of adsorption. Compared with these DFT-level results, UFF underestimates the heat of adsorption by more than 3.5 kJ/mol in 92.4\\% of MOFs. Thus, our work demonstrates that the MLP can provide DFT-level predictions for high-throughput screening studies.

Models describing the influence of photon fluxes have typically introduced photon flux dependent apparent thermal kinetic parameters (reaction orders, activation energies, binding energies, etc.). This has involved empirical fitting of reaction rate data, making mechanistic interpretations of the influence of photon fluxes on elementary step rates challenging, and is inconsistent with fundamental descriptions of photochemistry on metal surfaces developed from surface science studies. Using the CO adsorption-desorption quasi-equilibrium reaction on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts as a model \u201creaction\u201d system, we measured steady-state adsorbed CO (CO*) coverages under isothermal and isobaric (1 mbar CO) conditions as a function temperature (473 \u2013 573 K) and of 440 nm photon flux (0.1-5.2 x 103 #hv Pt site-1 s-1) using in-situ IR spectroscopy. Steady state CO* coverage on Pt was strongly photon flux dependent with increasing photon flux causing decreasing coverage, consistent with photons driving CO* desorption rates faster than thermal CO* desorption rates. However, photon flux dependent CO* coverages were essentially temperature independent, inconsistent with models that describe photon effects using perturbations to apparent thermal kinetic parameters. Instead, 120 steady state CO* coverages as a function of temperature and photon flux are quantitatively described by a kinetic model in which the overall desorption rate is a summation of independent thermal and photon-induced CO* desorption rates. Site-resolved analysis reveals distinct kinetic parameters for the photon driven desorption of CO* from well-coordinated, under-coordinated, and highly under-coordinated Pt sites, with temperature-dependent apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) consistent with temperature dependence of vibrational quanta distribution of CO. The rigorous kinetic rate laws for independent photon and thermal driven pathways allows for predictive modeling of operating regimes where photon fluxes can drive enhance reaction rates. This work provides evidence that steady state continuous wave photon fluxes can drive reactions on metal surfaces out of thermal equilibrium, reconciles surface science observations of molecular photodesorption with applied catalysis, establishes a general kinetic framework for photon-driven processes on metals, and defines catalyst, reaction, and photon flux characteristic design principles for breaking Sabatier limitations.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

This transition dynamically redirects CO2RR selectivity from two-electron products (CO, HCOOH) to the more kinetically demanding eight-electron product (CH4), with Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 80%. This phenomenon is corroborated by anomalous Hall measurements and density functional theory, both revealing a direct correlation between Berry flux and CO2RR selectivity. Thus, our findings establish quantum electronic topology, here the Berry flux, as a reversible, field-tunable means of controlling catalytic performance, introducing a new paradigm for adaptive electrocatalysis and real-time modulation of reaction pathways in quantum materials.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, simulating ion transport in nanoporous materials with density functional theory (DFT) accuracy has traditionally been challenging because of system sizes comprising hundreds of atoms and simulation times of nanoseconds. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to study the free energy landscape of Li+ and Na+ diffusion in zeolites, with and without solvent (water in our case). Results from umbrella sampling show Li+ to encounter a free energy barrier of \u223c14 kJ/mol during their transport along the pore channels, in the presence of solvent. The absence of solvent increases the free energy barrier by \u223c3\u22124 times. We find lower free energy barriers for Na+ diffusion (\u223c11 kJ/mol) than Li+ and subsequently rationalize how the different coordination environments of the ions lead to the difference in the free energy landscape. A key finding in this work is that the trade-off between the ion coordination with solvent and framework atoms determines the free energy barriers of ion transport in nanoconfinement. We then perform unbiased MD simulations at a high temperature (800 K) after modifying the chemical environment inside the zeolite in terms of the Si/Al ratio. The mean-squared displacements and probability densities of Li+ and Na+ distributions in our confined system show Na+ to diffuse faster than Li+ at high temperatures.

But creating a pH gradient with electrolysis of water requires a relatively high voltage, which could be energy-draining in manufacturing. So here an innovative three-chamber electrolysis system based on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is proposed, which lowers the electrolysis voltage while achieving very high current efficiency (~100%).

Native-like myoglobin unfolds in two sequential steps: an initial coop-erative melting that disrupts native contacts yet maintains compactness through non-local salt bridges, fol-lowed by an expansion driven by gains in configurational entropy as salt-bridge networks reorganize.

Hubbard corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) in a numerical atom-centred orbital framework, has been shown to address this challenge but is susceptible to numerical instability when simulating common transition metal oxides (TMOs) e.g., TiO2, and rare-earth metal oxides (REOs) e.g., CeO2, necessitating the development of advanced DFT+U parameterisation strategies. In this work, the numerical instabilities of DFT+U are traced to the default atomic Hubbard projector, which we refine for Ti 3d orbitals in TiO2 using Bayesian optimisation, with a cost function and constraints defined using symbolic regression (SR) and support vector machines, respectively. The optimised Ti 3d Hubbard projector enables the numerically stable simulation of electron polarons at intrinsic and extrinsic defects in both anatase and rutile TiO2, with comparable accuracy to hybrid-DFT at several orders of magnitude lower computational cost. We extend the method by defining a general first-principles approach for optimising Hubbard projectors, based on reproducing orbital occupancies calculated using hybrid-DFT. Using a hierarchical SR-defined cost function that depends on DFT-predicted orbital occupancies, basis set parameters and atomic material descriptors, a generalised workflow for the one-shot computation of Hubbard U values and projectors is presented. The method transferability is shown for 10 prototypical TMOs and REOs, with demonstrable accuracy for unseen materials, that extends to complex battery cathode materials like LiCo(1-x)Mg(x)O(2-x).

MM/GBSA calculated affinity is dominated by van der Waals contributions, and a per-residue decomposition highlight stabilizing roles for Ser135, Tyr150, and Pro132, consistent with the observed contact pattern and supportive of target engagement. While the potency is moderate, it is consistent with a fragment-like chemotype in the protease substrate-binding cleft and provides a tractable entry point for derivatization. Contact-persistence and the energy decomposition suggest promising avenues for future structure\u2013activity exploration, i.e., extension of the ligand into the S1/S2 subsites, reinforcement of aromatic contacts, and polarity management to increase hydrophobic collapse as a new opportunity for dengue protease inhibitor design.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Separation Science; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Plant Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to train automatically, avoiding the incredibly tedious process of constructing and extending traditional property estimation schemes. However, DNNs require large amounts of training data, are challenging to interpret, require large amounts of memory to load even during inference, and have severe difficulties incorporating qualitative chemical knowledge, which are often desired for molecular property prediction tasks. Here we present PySIDT (https://github.com/zadorlab/PySIDT), a software for training and running inference on Subgraph Isomorphic Decision Trees (SIDTs). SIDTs are graph-based decision trees made of nodes associated with molecular substructures. Inference is done by descending target molecular structures down the decision tree to nodes with matching subgraph isomorphic substructures and making predictions based on the final (most specific) node matched. SIDTs scale down well to dataset sizes much smaller than is feasible for DNNs. As trees of molecular substructures, SIDTs are inherently readable and easy to visualize, making them easy to analyze. They are also straightforward to extend and retrain, facilitate uncertainty estimation, and enable easy integration of expert knowledge. We demonstrate the SIDT approach discussing its application to a diverse range of molecular prediction tasks: rate coefficient estimation, diffusion coefficient estimation, thermochemistry estimation, transition state bond stretch prediction, pKa prediction, stability of molecular structures, stability of surface structures, and prediction of surface lateral interaction energetics. Additionally, we demonstrate the power of the SIDT algorithms in two direct learning curve vanilla comparisons with the popular DNN-based software Chemprop and the popular gradient boosted trees-based software XGBoost on enthalpy of formation and rate coefficient prediction tasks.

Contrary, the extracts from the positive electrodes consumed more KOH titrant when only N2 was present. The pH values and titrant amounts consumed increased with increasing voltage window for both electrodes. The larger amounts of acid consumed for the negative electrode extracts in the experiments with CO2 is explained by the adsorption of additional protons created from CO2 hydrolysis. The smaller amount of base consumed for the positive electrode in the presence of CO2 is due to reaction of bicarbonate with the acid generated at the positive electrode and conversion into gaseous CO2.

This promising method allows the description of S1-S0 conical intersections due to the ground state being a response of two triplet reference states, without the problem of spin contamination associated with regular spin-flip TDDFT.

Here, this gap is addressed with the introduction of the Hybrid kinetic Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (HkMCMD) algorithm, which decouples reactive event selection from vibrational dynamics to enable using kMC for time evolution. The algorithm incorporates three key components: (1) kMC-based timekeeping that advances time according to reactive events rather than atomic vibrations, (2) dynamic reaction rate scaling that detects and escapes pseudo-steady states in which fast reactions dominate, and (3) spatially-resolved diffusion calculations that capture heterogeneous transport with a voxel-based analysis. Validation on model systems demonstrates accurate dynamics across nanosecond to second timescales, computational savings of up to four orders of magnitude for systems with disparate reaction rates, and a quantitatively accurate treatment of diffusion-limited kinetics.

Phase diversity arises from the competition between the formation of different metal oxides or binary alloys, while the local properties of the suboxide layers are responsible for the final architecture and composition determining the electronic properties of the material. Two descriptors related to the competition between alloy and oxide formation are proposed to elucidate the phase diversity. Our work provides a systematic approach to advance the design of SMSI-based catalytic materials by offering insights into the atomic-level architecture of the metal/metal oxide interfaces.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Catalysts; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Recently, deep learning\u2013based diffusion models have shown promise in generating TSs from 2D reaction graphs for single-step reactions.

Mass spectra of FAP reveal four major proteoforms: FAP is always bound to the FAD cofactor and up to two endogenous fatty acid substrates in the dark, whereas upon irradiation these non-covalent species are released to produce the apo form. Ion mobility data show an irradiation-induced conformational change in FAP concomitant with photoinactivation.

However, the application of dispersion-based coatings limits uniformity and performance, while the persistence and toxicity associated to per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds have prompted regulatory scrutiny. Here, we investigate polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a fluorine-free, low-surface-energy, and environmentally benign polymer as a viable alternative. We assess four PDMS coating application strategies: (1) dip-coating, vapor deposition in (2) oxygen and (3) nitrogen atmospheres, and (4) electrografting of an amine-functionalized derivative. We perform spectroscopic, microscopic, wetting, and electrochemical double-layer measurements to correlate surface chemical composition and morphology with the resulting wettability. \nVapor deposition in an oxygen environment produces a superhydrophobic rough microstructure; however, weak adhesion of the coating and substrate oxidation result in severe flooding when the substrate is exposed to an alkaline liquid flow.

On the contrary, dip-coated samples feature thick, unevenly distributed layers exhibiting poor liquid infiltration resistance.

Designing next-generation catalysts requires an atomic-level understanding of the factors that affect the catalyst sulfur tolerance, but this is difficult to obtain due to complex interactions between the Ni catalyst and non-inert metal oxide supports. In this work, a combined computational and experimental approach is adopted to investigate design strategies for enhancing the sulfur tolerance of Ni catalysts via optimisation of the metal oxide support. We investigate the thermodynamic driving force for oxygen-mediated sulfur removal from the Ni(111) surface, which is indicative of the regenerative effects of support oxygen buffering, using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) sampling of a lattice model that is parameterised using density functional theory (DFT). The outcome is predictions of the surface coverage and composition of adsorbed S and O atoms across an extended Ni(111) surface, which are validated with a fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potential to reveal entropic contributions for catalyst regeneration at experimentally relevant surface coverages. Simulations of the surface chemistry of Ni(111) are complemented by predictions of the energetics of bulk defect formation in prototypical metal oxide support materials to provide insights into the proclivity for oxygen release and phase transformation during catalytic reactions. The computational modelling is correlated with experimental characterisation and methane steam reforming activity tests for H2S-poisoned Ni nanoparticle catalysts, allowing us to rationalise the experimentally observed differences in the catalyst sulfur tolerance and establish strategies for future catalyst optimisation.

We find that hole transfer from CdS to CdSe is 3-6 times slower in tetrapods than in dot-in-rods, a result we attribute to hole hopping between equivalent CdS arms, which competes with interfacial transfer. While electron transfer rates to benzoquinone are nearly identical for both heterostructures, the charge-separated state in tetrapods persists more than an order of magnitude longer, likely due to steric constraints that inhibit charge recombination.

Among them, acyl phosphates are highly reactive, yet biology channels their activation chemistry almost exclusively through aminoacyl adenylates. This conserved design leaves unexplored how alternative phosphate leaving groups might influence reactivity and structure. Here we show that aminoacyl phosphate esters with varied leaving groups (ethyl, phenyl, naphthyl, dodecyl) direct peptide bond formation and supramolecular assembly through distinct pathways in water. Structural features of the leaving group guide preorganization into compartments before acyl transfer and influence co-assembly with peptides after bond formation, imprinting outcomes that persist beyond activation. Consequently, the leaving group determines not only peptide yields but also the supramolecular architectures and mechanical properties of assemblies arising from the same peptide sequences. In multicomponent mixtures, aminoacyl phosphates create recognition microenvironments in which aromaticity, hydrophobicity, or charge bias electrophile-nucleophile pairing, thereby transforming them from passive electrophiles into active design elements capable of driving sequence selectivity. Moreover, soluble phosphates undergo phosphoryl exchange with orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, or adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to generate alternative intermediates that divert reactivity, whereas self-assembling phosphates resist exchange and favour amino acid oligomerization. These findings establish the leaving group as a tunable design element that governs reactivity, directs supramolecular organization and regulates pathway dynamics, transforming activation from a passive synthetic step into an active driver of recognition and assembly.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

MD simulations in water with low substrate concentrations confirm how the RCL adopts a closed conformation that restricts access to the active site. Upon substrate accumulation or increasing the concentration of substrate, activation of the enzyme is achieved due to conformational changes involving not only the previously proposed rotation of Phe113 but also a significant rearrangement of Arg114. This movement induces the outward shift of Phe113, opening a channel for substrate entry. These findings support the classical interfacial activation mechanism of lipases and justify the selection of a quasi-open lid RCL model for modeling its catalytic activity. Using M06-2X:AM1/MM MD simulations, we validated the esterase activity of RCL on a benchmark ester compound 4-nitrobenzyl butyrate (pNPB), uncovering a standard acylation-hydrolysis mechanism with acylation and hydrolysis steps barriers (18.6 and 19.3 kcal/mol, respectively) in excellent agreement with experimental data. The urethanase activity of RCL was then explored in the degradation of model substrate 4-nitrophenyl benzylcarbamate (pNC). Our results indicate that the process preferentially follows an esterase pathway, fully decomposing the PUR-like model sample through three steps, acylation, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation. The value of the activation energy of the full process, determined by the acylation step (17.2 kcal/mol), indicates a feasible reaction. Comparative analysis between the degradation of pNPB and pNC reveals that RCL's catalytic efficiency is influenced by the geometry and electrostatic nature of the substrate, with the enzyme\u2019s active site aligning key moieties for effective bond cleavage. Additionally, short-range interactions, along with long-range electrostatic effects, polarize key moieties, facilitating charge redistribution during bond formation and cleavage.

Additionally, we evaluated two-photon properties and presented, that 2PA can be used to distinguish between the form of a dye (monomer vs aggregate) upon binding to amyloids. Since our dyes differ only in one functional group (aryl/alkyl amine), evaluation of their structure-properties relationship as fluorescent probe is highly beneficial for better understanding of ACQ/AIE luminogens interaction with amyloids.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Central to their functionality is the ylide bond, yet the precise nature of this bond remains a subject of ongoing debate, which may limit the full exploitation of these compounds' potential. To address this issue, our study utilizes quantum crystallography, supported by complementary bonding analyses, to experimentally and directly verify the nature of the ylide bond. Specifically, we investigated five experimentally synthesized or crystallized sulfur, phosphorus, and arsenic ylide compounds, complemented by theoretical models in which ylide bonds were substituted with hydrogens. Our results reveal that the ylide bond is an intermediate between ionic/covalent and single/double bonds, with negative hyperconjugation being the most significant stabilizing factor. Notably, the lone pair on the sulfur atom, which is substituted in arsenic and phosphorus ylides, contributes minimally to the bonding in these compounds. The carbon ylide lone pair, particularly in arsenic ylides, shows a greater tendency for delocalization through negative hyperconjugation rather than remaining localized via electrostatic interactions. The ylide bond in arsenic ylides is weaker compared to phosphorus and sulfur ylides, suggesting easier bond cleavage and greater reactivity in arsenic ylides. Crucially, the d-orbitals of the heteroatoms (S/P/As) do not participate in bonding, even in arsenic, a fourth-row element. Additionally, the ylide resonance form remains dominant, although sulfur ylides exhibit more covalent character than their phosphorus and arsenic counterparts.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Bonding; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Organic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This implies that linear Cn could, in principle, serve as precursors for the formation of cyclic carbons. Recently, on-surface synthesis has enabled the generation of a series of linear and cyclic carbons (up to cyclo[30]carbon). However, a direct structural transformation from linear to cyclic carbon has not yet been achieved in real space.

Electronic characterization and calculations reveal that C25 adopts an open-shell configuration. To demonstrate the generality of this strategy, we employed linear C6 (derived from C6Br6) as the precursor, which led to the formation of the largest cyclocarbon so far, C50, on the surface, and importantly, its first and second ion resonances at two voltage polarities were probed successfully.

In this project, we set out to address two key questions: First, is there any relationship between the properties of the arsenic\u2013oxygen bond and piezoelectricity? Second, is the arsenic atom in the arsenate anion hypervalent? To explore these questions, we studied a set of ten periodic and molecular arsenic oxides and collected high-resolution X-ray single-crystal datasets for them. We employed quantum crystallography and complementary bonding analysis to answer our questions. Our results from geometrical and topological analysis classify all arsenic-oxygen bond types as weaker than a single covalent bond, with stabilization largely provided by electrostatic attraction. From an orbital perspective, negative hyperconjugation plays the key role in bond stability, and we observed only a minor contribution from the d-orbitals of arsenic, effectively ruling out the concept of arsenic hypervalency. From a localization perspective, the electrons are either localized on the arsenic atom itself or on the As\u2013O bond. The most intriguing breakthrough from this study is the observed connection between the magnitude of the dipole moment in the arsenic\u2013oxygen bond and the material properties. Specifically, the As\u2013O bond dipole moment reaches its maximum in gallium arsenate, a known piezoelectric material.

Even at much lower NO3\u2212 concentrations of 5 mM and 1 mM, ammonia FEs over 70% are achieved. Besides, a promising ammonia FE of 81.8% is obtained in actual hydroponic wastewater with a low nitrate concentration (~700 ppm). When applied in a scaled-up flow electrolyzer, CuCo-Dtz/Vulcan successfully eliminates over 93% nitrate in hydroponic wastewater and lowers the nitrate level to comply with the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standard (\u2264 50 ppm).

Here, we establish a nanoflow liquid chromatography (nanoLC) platform coupled with trapped ion mobility spectrometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-TOF) for comprehensive lipid profiling from as little as 1 \u03bcL of plasma. Two commonly employed single-phase extraction protocols (MeOH:MTBE and IPA:H\u2082O) were scaled to microsample volumes using NIST\u00ae SRM\u00ae 1950 plasma, and the influence of mobile phase buffer concentration (10, 5, and 2 mM NH\u2084HCO\u2082) on lipid coverage and chromatographic performance was systematically evaluated. Multivariate analysis revealed solvent- and buffer-dependent shifts in lipid distributions, while manual annotation and verification based on ion mobility ensured precise lipid identification, even from small volumes. The optimized nanoLC-TIMS-TOF workflow achieved broad lipid class coverage, enhanced detection of low-abundance species, and improved separation of structurally similar lipids using only 1 \u03bcL of starting material. Compared to high-flow LC-MS approaches, similar lipid coverage was achieved at lower buffer concentrations, though ammonium adduct formation introduced distinct lipid-specific biases. These results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of nanoLC-TIMS-MS lipidomics for sample-limited applications.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A hierarchical SMILES\u2011encoded GEBF template library for both cyclic and acyclic functional groups enables chemically meaningful and efficient partitioning via structure conversion, macrocycle detection, substructure matching, and small\u2011fragment merging.

There is a growing need to control this phenomenon in nonplanar porphyrin systems due to the mounting interest in these systems as enzyme-mimics and organocatalysts. Hence, in this work the influence of steric bulk on the stability of nonplanar 5,10,15,20-tetraaryl-2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-porphyrin atropisomers was explored. The library of atropisomeric porphyrins synthesized herein emphasizes the delicate balance that must be achieved between steric bulk without inducing an undesired amount of macrocycle flexibility to obtain an atropisomer with a predictable rotational barrier. To overcome this challenge, a stabilization strategy was devised by exploiting metal coordination to the peripheral porphyrin functionalities, leading to an atroposelective superstructure formation.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Stereochemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Crystallography \u2013 Organic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this study, we synthesized a series of chiral boron-embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons featuring an asymmetric boron center intramolecularly coordinated by a proximal P=O moiety. The resulting tetracoordinate enantiomers exhibit high configurational stability, enabling optical resolution by chiral HPLC. Notably, these molecules display dual circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), arising from excited-state dissociation of the intramolecular P=O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B bond, which converts point chirality in the tetracoordinate state into C\u2013B axial chirality in the tricoordinate state. Taking advantage of the intrinsically superior photophysical properties of tricoordinate boranes, one derivative exhibited CPL with a high quantum yield, while another displayed red-shifted CPL extending toward the near-infrared region. Furthermore, the dynamic P=O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B coordination is highly sensitive to hydrogen-bonding ability and polarity of solvent, thereby giving rise to solvent-dependent dual CPL behavior. These findings establish a new strategy for exploiting reversible coordination in chiral boron-PAHs to access responsive chiroptical functionalities.", "date": "2025-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using the M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory, we evaluated their radical scavenging potentials through multiple thermodynamic descriptors associated with different antioxidant pathways, including hydrogen atom transfer (HAT),  sequential proton loss\u2013electron transfer (SPLET), single electron transfer\u2013proton transfer (SETPT), sequential proton loss\u2013hydrogen atom transfer (SPLHAT), and double hydrogen atom transfer (dHAT). The conformational analysis revealed that intramolecular hydrogen bonding significantly stabilizes geometries, influencing reactivity. Among all investigated compounds, baicalein and norwogonin, each containing three phenolic groups, exhibited the most favourable bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs), proton affinities (PAs) and ionisation potentials (IPs), particularly at the 6-OH and 8-OH positions, respectively. The study identifies key structure\u2013activity relationships, emphasizing the role of hydroxyl positions and their count as well as phenyl ring in modulating antioxidant efficiency. Molecular dynamics-derived solubility profiles reveal the preferential compatibility of flavones with nonpolar solvents, emphasizing the critical influence of the phenyl ring in modulating their solubility behavior.

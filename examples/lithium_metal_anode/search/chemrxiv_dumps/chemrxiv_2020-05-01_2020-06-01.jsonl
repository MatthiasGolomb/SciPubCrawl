Two physical aspects are examined in detail, namely the melting temperature and liquid shear viscosity. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of phase coexistence are used to predict the pressure-dependent melting temperature up to 5~GPa. Equilibrium simulations and the Green-Kubo formalism are used to obtain the temperature- and pressure-dependent liquid shear viscosity. Starting from a simplified continuum-based grain-scale model for HMX, we systematically increase the complexity of treatments for the solid-liquid phase transition and liquid shear viscosity in simulations of pore collapse. Using a realistic pressure-dependent melting temperature completely suppresses melting for supported shocks, which is otherwise predicted when treating it as a constant determined at atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, large melt pools form around pores during pressure release in unsupported shocks, even with a pressure-dependent melting temperature. Capturing the pressure dependence of the shear viscosity increases the peak temperature of melt pools by hundreds of Kelvin through viscous work. The complicated interplay of the solid-phase plastic work, solid-liquid phase transition, and liquid-phase viscous work identified here motivate taking a systematic approach to building increasingly complex grain-scale models and for guiding interpretation of predictions made using them.", "date": "2020-05-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Carbon-based Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Processes; Physical and Chemical Properties; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Electrophilicity and nucleophilicity indices, based on the HOMO \u2013 LUMO frontier orbitals, were successfully used to explain the simulation results. Zinc and copper-supplements act as electron donors (nucleophiles) towards the ACE2 (electrophile), whereas the S protein remains inert. Molecular iodine acts as a strong electron sink in all of its unstable adducts with the ACE2, or the S protein, and in its adduct with both. Iodine is a stand-in as an electron shield to the ACE2.

Full genome sequencing of the virus was done, and uploaded to be freely available for the world scientists to explore.

The results revealed Out of 9 ligands, 8 ligands (JFM, X77, RZG, HWH, T8A, 0EN, PEPTIDE and DMS) showed best ADME properties. These findings suggest that these ligands can be used as potential molecules for developing potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, which could be helpful in inhibiting the propagation of the COVID-19.

Hence, the study was\ndesigned to evaluate some plant-based active compounds for drug candidacy against\nSARS-CoV-2 by using virtual screening methods and various computational\nanalysis. A total of 27 plant metabolites were screened against SARS-Cov-2 main\nprotease proteins (MPP), Nsp9 RNA binding protein, spike receptor binding\ndomain, spike ecto-domain and <a href=\"https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LVN\">HR2 domain</a> using molecular docking approach.

The dynamic range of a sandwich LFIA is limited by the \u2018hook effect\u2019, according to which, test line signal intensities reduce with increasing analyte concentration beyond a threshold analyte concentration. Rey et al. (<i>Anal Chem</i>, 2017, 89(9)) have shown experimentally that the hook effect in sandwich LFIAs may be mitigated by real-time imaging of test and control line, but theoretical understanding of the transport phenomena that govern this phenomenon is lacking. In fact, transport phenomena at the control line of an LFIA have never been modelled. In this paper, we use a transport-reaction model to understand how the kinetics of signal generation at the test and control lines of an LFIA relate to analyte concentration. Using this model, we developed a method for determination of analyte concentration accurately over a much larger range than the traditional end-point detection method. The model was validated using a commercially available lateral flow assay (home pregnancy test) on which real time imaging was conducted using a time-lapse app on a smartphone; there was a strong agreement between the predictions of our model and experiments results. The newly developed readout method increased the dynamic range for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to 3 orders of magnitude (compared to ~1.5 orders of magnitude achieved by traditional end-point detection), without any modification to the test strip.</p>", "date": "2020-05-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the family of coronaviruses consisting of four structural and 16 non-structured proteins. Three non-structural proteins such as main protease, papain like protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are believed to play a crucial role in the virus replication. We applied a computational ligand-receptor binding modeling and performed a comprehensive virtual screening on the FDA-approved drugs against these three SARS-CoV-2 proteins using AutoDock Vina. Our computational studies indicated that Simeprevir, Ledipasvir, Idarubicin, Saquinavir, Ledipasivir, Partitaprevir, Glecaprevir, and Velpatasvir are all promising inhibitors, which displayed a lower binding energy (higher inhibitory effect) than Remdesivir, Lopinavir, and Ritonavir. However, we found that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which showed efficacy in treating the COVID-19 in recent clinical studies, had high binding energy with all three proteins, suggesting they may work through a different mechanism. We also identified several novel drugs as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, including antiviral Raltegravir; antidiabetic Amaryl; antibiotics Retapamulin, Rifimixin, and Rifabutin; antiemetic Fosaprepitant and Netupitant.

In spite of their potential in the medical field, there is no consensus on the best method for separating microvesicles from cell culture supernatant and complex biological fluids. Obtaining a good recovery yield and preserving physical characteristics is critical for the diagnostic and therapeutic use of EVs. The separation is made complex by the fact that blood and cell culture media, contain a large number of nanoparticles in the same size range. Methods that exploit immunoaffinity capture provide high purity samples and overcome the issues of currently used separation methods. However, the release of captured nanovesicles requires harsh conditions that hinder their use in certain types of downstream analysis. Herein, a novel capture and release approach for small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), based on DNAdirected immobilization of antiCD63 antibody is presented. The flexible DNAlinker increases the capture efficiency and allows releasing of EVs by exploiting the endonucleasic activity of DNAse I. This separation protocol works under mild conditions, enabling the release of intact vesicles that can be successfully analyzed by imaging techniques.

Understanding the relationship between a material's structure and functionality is an important step in the process, such that viable polymorphs for a given chemical composition need to be identified. Machine-learning based surrogate models have the potential to accelerate the search for polymorphs that target specific applications. Herein, we report a readily generalizable active-learning (AL) accelerated algorithm for identification of electrochemically stable iridium-oxide polymorphs of IrO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>3</sub>. The search is coupled to a subsequent analysis of the electrochemical stability of the discovered structures for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Structural candidates are generated by identifying all 956 structurally unique AB<sub>2</sub> and AB<sub>3</sub> prototypes in existing materials databases (more than 38000). Next, using an active learning approach we are able to find 196 IrO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs within the thermodynamic amorphous synthesizability limit and reaffirm the global stability of the rutile structure. We find 75 synthesizable IrO<sub>3</sub> polymorphs and report a previously unknown FeF<sub>3</sub>-type structure as the most stable, termed \u03b1-IrO<sub>3</sub>. To test the algorithms performance, we compare to a random search of the candidate space and report at least a twofold increase in the rate of discovery. Additionally, the AL approach can acquire the most stable polymorphs of IrO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>3</sub> with less than 30 density functional theory optimizations. Analysis of the structural properties of the discovered polymorphs reveals that octahedral local coordination environments are preferred for nearly all low energy structures.

The recent emergence of machine learning (ML)\npotentials may be a promising alternative. Useful ML models should not only estimate accurate interaction\nenergies, but also predict smooth and asymptotically correct potential energy surfaces. However, existing\nML models are not guaranteed to obey these constraints. Indeed, systemic deficiencies are apparent in the\npredictions of our previous hydrogen-bond model as well as the popular ANI-1X model, which we attribute\nto the use of an atomic energy partition.

The AP-Net model is developed using this physically motivated atomic-pairwise paradigm and\nalso exploits the interpretability of symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT).

The surface corona provides biological identity, physical structure, colloidal stability and a chemical scaffold for modification.  Understanding the structure and composition of the corona that surrounds nanoparticles enables rational design for applications.  Previous investigations examining biogenic nanoparticles have purported a coating comprised of biomolecules, however a defined structure is extremely limited.  We address this limitation through a detailed examination involving both <i>in situ</i> analyses of silver nanoparticle dispersions (indirect) produced by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> and desorbing the surface corona (direct).  Using a series of orthogonal characterization techniques we show evidence the surface corona of biogenic silver nanoparticles is comprised of a thin mixed layer of peptides and carbohydrates.

Although air pollution regulations typically target reducing emission factors rather than altering activity, the COVID-19 related closures offered a novel opportunity to observe and quantify the impact of activity levels of modifiable factors on ambient air pollution in real-time. We use data from a network of twenty-seven low-cost Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor packages deployed throughout urban and suburban Pittsburgh along with data from EPA regulatory monitors. The RAMP locations were divided into four site groups based on land use (High Traffic, Urban Residential, Suburban Residential, and Industrial). Concentrations of PM2.5, CO, and NO2 following the COVID-related closures at each site group were compared to measurements from \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d periods in March 2019 and 2020. Overall, PM2.5 concentrations decreased across the domain by 3 \u03bcg/m3. Intra-day variabilities of the pollutants were computed to attribute pollutant enhancements to specific emission sources (i.e. traffic and industrial emissions). There was no significant change in the industrial related intra-day variability of PM2.5 at the Industrial sites following the COVID-related closures. The morning rush hour induced CO and NO2 concentrations at the High Traffic sites were reduced by 57% and 43%, respectively, which is consistent with the observed reduction in commuter traffic (~50%).

Arguments for the hypotheses are based on computational methods: bioinformatics calculations searching for evidence that viral proteins share functional domains related to haem binding with human proteins, molecular modeling of viral proteins, and computational docking of these protein models with models of haem, porphyrin and haemoglobin. No experimental evidence is provided to support any of the conclusions. When interpreted according to accepted standards, these computational results do not hold up and do not provide support for the hypotheses. The interpretation of the search for shared functional domains suffers from a fundamental error in how the significance of the results is judged; when interpreted correctly, there is no evidence for these shared functional domains. Molecular modeling is carried out with tools that are easy to use but not best-in-class, and no allowance is made for uncertainty in the resulting atomic coordinates.

We selected Remdesivir (used in the treatment of Ebola) and Aspirochlorine (a natural product found in <i>Aspergillus oryzae)</i>, and their binding to specific peptide sequences of the coronavirus S-protein: ACE2 interface-drug binding adduct were calculated. The stable intermolecular adducts between the chosen drug molecules with the S protein and ACE2 result in limited host-virus interactions. The electrophilicity and nucleophilicity indices of the drugs showed that both drugs act as electron sinks to shield ACE2 from interacting with the S protein. Aspirochlorine acts as an electron acceptor (electrophile) toward both individual targets, the ACE2, and S proteins (nucleophiles). Aspirochlorine electronically shields ACE2 from the interaction with S protein by sinking the electronic charge of the S protein. The electrophilicity and nucleophilicity parameters of Remdesivir were higher than those of ACE2, and both molecules were bound via hydrogen bonding intermolecular interactions without intermolecular electron transfer. Remdesivir also shields ACE2 from the S protein. The results obtained strongly suggest the beneficial use of both drugs. The results reported indicate that the association of remdesivir with the target proteins was exothermic, while it was endothermic in the case of Aspirochlorine.

In many cases, precise control over a bicontinuous porous network on the 10-nm length scale is crucial for their operation. A particularly promising route for structure formation utilizes block copolymer (BCP) micelles in solution as sacrificial structure-directing agents for the co-assembly of inorganic precursors. This method offers pore size control via the molecular weight of the pore forming block and is compatible with broad materials library. On the other hand, the molecular weight dependence impedes continuous pore tuning and the intrinsic polymer dispersity presents challenges to the pore size homogeneity. To this end, we demonstrate how chromatographic fractionation of BCPs provides a powerful method to control the pore size and dispersity of the resulting mesoporous thin films. We apply a semi-preparative size exclusion chromatographic fractionation to a polydisperse poly(isobutylene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PIB-b-PEO) BCP obtained from scaled-up synthesis. The isolation of BCP fractions with distinct molecular weight and narrowed dispersity allowed us to not only tune the characteristic pore size from 9.1\u00b11.5 to 14.1\u00b12.1 nm with the identical BCP source material, but also significantly reduce the pore size dispersity compared to the non-fractionated BCP.

Cooper; Seb Sprick; Iain McCulloch; James R Durrant", "abstract": "Semiconducting polymers are versatile materials for solar energy conversion and have gained popularity as photocatalysts for sunlight-driven hydrogen production. Organic polymers often contain residual metal impurities such as palladium (Pd) clusters that are formed during the polymerization reaction, and there is increasing evidence for a catalytic role of such metal clusters in polymer photocatalysts. Using transient optical spectroscopies on nanoparticles of F8BT, P3HT, and the dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone homopolymer, P10, we demonstrate how differences in the timescale of electron transfer to Pd clusters translate into hydrogen evolution activity optima at extremely different residual Pd concentrations. For F8BT nanoparticles with common Pd concentrations of >1000 ppm (>0.1 wt. %), we find that residual Pd clusters quench photogenerated excitons via energy and electron transfer on the fs \u2013 ns timescale, thus outcompeting reductive quenching via the electron donor diethylamine in the solution phase. We spectroscopically identify reduced Pd clusters in our F8BT nanoparticles from the \u00b5s timescale onwards and show that the predominant location of long-lived electrons gradually shifts to the F8BT polymer when the Pd content is lowered. However, a low yield of long-lived electrons limits the hydrogen evolution activity of F8BT. P10, on the other hand, exhibits a substantially higher hydrogen evolution activity, which we demonstrate results from higher yields of long-lived electrons compared to F8BT due to more efficient reductive quenching. Surprisingly, and despite the higher performance of P10, long-lived electrons reside on the P10 polymer rather than on the Pd clusters in P10 particles, even at very high Pd concentrations of 27,000 ppm (2.7 wt. %). We show that these long-lived electrons in P10 react orders of magnitude slower at lower Pd levels, which suggests that their transfer to Pd sites constitutes a kinetic bottleneck and thus reveals a direction towards further improvements for this already very performant material. In contrast, long-lived electrons in F8BT already reside on Pd clusters before the typical timescale of hydrogen evolution. This comparison illustrates that P10 exhibits efficient reductive quenching but slow electron transfer to residual Pd clusters, whereas the opposite is the case for F8BT. We discuss possible reasons for this pronounced difference in the predominant location of long-lived electrons in F8BT and P10. Our results suggest that the development of even more efficient polymer photocatalysts should target materials that combine both rapid reductive quenching and rapid charge transfer to a metal-based co-catalyst.", "date": "2020-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Photochemistry (Org.); Organic Polymers; Photocatalysis; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science; Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Experimental determination of GAG-protein complexes remains difficult due to the considerable diversity in both carbohydrate linkage, and sulfation patterns. To complement existing methods of structural determination, we present our molecular docking tool, GlycoTorchVina (GTV), which demonstrates a substantial improvement at reproducing low energy conformations of GAGs compared with traditional docking programs. Based on the carbohydrate specific docking program VinaCarb (VC), GTV utilizes rotational energy functions, calculated using density functional theory (DFT), specifically designed for glycosidic linkages found in GAGs. The redocking accuracy of four programs (GTV, VC, AutoDock Vina and Glide) was tested over a set of 10 high-quality crystal structures containing co-crystallized GAGs (tetrasaccharides or longer). GTV outperformed other programs and was able to reproduce the native pose of eight structures and produced top-scoring docked poses that were on average only 1.8 \u00c5 RMSD away from the crystal structure. Although imitation of crystal structures is a standard test used for assessing the accuracy of docking programs, we illustrate how the underlying quality of the crystal structure, which is often overlooked during benchmarking, affects conclusions drawn from this approach. Statistical and theoretical investigations into charge-charge (\u201csalt-bridge\u201d) interactions are also presented.

This makes infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy a very powerful tool in life science. The strong absorption of infrared radiation of liquid water, however, still prevents to simply access the measured quantity \u2013 light scattered at the probing atomic force microscope tip.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with the SMD continuum solvation model demonstrate that T-705 prefers the aromatic enol form in solution over the ketone tautomer. Deprotonation constants for the conjugate acids of T-705 (pKas) are then evaluated, by combining the DFT/SMD calculations with accurate G4 gas-phase basicities.

This end-to-end learning approach eliminates the need for selection of molecular descriptors or structural groups, as it learns optimal fingerprints through graph convolutions and maps the fingerprints to the physico-chemical properties by deep learning. We develop GNN models for predicting three fuel ignition quality indicators, i.e., the derived cetane number (DCN), the research octane number (RON), and the motor octane number (MON), of oxygenated and non-oxygenated hydrocarbons. In light of limited experimental data in the order of hundreds, we propose a combination of multi-task learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning. The results show competitive performance of the proposed GNN approach compared to state-of-the-art QSPR models making it a promising field for future research.

The bulk modulus (i.e. the resistance to compression under hydrostatic pressure) of each MOF is determined by in situ diamond anvil cell (DAC) powder X-ray diffraction measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. These experiments reveal distinctive behavior of Ce-UiO-66 in response to pressures under one GPa. In situ DAC Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations support the observed differences in compressibility between Zr-UiO-66 and the Ce- analogue. Monitoring changes in bond lengths as a function of pressure through DFT simulations provides a clear picture of those which shorten more drastically under pressure and those which resist compression.

While design rules have been established for selecting electrolyte solvents and salt anions to establish a more robust SEI, the impact of altering cation identity is not well understood.

Yet, the natural phenoxazinone-based ommochrome pigment called xanthommatin displays a bathochromic (i.e. red) shift upon two-electron reduction to its corresponding phenoxazine, whose electronic origins are not completely disclosed. In this study, we investigated, at quantum chemical level, a series of phenoxazinone/phenoxazine pairs that was previously explored by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Sch\u00e4fer and Geyer, 1972), and which displays different hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts upon reduction.

Our findings therefore suggest new potential ways to adjust the color-changing ability of phenoxazinones in technological contexts.

In molecular simulations of gas adsorption/diffusion in MOFs, the adsorbate-MOF electrostatic interaction is typically modeled by placing partial point charges on the atoms of the MOF. For the virtual screening of large libraries of MOFs, it is critical to develop computationally inexpensive methods to assign atomic partial charges to MOFs that accurately reproduce the electrostatic potential in their pores. Herein, we design and train a message passing neural network (MPNN) to predict the atomic partial charges on MOFs under a charge neutral constraint. A set of ca. 2,250 MOFs labeled with high-fidelity partial charges, derived from periodic electronic structure calculations, serves as training examples. In an end-to-end manner, from charge-labeled crystal graphs representing MOFs, our MPNN machine-learns features of the local bonding environments of the atoms and learns to predict partial atomic charges from these features. Our trained MPNN assigns high-fidelity partial point charges to MOFs with orders of magnitude lower computational cost than electronic structure calculations. To enhance the accuracy of virtual screenings of large libraries of MOFs for their adsorption-based applications, we make our trained MPNN model and MPNN-charge-assigned computation-ready, experimental MOF structures publicly available.<br />", "date": "2020-05-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our herein disclosed dispersion corrected DFT studies show the anthracene transfer to take place in a synchronous retro Diels-Alder/Diels-Alder reaction: an anthracene molecule dissociates from one fullerene under formation of an intermediate, while already undergoing stabilizing interactions with both neighboring fullerenes, facilitating the reaction kinetically. In the intermediate, a planar anthracene molecule is sandwiched between two neighboring fullerenes and forms equally strong \"double-decker\" type pi-pi stacking interactions with both of these fullerenes. Analysis with the distorsion interaction model shows that the anthracene unit of the intermediate is almost planar with minimal distorsions.

A series of tests were done to examine the robustness of the predictor models, to demonstrate the continuity of the latent material space, and its ability to generate materials exhibiting target property values.

COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\nCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As per the report from the WHO, more than 4.5\nmillion people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 with more than 3,00,000 deaths across\nthe globe. As of now, there is no therapeutic drug or vaccine approved for the\ntreatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, the outbreak of COVID-19 poses a\nmassive threat to humans. Due to the time taking process of new drug design and\ndevelopment, drug repurposing might be the only viable solution to tackle\nCOVID-19. RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzes SARS-CoV-2 RNA\nreplication, <i>i.e.</i> the synthesis of\nsingle-stranded RNA genomes, an absolutely necessary step for the survival and\ngrowth of the virus. Thus, RdRp is an obvious target for antiviral drug design.\nInterestingly, several plant-derived polyphenols have been shown to inhibit\nenzymatic activities of RdRp of various RNA viruses including polio-virus type\n1, parainfluenza virus type 3, and respiratory syncytial virus etc. More\nimportantly, natural polyphenols have been used as a dietary supplementation\nfor humans for a long time and played a beneficial role in immune homeostasis.\nTherefore, we were curious to study the binding of dietary polyphenols with\nRdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and assess their potential as an effective therapy for\nCOVID-19. In this present work, we made a library of twenty potent polyphenols that\nhave shown substantial therapeutic effects against various diseases.

The study reveals that EGCG, quercetagetin,\nand myricetin strongly bind to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Our studies\nsuggest that EGCG, quercetagetin, and myricetin can inhibit RdRp and represent\nan effective therapy for COVID-19. </p>", "date": "2020-05-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Natural Products; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In theory, targeting human proteins should provide an advantage over targeting viral proteins in terms of drug resistance, which is commonly a problem in treating RNA viruses. This paper focuses on the human protein TMPRSS2, which supports coronavirus life cycles by cleaving viral spike proteins. The three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 is not known and so we have generated models of the TMPRSS2 in the apo state as well as in complex with a peptide substrate and putative inhibitors to aid future work. Importantly, many related human proteases have 80% or higher identity with TMPRSS2 in the S1-S1\u2019 subsites, with plasminogen and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) having 95% identity. We highlight 376 approved, investigational or experimental drugs targeting S1A serine proteases that may inhibit TMPRSS2. Whilst the presence of a relatively uncommon lysine residue in the S2/S3 subsites means that many serine protease inhibitors may not inhibit TMPRSS2, this is likely to provide a handle for selective targeting. We discuss how experimental drugs targeting related serine proteases might be repurposed as TMPRSS2 inhibitors to treat coronaviruses. </p><div><br /></div>", "date": "2020-05-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we characterize two strategies for combating these challenges during IMS experiments on a hybrid QqFT-ICR MS. In one iteration, the mass resolving capabilities of a quadrupole mass filter are used to selectively enrich for ions of interest via a technique previously termed continuous accumulation of selected ions (CASI). Secondly, we have introduced a supplemental dipolar AC waveform to the quadrupole mass filter of a commercial QqFT-ICR mass spectrometer to perform selected ion ejection prior to the ion accumulation region. This setup allows the selective ejection of the most abundant ion species prior to ion accumulation, thereby greatly improving the molecular depth with which IMS can probe tissue samples.<br />", "date": "2020-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The unavailability of vaccines and the virus-specific drugs has created an opportunity to repurpose existing drugs to examine their efficacy in controlling the virus activities. Here, the inhibition of the RdRp viral protein responsible for the replication of the virus in host cells is examined by evaluating the binding patterns of various approved and investigational antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-cancer drugs by using the molecular docking approach. Some of these drugs have been proposed to be effective against the SARS-Cov-2 virus infection. In an attempt to discover new antiviral agents, artificially expanded genetic alphabets (AEGIS) such as dP, dZ, dJ, dV, dX, dK, dB, dS, dP4, and dZ5 and different sequences of these nucleotides were also docked into the active site of the RdRp protein. It is found that among the various approved and investigational drugs, the Clevudine, N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), 2'-C-methylcytidine, EIDD-2801, Uprifosbuvir, Balapiravir, Acalabrutinib, BMS-986094, Remdesivir (full drug), GS-6620, and Ceforanide would act as potent inhibitors of the RdRp protein. Similarly, among the AEGIS nucleotides, dB, dJ, dP, dK, dS, dV, and dZ are found to inhibit the RdRp protein efficiently. It is further found that sequences containing up to three artificial nucleotides can also inhibit the RdRp viral protein. As these unnatural nucleotides are foreign molecules for the cells, their replication in host cells may not occur naturally, and hence these may act as potent drugs for the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in vivo evaluation of these drugs and artificial nucleotides are required against SARS-CoV-2 before prescribing them to the infected patients.", "date": "2020-05-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for being highly contagious and exhibiting tighter binding with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). The entry of the virus into host cells is mediated by the interaction of its spike protein with hACE-2. Thus, a peptide that has a resemblance to hACE-2 but can overpower the spike protein-hACE-2 interaction will be a potential therapeutic to contain this virus. The non-interacting residues in the receptor-binding domain of hACE-2 have been mutated to generate a library of 136 new peptides. Out of this library, docking and virtual screening discover seven peptides that can exert a stronger interaction with the spike protein than hACE-2. A peptide derived from simultaneous mutation of all the non-interacting residues of hACE-2 yields two-fold stronger interaction than hACE-2 and thus turns out here to be the best peptide-inhibitor of the novel coronavirus.

Natural products have long been used in traditional medicines to treat various diseases, and purified phytochemicals from medicinal plants provide a valuable scaffold for the discovery of new drug leads. In the present study, we performed a computational screening of an in-house database composed of ~1000 phytochemicals derived from traditional Saudi medicinal plants with recognised antiviral activity. Structure-based virtual screening was carried out against three druggable SARS-CoV-2 targets, viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) and papain like protease (PLpro) to identify putative inhibitors that could facilitate the development of potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates.

They pass through conventional wastewater treatment processes and present a risk to aquatic ecosystems and humans. Point-source remediation of source-separated urine provides a promising alternative to destroy pharmaceuticals before dilution with wastewater. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are one possible option for degrading pharmaceuticals in urine, but they often lead to the formation of oxidation byproducts (OBPs) including chlorate, perchlorate, and halogenated organics at hazardous concentrations due to high background chloride concentrations. Here, we show that the high urea content of fresh human urine suppresses the formation of oxychlorides by inhibiting formation of HOCl/OCl\u2012 during electrolysis, while still enabling the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by \u2022OH due to the slow rate of urea oxidation by \u2022OH. This results in improved performance when compared to equivalent treatment of hydrolyzed aged urine. This (primarily indirect) electrochemical oxidation scheme is shown to degrade the model pharmaceuticals cyclophosphamide and sulfamethoxazole with surface-area-to-volume-normalized pseudo-first-order observed rate constants greater than 0.08 cm/min in authentic fresh human urine matrixes. It results in two orders-of-magnitude decrease in pharmaceutical concentrations in 2 hours while generating three orders-of-magnitude lower oxychloride byproduct concentrations in synthetic fresh urine as compared to synthetic hydrolyzed aged urine matrixes. Importantly, this proof-of-principle shows that simple and safe electrochemical methods can be used for point-source-remediation of pharmaceuticals in fresh human urine (before storage and hydrolysis), without formation of significant oxychloride byproducts. <br /></p>", "date": "2020-05-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Environmental Science; Electrochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A comparison of different buffer effects on the in vitro release reveals that it is crucial to choose the right buffer for determining the loaded cargo release in each pH zone (acidic, neutral and basic). Clearly, choosing the wrong combination of buffers for different pH zones would result in completely different interpretation of the release behaviour.</p><div><br /></div>", "date": "2020-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biocompatible Materials; Biodegradable Materials; Controlled-Release Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We perform a detailed analysis of the potential energy surfaces with special focus on the role of triplet states considering the crystal structure, intermolecular interactions, exciton couplings and reorganisation energies in the vacuum and solid state. In contrast with other members of the propeller-shaped family, nonradiative decay in TPT is driven by bond breaking. Because of the significant spin-orbit couplings along the reaction coordinate, intersystem crossing plays an important role in the mechanism. Our calculations show that aggregation in the solid state hampers the access to internal conversion pathways, however, intersystem crossing is active in the crystal phase, which explains the weak AIE of this molecule.

Binding of SARS-Cov-2 to ACE2 involves the viral Spike protein. The molecular interaction between ACE2 and Spike has been resolved. Interfering with this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. Inhibition of this interaction can be attained via multiple routes: here we focus on identifying small molecules that would prevent the interaction. Specifically we focus on small molecules and peptides that have the capacity to effectively bind the ACE2: RBD contact domain to prevent and reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell. We aim to identify molecules that prevent the docking of viral spike protein (mediated by RBD) onto cells expressing ACE2, without inhibiting the activity of ACE2. We utilize the most recent ACE2-RBD crystallography resolved model (PDB-ID:6LZG). Based on animal susceptibility data we narrowed down our interest to the location of amino acid 34 (Histidine) located on ACE2. We performed an in silico screen of a chemical library of compounds with several thousand small molecules including FDA approved compounds. All compounds were tested for binding to the proximal binding site located close to histidine 34 on ACE2. We report a list of four potential small molecules that potentially have the capacity to bind target residue: AY-NH2, a selective PAR4 receptor agonist peptide (CAS number: 352017-71-1), NAD+ (CAS number: 53-84-9), Reproterol, a short-acting \u03b22 adrenoreceptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma (CAS number: 54063-54-6), and Thymopentin, a synthetic immune-stimulant which enhances production of thymic T cells (CAS number: 69558-55-0). The focus is on a High Throughput Screen Assay (HTSA), or in silico screen, delineating small molecules that are selectively binding/masking the crucial interface residue on ACE2 at His34. Consequently, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to host ACE2 and viral entry is a potent strategy to reduce cellular entry of the virus. We suggest that this anti-viral nature of this interaction is a viable strategy for COVID19 whereas the small molecules including peptides warrant further in vitro screens.", "date": "2020-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In molecular simulations the usual approach is to\ncompute the free energy (FE) profile of a molecule across a model lipid bilayer, which can then be used to\nestimate the permeability of the molecule. Umbrella sampling (US), which involves carrying out a series of\nbiased simulations along a defined reaction coordinate (usually the bilayer normal direction), is a popular\nmethod for the computation of such FE profiles. However, US can be challenging to implement because\nthe results are dependent on the strength of the biasing potential and the spacing of windows along the\nreaction coordinate, which, in practice, are usually optimized by an inefficient trial and error approach. The\nSteered Molecular Dynamics implementation of the Jarzynski Equality (JE-SMD) has been identified as an\nalternative to equilibrium sampling methods for measuring the FE change across a reaction coordinate. In\nthe JE-SMD approach, equilibrium FE values are evaluated from the average of rapid non-equilibrium trajectories, thus avoiding the practical issues that come with US. Here, we use three different corrections of the\nJE-SMD method to calculate the FE change for the translocation of two aromatic substrates, phenylalanine\nand toluene, across a lipid bilayer, and compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of these approaches\nto the results obtained using US. We show evidence that when computing the free energy profile, the JE-SMD\napproach suffers from insufficient sampling convergence of the bilayer environment, and is dependent on the\ncharacteristic of the aromatic substrate itself. We deduce that, despite its drawbacks, US remains the more\nviable approach of the two for computing the FE profile.", "date": "2020-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To obtain insight into this relation and to assess its viability as a foundation for a new spectroscopic method, NSOR of a set of hydrocarbon molecules with various structural motifs is theoretically investigated using density functional theory calculations. The results reveal that NSOR intensities are correlated with several structural features of the molecules, such as the position of the nucleus in the carbon chain, isomerism and presence of nearby unsaturated groups. Specific patterns connecting NSOR to the local chemical environment of the nucleus can be observed. It is also shown that this effect can be to a good approximation modelled as a sum of individual contributions from nearby chemical groups, allowing for a rapid estimation of its values.

This is due to the complex interplay between the charge-transfer (CT) and singlet excitons. In this study, we present a general strategy to tune the emission color of a single-fluorophore aggregate by controlled radical polymerization-mediated charge transfer. Using a library of well-defined styrenic donor (D) polymers grown from an acceptor (A) fluorophore by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), we found that the solid-state emission color can be fine-tuned by varying three molecular parameters: (i) the monomer substituent, (ii) the end-groups of the polymer, and (iii) the polymer chain length. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the color tunability originates from the structurally dependent through-space charge transfer (TSCT) process that regulates CT energy.

However, the determination and\ninterpretation of the apparent activation energy in multistep reactions is not an easy task. For\nthis purpose, the concept of degree of rate control is convenient, which comprises a\nmathematical approach for analyzing reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics. Although\nthis concept has been used in catalysis, it has not yet been applied in electrocatalytic systems,\nwhose ability to control the potential across the solid/liquid interface is the main difference\nwith heterogenous catalysis, and the electrical current is commonly used as a measure of the\nreaction rate.

For this, an electrokinetic\nmodel Langmuir-Hinshelwood-like is used for making numerical experiments and verifying the\nproposed ideas. The results show that to improve the catalytic activity of an electrode\nmaterial, it must act upon the reaction steps with the highest normalised absolute values of\ndegree of rate control.

As a consequence, P immobilization could occur which eventually leads to P inefficiency and thus unavailability to plants with strong implications on the global food system. A molecular level understanding of the mechanisms of the P binding to soil mineral surfaces could be a key for the development of novel strategies for more efficient P application. Much experimental work has been done to understand P binding to several reactive and abundant minerals especially goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH). On the other hand, atomistic modeling of the P-mineral molecular systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is emerging as a new tool which provides more detailed information regarding the mechanisms, nature, and strength of these binding processes. The present study characterize the binding of the most abundant organic phosphates in forest soils, inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) and glycerolphosphate (GP), to the 100 diaspore (\u03b1-AlOOH) surface plane. Here, different molecular models have been introduced to simulate typical situations for the P-binding at the diaspore/water interface. For all models, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) based MD simulations have been performed to explore the diaspore\u2013IHP/GP\u2013water interactions. The results provide evidence for the formation of monodentate (M) and bidentate (B) motifs for GP and M and as well as two monodentate (2M) motifs for IHP with the surface. The calculated interaction energies suggest that GP and IHP prefer to form the B and 2M motif, respectively. Moreover, IHP exhibited stronger binding than GP with diaspore and water. Further, the role of water in controlling binding strengths via promoting of specific binding motifs, formation of H-bonds, adsorption and dissociation at the surface, as well as proton transfer processes is demonstrated. Finally, the P-binding at the 100 diaspore surface plane is weaker than that at the 010 plane highlighting the influential role of the coordination number of Al atoms at the top surface of diaspore.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2020-05-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A detailed understanding of the associated molecular mechanisms would also help to design enzymes optimized for biotechnological processes. Despite important advances, a comprehensive picture of how thermophilic enzymes succeed in functioning under extreme temperatures remains incomplete. Here, we examine the temperature dependence of stability and of flexibility in the mesophilic monomeric Escherichia coli (Ec) and thermophilic dimeric Thermotoga maritima (Tm) homologs of the paradigm dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme. We use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and a replica-exchange scheme that allows to enhance the conformational sampling while providing at the same time a detailed understanding of the enzymes' behavior at increasing temperatures. We show that this approach reproduces the stability shift between the two homologs, and provides a molecular description of the denaturation mechanism by identifying the sequence of secondary structure elements melting as temperature increases, which is not straightforwardly obtained in the experiments. By repeating our approach on the hypothetical TmDHFR monomer, we further determine the respective effects of sequence and oligomerization in the exceptional stability of TmDFHR. We show that the intuitive expectation that protein flexibility and thermal stability are correlated is not verified. Finally, our simulations reveal that significant conformational fluctuations already take place much below the melting temperature. While the difference between the TmDHFR and EcDHFR catalytic activities is often interpreted via a simplified two-state picture involving the open and closed conformations of the key M20 loop, our simulations suggest that the two homologs' markedly different activity temperature dependences are caused by changes in the ligand-cofactor distance distributions in response to these conformational changes.", "date": "2020-05-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Levine; Francoise Remacle", "abstract": "Quantum parallelism can be implemented on a classical ensemble of discrete level quantum systems. The nano systems are not quite identical and the ensemble represents their individual variability. An underlying Lie algebraic theory is developed using the closure of the algebra to demonstrate the parallel information processing at the level of the ensemble. The ensemble is addressed by a sequence of laser pulses. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics the coherence between the N levels of a given quantum system can be handled as an observable. Thereby there are N2 logic variables per N level system. This is how massive parallelism is achieved in that there are N2 potential outputs for a quantum system of N levels. The use of an ensemble allows simultaneous reading of such outputs. Due to size dispersion the expectation values of the observables can differ somewhat from system to system. We show that for a moderate variability of the systems one can average the N2 expectation values over the ensemble while retaining closure and parallelism. This allows directly propagating in time the ensemble averaged values of the observables. Results of simulations of electronic excitonic dynamics in an ensemble of quantum dot, QD, dimers are presented. The QD size and interdot distance in the dimer are used to parametrize the Hamiltonian. The dimer N levels include local and charge transfer excitons within each dimer.

To decipher the mechanisms of cooperative ligand binding it is necessary to define, at a microscopic level, the thermodynamic consequences of binding of each ligand to its energetically coupled site(s). However, extracting these microscopic constants is difficult for macromolecules with more than two binding constants. This goal is complicated because the observable (e.g., NMR chemical shift changes, fluorescence, enthalpy) can be altered by allostery, thereby distorting its proportionality to populations of states. Because it measures mass, native mass spectrometry (MS) can directly quantify the populations of homo-oligomeric protein species with different numbers of bound ligands, provided the populations are proportional to ion counts and that MS-compatible electrolytes do not alter the overall thermodynamics. These measurements can help decipher allosteric mechanisms by providing unparalleled access to the statistical thermodynamic partition function. We used native MS (nMS) to study the cooperative binding of tryptophan (Trp) to Bacillus stearothermophilus trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP), a ring-shaped homo-oligomeric protein complex with 11 identical binding sites. Mass spectrometrycompatible solutions did not significantly perturb protein structure and thermodynamics as assessed by ITC and NMR spectroscopy. Populations of Trpn-TRAP11 states were quantified as a function of Trp concentration by native mass spectrometry. Population distributions cannot be explained by a non-cooperative binding model but are well described by a nearest neighbor cooperative model. Non-linear least-squares fitting of the populations to a mechanistic model yielded microscopic thermodynamic constants that define the interactions between neighboring binding sites that result in homotropic cooperativity in Trp binding to TRAP.", "date": "2020-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A low cost and water-soluble polymer, hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), was added in varying quantities into the synthesis reaction to achieve >200% particle size enlargement with controlled crystal morphology. The modified adsorbent, MIL-96-RHPAM2, was systematically characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET and TGA-MS. Using activated carbon (AC) as a reference adsorbent, the effectiveness of MIL-96-RHPAM2 for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) removal from water was examined. The study confirms stable morphology of hydrated MIL-96-RHPAM2 particles as well as a superior PFOA adsorption capacity (340 mg/g) despite its lower surface area, relative to standard MIL-96. MIL-96-RHPAM2 suffers from slow adsorption kinetics as the modification significantly blocks pore access. The strong adsorption of PFOA by MIL-96-RHPAM2 was associated with the formation of electrostatic bonds between the anionic carboxylate of PFOA and the amine functionality present in the HPAM backbone.

Liao\u2019s photoacid (1) represents the archetype of mPAHs, and is being widely used on account of its unique capability to change the acidity of aqueous solutions reversibly. The behavior of 1 in water, however, still remains poorly understood. Herein, we provide in-dept insights on the thermodynamics and kinetics of 1 in water through a series of comparative 1H NMR and UV-Vis studies and relative modelling. Under dark conditions, we quantified a three-component equilibrium system where the dissociation (Ka) of the open protonated form (MCH) is followed by isomerization (Kc) of the open deprotonated form (MC) to the closed spiropyran form (SP) \u2013 i.e., in the absence of light, the ground state acidity can be expressed as KaGS = Ka(1+Kc). On the other hand, under powerful and continuous light irradiation we were able to assess, for the first time experimentally, the dissociation constant (KaMS) of the protonated metastable state (cis-MCH). In addition, we found that thermal ring-opening of SP is always rate-determining regardless of pH, whereas hydrolysis is reminiscent of what is found for Schiff bases. The proposed methodology is general, and it was applied to other two compounds bearing a shorter (ethyl, 2) and a longer (butyl, 3) alkyl-1-sulfonate bridge. We found that the pKa remains constant, whereas both pKc and pKaMS linearly increase with the length of the alkyl bridge. Importantly, all results are consistent with a four-component model cycle, which describes perfectly the full dynamics of proton release/uptake of 1\u20123 in water. The superior hydrolytic stability and water solubility of compound 3, together with its relatively high pKaGS (low Kc), allowed us to achieve fully reversible jumps of 2.5 pH units over 18 consecutive cycles (6 hours).", "date": "2020-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Photochemistry (Org.); Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Tailoring channelrhodopsins for such applications includes the tuning of the absorption maximum. In order to establish rational design and to obtain a desired spectral shift, a basic understanding of the absorption spectrum is required. We have studied the chimera C1C2 as a representative of this protein family and the first member with an available crystal structure. For this purpose, we sampled the conformations of C1C2 using QM/MM molecular dynamics, and subjected the resulting snapshots of the trajectory to excitation energy calculations using ADC(2) and simplified TD-DFT.

Although many policies and regulations on air quality have been promulgated worldwide over the past decades, airborne pollution still negatively affects health and therefore the life-style of human beings. One of the strategies to challenge this problem might be reducing the amount of airborne pollutant by mineralising them via photoinduced reactions. Photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous pollutants <i>via</i> titanium dioxide is one of the most investigated solar photochemical reactions. In this research work, by means of a green sol-gel procedure, we have coupled titania to graphene (0.5 and 1.0 wt%) aiming to increase the solar photocatalytic activity of the produced hybrid materials. The photocatalytic reactions were assessed by monitoring the removal of nitrogen oxides and two different volatile organic compounds (benzene and isopropanol). Photocatalytic mechanism was investigated by means of EPR\nspin trapping experiments.Our results highlight the exceptional characteristics of the TiO2/graphene hybrid material (1.0 wt% graphene), and its suitability for multi-purpose applications in the field of environmental remediation.

Adaptive-partitioning (AP) methods extend the applicability of QM/MM, allowing active zones to change during the simulation. AP methods achieve continuous potential energy surface (PES) by introducing buffer regions in which atoms have both QM and MM characters. Most of the existing AP-QM/MM methods require multiple QM calculations per time step, which can be expensive for systems with many atoms in buffer regions. Although one can lower the computational cost by grouping atoms into fragments, this may not be possible for all systems, especially for applications in covalent solids. The SISPA method [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017, 13, 2342] differs from other AP-QM/MM methods by only requiring one QM calculation per time step, but it has the flaw that the QM charge density and wavefunction near the buffer/MM boundary tend to those of isolated atoms/fragments. Besides, regular QM/MM methods for treating covalent bonds cut by the QM/MM boundary are incompatible with SISPA. Due to these flaws, SISPA in its original form cannot treat covalently bonded systems properly. In this work, I show that a simple modification to the SISPA method improves the treatment of covalently bonded systems.

In fact, the binding affinity of Rutin was much\nhigher than Chloroquine (1000 times) and Hydroxychloroquine (100 times) and was\ncomparable to that of the reference drug Remdesivir, which is in clinical\ntrials to treat COVID-19 patients. The results suggest that natural compounds\nsuch as flavonoids have the potential to be developed as novel inhibitors of\nSARS-CoV-2 with a comparable potency as that of Remdesivir. However, their\nclinical usage on COVID-19 patients is a subject of further investigations and\nclinical trials.</p><br /><p></p>", "date": "2020-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The orthodox Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) model and its many derivatives invariably picture the double layer as a serial connection of a compact layer and a diffuse layer. We unravel herein that the serial connection tacitly prescribes a zero potential gradient at the solution-side boundary, which is, rigorously speaking, invalid. The bearing of this problematic assumption is pinpointed by comparing the double-layer impedance, which is analytically solved at the potential of zero charge, derived from the original and amended GCS models. Specifically, in the amended GCS model, the capacitance of the compact layer now shows frequency dispersion. The deviation between the original and amended models is greater when the double layer is confined in narrower space.", "date": "2020-05-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

P. White; Paulo J. Costa; Mark Crimmin", "abstract": "Non-catalysed and catalysed reactions of aluminium reagents with furans, dihydrofurans and dihydropyrans were investigated and lead to the ring-expanded products due to the formal insertion of the aluminium reagent into a C\u2013O bond of the heterocycle. Specifically, the reaction of [{(ArNCMe)2CH}Al] (Ar = 2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl, 1) with furan, 2-methylfuran, 2,3-dimethylfuran and 2-methoxyfuran proceeded between 25 and 80 \u00baC leading to ring-expanded and dearomatised products due to the net transformation of a sp2 C\u2013O bond into a sp2 C\u2013Al bond. The kinetics of the reaction of 1 with furan were found to be 1st order with respect to 1 with activation parameters \u0394H\u2021 = +19.7 (\u00b1 2.7) kcal mol-1, \u0394S\u2021 = \u201318.8 (\u00b1 7.8) cal K-1 mol-1 and \u0394G\u2021298 K = +25.3 (\u00b1 0.5) kcal mol-1 and a KIE of 1.0 \u00b1 0.1. DFT calculations support a stepwise mechanism involving an initial (4+1) cycloaddition of 1 with furan to form a bicyclic intermediate that rearranges by an a-migration. The selectivity of ring-expansion is influenced by factors that weaken the sp2 C\u2013O bond through population of the s*-orbital. Inclusion of [Pd(PCy3)2] as a catalyst in these reactions results in expansion of the substrate scope to include 2,3-dihydrofurans and 3,4-dihydropyrans but also improves the selectivity. Under catalysed conditions, the C\u2013O bond that breaks is that adjacent to C\u2013H bond. The aluminium(III) dihydride reagent [{(MesNCMe)2CH}AlH2] (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl, 2) can also be used under catalytic conditions to effect a dehydrogenative ring-expansion of furans. Further mechanistic analysis of the Pd-catalysed reaction of 1 with furan shows that C\u2013O bond functionalisation occurs via an initial C\u2013H bond alumination. Kinetic products can be isolated that are derived from installation of the aluminium reagent at the 2-position of the heterocycle. C\u2013H alumination proceeds with a strong primary KIE of 4.8 \u00b1 0.3 consistent with a turnover limiting step involving oxidative addition of the C\u2013H bond to a palladium catalyst. Isomerisation of the kinetic C\u2013H aluminated product to the thermodynamic C\u2013O ring expansion product is an intramolecular process that is again catalysed by [Pd(PCy3)2]. DFT calculations suggest that the key C\u2013O bond breaking step involves attack of an aluminium based metalloligand on the 2-palladated heterocycle.

However, critical debates remain on the use of the O-K pre-edge variations upon electrochemical cycling as evidences of oxygen redox reactions, which has been a popular practice in the battery field. This study presents an investigation of the O-K pre-edge of 55 oxides covering all 3d TMs with different elements, structures and electrochemical states through combined experimental and theoretical analyses. It is shown unambiguously that the O-K pre-edge variation in battery cathodes is dominated by changing TM-d states. Furthermore, the pre-edge enables a unique opportunity to project the lowest unoccupied TM-d states onto one common energy window, leading to a summary map of the relative energy positions of the low-lying TM states, with higher TM oxidation states at lower energies, corresponding to higher electrochemical potentials. The results naturally clarify some unusual redox reactions, such as Cr<sup>3+/6+</sup>.

{"title": "Tripartite combination of potential pandemic mitigation agents: Vitamin D, Quercetin, and Estradiol manifest properties of candidate medicinal agents for mitigation of the severity of pandemic COVID-19 defined by genomics-guided tracing of SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells.", "doi": "10.26434/chemrxiv.12052512.v11", "published_doi": "10.3390/BIOMEDICINES8050129", "published_url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8050129", "authors": "Gennadi Glinsky", "abstract": "<p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Genes\nrequired for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, <i>ACE2</i> and <i>FURIN</i>, were\nemployed as baits to build genomics-guided molecular maps of up-stream\nregulatory elements, their expression and functions in human body, including\npathophysiologically-relevant cell types. Repressors and activators of the <i>ACE2</i> and <i>FURIN</i> genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing\nand overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models.\nPanels of repressors (<i>VDR; GATA5; SFTPC;\nHIF1a</i>) and activators (<i>HMGA2; INSIG1</i>)\nwere then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting gene expression\nsignatures of the potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this\nstrategy, Vitamin D and Quercetin have been identified as putative COVID-19\nmitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring\ncandidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene\nSet Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating\nthat highly similar structurally Quercetin, Luteolin, and Eriodictyol could\nserve as scaffolds for development of efficient inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2\ninfection. In agreement with this notion, Quercetin alters expression of 98 of\n332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus\npotentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral\nproteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of\n19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332\n(25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the\npotential effects of both Quercetin and Vitamin D, the inference could be made\nthat functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be\naltered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease\nconditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting\nagents. Discordant patterns of Testosterone versus Estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2\ntargets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male\nmortality during coronavirus pandemic. Estradiol, in contrast with\nTestosterone, affects expression of a majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%)\nencoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26\nof 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination\nconsisting of Quercetin/Vitamin D/Estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332\n(73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. Of major concern is the ACE2 and\nFURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells,\nsuggesting that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus may infect a broad range of cellular\ntargets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause\nimmunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus\nto secondary targets. Present analyses and numerous observational studies\nindicate that age-associated Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to high\nmortality of older adults and elderly. Immediate availability for targeted\nexperimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic\nmitigation agents, namely Vitamin D and Quercetin, as well as of the highly\nselective (K<sub>i, </sub>600 pm) intrinsically-specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin\nPortland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported\nin this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental\nstudies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate\ntherapeutically-viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically,\ngene expression profiles of Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their\nestablished safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly\nargue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of\ntheir potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents.

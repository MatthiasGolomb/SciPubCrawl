In this work, we evaluate the relationship between the polymer structure and their coil dimensions, and explore new polymers based on these relations. Coil dimensions are important features of polymers which affect their performance in various applications, including drug delivery, waste-water treatment, and engine oils. Coil dimensions of the polyolefins are dependent on the number, size, and stereo orientation of side chains along the backbone. Thus, controlling these attributes allows us to tailor the coil dimensions of polyolefins. In the proposed scheme, we calculate the radius of gyration (<i>R<sub>g</sub></i>) of polyolefin chains using molecular dynamics simulations and validate against experimental results. Simulated annealing is implemented to ensure the capture of different configurations. This model affords the ability to quantify the effect tacticity has on the coil dimensions of polyolefins. The results show the suppression of tacticity effects when the polymer chains transition to bottlebrush structures, demonstrating that the side chain steric hindrance plays an important role in the rigidity of the chain backbone. Further, the model is used to evaluate the compositional effects by determining the rigidity of propylene and 1-hexene copolymers. Combining our model with virtual high-throughput screening techniques, we evaluated the coiling behavior of hundreds of new polymers.

The reagent ion source uses a low-pressure discharge. The FIMR consists of a glass tube with a resistive coating, mounted inside a radio-frequency (RF) quadrupole.

The HAQC approach makes use of heuristic kinetic criteria for selecting reaction paths that are not only plausible, that is, consistent with the empirical rules of organic reactivity, but also feasible under the reaction conditions. In this work, we develop heuristic kinetic feasilibity criteria, which correctly predict feasible reaction pathways for a wide range of simple polar (substitutions, additions, and eliminations) and pericyclic organic reactions (cyclizations, sigmatropic shifts, and cycloadditions). In contrast to knowledge-based reaction mechanism prediction methods, the same kinetic heuristics are successful in classifying reaction pathways as feasible or infeasible across this diverse set of reaction mechanisms.

The errors in SMD solvation energies predicted using NDDO-based methods is considerably larger than when using DFT and HF, with RMSE values of 3.4-5.9 (neutrals) and 6-15 kcal/mol (ions) compared to 2.4 and ca 5 kcal/mol for HF/6-31G(d).

The synthesis was achieved using chronoamperometry to apply a constant voltage of 0.8V vs. Ag/AgCl (BASi) to oxidatively polymerize the pyrrole monomer to poly(pyrrole).

The popular CHARMM36, Amber ff14sb, and OPLS-</div><div>AA force fields represent these interactions through the C6 /r 6 term of the Lennard-Jones potential. The C6 parameters are assigned empirically, so these parameters are</div><div>not necessarily a realistic representation of the true dispersion interactions. In this work, dispersion coefficients of all three force fields were compared to corresponding</div><div>values from quantum-chemical calculations using the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model. The force field values were found to be roughly 50% larger than the XDM values for protein backbone and side-chain models. The  CHARMM36 and Amber OL15 force fields for nucleic acids were also found to exhibit this trend. To explore how these elevated dispersion coefficients affect predicted properties, the hydration energies of the side-chain models were calculated using the staged REMD-TI method of Deng and Roux for the CHARMM36, Amber ff14sb, and OPLS-AA force fields. Despite having large C 6 dispersion coefficients, these force fields predict side-chain hydration energies that are in generally good agreement with the experimental values, including for hydrocarbon residues where the dispersion component is the dominant attractive solute\u2013solvent interaction. This suggests that these force fields predict the correct total strength of dispersion interactions, despite C6 coefficients that are considerably larger than XDM predicts. An analytical expression for the water\u2013methane dispersion energy using XDM dispersion coefficients shows that that higher-order dispersion terms(i.e., C 8 and C 10 ) account for roughly 37.5% of the hydration energy of methane. This suggests that the C 6 dispersion coefficients used in contemporary force fields are</div><div>elevated to account for the neglected higher-order terms. Force fields that include higher-order dispersion interactions could resolve this issue.</div>", "date": "2018-06-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Specifically we use calculation of modified <i>Z</i> scores to locate spikes followed by a simple moving average filter to remove them. The algorithm is very simple and its execution is essentially instantaneous, resulting in spike-free spectra with minimal distortion of actual Raman data.

In this study, we examine the enzymatic degradation of poly(butylene succinate-dilinoleic succinate) (PBS-DLS) copolymers obtained by \u201cgreen\u201d enzymatic synthesis using lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB). The copolymers differed in their hard to soft segments ratio, from 70:30 to 50:50 wt.%. Enzymatic degradation was carried out on electrospun membranes (scaffolds) and compression-moulded films using lipase fromPseudomomas cepacia. Poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) was used as a reference aliphatic polyester. The degradation process was monitored gravimetrically via water uptake and mass loss. After 24 days, approx. 40% mass loss was observed for fibrous materials prepared from PBS-DLS 70:30 copolymer, as compared to approx. 10% mass loss for PBS-DLS 50:50. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and SEC analysis were used to examine changes in chemical structure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning light microscopy (LSM) revealed changes in degree of crystallinity, and changes in surface morphology, consistent with a surface erosion mechanism. We conclude that the obtained copolymers are suitable for tissue engineering applications thanks to tuneable degradation and lack of acidification during breakdown.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2018-06-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biodegradable Materials; Fibers; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers); Polymer scaffolds; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Structural collapse at high-pressure, and unusual behaviours at elevated temperatures, such as melting and transitions to liquid states, have recently been observed in the family. Here, we show that the effect of the application of simultaneous high-pressure and -temperature on a MOF can be understood in terms of silicate analogues, with crystalline, amorphous and liquid states occurring across the pressure - temperature phase diagram. The response of ZIF-62, the MOF on which we focus, to simultaneous pressure and temperature reveals a complex behaviour with distinct high- and low- density amorphous phases occurring over different regions of the pressure-temperature space. In-situ powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and optical microscopy reveal that the stability of the liquid MOF-state expands significantly towards lower temperatures at intermediate, industrially achievable pressures.

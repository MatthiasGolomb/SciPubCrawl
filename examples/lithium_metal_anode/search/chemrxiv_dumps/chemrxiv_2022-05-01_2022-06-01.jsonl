The use of Jaryzinski's equality opened the possibility of determining the free energy along the steered coordinate, but sampling over the nonequilibrium trajectories is slow to converge. Adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) and other related techniques have been introduced to overcome this challenge through the use of stages. Here, we take advantage of these stages to address the numerical cost that arises from the use of the very large solvent boxes required to simulate the entirety of the steered coordinate. We introduce a scheme, called a telescoping box, within ASMD in which we adjust the solvent box between stages, and thereby vary (and optimize) the required number of solvent molecules. We have benchmarked the method on a relatively long alpha-helical peptide, Ala<sub>30</sub>, with respect to the potential of mean force and hydrogen bonds.

Symmetric DPPE derivatives (Ar12P\u2212CH2\u2212CH2\u2212PAr12) are well-known and readily prepared, but electronically and sterically unsymmetric DPPE (Ar12P\u2212CH2\u2212CH2\u2212PAr22; Ar1 \u2260 Ar2) ligands have been less explored, mostly due to the difficulties associated with their preparation.

A comparison of the electrochemical and photophysical properties of pDTCz-DPmS with 4CzIPN in a range of solvents identifies the former as a better ground state reducing agent and photoreductant, while both exhibit similar oxidation capabilities in the ground and excited state. The increased conjugation of pDTCz-DPmS relative to 4CzIPN presents a more intense CT band in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum, aiding in the light absorption of this molecule. Prompt and delayed emission lifetimes are observed for pDTCz-DPmS, confirming the TADF nature, both of which are significantly long lived to participate in productive photochemistry. These combined properties make pDTCz-DPmS useful in photocatalysis reactions, covering a range of photoredox oxidative and reductive quenching reactions, as well as those involving a dual Ni(II) cocatalyst, alongside energy transfer processes.

First, solvolytic delignification renders lignin liquors with its native chemical structure largely intact; and second, beta-zeolite catalytic depolymerization of these liquors leads to similar monomer yields as the corresponding 1-step fractionation process. Higher delignification temperatures lead to slightly lower b-O-4 content in the solvated lignin, but does not affect significantly the monomer yield, so a higher temperature was overall preferred as it promotes faster delignification. Deposition of Pd on beta-zeolite resulted in a bifunctional hydrogenation/dehydration catalyst, tested during the catalytic depolymerization of solvated lignin with and without hydrogen addition. Pd/beta-zeolite displays synergistic effects (compared to the Pd/gamma-Al2O3 and \uf062-zeolite tested individually and as a mixed bed), resulting in higher monomer yield.

Previous studies have concentrated on the role of the solvent in tuning the fields exerted on the solute. Here, we explore instead the role of the solute electronic structure in modifying the local solvent organization and electric field exerted on the solute. By measuring the infrared absorption spectra of amide-containing molecules, as prototypical peptides, and contrasting them with non-amide carbonyls in a wide range of solvents, we show that these solutes experience notable differences in their frequency shifts in polar solvents. Using vibrational Stark spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that while some of these differences can be rationalized using the distinct intrinsic Stark tuning rates of the solutes, the larger frequency shifts for amides and dimethylurea primarily result from the larger solvent electric fields experienced by their carbonyl groups. These larger fields arise due to their stronger p-\u03c0 conjugation, which results in larger C=O bond dipole moments that further induce substantial solvent organization. Using electronic structure calculations, we decompose the electric fields into contributions from solvent molecules that are in the first solvation shell and those from the bulk and show that both of these contributions are significant and become larger with enhanced conjugation in solutes. These results show that structural modifications of a solute can be used to tune both the solvent organization and electrostatic environment, indicating the importance of a solute-centric paradigm in modulating and designing the electrostatic environment in condensed-phase chemical processes.", "date": "2022-05-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Solution Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, dislocations have never been directly visualized and their prevalence and size have remained elusive. In this study, we have used super-resolution (SR) fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize and measure alternating crystalline and disordered regions within individual fluorescently labelled bacterial cellulose fibrils. The measured size of the crystalline regions ranges from 40 \u2013 400 nm and shows striking overlap with the length distribution of bacterial CNCs produced through sulfuric acid hydrolysis, supporting the fringed micellar model for the supramolecular structure of cellulose fibrils. The disordered regions were found to be 20 \u2013 120 nm in length and show heterogeneous accessibility, which directs fibril cleavage during the initial stages of cellulose acid hydrolysis. Two-colour SR imaging of cellulose fibrils and bound exoglucanases (Cel7A), in combination with degree of crystallinity measurements suggest that these dislocations are nanoscale in size, and do not result in amorphous cellulose pockets large enough to accommodate enhanced enzyme binding. Through characterization of disordered regions in cellulose fibrils, we have gained insight into the role of cellulose nanostructure in its breakdown by chemical and enzymatic means.

Whilst many studies have investigated presence of CECs in aquatic environments, these studies have been focused on higher income countries, leaving significant knowledge gaps for many low-middle income countries. This study proposes a new integrated powerless, in-situ multi-mode extraction (iMME) sampler for the analysis of chemicals (105 chemicals of emerging concern, CECs) and biological (5 genes) markers in water in contrasting settings: an urbanized Avon River in the UK and remote Olifants River in Kruger National Park in South Africa. The overarching goal was to develop a sampling device that maintains integrity of a diverse range of analytes via analyte immobilization using polymeric and glass fibre materials, without access to power supply or cold chain for sample transportation. Chemical analysis was achieved using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Several mobile CECs showed low stability in river water, at room temperature and typical 24h sampling/transport time. It is therefore recommended that, in the absence of cooling, environmental water samples are spiked with internal standards on site, immediately after collection and analyte immobilization option is considered. iMME has proven effective in immobilization, concentration and increased stability of CECs at room temperature (and at least 7 days storage) allowing for sample collection at remote locations. The results from the River Avon and Olifants River sampling indicate that the pristine environment of Olifants catchment is largely unaffected by CECs common in the urbanized River Avon in the UK with a few exceptions: lifestyle chemicals (e.g., caffeine, nicotine and their metabolites), paracetamol and UV filters due to tourism and carbamazepine due to its persistent nature. iMME equipped with an additional gene extraction capability provides an exciting new opportunity of comprehensive biochemical profiling of aqueous samples with one powerless in-situ device. Further work is required to provide full integration of the device and comprehensive assessment of performance in both chemical and biological targets.", "date": "2022-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To this end, we studied protein interactions during oral processes using a PDMS-PDMS interface lubricated by ex-vivo human saliva. Friction measurements and in-contact imaging were implemented, while food consumption was simulated by introducing model plant and animal-based proteins. All but one of the protein samples caused an increase in measured friction and this correlated with astringency ratings from a human taste panel.  This is attributed to delubrication as the salivary pellicle is removed, since food proteins interact with salivary proteins thus disrupting their adhesion. This interaction is shown to occur both on the surface and in the bulk of the fluid. However, the debonding of the pellicle requires frictional shear stress (i.e., rubbing).  Food proteins in isolation are themselves shown to be surface-active and form boundary films, which can adhere following removal of the pellicle. The mechanical action of protein particles in the delubrication process was isolated by filtering and shown to account for a moderate (<33%) increase in friction magnitude accompanied by a significant (>90%) increase in frictional noise.

Our prior simulations of DA and dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ) on pristine, flat graphene showed rapid surface diffusion for all adsorbed species, but it is not known how CNT surfaces affect dopamine adsorption and surface diffusivity. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the adsorbed structures and surface diffusion dynamics of DA and DOQ on CNTs of varying curvature and helicity. In addition, we study DA dynamics in a groove between two aligned CNTs to model the spatial constraints at the junctions within CNT assemblies. We find that the adsorbate diffusion on a solvated CNT surface depends upon curvature. However, this effect cannot be attributed to changes in the surface energy roughness because the lateral distributions of the molecular adsorbates are similar across curvatures, diffusivities on zigzag and armchair CNTs are indistinguishable, and the curvature dependence disappears in the absence of solvent. Instead, adsorbate diffusivities correlate with the vertical placement of the adsorbate's moieties, its tilt angle, its orientation along the CNT axis, and the number of waters in its first hydration shell -- all of which will influence its effective hydrodynamic radius. Finally, DA diffuses into and remains in the groove between a pair of aligned and solvated CNTs, enhancing diffusivity along the CNT axis. These first studies of surface diffusion on a CNT electrode surface are important for understanding the changes in diffusion dynamics of dopamine on nanostructured carbon electrode surfaces.", "date": "2022-05-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Since H2TFS can be seen as the fully aliphatic and perfluorinated C4 analogue of fumaric acid, ZrTFS was found to be isoreticular to zirconium fumarate (MOF-801). The structure of ZrTFS was solved and refined from X-ray Powder Diffraction data. Despite this analogy, the gas adsorption capacity of ZrTFS is much lower than that of MOF-801; in the former, the presence of bulky fluorine atoms causes a considerable windows size reduction. In order to have PF-MOFs with more accessible porosity, Post-Synthetic Exchange (PSE) reactions on (defective) MOF-801 suspended in H2TFS aqueous solutions were carried out. Despite the different H2TFS concentrations used in the PSE process, the exchanges yielded two mixed-linker materials of similar minimal formulae [Zr6O4(\u03bc3-OH)4(\u03bc1-OH)2.08(H2O)2.08(FUM)4.04(HTFS)1.84] (PF-MOF1) and [Zr6O4(\u03bc3-OH)4(\u03bc1-OH)1.83(H2O)1.83(FUM)4.04(HTFS)2.09] (PF-MOF2) (FUM2- = fumarate), where the perfluorinated linker was found to fully replace the capping acetate in the defective sites of pristine MOF-801. CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms collected on all samples reveal that both CO2 thermodynamic affinity (isosteric heat of adsorption at zero coverage, Qst) and CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity increase with the amount of incorporated TFS2-, reaching the maximum values of 30 kJ mol-1 and 41 (IAST), respectively, in PF-MOF2. This confirms the beneficial effect coming from the introduction of fluorinated linkers in MOFs on their CO2 adsorption ability. Finally, solid-state density functional theory calculations were carried out to cast light on the structural features and on the thermodynamics of CO2 adsorption in MOF-801 and ZrTFS.

Compound like 4 belongs to a family of anthracene derivatives capable of forming crystals that can photo-mechanically deform with light.

Photochemical conversion of a solution of the 3 in acetonitrile using light > 475 nm from a commercial blue LED leads to a mixture of 4 (87%) and unconverted 3 (13%) due to the presence of a photostationary state from overlapping absorption spectral regions. Pure 4 ( >99%) was later obtained by precipitating an organic sol1ution of the photoproduct from aqueous surfactant Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS).  Pure 4 was collected in the form of acicular micro crystals that are photomechanically responsive to UV light. The products were analyzed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, UV-Vis, and HPLC.

Here, a newfound utility of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy as a tool to study noble metal-anchored thiol monolayers is demonstrated for a pair of L-cysteine isotopologues competing to bind the surface of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). According to our DFT calculations, SERS spectra of L-Cys could be sensitive to 12C/13C and 14N/15N isotopic substitutions, which has been experimentally confirmed for the pair of L-Cys isotopologues: Cys-cabn (all 12C/14N) and Cys-CABN (all 13C/15N). In the AgNP-anchored state, the two isotopologues reveal distinct Raman shift values (1577 cm-1 / 1633 cm-1) of the band assigned to C=O stretching. This characteristic SERS feature has been subsequently employed to probe various exchange scenarios between AgNP-bound and free L-Cys molecules. As the exchange involves two spectrally distinct but chemically identical molecules, the process is exclusively entropy-driven ultimately leading to the equilibrium state in which Cys-cabn/Cys-CABN concentration ratios in the Ag surface-bound layers and the bulk solution are identical. In a system containing AgNP-L-Cys and an excess of free L-Cys molecules, the exchange energy barrier limits the overall kinetics. Although the SERS-monitored rate of progression toward the equilibrium state under ambient conditions (25 \u00b0C) is negligible, a very steep acceleration of the exchange is observed at 50 \u00b0C. While the temperature-induced transition is very abrupt, it is still reversible with cooling. We argue that the dramatic acceleration of the dynamics of the L-Cys exchange between free and AgNP-bound molecules may be rationalized as a collective phase transition to an excited and reaction-prone state. Our work highlights unexplored potential of SERS spectroscopy coupled to isotopic exchange as a tool to study obscured dynamic phenomena within metal-anchored adsorbate layers.", "date": "2022-05-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Interfaces; Self-Assembly; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The ionic nature of these materials makes them ideal candidates for solution processing into both thin films and nanostructured crystals. However, a complete mechanistic description of 2D perovskite crystallization in solution is still missing due to the intricacy of process parameters and intermediates. Here, we investigate the role of different solid lead precursors (PbO2, PbI2, PbCO3) on the crystallization of pure-phase, n=1, Ruddleson-Popper 2D perovskite BA2PbI4, during a two-step drop-cast-based synthesis. While BA2PbI4 is formed in all cases, the nucleation and resulting morphology are strongly dependent on the choice of precursor, where the three lead precursors differ from each other in terms of their Pb-ion oxidation state, crystal structure, and material class. We use in-situ optical live imaging during synthesis to reveal clear differences in crystallization kinetics of the same 2D perovskite as a function of the lead precursor. We discern three competing mechanisms in the Pb-precursor for the formation of BA2PbI4: dissolution/complexation, BAI intercalation, and solid-state conversion. The differences in the oxidation state and solubility of the starting lead precursor in halide-rich solution play a key role in defining the crystallization pathway(s). This work demonstrates the importance of lead precursors in defining the nucleation and growth of perovskites thereby advancing the existing solution-processing techniques.

The polymers bound their complementary phosphorylated decapeptides with Kd:s in the low \u00b5M range in both low aqueous proteomics media and aqueous buffers. Moreover, only minor cross-reactivity was observed for phosphopeptide variants with identical amino acid sequence. Proving their practical value, we demonstrate their use for sequence specific phosphopeptide enrichment from extracts of Jurkat T-cells stimulated to induce protein phosphorylation at either of the two regulatory sites of ZAP-70.   We expect the approach to be broadly applicable paving the way for robust, low-cost multiplex phosphopeptide assays.", "date": "2022-05-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Discerning the abundance and diversity of PFAS is essential for understanding sources, fate, exposure routes, and the associated health impacts of PFAS.

While automated approaches can compile all mass spectrometric evidence (e.g., retention time, isotopic pattern, fragmentation, and accurate mass) and provide ranking or scoring metrics for annotations, confident assignment of structure often still requires extensive manual review of the data. To aid this process, we present FluoroMatch Visualizer which was developed to provide interactive visualizations which include normalized mass defect plots, retention time versus accurate mass plots, MS/MS fragmentation spectra, and tables of annotations and meta-data. All graphs and tables are interactive and have cross-filtering such that when a user selects a feature, all other visuals highlight the feature of interest. Several filtering options have been integrated into this novel data visualization tool, specifically with the capability to filter by PFAS chemical series, fragment(s), assignment confidence, and MS/MS file(s). FluoroMatch Visualizer is part of FluoroMatch Suite, which consists of FluoroMatch Modular, FluoroMatch Flow, and FluoroMatch Generator. FluoroMatch Visualizer enables annotations to be extensively validated, increasing annotation confidence.

Timescales for multiphase reactions of ozone in atmospheric aqueous phases are governed by coupled kinetic processes between the gas-phase, the particle interface and its bulk, which respond dynamically to reactive consumption of O3. However, models of atmospheric aerosol reactivity often do not account for the coupled nature of multiphase processes. To examine these dynamics, we use new and prior experimental observations of aqueous droplet reaction kinetics, including three systems with a range of surface affinities and ozonolysis rate coefficients (trans-aconitic acid (C6H6O6), maleic acid (C4H4O4) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2)). Using literature rate coefficients and thermodynamic properties, we constrain a simple two-compartment stochastic kinetic model, which resolves the interface from the particle bulk and represents O3 partitioning, diffusion and reaction as a coupled kinetic system. Our kinetic model accurately predicts decay kinetics across all three systems, demonstrating that both the thermodynamic properties of O3 and the coupled kinetic and diffusion processes are key to making accurate predictions. An enhanced concentration of adsorbed O3, compared to gas and bulk phases, is rapidly maintained and remains constant even as O3 is consumed by reaction. Multiphase systems dynamically seek to achieve equilibrium in response to reactive O3 loss, but this is hampered at solute concentrations relevant to aqueous aerosol by the rate of O3 arrival in the bulk by diffusion. As a result, bulk-phase O3 becomes depleted from its Henry\u2019s Law solubility. This bulk-phase O3 depletion limits reaction timescales for relatively slow-reacting organic solutes with low interfacial affinity (i.e., trans-aconitic and maleic acids, with krxn ~ 10^3 - 104 M-1 s-1), which is in contrast to fast-reacting solutes with higher surface affinity (i.e., nitrite, with krxn ~ 10^5 M-1 s-1) where surface reactions strongly impact observed decay kinetics.", "date": "2022-05-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Those models were trained and evaluated using the experimental data deposited in the COVID-19 OpenData Portal which is hosted by NCATS (https://ncats.nih.gov/expertise/covid19-open-data-portal). We explored 6 popular ML algorithms in combination with 15 molecular descriptors for molecular structures from 9 screening assays. Of note, 6 screening assays of the same datasets were also adopted by KC et al. to construct prediction models which were deployed in the REDIAL-2020 model suite (Nature Machine Intelligence, 3, 527\u2013535, 2021). The impacts of ML algorithms and molecular descriptors on model performance were investigated. As a result, the model constructed using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) method and the hybrid molecular descriptor, GAFF+RDKit, achieved the best performance. We evaluated the model performance on 28 drugs which have been applied in clinical trails of treating COVID-19. The overall performance of our developed models was better than REDIAL-2020. For the external CPE dataset, 79% of compounds were correctly predicted by using our model, significantly better than REDIAL-2020 (66.7%). For the external 3CL assay, the percentages of correct predictions by our predictors (38.1%) are not as high as REDIAL-2020 (61.9%). However, our models achieved more accurate predictions for the 100 druglike compounds selected as negative control. Furthermore, we reconstructed another 3CL model by utilizing the screen data from the study by Kuzikov, et al. The classification model achieved the best performance on the prediction of positive control, albeit its performance is lower than REDIAL-2020 on the prediction for the negative control.

Flitsch", "abstract": "The conversion of carboxylic acids to thioesters is a key step in the biosynthesis of natural products, resulting in activation of the acyl groups for a broad range of subsequent biochemical reactions, such as acylations and alkylations. In particular, the thioesters of Coenzyme A (CoA-SH) play disproportionate roles in many metabolic pathways, from fatty acids, polyketides and peptides to epigenetic post-translational modifications, such as N-, O- and S-acylations of proteins. However, lack of access to a broad range of structurally diverse thioesters and the structural complexity of CoA-SH have limited the wider exploitation of thioesters in biochemistry, cell biology and biotechnology. Here we report an in-situ recycling system of thioesters from free carboxylic acids that aims to address these challenges. We show that the adenylation domain of the carboxylic acid reductase from Segniliparus rugosus (CARsr-A) can function as an efficient and robust acyl-S-CoA synthetase, accepting a wide range of carboxylic acids as substrates. In addition, CARsr-A was able to generate thioesters from structurally simpler thiols such as pantetheine. The resulting thioesters were shown to be substrates for acyltransferases leading to diverse amides, including more challenging targets such as pharmaceutically relevant aryl amides. Importantly, CoA-SH is regenerated in situ and can be used in sub-stoichiometric quantities. In a further application, the histone-derived peptide H4-20 was successfully acylated via thioester activation with a range of natural and unnatural \u2018clickable\u2019 carboxylic acids, by combination with the epigenetic \u2018writer\u2019 lysine acetyltransferase HATp300.

The IDTs with a curved, serpentine, paired and focusing geometry are easily embedded into the PDMS slab by filling the IDT channels with low melting point metal alloy. In this article, we propose the working mechanism of our embedded IDTs, which we call acoustoinjection, and carry out a precise characterization by laser doppler vibrometry (LDV) and infrared imaging to describe the injection of droplets within microfluidic channels. Although we observe that the device has acoustic resonance in the MHz frequency domain, we show that it operates most efficiently for acoustoinjection in the kHz frequency domain. In this frequency domain, our acoustofluidics device generates a pressure wave that causes destabilization of the surfactant-supported droplet interface enabling the injection of aqueous solution into the water-phase of the droplet with minimum heat generation. We show droplet injection for different surfactant concentrations, droplet passing speeds, and injection rates with high accuracy.

In this work, we have undertaken the first detailed photophysical interrogation of three homologous Pd(II) biladienes bearing different combinations of methyl- and phenyl-substituents on the frameworks\u2019 sp3-hybridized meso-carbon (i.e., the 10-position of the biladiene framework). These experiments have revealed unexpected excited-state dynamics that are dependent on the wavelength of light used to excite the biladiene. More specifically, transient absorption spectrosco-py revealed that higher-energy excitations (\uf06cexc ~ 350-500 nm) led to an additional lifetime (i.e., an extra photophysical pro-cess) compared to experiments carried out following excitation into the lowest-energy excited states (\uf06cexc = 550 nm). Each Pd(II) biladiene complex displayed an intersystem crossing lifetime on the order of tens of ps and a triplet lifetime of ~20 \uf06ds, regardless of the excitation wavelength. However, when higher-energy light is used to excite the complexes, a new life-time on the order of hundreds of ps is observed. The origin of the \u2018extra\u2019 lifetime observed upon higher energy excitation of the Pd(II) biladiene complexes was revealed by detailed computational modeling using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). These efforts demonstrated that excitation into higher-energy metal-mixed-charge-transfer excited states with high spin-orbit coupling to higher energy metal-mixed-charge-transfer triplet states leads to the additional excitation deactivation pathway. Importantly, time-resolved spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations carried out for the analogous aromatic Pd(II) meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (Pd[TPFPP]) demonstrated this traditional tetrapyrrole does not display the excitation-wavelength dependent photophysics observed for the Pd(II) biladienes. These experiments confirm that the unusual photophysics we observe are unique to low-symmetry biladienes and do not apply to more well-studied porphyrinoids. The results of this work demonstrate that Pd(II) biladienes support a unique triplet photo-chemistry that may be exploited for development of new photochemical schemes and applications.

This\nfinding has a direct implication on the most characteristic property of these systems, the spin-crossover transition, which is notably affected by this arrangement. This is because the energy difference between both spin states depends on the pyrazine configuration and the ordering of the rings changes the balance of entropy contributions to the entropy-driven spin-crossover phenomenon.", "date": "2022-05-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using BE and MWI, large mesoscale CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets were produced, whereas use of ODE produced thin small crystallites.

Both products had orthorhombic crystal structure, with the BE-CsPbBr3 revealing significant preferred orientation diffraction signals consistent with the asymmetric and two-dimensional (2D) platelet morphology.  The differences in final morphology were also observed for products formed via hot-injection, with BE-CsPbBr3 showing thinner square platelets with thicknesses of ~2 ML, and ODE-CsPbBr3 showing similar morphologies and small crystallite sizes.

Despite the evident importance of f5C in playing an important role in gene expression regulation, little is known about the exact amount and positions of this modified cytidine in RNAs, as well as its exact functions.  To capture this type of information, we performed a site-specific dual functionalization of f5C with semi-stabilized ylide cyanomethylene triphenylphosphorane that can simultaneously seizure the C5-formyl and N4-amino groups in the cytidine residue under light irradiation.  The photochemical labelling with f5C-containing oligonucleotides imparts a high selectivity towards f5C and allows distinction from structurally similar 5-formyluridine f5U.  We implemented a detection strategy of f5C modification in RNA based on the fluorescence signal of the cyclization product 4,5-pyridin-2-amine-cytidine paC, which exhibited a relatively high fluorescence quantum yield.  The results could clearly identify f5C with a limit of detection LOD at 0.58 nM.  The chemical labelling was capable of altering the hydrogen bonding activity of the parent cytidine and enabled the modulation of the reverse transcription signature of f5C in sequencing profile.  We showed that using this Pan-Seq strategy, f5C can be detected from tRNA segments with a single-base resolution.

Here, we have synthesized, characterized and calculated structural, thermal and electrochemical properties of an adiponitrile-based lithium-ion electrolyte which combines the advantages of organic and ceramic materials. This solid material is (Adpn)2LiPF6, (Adpn = adiponitrile) wherein (Adpn)-based channels solvate Li+ ions through weak C\u2261N---Li+ contacts. The surface of the crystal is a liquid nanolayer that binds the grains so that ionically conductive pellets are easily formed without high pressure/temperature treatments, which self-heals if fractured and which provide liquid-like conduction paths through the grain boundaries. High conductivity (\u03c3 ~ 10-4 S/cm) and high lithium-ion transference number (tLi+ = 0.54) result from weak interactions between \u201chard\u201d (charge-dense) Li+ ions and \u201csoft\u201d (electronically polarizable) - C\u2261N, compared with the stronger interactions of previously reported \u201chard\u201d ether oxygen contacts of polyethylene oxide (PEO) or glymes. The proposed mechanism of conduction is one in which Li+ ion migration occurs preferentially along the low activation energy path at the co-crystal grain boundaries and within the interstitial regions between the co-crystals, with bulk conductivity comprising a smaller but extant contribution to the observed conductivity. (Adpn)2LiPF6(s) has a wide electrochemical stability window of 0 to 5 V. Li0/(Adpn)2LiPF6/LiFePO4 cells exhibit cycling for > 50 cycles at C/20, C/10, C/5 rates with capacities of 140 mAh-g-1 to 100 mAh-g-1 and Coulombic efficiencies ~ 99%, and mitigation of the deleterious reactions with Li metal due to the high ionic strength.

The study utilized Pearson correlation and functional enrichment analysis tools (including gene set enrichment analysis, GSEA) in combination with the gene ontology (GO) resource to identify cellular processes that might contribute to the unique spectrum of activity and high potency of compound 1.  The GSEA results are consistent with DNA being a major target of compound 1 based on the negative correlation observed between its potency and expression levels of genes implicated in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.

Further, the RTP quantum efficiency improves more than 80-fold in 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) compared to that in PMMA. This design principle offers important insight into triplet excited state dynamics and has been exploited in afterglow-indicating temperature sensing.

A method to grow these materials in thin-film form would be desirable, since thin films are required in many applications and they are an ideal platform for high-throughput studies. In addition, the high density and smooth surfaces achievable in thin films are a significant advantage for characterization of transport and optical properties. Despite these benefits, there is hardly any published work on even the simplest binary phosphorus-rich phosphides. Here, we demonstrate growth of single-phase CuP2 films by a two-step process involving reactive sputtering of amorphous CuP{2+x} and rapid annealing in an inert atmosphere. At the temperature required for crystallization, CuP2 tends to decompose into Cu3P and gaseous phosphorus. However, CuP2 can still be synthesized if the amorphous precursors are mixed on the atomic scale and are sufficiently close to the desired composition (neither too P poor nor too P rich). Fast formation of polycrystalline CuP2, combined with a short annealing time, makes it possible to bypass the diffusion processes responsible for decomposition. We find that thin-film CuP2 is a 1.5 eV band gap semiconductor with interesting properties, such as a high optical absorption coefficient (above 1e5 cm-1), low thermal conductivity (1.1 W/Km), and composition-insensitive electrical conductivity (around 1 S/cm).\nWe anticipate that our processing route can be extended to other phosphorus-rich phosphides that are still awaiting thin-film synthesis, and will lead to more complete understanding of these materials and of their potential applications.", "date": "2022-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Processing; Thermal Conductors and Insulators; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Chem. Chem. Phys. 24, 3532 (2022)). NRO analysis along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) for several typical chemical reactions demonstrated that electron transfer occurs mainly in the vicinity of transition states and in regions where the energy profile along the IRC shows shoulder features, allowing the reaction mechanism to be explained in terms of electron motion based on orbital pairs that represent electron transfer. However, its application has been limited to single configuration theories such as Hartree-Fock theory and density functional theory (DFT). In this work, the concept of NRO is extended to multiconfigurational wavefunctions and formulated as the multiconfiguration NRO (MC-NRO). The MC-NRO method is applicable to various types of electronic structure theories, including multiconfigurational theory and linear response theory, and is expected to be a practical tool for extracting the qualitative essence of a broad range of chemical reactions, including covalent bond dissociation and chemical reactions in electronically excited states. In this paper, we calculate the IRC for five basic chemical reaction processes at the level of the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) theory and discuss the electron transfer by performing MC-NRO analysis along each IRC.

Among the library of dynamic crosslinks, electrostatic interactions among oppositely charged ions have been shown to enable tough and resilient elastomers and hydrogels. In this work, we investigate the mechanical properties of ionically crosslinked ethyl acrylate-based elastomers assembled from oppositely charged copolymers. Using both infrared and Raman spectroscopy, we confirm that ionic interactions are established among polymer chains. We find that the glass transition temperature of the complex is in between the two individual copolymers, while the complex demonstrates higher stiffness and more recovery, indicating that ionic bonds can strengthen and enhance recovery of these elastomers. We compare cycles to increasing strain levels at different strain rates, and hypothesize that at fast strain rates ionic bonds dynamically break and reform while entanglements do not have time to slip, and at slow strain rates ionic interactions are disrupted and these entanglements slip significantly. Further, we show that a higher ionic to neutral monomer ratio can increase the stiffness, but its effect on recovery is minimal. Finally, taking advantage of the versatility of acrylates, ethyl acrylate is replaced with the more hydrophilic 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and the latter is shown to exhibit better recovery and self-healing at a cost of stiffness and strength.

It is now well known that it is not sufficient to estimate the affinity of a protein-drug complex in the thermodynamic equilibrium process in in-vitro experiments (closed systems), where the concentrations of drug and protein remain constant.\nOn the contrary, it is mandatory to consider the conformational dynamics of the system in terms of the binding and dissociation processes between protein and drugs in in vivo (open systems), where their concentrations are in constant flux. This last model has been proved to dictate much of several drugs' pharmacological activities in vivo (3).\nAt the atomistic level, molecular dynamics simulations can explain why some drugs have better efficacy than others or the molecular aspects that make some drugs work better in one molecular target than others. Here, the protein kinases Aurora A/B, complexed with its inhibitor Danusertib, were studied using conventional and enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to estimate the dissociation paths and, therefore, the computational \u03c4 values and their comparison with experimental ones. These enzymes control different steps in the cell cycle, and their malfunction and dysregulation lead to the development of different types of cancer. Using classical molecular dynamics (cMD) and well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD), tree differential residues within the Aurora A/B active site, which seems to play an essential role in the observed experimental Danusertib\u2019s residence time against these kinases, were characterized. Using cMD, differences in the energetic contributions of residues THR217 and GLU161, which are located in the same structural position in Aurora A and Aurora B, respectively, to the binding of Danusertib were found.\nMoreover, a stable hydrogen bond between residues GLU161-LYS164 in Aurora B was identified, which provokes that LYS164 cannot move freely. In Aurora A, it was not observed a stable hydrogen bond between the analog residues THR217-ARG220, which caused that ARG220 can move with more flexibility. Then, using WT-MetaD and several replicas per system, the relative Danusertib\u2018s residence times against Aurora A/B kinases were measured on a nanosecond time scale, which was comparable to those \u03c4 values observed experimentally. In addition, the potential dissociation paths of Danusertib in Aurora A and B were characterized, finding differences that might be explained by the differential residues in the enzyme's active sites. In perspective, it is expected that this computational protocol can be applied to other protein-ligands complexes to understand at the molecular level the differences in residence times and amino acids that may contribute to it. \n", "date": "2022-05-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Deploying ML optimization tools in R\\&D operations increases productivity and efficiency, while reducing the time and cost necessary to identify new molecules, materials, and process parameters with desired target properties. Additional benefits can be captured when combining these ML algorithms with automated laboratory equipment with Atinary\u2019s orchestration software platform SDLabs. The synergy of these technologies are referred to as Self-driving Laboratories, which hold the potential to revolutionize scientific experimentation, data collection, and materials discovery. Thus far, however, autonomous experimentation projects have not fully leveraged pre-existing knowledge and databases, often beginning from scratch and sequentially collecting measurements from new experiments. This is in stark contrast to experimentation by humans, where trained experts rely on intuition acquired from experience to select initial parameter settings for a novel experiment. In this work, we introduce Atinary\u2019s transfer learning algorithm SeMOptt, a general-purpose Bayesian optimization framework which uses meta-/few-shot learning to efficiently transfer knowledge from related historical experiments and databases to a novel experimental campaign via a compound acquisition function. We apply SeMOpt to chemical reaction optimization, an important and challenging task in chemistry. Specifically, we perform two case studies: i) the optimization of five simulated cross-coupling reactions, which demonstrates the ability of our approach to adapt to data with unknown effects, such as the presence of a side reaction, catalyst deactivation, and measurement noise; ii) the optimization of palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling of aryl halides with 4-methylaniline in the presence of potentially inhibitory additives. We find that SeMOpt accelerates the optimization rate by a factor of 10 or more compared to standard single-task ML optimizers (those without transfer learning capabilities to leverage historical experiments or databases). Moreover, these case studies show that \\semopt outperforms several existing ML Bayesian optimization strategies that leverage historical data. Thus, we believe this work presents a valuable technical contribution for general-purpose optimization and makes the case to replace the traditional trial-and-error experimentation process with Self-driving Labs augmented with semantic memory.

Here, we report a universal yet simple platform based on through-space charge transfer (TSCT) polymers, that has full-color tunable emission and was developed with the aid of predictive machine learning models. Using a single acceptor (A) fluorophore as the initiator for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), a series of electron donor (D) groups containing simple polycyclic aromatic moieties (e.g., pyrene) are introduced either by one-step copolymerization or by end-group functionalization of a pre-synthesized polymer. By manipulating donor-acceptor (D-A) interactions via controlled polymer synthesis, continuous blue-to-red emission color tuning was easily achieved in solid polymers.

Additionally, we find all silicate Ca-NaSICONs to be thermodynamically unstable and hence unsuitable as Ca-cathodes.

Solid phase synthesis of oligosaccharides is crucial for the devel-opment of glycobiology. Accelerated solid phase synthesis of biological oligomers is crucial for chemical biology, but its application to the synthesis of oligosaccharide is not trivial. Solid phase oligosaccharide synthesis is performed in a variety of conditions and temperatures, requires inert gas atmosphere, and demand high excess of glycosyl donors. The reactions are usually very long, and the poor mixing of the solid support increases the risk of diffusion-independent hydrolysis of the activated donor. The entire process is slow and done mostly in special synthesizers. High shear stirring is a new con-cept in solid phase that enables shortening the synthesis time. The efficient mixing makes sure that reactive intermedi-ates can diffuse faster to and into the solid support thereby increase the kinetics of the reactions. We report the first stir-ring-based accelerated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis. We harnessed high shear mixing to promote diffusion-dependent glycosylation over diffusion-independent side reactions resulting in high conversion in short reaction time. We eliminated the need for high excess of glycosyl donors and overcame the need to use inert atmosphere. We showed that by tailoring the deprotection and glycosylation conditions to the same temperature, all steps are performed continuously and full glycosylation cycles is completed in few minutes", "date": "2022-05-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Process Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These limitations derive from the native solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) which, among multiple functions, stabilizes and protects deposited Li. The SEI also plays a critical role in regulating Li+ exchange between the electrolyte and the electrode, but quantification of this effect has been non-straightforward, and a general relationship between Li+ exchange and CE has not been clearly elucidated to date. Using electrochemical impedance and voltammetry, we report self-consistent Li+ exchange values of native SEIs over a range of relevant electrolytes with CE spanning 78.0% to >99%. CE and its retention at high rates are found to be positively correlated with the rate of SEI Li+ exchange. Additionally, Li+ exchange rates increased during cycling in high-CE electrolytes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to exceed 10 mA/cm2, whereas for low-CE electrolytes they remained low (<1 mA/cm2), revealing a chemistry-dependent picture of SEI evolution with often-complex dynamics. The evolution in Li+ exchange unique to high-CE electrolytes also provides insights into the role and effectiveness of the formation cycle on Cu current collectors upon the first plating step. Altogether, these findings indicate that Li+ exchange governs several key processes related to Li deposition and cycling efficiency. Consequently, its quantification can help to guide future high-CE electrolyte design, particularly targeting high rates (>1 mA/cm2).\u2003", "date": "2022-05-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Conventionally, gold electrodes are used because of their ease of modification with thiolated biomolecules. However, carbon screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) are gaining popularity for the development of cost-effective platforms, as they do not require precious metals for the work-ing electrode and are more consistent than most equivalent gold screen-printed electrodes. However, their universal modification with biomolecules remains a challenge; the majority of work to-date relies on non-specific amide bond formation to chemical handles on the electrode surface. By combining facile and consistent electrochemical modification to add an aniline handle to elec-trodes with a specific and biocompatible bioorthogonal oxidative coupling reaction, we can attach DNA and proteins to carbon electrodes. Importantly, for both proteins and DNA, the biomolecules maintain activity following coupling, ensuring that the DNA is in a biologically-relevant conformation and that proteins remain folded following coupling. We have further demonstrated the ability to generate self-assembled whole-cell films on these electrodes using DNA-directed immobilization to DNA-modified elec-trodes.

To facilitate pomace management, the current study has applied the biorefinery concept to develop systems that facilitate value extraction. In this regard, alternative scenarios for the production of polyphenolic compounds and electricity from apple pomace were investigated using ASPEN Plus for process simulations. Scenarios enabling the production of polyphenols using green solvents of subcritical water (scenario (a)) and ethanol (scenario (b)), while also co-producing electricity, were compared to scenario (c) in which the pomace was employed in only electricity production. Comparisons of profitabilities and environmental performances were achieved via a consideration of the net present values (NPVs) and potential environmental impacts (PEIs) respectively, of all scenarios. The study was able to show that scenario (a) constituted the only economically viable strategy, with an NPV of US$19.86 million, while scenarios (b) and (c) were determined to have NPVs of US$-88.12 million and US$-4.05 million respectively. Scenario (b) was also determined to have the poorest environmental performance with a PEI of 148 kPEI/h. Notably, although scenario (c) (PEI of 0.21 kPEI/h) was determined to present a better environmental performance than scenario (a) (PEI of 47 kPEI/h), its economic infeasibility indicated that it will be impractical to consider it as a viable pomace strategy in a future scaled-up system. The present study therefore proposed that scenario (a) may constitute a preferred pomace valorization strategy provided technological innovations i.e. use of renewable energy and gas filters are explored and integrated to reduce the major existing challenge of greenhouse gas emissions.

We have developed a deep learning-based de novo drug design method which can design novel small molecules by optimizing target specificity as well as multiple parameters (including late-stage parameters) in a single step. All possible combinations of parameters were optimized to understand the effect of each parameter over the other parameters. An explainable predictive model was used to identify the molecular fragments responsible for the property being optimized. The proposed method was applied against the human 5-hydroxy tryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT1B), a protein from the central nervous system (CNS). Various physicochemical properties specific to CNS drugs were considered along with the target specificity and blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP), which acts as an additional challenge for CNS drug delivery. The contribution of each parameter towards molecule design was identified by analyzing the properties of generated small molecules from optimization of all possible parameter combinations. The final optimized generative model was able to design similar inhibitors compared to known inhibitors of 5-HT1B.

HDAC10 deacetylates polyamines and has a distinct substrate specificity, making it unique among the 11 zinc-dependent HDAC hydrolases. Taking inspiration from HDAC10 polyamine substrates, we systematically inserted an amino group (\u201caza-scan\u201d) into the hexyl linker moiety of the approved drug Vorinostat (SAHA). This one atom replacement (C-->N) transformed SAHA from an unselective pan-HDAC inhibitor into a specific HDAC10 inhibitor. Optimization of the aza-SAHA structure yielded the HDAC10 chemical probe DKFZ-748, with potency and selectivity demonstrated by cellular and biochemical target-engagement, as well as thermal-shift, assays. Co-crystal structures of our aza-SAHA derivatives with HDAC10 provide a structural rationale for potency, and chemoproteomic profiling con-firmed cellular HDAC10-selectivity of DKFZ-748 across the target landscape of HDAC drugs. Treatment of cells with DKFZ-748, followed by quantification of selected polyamines, confirmed for the first time the suspected cellular function of HDAC10 as a polyamine deacetylase. Finally, in a polyamine-limited in vitro tumor model, DKFZ-748 showed dose-dependent growth inhibition of HeLa cells.

A. baumannii is known to be the causative agent of hospital-related infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, septicaemia and a plethora of infections such as urinary tract and wound infections found primarily in immunocompromised patients. These attributes of A. baumannii make it a priority pathogen against which potential therapeutic agents need to be developed. A. baumannii employs the formation of a biofilm to insulate its colonies from the outer environment, which allows it to grow under harsh environmental conditions and develop resistance against various drug molecules. Acyl-homoserine lactone synthase (AHLS) is an enzyme involved in the quorum-sensing pathway in A. baumannii, which is responsible for the synthesis of signal molecules known as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL), which trigger the signalling pathway to regulate the factors involved in biofilm formation and regulation. The current study utilised a homology modeled structure of AHLS to virtually screen it against the ZINC in trial/FDA approved drug molecule library to find a subset of potential lead molecules. These molecules were then filtered based on Lipinski\u2019s, toxicological and ADME properties, binding affinity, and interaction patterns to delineate lead molecules, which were then validated using molecular docking.

Crawling has been demonstrated previously with thermoresponsive hydrogels but needs a patterned or ratcheted surface to break symmetry for unidirectional motion.

A total of 45 CECs, that are grouped into 16 drug classes, were quantified during multiple sampling events that spanned over a period of two years in the study area. Daily loads (DL; in g/day) of the target analytes in the WWTW showed persistence of various CECs, along with population-normalised daily loads (PNDL; in mg/day/1000inh) of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse (DOA) that were estimated for the first time in the study area, using the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach. Multiple chemical markers were recorded in river water located upstream of the WWTW discharge, suggesting other urban pollution sources that contribute towards the CEC loading in the surface water environment. Environmental risk characterisation for the WWTW effluent and surface waters was done to calculate multiple risk quotients (RQs) for each CEC spanning over various sentinel trophic levels. High risk profiles (RQ>1.0) with a frequency of exceedance (FoE) larger than 75% were recorded for several CECs in both WWTW effluent and surface water locations that warrants the need for more refined surveillance of pollution hotspots in the urban catchment. These findings highlight the need for developing an urban water profiling (UWP) approach similar to conventional WBE approaches, at least for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where some (peri)urban communities are not connected to municipal sewage infrastructure and thus lead to direct discharge of human waste products into the natural environment.", "date": "2022-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, many NIR-II dyes suffer from the emission quenching effect and extremely low quantum yields (QYs) in the practical usage forms. The AIE strategy has been successfully utilized to develop NIR-II dyes with donor-acceptor (D-A) structures with acceptable QYs in the aggregate state, but there is still a large room for QY improvement. Here, we rationally designed NIR-II emissive dye named TPE-BBT and its derivative (TPEO-BBT) by changing the electron-donating triphenylamine unit to tetraphenylethlene (TPE). Their nanoparticles exhibited ultrahigh relative QYs of 31.5% and 23.9% in water, respectively. By using an integrating sphere, the absolute QY of TPE-BBT nanoparticles was measured to be 1.8% in water. Its crystals showed an absolute QY of 10.4%, which is the highest value among organ-ic small molecules reported so far. The optimized D-A interaction and the higher rigidity of TPE-BBT in the aggregate state are believed to be the two key factors for its ultrahigh QY. Finally, we utilized TPE-BBT for NIR-II photoluminescence (PL) and chemiluminescence (CL) bioimaging through successive CL resonance energy transfer and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer processes. The ultrahigh QY of TPE-BBT realized an excellent PL imaging quality in mouse blood vessels, and an excellent CL imaging quality in the local arthrosis inflammation in mice with a high signal-to-background ratio of 130.

The Iranian recipe induces the formation of gypsum platelets displaying preferential orientation in the plaster bulk. In contrast, the Italian and regular plasters comprise a typical needle-like morphology of gypsum crystals. The platelets in Koshteh expose the hydrophilic {010} face of gypsum in a much more pronounced manner than needles. Consequently, the Iranian plaster exhibits enhanced wettability, enabling their direct use for water-based decoration purposes without mixing it with any binder material, as is the case for Sottile. Contrary, the preparation of Sottile promotes the exposure of the more hydrophobic gypsum faces conferring a more water repelling character to this type of plaster.

However, in many cases the conditions needed to realize the hyphenation of SEC with MS require relative high activation energy and therefore hinder the analysis of labile protein complexes.\nIn this work, we are investigating the advantages of narrow SEC columns (1 mm internal diameter) operated at 15 \u03bcL/min flow rates coupled directly to nMS for the characterization of proteins, labile protein complexes and their higher-order structures (HOS). Reducing the flow rate, allowed for a significant increase of the MS sensitivity and ionization efficiency, facilitating detection of low-abundant impurities and HOS (up to the limit of the Orbitrap-MS used, i.e. 230 kDa). More-efficient solvent evaporation could be achieved, allowing using softer MS conditions (e.g. lower gas temperature, lower activation energy) that ensured (little or) no structural alterations or denaturation of the proteins and their HOS during their transfer to the gas phase. Furthermore, high-ionic-strength conditions of volatile salts (200-400 mM), are often necessary to ensure (almost) interaction-free SEC analysis of proteins, such as antibodies (mAbs). With this approach the salt tolerance of the MS was much improved. Because of the reduced column dimensions, band broadening effects resulting from the injection volume became more critical. At high injection volumes (exceeding 3% of the column volume) of more dilute samples, the peak shape and width was affected. Therefore, a new set-up was developed to pre-concentrate the injected proteins on an anion and cation-exchange mixed bed trap column prior to SEC-nMS analysis. This \u201ctrap-and-elute\u201d set-up was able to eliminate adverse injection-volume effects in SEC and provide additional desalting, while improving MS detection limits. \n", "date": "2022-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study critically reviewed most available up-to-date scientific literature on MPs/NPs in landfill leachate and provides the state-of-the-science regarding their detection and quantification, occurrence and characteristics, and remediation. MPs/NPs in landfill leachate can be classified into primary source that is in micro- or nano- scale when manufactured, and secondary source that is made as regular sized plastic but fragmented in to micro- or nano- scale in landfills. In the global scale, the concentration of MPs/NPs in raw and treated landfill leachate varied between 0-382 item/L and 0-2.7 item/L, respectively. Occurrence of MPs/NPs in raw landfill leachate is largely related to the local plastic waste production and solid waste management practice. Among all types of polymers, low-density and high-density polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), are the four most abundant MPs/NPs polymers in landfill leachate worldwide. Though the color of MPs/NPs primarily depends on their parent plastic waste, the dominance of light color in MPs/NPs in leachate is a sign of long-term degradation in landfills. The identified morphologies of MPs/NPs in leachate from all literatures have the highest abundance of fiber and fragments. Depending on the treatment technique, leachate treatment processes can achieve removal rate from 3 to 100% for MPs/NPs. Also, the critical review provides unique perspectives for MPs/NPs in landfill leachate regarding remediation, ultimate disposal, fate and transport among engineering systems, standardized detection methods, source reduction, etc. The landfill-WWTP loop and bioreactor landfills create unique challenges and opportunities for the management of landfill leachate induced MPs/NPs.\n\n\n", "date": "2022-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Wastes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In addition, this study also investigates the  expression of p53 proteins which can be correlated with carcinogenocity. UV-A irradiation experiments were conducted using a near collimated beam system operating at 365 nm. AFs at known concentrations were spiked in WM and irradiated at quantifiable UV doses based on the average volumetric intensity. The impact of ultraviolet light (UV-A) irradiation on volatile compounds, certain amino acids, and oxidative products were evaluated. No significant reduction in amino acids was observed except tryptophan, p<0.05. At 838 mJ/cm2 no significant lipid peroxidation was observed, p<0.05. The volatile profiling showed that alcohols, the key contributor of oxidized flavor was not significantly affected by the UV-A irradiation. Western blotting was used to assess the effect of UV-A irradiated WM on protein expression in HepG2 cells. Because the targeted gene p53 was not considerably altered, we can affirm that UV-A irradiated WM may be  safe and not cytotoxic.

However, one of the main challenges in these areas is that beneficial bacteria are not necessarily good at biofilm formation. Currently, this problem is solved by genetic engineering or experimental evolution, techniques that can be costly and time consuming, require expertise in molecular biology and/or microbiolo-gy and, more importantly, are not suitable for all types of microorganisms or applications. Here we show that synthetic polymers can be used as an alternative, working as simple additives to nucleate the formation of biofilms. Using MC4100, a strain of Escherichia coli that forms bio-films poorly, we demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers induce clustering and promote biofilm formation in this bacterium, with increasingly hydrophobic polymers outperforming less hydro-phobic polymers. Moreover, we compare the effect of the polymers on MC4100 against PHL644, an E. coli strain that forms biofilms well due to a single point mutation which increases expres-sion of the adhesin curli. In the presence of selected polymers MC4100 can reach levels of bio-mass production and curli expression similar or higher than PHL644, demonstrating that syn-thetic polymers promote similar changes in microbial physiology than those introduced following genetic modification. Finally, we demonstrate that these polymers can be used to improve the performance of MC4100 biofilms in the biocatalytic transformation of 5-fluoroindole into 5-fluorotryptophan. Our results show that incubation with these synthetic polymers helps MC4100 match and even outperform PHL644 in this biotransformation, demonstrating that synthetic polymers can underpin the development of beneficial applications of biofilms.", "date": "2022-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Polymer Science; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Membranes absorb water exponentially at high water activity (aw), making that region of the sorption isotherm the most influential on membrane properties. Plasticization of the polymer by water has been proposed to cause this exponential uptake at high aw. However, an integrated microscopic picture of the structure, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties of IEM as a function of aw has remained elusive. Here we use large-scale molecular simulations validated with experimental measurements to compute the sorption isotherms, Young\u2019s modulus, polymer dynamics and structure of IEM. The simulations unveil that the exponential increase in water uptake coincides in all cases with the glass to rubber transition of the membrane, as measured through its Young\u2019s modulus and segmental polymer dynamics. Functionalization of the polymer with alkyl groups further contributes to the plasticization of the polymer, increasing the water uptake at a given ion exchange capacity (IEC) and aw. We conclude that the alkyl chains act synergistically with water to plasti-cize the polymer matrix and allow water penetration in the membrane. The simulations reveal that the width of the water chan-nels depends on the ratio \u03bb of water to ions in the membrane but is independent of its IEC.

The question of a localized/delocalized vacancy is relevant for systems with symmetrically equivalent atoms, as well as near-degeneracies which can distribute the core-orbitals over several atoms. We show that issues relating to core-hole delocalization are present for calculations considering explicit core-hole states, e.g. when using a core-excited or core-ionized reference state, or for fractional occupation numbers. Including electron correlation eventually alleviates the issues, but even using CCSD(T) there is a noticable discrepancy between core-ionization energies obtained with a localized and delocalized core-hole (0.5 eV for the carbon K-edge). Within density functional theory, the discrepancy correlates to the exchange interaction involving the core orbitals of the same spin symmetry as the delocalized core-hole. The use of a localized core-hole allows for a reasonably good inclusion of relaxation at lower level of theory, whereas the proper symmetry solution involving a delocalized core-hole requires higher levels of theory to account for the correlation effects involved in orbital relaxation. For linear response methods, we further show that if X-ray absorption spectra are modelled by considering symmetry-unique sets of atoms, care has to be taken such that there are no delocalizations of the core orbitals, which would otherwise introduce shifts in absolute energies and relative features.", "date": "2022-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Conventionally, a trained predictive model describes a scalar output variable, such as thermodynamic, electronic, or mechanical properties, as a function of input descriptors that vectorize the compositional or structural features of any given material, such as molecules, chemical compositions, or crystalline systems. In machine learning of materials data, on the other hand, the output variable is often given as a function. For example, when predicting the optical absorption spectrum of a molecule, the output variable is a spectral function defined in the wavelength domain. Alternatively, in predicting the microstructure of a polymer nanocomposite, the output variable is given as an image from an electron microscope, which can be represented as a two- or three-dimensional function in the image coordinate system. In this study, we considered two unified frameworks to handle such multidimensional or functional output regressions, which are applicable to a wide range of predictive analyses in materials science. The first approach employs generative adversarial networks, which are known to exhibit outstanding performance in various computer vision tasks such as image generation, style transfer, and video generation. We also present another type of statistical modelling inspired by a statistical methodology referred to as functional data analysis.

The model yields a full description of the electric potential and charge distributions across the monolayer and into the bulk solution, including the potential distribution associated with ohmic resistance in the bulk solution.  In this way, it is possible to properly account for electrostatic effects at the molecular film/electrolyte interface, which are present due to the changing charge states of the redox head groups as they undergo electron transfer, under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. Our numerical simulations also significantly extend previous theoretical predictions by simultaneously including both the effects of finite electron-transfer rates and electrolyte conductivity.  Distortion of the voltammetric wave due to ohmic potential drop in the solution is shown to be a function of the supporting electrolyte concentration and scan rate, in agreement with experimental observations. The electric potential and charge distributions across an electrochemically inactive monolayer and into the solution are also simulated as a function of applied potential and are found to agree with the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory, allowing numerical predictions of the capacitive background currents in voltammetric experiments.

To provide a more comprehensive description of the behavior of the hydrocarbon molecules within the MOF-74 cavity, diffusion processes and corresponding diffusion barriers of small hydrocarbons in the MOF-74-Mg were modeled. This work provides a description of the molecular transport processes of CH4, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 within and along the cavity of MOF-74-Mg; in addition, the influence of pre-adsorbed water molecules is also addressed. Density functional theory (DFT), as implemented within a plane-wave (PW) approach under periodic boundary conditions (PBC), has been used to investigate the diffusion mechanisms using the climbing-image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method, coupled with the van der Waals functional (vdW-DF) and ultra-soft pseudopotentials. Two transport mechanisms were identified: M1, referring to the molecular migrations within the MOF cavity; and M2, referring to the molecular migrations along the MOF longitudinal channel. The M1 transport mechanism was further analyzed to address the molecular migration from one metal atom to its adjacent one (M1a), and with respect to the second metal over (M1b). All the transport mechanisms considered show that the diffusion of paraffin molecules in MOF-74-Mg is energetically more favorable than that of olefin molecules. An interesting trend is observed across all the diffusion mechanisms where the stronger the molecule binds to the open metal site, the higher the diffusion barrier it needs to overcome. For all the small hydrocarbons considered in this study, transport mechanism M1a is significantly more energetically favorable than M1b, showing that it is easier for molecules to drift along the longitudinal cavity than to remain trapped cross-sectionally within the cavity itself. This work shows how this computational approach can be successfully applied not only to reveal the molecular transport in other MOF-74 isostructural species, but also in the fundamental understanding of the screening of MOFs and other nano-porous materials for gas separation applications.", "date": "2022-05-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Processes; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This work proposes two contributions at the interface between engineering of chemical process and materials science: (A) an automated compact stainless-steel photoreactor with 40 cm3 and 65 cm2 of volume and area, respectively, for hydrogen photoproduction as a model reaction and (B) the synthesis, characterization, and performance of TiO2 Schottky junctions, using Pd, Pt, or Au nanoparticles (ca. 0.5, 1, 2wt.% loadings each) to validate the operation of the reactor. A photonic profile methodology is implemented to the studied reactor to obtain the local light absorption profile, opening up for evaluation of the local quantum yield calculation for the selected materials. A combination of transmission electron microscopy, (X-ray/ultraviolet) photoelectron/electron, energy loss/infrared spectroscopies, X-ray scattering, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry is employed to determine the distinctive surface and bulk properties to build structure-function correlations.

MXenes could be candidate electrode materials due to their excellent electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. In this work, the theoretical performance of the Ti- and Zr-containing MXenes Ti3C2T2 (T=O, F, OH) and Zr3C2T2 (T=O, F, OH, S) as SIB anode materials is investigated. The influence of Hubbard U correction is discussed, and the behaviour at MXene surface with the partial occupation of sodium atoms is considered. Including the weight and volume of adsorbed sodium atoms, Ti3C2O2 presents the best performance among the seven MXenes studied. Its mass and volumetric capacities are 299 mA h g-1 and 993 mA h cm-3 respectively, and the migration barrier and open circuit voltage are 0.138 eV and 0.421 V. Both Zr3C2O2 and Zr3C2S2 can adsorb double layers of sodium atoms on both sides, and the former shows higher capacity because of its lower weight and smaller volume. The mass and volumetric capacities of Zr3C2O2 are 254 mA h g-1 and 913 mA h cm-3 respectively. More importantly, the surface potential is determined to be an effective descriptor for selecting electrode materials. The migration barrier is proportional to the fluctuation amplitude of surface potential. A low surface potential generally implies a high capacity. A large open circuit voltage is prone to appear in the structure with large fluctuation amplitude and a low average value in its surface potential.", "date": "2022-05-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

According to this result, hexagonal surface textures were added to the inner surface of the MFSA and a small part of the MFSA was taken for further simulation analysis. The flow distribution of the magnetic fluid (MF) acquired from the simulation clearly illustrates that the surface textures cause vortexes formation in the MF layer. These vortexes increase the shear rate between the MF layers, thereby augmenting the flow resistance. The vibration reduction experiments were carried out and MFSAs employed in these experiments were fabricated by 3D printing technology.

Therefore, robust and practical experimental approaches -- preferably using small quantities of material -- to characterize both the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics for shaped adsorbents is necessary. The overarching goal of this work is to develop an approach to characterize the adsorption properties of shaped adsorbents with less than 100 mg of sample.

We embed these models into a derivative-free optimizer to predict model parameters for adsorption equilibrium and kinetics. We evaluate the performance of our approach using three adsorbents.

The importance of structure normalization is demonstrated using three open access cheminformatics toolkits: the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK), RDKit and OpenChemLib (OCL). Each toolkit was used for structure parsing, normalization and subsequent substructure searching, using SMILES as structure representations of chemical molecules and International Chemical Identifiers (InChIs) for comparison. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were chosen as a case study to perform the substructure search, due to their high environmental relevance, their presence in both literature and patent corpuses, and the current lack of community consensus on their definition. Three different structural definitions of PFAS were chosen to highlight the implications of various definitions from a cheminformatics perspective. Since CDK, RDKit and OCL implement different criteria and methods for SMILES parsing and normalization, different numbers of parsed compounds were extracted, which were then evaluated using the three PFAS definitions. A comparison of these toolkits and definitions is provided, along with a discussion of the implications for PFAS screening and text mining efforts in cheminformatics.

In this work, we demonstrate that high-resolution hyperspectral tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) imaging can be a powerful analytical tool to study on-surface decomposition chemistry at the nanoscale. Specifically, we present a TERS based hyperspectral approach to visualize the on-surface decomposition process of a pyridine-4-thiol (4-PyS) self-assembled monolayer on atomically flat Au(111) surfaces under ambient conditions. Reactive intermediates involved in the degradation process are spectroscopically detected with 5 nm spatial resolution. With supporting density functional theory simulations, a key species could be assigned to the disulfide reaction intermediate. This work opens a new application area of studying on-surface decomposition chemistry and related dynamics quantitatively at solid-liquid interfaces with nanometer spatial resolution.", "date": "2022-05-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

MXenes are synthesized from the parent MAX phase with different etching agents (HF or fluoride salts with a strong acid) by selectively removing a more weakly bound crystalline layer of Al or Ga replaced by surface groups (-O, -F, -OH, etc.). Ti3C2Tx MXene synthesized by CoF2/HCl etching has layered heterogeneity due to intercalated Al3+ and Co2+ that act as pillars for interlayer spacings. This study investigates the impacts of etching environments on the compositional, interfacial, structural, and thermodynamic properties of Ti3C2Tx MXenes. Specifically, compared with HF/HCl etching, CoF2/HCl treatment leads to a Ti3C2Tx MXene with a broader distribution of interlayer distances, increased number of intercalated cations, and decreased degree of hydration. Moreover, we determine the enthalpies of formation at 25 \u00b0C (\u0394Hf,25\u00b0C) of Ti3C2Tx MXenes etched with CoF2/HCl, \u0394Hf,25\u00b0C = \u20131891.7 \u00b1 35.7 kJ/mol Ti3C2, and etched with HF/HCl, \u0394Hf,25\u00b0C = \u20131978.2 \u00b1 35.7 kJ/mol Ti3C2, using high-temperature oxidation drop calorimetry.

The thiols of two GSH molecules can be oxidized to the disulphide GSSG. The cytosolic GSH/GSSG ratio is very high (> 100), and its decrease can lead to apoptosis or necrosis, which are of interest in cancer research. CuII ions are very efficient oxidants of thiols, but with an excess of GSH, the formed CuIn(GS)m clusters are only slowly re-oxidized by O2 at pH 7.4, and even more slowly at lower pH. Here, the oxidation of GSH by CuII was investigated in the presence of the anticancer thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT. The results showed that CuII-Dp44mT oxidizes GSH faster than CuII alone at pH 7.4, and hence accelerates the production of the very reactive hydroxyl radicals. Interestingly, the GSH oxidation and hydroxyl radical production by CuII-Dp44mT were accelerated at the acidic pH found in lysosomes, where CuII-Dp44mT was previously shown to accumulate and induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization. To decipher this unusually faster thiol oxidation a lower pH, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and spectroscopic studies were performed. The results suggest that the acceleration is due to the protonation of CuII-Dp44mT on the hydrazinic nitrogen, which favours the rate-limiting reduction step without subsequent dissociation of the CuI-complex. Furthermore, preliminary biological studies in cell culture using the proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1 indicated that the lysosomal pH plays a role in the activity of Dp44mT.

Among these, the lambda-dynamics approach proposed by Brooks and co-workers can be performed with little computational overhead and hence be used to routinely perform MD simulations at microsecond timescales, as shown in the accompanying paper. At such timescales, however, the accuracy of the molecular mechanics force field and the parameterization becomes critical. Here, we address these issues and provide the community with guidelines on how to set up and perform long timescale constant pH MD simulations. We found that barriers associated with the torsions of side chains in the CHARMM36m force field are too high for reaching convergence in constant pH MD simulations on microsecond timescales. To avoid the high computational cost of extending the sampling, we propose small modifications to the force field to selectively reduce the torsional barriers. We demonstrate that with such modifications we obtain converged distributions of both protonation and torsional degrees of freedom and hence consistent pKa estimates, while the sampling of the overall configurational space accessible to proteins is unaffected as compared to normal MD simulations. We also show that the results of constant pH MD depend on the accuracy of the correction potentials. While these potentials are typically obtained by fitting a low-order polynomial to calculated free energy profiles, we find that higher-order fits are essential to provide accurate and consistent results.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements reveal the sp3 carbon character of the diamond and advantageous electrochemical properties of a BDD electrode are retained during the milling process. TEM diffraction studies show a dominant (110) crystallographic orientation. Compared with conventional carbon TEM films on metal supports, the BDD-TEM electrodes offer superior thermal, mechanical and electrochemical stability properties.

This result also highlights the use of BDD as a corrosion free electrocatalyst TEM support for fundamental studies, and in practical energy conversion applications. High magnification TEM imaging demonstrates resolution of isolated, single atoms on the BDD-TEM electrode during electrodeposition, due to the low background electron scattering of the BDD surface.

Fluxes of P from the sediments to the water column, referred to as internal P loading, often delays the recovery of water quality following a reduction in external P loads. Here, we report on the vertical distribution and geochemistry of P, lanthanum (La), iron (Fe) and carbon (C) in the culturally eutrophied Lake Bromont. This lake underwent remediation treatment using La- modified bentonite (LMB) commercially available as PhoslockTM. We investigated the effectiveness of LMB in decreasing soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) availability in sediments and in reducing dissolved fluxes of P across the sediment-water interface. Sediment cores were retrieved before and after LMB treatment at three sites representing bottom sediment, sediment influenced by lakeside housing and finally littoral sediment influenced by the lake inflow. Sequential extractions were used to assess changes in P speciation. Depth profiles of dissolved porewater concentrations were obtained after LMB treatment at each site. Results indicate that SRP extracted from the sediments decreased at all sites, while total extracted P (PTOT) bound to redox-sensitive metal oxides increased. 31P NMR data on P extract reveals that 20-43% of total solid-phase P is in the form of organic P (Porg) susceptible to be released via microbial degradation. Geochemical modelling of porewater data provides evidence that LaPO4(s) mineral phases, such as rhabdophane and/or monazite, are likely forming. However, results also suggest that La3+ binding by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) hinders La-phosphate precipitation. We rely on thermodynamic modelling to suggest that high Fe2+ would bind to DOC instead of La3+, therefore promoting P sequestrations by LMB under anoxic conditions.

These (bio)sensors are useful in the detection of various analytes including ions, small organic molecules, DNA, proteins, and cells. However, the equipment such as parameter analysers or source meters used to characterize FET-based (bio)sensors is typi-cally bulky, expensive and complex, limiting the access to their research and development. There is a need for a compact and portable solution to this problem. It is worth noting that an answer to this conundrum may lie in the knowledge gap between the research communities of electrical/material engineers or physicists working on FETs and the electrochemists focused on potentiometry, which herein we aim to bridge. We present an economical and versatile solution based on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) product from a leading portable potentiostat developer \u2013 PalmSens. Together with their engineers, we repurpose the flexible and affordable EmStat Pico bipotentiostat module to measure a variety of differ-ent commercially available FET sensor architectures \u2013 starting from a simple metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET) which is then used as a transducer in extended-gate configuration. We then move towards a more complex ion-sensitive FET and a state-of-the-art single-sheet graphene electrolyte gated FET. Using a simple proprietary scripting language, we perform proof-of-concept experiments aimed at popularizing the FET field among electrochemists. We believe that using the EmStat Pico module can help accelerate FET-based (bio)sensor research and bridge the knowledge gap between FET researchers: physicists, electrical/material engineers and chemists. On top of that, the mentioned bipotentiostat is ready to implement in an end-user device, accelerating the commercialization of FET (bio)sensors for e.g. medical diagnostics.", "date": "2022-05-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Apparatus; Electrochemical Analysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Surrogate methods based on machine learning has garnered much attention as a viable alternative to bypass these limitations, especially in prediction of solid-state band gaps. Here, we construct a random forest regression model for band gaps of double perovskite materials, using a dataset of 1306 band gaps computed with the GLLBSC (Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends solid correlation) functional.

Using the top 10 features, a model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained, comparable to a previous study employing kernel ridge regression.

Methods to synthesize metastable phases without the need for high-temperature or high-pressure conditions would facilitate their widespread use. We report on the electrochemical growth of microcrystals of bismuth selenide, Bi2Se3, in the metastable orthorhombic phase at room temperature in aqueous solution. Rather than direct epitaxy with the growth substrate, the spontaneous formation of a seed layer containing nanocrystals of cubic BiSe enforces the metastable phase. We first used single-crystal silicon substrates with a range of resistivities and different orientations to identify the conditions needed to produce the metastable phase. When the applied potential during electrochemical growth is positive of the reduction potential of Bi3+, an initial, Bi-rich seed layer forms. Electron microscopy imaging and diffraction reveal that the seed layer consists of nanocrystals of cubic BiSe embedded within an amorphous matrix of Bi and Se. Using density-functional theory calculations, we show that epitaxial matching between cubic BiSe and orthorhombic Bi2Se3 can help stabilize the metastable orthorhombic phase over the thermodynamically stable rhombohedral phase. The spontaneous formation of the seed layer enables us to grow orthorhombic Bi2Se3 on a variety of substrates including single-crystal silicon with different orientations, polycrystalline fluorine-doped tin oxide, and polycrystalline gold. The ability to stabilize the metastable phase through room-temperature electrodeposition in aqueous solution without requiring a single-crystal substrate, broadens the range of applications for this semiconductor in optoelectronic and electrochemical devices.

We developed CG PyRosetta, an extension to the popular protein folding python package, PyRosetta, which introduces coarse-grained (CG) residues into PyRosetta, enabling the folding of toy CG foldamer models.

R-CNDs were prepared from 2-aminophenol by solvothermal synthesis and used as a modifier for chitosan-based selective membranes. The data obtained from atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy suggest a spherical morphology of the R-CNDs with lateral size in the range of 3\u20138 nm and the height of 1\u20138 nm. In contrast to most other known carbon nanodots, R-CNDs are soluble in various organic solvents, including apolar, and less soluble in water. Small nanodots (3 nm) are more hydrophilic than large ones (6\u20138 nm) and can be separated from the bulk suspension of R-CNDs in heptane by their extraction into water/ethanol mixture. Suspensions of large R-CNDs in apolar solvents exhibit green photoluminescence, while small R-CNDs in polar solvents have orange. This phenomenon was attributed to a solvatochromic rather than to a quantum effect. The R-CNDs were embedded on a chitosan-modified pencil electrode and the electrode was applied for voltammetric determination of four abandoned estrogens: Estrone, Estradiol, Estriol, and Ethynyl Estradiol. The sensor demonstrates a group-selective response to the estrogens with a detection limit of 17.0 nmol\u00b7L-1. It can be applied to determine the estrogens in the range of 0.05\u20134.6 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121 in the presence of typical interfering bioactive compounds, such as paracetamol, uric acid, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ibuprofen, caffeine.

The efficiency of the was proved by application for tap and lake water samples, where the recovery range was found to be 93\u2013100%. The low cost, stability and high sensitivity and selectivity of fabricated sensors, make R-CNDs a perspective modifier for electrochemical sensors for the detection of estrogen microquantities in variable water samples.

In this work we report the evaluation of 1039 metal-containing compounds that were screened by the Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD). We show that 20.9% of all metal compounds tested have antimicrobial activity against two representative Candida and Cryptococcus strains, compared with only 1.1% of the >300,000 purely organic molecules tested through CO-ADD. We identified 90 metal compounds (8.7%) that show antifungal activity while not displaying any cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines or haemolytic properties at similar concentrations. The structures of 21 metal complexes which display high antifungal activity (MIC \u2264 1.25 \u00b5M) are discussed and evaluated further against a broad panel of yeasts. Most of these have not been evaluated for antifungal activity. Eleven of these metal complexes were tested for toxicity in the Galleria mellonella moth larvae model, revealing that only one compound showed signs of toxicity at the highest injected concentration. Lastly, we demonstrated that  the organo-Pt(II) cyclooctadiene complex Pt1 significantly reduces fungal load in an in vivo G. mellonella infection model.

Our study suggests a polymerisation mechanism where cGMP aids the incorporation of the relatively unreactive nucleotides C, A and U.

The ONIOM(QM:MM) implementation in PyQM/MM uses the Gaussian16 program for quantum mechanical (QM) computations and the Tinker program for molecular mechanics (MM) computations with the AMOEBA09 polarizable force field. We have used PyQM/MM, employing ONIOM(QM:AMOEBA09) method, to calculate binding energy of SH and OH radicals on amorphous solid water (ASW). Computed binding energies of SH radical are in the range of 0.10-0.36 eV, where the average binding energy is 0.22 eV. Compared to SH radical, OH radical binding energies are stronger (0.21 \u2013 0.52 eV, and the average value is 0.36 eV). We propose that both SH and OH radicals adsorb on ASW, and SH radical binding preference is smaller than OH radical. Also, we have rationalized the mechanism for the reaction between OH anion and CO in ice using ONIOM(wB97X-D:AMOEBA09) method. The computed reaction mechanism showed a relatively low energy path to form HC(O)OH, where the OH anion is recovered during the reaction. In contrast, the reaction between OH radical CO gives rise to HOCO radical. We propose that OH anions and OH radicals in interstellar ices can react with the molecules trapped in ices to synthesize complex organic molecules. These examples evidence that PyQM/MM is a user-friendly strategy to perform ONIOM(wB97XD:AMOEBA09) calculations to study chemical processes in the interstellar medium.", "date": "2022-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study, we explore the binding of different anions to a FeDO facial triad variant, SadX, and the effects of that binding on HO\u2022 vs. X\u2022 rebound. We establish that chloride and bromide not only enable non-native halogenation reactions but that all anions investigated, including azide, cyanate, formate, and fluoride, significantly accelerate and influence the site selectivity of SadX hydroxylation catalysis. Azide and cyanate also lead to the formation of products resulting from N3\u2022, NCO\u2022, and OCN\u2022 rebound. While fluoride rebound is not observed, the rate acceleration provided by this ligand led us to calculate barriers for HO\u2022 and F\u2022 rebound from a putative Fe(III)(OH)(F) intermediate. These calculations suggest that the lack of fluorination is due to the relative barriers of the HO\u2022 and F\u2022 rebound transition states rather than an inaccessible barrier for F\u2022 rebound.

The fast development of algorithms and computing resources offers the opportunity to use CSP earlier and for a broader range of applications in the drug design cycle. This study presents a novel paradigm of CSP specifically designed for structurally related molecules, referred to as Quick-CSP. The approach prioritizes more accurate physics through robust and transferable tailor-made force fields (TMFFs), such that significant efficiency gains are achieved through the reduction of expensive ab initio calculations. The accuracy of the TMFF is increased by the introduction of electrostatic multipoles and the fragment-based force field parameterization scheme is demonstrated to be transferable for a family of chemically related molecules. The protocol is benchmarked with structurally related compounds from the Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) domain inhibitors series. A new convergence criterion is introduced that aims at performing only as many ab initio optimizations of crystal structures as required to locate the bottom of the crystal energy landscape within a user-defined accuracy. The overall approach provides significant cost savings ranging from three to eight-fold less than the Full-CSP workflow.

Recently, we demonstrated that a sulfone-based RM could trigger co-electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via an inner-sphere mechanism under aprotic conditions. Here, we provide support for inner-sphere cooperativity under protic conditions by synthetically modulating the mediator to increase activity at lower overpotentials (inverse potential scaling).

These statistics can be changed to 48-100% by incorporating proposed experiments and content in the curriculum.", "date": "2022-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Loss of \u03b1-helical content in specific regions can inhibit native polypeptide function or induce new, potentially toxic, biological activities. Thus, identifying specific residues that exhibit loss or gain of helicity is critical for understanding the molecular basis of function. Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy coupled with isotope labeling is capable of capturing detailed structural changes in polypeptides. Yet, questions remain regarding the inherent sensitivity of isotope-labeled modes to local changes in \u03b1-helicity, such as terminal fraying; the origin of spectral shifts (hydrogen bonding vs. vibrational coupling); and the ability to definitively detect coupled isotopic signals in the presence of overlapping sidechains. Here, we address each of these points systematically by characterizing a short, model \u03b1-helix (DPAEAAKAAAGR-NH2) with 2D IR and isotope labeling. These results demonstrate that pairs of 13C18O probes placed three residues apart can detect subtle structural changes and variations along the length of the model peptide as its \u03b1-helicity is tuned. Comparison of singly and doubly labeled peptides affirmed that frequency shifts arise primarily from hydrogen bonding, while vibrational coupling between paired isotopes leads to increased peak amplitudes that can clearly be differentiated from underlying sidechain modes or uncoupled isotope labels that do not participate in helical structures. These results demonstrate that 2D IR in tandem with i,i+3 isotope-labeling schemes can capture residue-specific molecular interactions within a single turn of an \u03b1-helix.", "date": "2022-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inappropriate and over-usage of antimicrobial agents (AAs) is a major driver for AMR. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising tool for monitoring AA usage in communities. Two urban catchment areas have been investigated in this study, one city and one small town in the Southwest of the UK over a 13-month period in 2018-2019. Population normalised loads (PNDLs) of 17 AAs and metabolites have been calculated and compared to catchment specific prescription data. Correction factors (CFs) have been applied to several AAs and metabolites in order to back-calculate consumption at the community level and compare to the corresponding catchment prescription data. Results have demonstrated positive correlations for all quantifiable parent AAs and metabolites in wastewater, and spatial variability in AA usage was observed even in neighbouring urban areas. The application of correction factors demonstrated good agreement for several of the studied AAs, including clarithromycin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim, hydroxy metronidazole, and acetyl sulfamethoxazole. It was noted that in general, the larger population city gave closer agreement to estimated prescription intake than the smaller town.  Differences in wastewater and between prescription data could be due to variable prescribing patterns and potential lack of compliance of AAs at the community level. This study has demonstrated that data triangulation, of both prescription data and wastewater data, provides the most comprehensive approach to understanding AA usage in communities.

It was proposed that PD-H and related substances would have high energy level of the triplet-excited state (ET) as a result of the enforcement of molecular planarity through incorporation of ring-fusion constrained diene and avoidance of resonance caused by the presence of amide moieties in the diketopyrrolopyrrole core. Three members of this family (PDs), PD-H, PD-OCH3 (the 4-methoxyphenyl derivative), and PD-CF3 (the 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl derivative), were synthesized. The results of photophysical studies revealed that the energy level of singlet-excited state (ES) and ET of PD-H are 2.88 and 1.43 eV, respectively. These values indicate that PD-H has the energy relationship, ES > 2ET, required for it to be a singlet fission material. Moreover, introduction of electron-donating or -withdrawing groups on the benzene rings in PD-H enable fine-tuning of ES and ET while maintaining ES > 2ET. The results of transient absorption spectroscopic studies show that PD-H, PD-OCH3, and PD-CF3 in CH2Cl2 have respective T1 lifetimes of 54, 94, and 108 microsec, which are long enough to utilize its triplet energy as an excitation energy in other optoelectronic systems.

This additional flexibility, however, comes with a more involved mathematical form and a more complicated design. A common denominator for previously constructed local hybrid funtionals is usage of thermochemical benchmark data to construct these functionals. Herein, we design a\nlocal hybrid functional without relying on benchmark data. Instead, we construct it in a more ab initio manner, following the principles of modern meta-generalized gradient approximations and considering theoretical constrains. To achieve this, we make use of the density matrix expansion and a local mixing function based on an approximate correlation length. The accuracy of the developed density functional approximation is assessed for thermochemistry, excitation energies, polarizabilities, magnetizabilities, NMR spin\u2013spin coupling constants, NMR shieldings and shifts, as well as EPR g-tensors and hyperfine coupling constants. Here, the new exchange functional shows a robust performance and is especially well suited for atomization energies, barrier heights, excitation energies, NMR coupling constants, and EPR properties, whereas it looses some ground for the NMR shifts. Therefore, the designed functional is a major step forwards for functionals that have been designed from first principles.", "date": "2022-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, it is still challenging to further improve the sensitivity to picomolar (pM) and sub-pM level as LPRS- and SERS-enhanced electrochemical, ELISA and aptamer-based highly sensitive methods. The main obstacle lies that even if strongly absorbing fluorophores with 100% photoluminescence quantum yield, the signals it generates at pM level still cannot exceed the background noise by solvent and particle Rayleigh and Raman scattering and detector dark current and a satisfactory signal to noise ratio cannot be achieved. To overcome this issue, non-linear amplification strategies were undertaken such as enzyme catalyzed processes such as ELISA and aptamer-based fluorescence sensing. However, due to the rigorous physiological conditions enzyme required, it is highly desired to develop artificial catalytic amplification method to non-linearly enhance the weak fluorescence signals generated by the fluorophores, which responds to pM level analytes. Here, we developed a TAPA-BTD-COF, which complexes with NH3 by its C=N-H bond, and the as-formed strong interaction strengthen the C=N imine bond and fix the trans-configuration. Given the infinite extending two-dimensional network by strong covalent bond, the fixation of a single imine bond to trans-configuration leads to a domino effect rendering the C=N bond in the two-dimensional plane to be locked one by one to trans-configuration. Since trans-configuration bears stronger fluorescence than cis-configuration because of more rigidified and conjugated structures. This domino amplification effect by a single NH3 molecule drives about 10 million TAPA-BTD-COF C=N-H bond be locked due to the whole rigid two-dimensional COF structure not allowing the flexible configuration isomerization and blocked the non-radiative channel realizing unprecedented pM concentration fluorescence sensing by common chemical sensors without pursuing to biologically enzyme catalyzed amplification process such as ELISA or aptamer.

Yet, historically, the polycrystalline nature of spherulites has hindered successful crystal structure determination. Here, we report for the first time the direct structure determination of a small molecule organic compound in spherulite form using 3D electron diffraction (3D ED). We employed vemurafenib (VMN), a clinical drug used for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma, as a model compound. VMN has four known polymorphs (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-VMN), three of which were discovered by melt crystallization. We first solved the crystal structures of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-VMN from both open and compact spherulite samples using 3D ED, and the resulting structures were highly consistent with those solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. We then determined the previously unknown crystal structure of \u03b4-VMN\u2014the least stable polymorph which cannot be cultivated as a single crystal\u2014directly from the spherulite sample resulting from spontaneous nucleation. We unexpectedly discovered a new polymorph during our studies, denoted as Form \u03b5. Single crystals of \u03b5-VMN are extremely thin and are not suitable for study by X-ray diffraction. Again, we determined the structure of \u03b5-VMN from both open and compact spherulite forms. This successful structure elucidation of all five VMN polymorphs demonstrates the possibility of removing the time-consuming step of single crystal growth and directly determining structures from spherulite samples.

Our team previously reported that metal-free hydride donors, such as biomimetic benzoimidazole-based motifs, can reduce CO2 selectively to the formate ion and that they can be electrochemically regenerated using the proton-coupled mechanism. To enable direct utilization of solar energy, we report here the photochemical regeneration of a benzoimidazole-based hydride donor using a phenazine-based metal-free chromophore. The photochemical regeneration was investigated under different experimental conditions involving varying sacrificial donors, proton donors, solvents and component concentrations. The best hydride regeneration yield of 50% was obtained with phenol as a proton source and thiophenolate as a sacrificial electron donor. The mechanism of photochemical regeneration was studied using steady-state and time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopies. Based on the results of these studies, we hypothesize that the initial photoinduced electron transfer from photoexcited phenazine chromophores involves the benzoimidazole cation and that this process is likely coupled with proton transfer to generate protonated benzoimidazole-based radical cation. The second photoinduced electron transfer is hypothesized to generate the hydride form.

Most emission inventories do not directly report data on durations of active emissions, and the variability in emissions over time must be inferred from other measurements or engineering calculations.  This work examines a unique emission inventory, assembled for offshore oil and gas production platforms in United States coastal waters, which reports production-related sources on individual platforms, along with estimates of emission duration for individual sources.  Platform specific emission rates, derived from the inventory, were compared to shipboard measurements made at 72 platforms.  The reconciliation demonstrates that emission duration reporting, by source, can lead to predicted ranges in emissions that are orders of magnitude broader than those based on annual average emission rates.  Total emissions reported in the inventory for the matched platforms were 20-30% larger than total emissions estimated based on observations.  The distributions of emissions were similar, with 75% of platform total emission rates falling between 0 and 49 kg/hr for the observations and between 0.59 and 54 kg/hr for the inventory.

Fe-ortho-im(H), which poises imidazolium units featuring both positive charge and hydrogen-bond capabilities proximal to the active iron center, increases CO2 binding affinity by 25-fold and CO2RR activity by 2,000-fold relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe-TPP), achieving turnover frequencies (TOF) exceeding 109 s-1 with >95% Faradaic efficiency for CO product. Owing to these dual, synergistic second-sphere enhancements, this catalyst also retains high activity and selectivity for homogeneous CO2RR in aqueous media. Notably, the observed TOF value for Fe-ortho-im(H) is 14,000-fold higher than the Fe-para-im(H) positional analog, but only 40-fold higher than the Fe-ortho-im(Me) congener that retains the proximal positive charge but lacks the C2-H hydrogen-bonding moiety, revealing that through-space charge effects have a greater impact on catalytic CO2RR performance compared to hydrogen bonding in this context.

Late-stage remodeling strategies of widely encountered and pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds, such as indoles, would offer enormous potential to expand accessible chemical space. Herein, we report the skeletal editing of indoles through nitrogen atom insertion, accessing their corresponding quinazoline or quinoxaline bioisosteres via trapping of an electrophilic nitrene species generated from ammonium carbamate and hypervalent iodine. This unique reactivity is unlocked through the strategic use of a silyl group which acts as a reactivity-controlling element to suppress the inherent nucleophilicity of the nitrogen in indoles. Importantly, the utility of this highly functional group-tolerant methodology in the context of late-stage skeletal editing of several commercial drugs is demonstrated.

The presence of this polyQ repeat results in neuronal degeneration, and there is no cure nor treatment that modifies disease progression. Small molecules that bind selectively to the recently-cloned sigma 2 receptor (\uf0732R), which is identical to TMEM97, have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury and several other neurological disorders. To assess whether modulating pathways involving \uf020\uf0732R/TMEM97 can provide protection in HD, we used an HD cell model to evaluate the effects of \uf020\uf0732R/TMEM97 ligands on mHTT induced neuronal toxicity. We first synthesized a set of compounds designed to bind to \uf0732R/TMEM97, and binding profiles (Ki) of these ligands were determined. Modulators with high selectivity for \uf0732R/TMEM97 relative to \uf0731R\uf020were then tested in our HD cell model. Primary cortical neurons were cultured in vitro for seven days and then co-transfected with either normal HTT construct (Htt N-586-22Q/GFP) or mHTT construct (Htt-N586-82Q/GFP). Transfected neurons were treated with \uf0732R/TMEM97 or \uf0731R modulators for 48 h. After treatment, neurons were fixed and stained with Hoechst, and condensed nuclei were quantified to assess cell death in transfected neurons. Significantly, \uf0732R/TMEM97 modulators reduce the neuronal toxicity induced by mHTT, and their neuroprotective effects are not blocked by NE-100, a selective \uf0731R antagonist. These results indicate for the first time that \uf0732R/TMEM97 modulators can protect neurons from mHTT induced neuronal toxicity, suggesting that targeting \uf0732R/TMEM97 may provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat HD patients.", "date": "2022-05-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Compound 5o showed anti-cancer properties against liver, breast, lung as well as primary patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, 5o in combination with specific clinically relevant brain-penetrant small molecule inhibitors induces enhanced cytotoxicity in a murine glioblastoma cell line. Through our current work, we establish a promising 6-amino-2-pyridone-3,5-dicarbonitrile based lead compound with anti-cancer activity either on its own or in combination with specific clinically relevant small molecule kinase and proteasome inhibitors.", "date": "2022-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For the potential of SF to be fully realized, accurate assignment and quantification of SF is necessary. Intersystem crossing (ISC) is another process of singlet to triplet conversion that is important to distinguish from SF to avoid either over- or under-estimation of SF triplet production. Here, we quantify an upper bound on the rate of ISC in two commonly studied SF chromophores, TIPS-pentacene and TIPS-tetracene, by using transient absorption spectroscopy of solutions of varying concentrations in toluene. We show that SF in solutions of these acenes has previously been misidentified as ISC, and vice versa. By determining a bimolecular SF rate constant in concentrated solutions in which SF dominates over ISC, we distinguish triplet formation due to SF from triplet formation due to ISC, and show that the characteristic time scale of ISC must be longer than 325 ns in TIPS-pentacene, while it must be longer than 118 ns in TIPS- tetracene. We additionally note that no excimer formation is observed in the relatively dilute (up to 8 mM) solutions studied here, indicating that previous excimer formation observed at much higher concentrations may be partially due to aggregate formation. This work highlights that an accurate quantification of ISC is crucial as it leads to accurate determination of SF rate constants and yields.", "date": "2022-05-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The test strip was used to determine UA concentration in synthetic urine and grain samples.

Molecules containing sulfane sulfur (S0) have emerged as key species involved in cellular redox buffering as well as RSS generation, translocation, and action. Using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) as a model hydrophobic host, we demonstrate here that S8 can be encapsulated to form a 1:1 host guest complex, which was confirmed by solution state experiments, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. The solid state structure of CB[7]/S\u00ac8 shows that the encapsulated S\u00ac8 is available to nucleophiles through the carbonyl portals of the host. Treatment of CB[7]/S8 with thiols results in efficient reduction of S8 to H2S in water at physiological pH. We establish that encapsulated S8 is attacked by a thiol within the CB[7] host and that the resultant soluble hydropolysulfide is ejected into solution, where it reacts further with thiols to generate soluble sulfane sulfur carriers and ultimately H2S. The formation of these intermediate is supported by observed kinetic saturation behavior, competitive inhibition experiments, and alkylative trapping experiments. We also demonstrate that CB[7]/S8 can be used to increase sulfane sulfur levels in live cells using fluorescence microscopy. More broadly, this work suggests a general activation mechanism of S8 by hydrophobic motifs, which may be applicable to proteins, membranes, or other bimolecular compartments that could transiently bind and solubilize S8 to promote reaction with thiols to solubilize and shuttle S8 back into the redox labile sulfane sulfur pool.

Molecular simulations have elucidated most of the molecular mechanisms at the atomic level, yet quantitative analysis to compare with experiments using the potential of mean force (PMF) remains a hurdle, including the definition of reaction coordinates and accuracy of liquid structures by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with density functional theory (DFT) methods. Here, we perform AIMD simulations with the revPBE-D3 exchange-correlation functional to compute the PMF profiles of autoionization, or proton transfer (PT), in liquid water. For the quantitative analysis with physically meaningful reaction coordinates, we employ a PT coordinate, donor-acceptor (OH--H3O+) distance, and hydrogen (H)-bond number. The one-dimensional (1D) PMF profile along the PT coordinate shows no local minimum in the product state of PT (OH- and H3O+), which is necessary to accurately compute acid dissociation constant (or pKa). On the other hand, the 2D PMF profiles along the PT coordinate and donor-acceptor distance show local minima in the product state and reaction barriers, and the computed pKw is comparable to the experiment. In addition, the 2D PMF profiles along the PT coordinate and the H-bond number reveal the molecular mechanism of the H-bond rearrangement concomitant with PT, in which the H-bond breaking before PT is slightly preferable. These findings indicate that accurate evaluation of pKa by MD simulations requires the donor-acceptor distance in addition to the conventional PT coordinate.", "date": "2022-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These candidates must be compared to remove duplicates prior to further analysis (e.g., optimization with electronic structure methods) and ultimately compared with structures determined experimentally. The agreement of predicted and experimental structures forms the basis of evaluating the results from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) blind assessment of crystal structure prediction, which further motivates the importance of rigorous alignments. Evaluating crystal structure packings in a reproducible manner requires not only calculating a coordinate root-mean-square deviation (RSMD) for N molecules (or N asymmetric units), but we argue should also include metrics to describe the shape of the compared molecular clusters to account for alternative approaches used to prioritize selection of molecules. Here we describe a flexible algorithm called Progressive Alignment of Crystals (PAC) to evaluate crystal packing similarity using coordinate RMSD and introduce radius of gyration (Rg) as a metric to quantify the shape of the superimposed clusters. We show that the absence of metrics to describe cluster shape adds ambiguity to the results of the CCDC blind assessments because it is not possible to determine whether the superposition algorithm prioritized tightly packed molecular clusters (i.e., to minimize Rg) or prioritized reduced RMSD (i.e., via possibly elongated clusters with relatively larger Rg). For example, we show that when the PAC algorithm described here uses \u201csingle linkage\u201d to prioritize molecules for inclusion in the superimposed clusters, our results are nearly identical to those calculated by the widely used program COMPACK. However, we favor the lower Rg values obtained by use of \u201caverage linkage\u201d for molecule prioritization because the resulting RMSDs more equally reflect the importance of packing along each dimension.

Using physisorption and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on 15N-enriched COFs, we study the gas uptake capacity and selectivity of NO adsorption and unravel the interactions of NO with COFs. Our study reveals the clean deamination of terminal amine groups on the particle surfaces by NO, exemplifying a unique surface passivation strategy for COFs. We further describe the formation of a NONOate-linkage by the reaction of NO with an amine-linked COF, which shows controlled release of NO under physiological conditions. NONOate-COFs thus show promise as tunable NO delivery platforms for bioregulatory NO release in biomedical applications.", "date": "2022-05-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Drug delivery systems; Organic Polymers; Polymer scaffolds; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The study of biogas accumulation conditions of quaternary shale in Sanhu area is of great significance to the theory of biogas accumulation and the guidance of exploration and development. This paper takes the quaternary shale in Sanhu area as the research object, through the experiment of soluble organic carbon analysis, pore permeability analysis and so on, analyzes the accumulation conditions of shale biological gas reservoir from the perspectives of hydrocarbon generation, reservoir conditions, hydrodynamic and structural conditions. The results show that the quaternary shale has high soluble organic carbon content and high salinity formation water, which is conducive to the late methane biochemical generation. Quaternary shale has the characteristics of high porosity and low permeability, mainly developing intergranular pores and intragranular pores. The large pore volume and specific surface area provide a lot of storage space for free gas and adsorbed gas, and the reservoir conditions are good. Under the structural characteristics of high in the south and low in the north and the action of formation hydrodynamics, biogas migrated from the south and deep to the north of the basin. The north slope is the main biogas rich zone.

The alkyl groups explored were tert-butyl, tert-pentyl, 1-adamantyl, and a cyclic imido (from 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-diamine).

We found that the decomposition of all compounds follows the same general pathway, proceeding first by the dissociation of the chelating ligand to give the coordinatively unsaturated species (RN)2MoCl2. Subsequent dimerization results in either an imido bridged adduct, [(RN)Mo(\u03bc-NR)Cl2]2, or a chloride bridged adduct, [(RN)2Mo(\u03bc-Cl)Cl]2, depending on the size of the R group.

However, a lack of well-defined structure-property relationships for redox-active organic materials restricts the advancement of the field. Herein, we investigate a family of diimide-based polymer materials with several charge-compensating ions (Li+, Na+, K+) in order to systematically probe how redox-active moeity, ion, and polymer flexibility dictate their thermodynamic and kinetic properties. When favorable ion-electrode interactions are employed (e.g., soft K+ anions with soft perylenediimide dianions),  the resulting batteries demonstrate increased working potentials and improved cycling stabilities. Further, for all polymers examined herein, we demonstrate that K+ accesses the highest percentage of redox-active groups due to its small solvation shell/energy. Through crown ether experiments, cyclic voltammetry, and activation energy measurements, we provide insights into the charge compensation mechanisms of three different polymer structures and rationalize these findings in terms of the differing degrees of improvements observed when cycling with K+. Critically, we find that the most flexible polymer enables access to the highest fraction of active sites due to the small activation energy barrier during charge/discharge. These results suggest that improved capacities may be accessible by employing more flexible structures. Overall, our in-depth structure-activity investigation demonstrates how variables such as polymer structure and cation can be used to optimize battery performance and enable the realization of novel battery chemistries.

A series of electrochemical and chemical characterization experiments was performed to distinguish between structural decomposition and apparent capacity fade of ferri-/ferrocyanide solutions used in the capacity-limiting side of a flow battery. Our results indicate that, in contrast with previous reports, no structural decomposition of ferri-/ferrocyanide occurs at tested pH values as high as 14 in the dark or in diffuse indoor light. Instead, an apparent capacity fade takes place due to an electroless reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide, via electroless oxygen evolution reaction. We find that this parasitic process can be further exacerbated by carbon electrodes, with apparent capacity fade rates at pH 14 increasing with an increased ratio of carbon electrode surface area to total amount of ferricyanide in solution. Based on these results, we report a set of operating conditions that enables the cycling of alkaline ferri-/ferrocyanide electrolytes, and demonstrate how apparent capacity fade rates can be engineered by the initial cell setup.

The lens of chemistry is fundamentally necessary to understand the resulting flux of chemical substances in Earth system processes, the unintended consequences of those transformations, impacts on food supply security, water and energy concerns, ways to mediate and adapt to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and how best to build and maintain resilient ecosystems. Reactive nitrogen compounds (Nr) such as ammonia from the industrial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen exemplify both the central importance of chemistry in providing food and meeting basic human needs for a global population of 7.9 billion people and the sustainability challenges arising from the intended and unintended consequences of large-scale human production and release of Nr. The chemistry profession can use the Planetary Boundaries framework as a systems thinking tool to understand and address challenges facing the entire Earth system resulting from the altered biogeochemical flows of nitrogen. This analysis has compelling priority due to the roles Nr currently plays in global food production and ammonia\u2019s potential role as an energy carrier for large-scale human activities in a future low carbon economy. As this example illustrates, navigating the complex benefits and challenges large-scale human activity imposes on Earth system processes requires the convergence of chemistry research, industrial practice, and education. Since the chemical reactions and processes that transform matter are foundational to sustainability challenges, this perspective maps multiple levels at which chemistry can contribute toward the emergence of sustainability of the Earth system.

Read-across is one of the most widely used alternative tools for hazard assessment, aimed at filling data gaps. However, there are no systematic studies or recommendations on the measures to identify the quality of read-across predictions for the data points without any experimental response data.  Recently, we have reported a new similarity-based read-across algorithm for the prediction of toxicity (biological activity in general) of untested compounds from structural analogues (the tool available from https://sites.google.com/jadavpuruniversity.in/dtc-lab-software/home). Three similarity estimation techniques such as, Euclidean distance-based similarity, Gaussian kernel function similarity, and Laplacian kernel function similarity are used in this algorithm. As the confidence of predictions for untested compounds is important information, we have addressed this issue here by consideration of several similarity and error \u2013 based criteria. The role of these measures in discriminating high and low residual query compounds is studied in three different approaches: (a) comparison of means of a measure for high and low residual groups; (b) development of classification models for absolute residuals to identify the contributing measures; (c) application of the sum of ranking differences (SRD) approach to identify the measures closer to the reference rank defined by the absolute residuals. Finally, the frequency of occurrences of different measures in the three approaches is compared. The results from three data sets with 10 divisions of source and target compounds in each case indicate that weighted standard deviation of the predicted response values appear to be the most deterministic feature for the reliability of predictions followed by different similarity-based features. The derived reliability measures will provide a greater confidence to the quality of quantitative predictions from the chemical read-across tool for new query compounds.

R. K. C. Yamijala", "abstract": "The current electric vehicle market is entirely dominated by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, due to the limited and unequal distribution of LIB raw materials on earth, there is a continuous effort to design alternate storage devices. Among the alternatives to LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) are at the forefront because sodium resources are ubiquitous worldwide and virtually inexhaustible. However, one of the major drawbacks of the NIBs is their low specific charge capacity. Since the specific charge capacity of a cell can be improved by increasing the specific charge capacity of the anode material, there is a constant effort to find suitable anode materials. Recent studies suggested that cobalt-boride (CoB) anti-MXene material (a newly discovered two-dimensional material) can yield superior specific charge capacities for LIBs than traditional graphite-based anodes. Inspired by these findings, in this work, we considered six cobalt-based anti-MXene materials (Co-anti-MXenes), namely, CoAs, CoB, CoP, CoS, CoSe, and CoSi, and examined their competency as anode materials for NIBs. Our findings suggest that Co-anti-MXenes possess superior specific charge capacities (~ 390\u2013590 mAh/g) than many well-studied anode materials like MoS2 (146 mAh/g), Cr2C (276 mAh/g), expanded graphite (284 mAh/g), etc. Moreover, their greater affinity (-0.55 to -1.16 eV) to Na atoms, along with reasonably small diffusion energy barriers (0.32 to 0.59 eV) and low average sodiation voltages (0.2 to 0.64 V), suggest that these Co-anti-MXenes can serve as excellent anode materials for NIBs.", "date": "2022-05-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here we report unique metallo-organic crystals that exhibit, on the one hand, single crystallinity and, on the other hand, a concave, multidomain appearance and a rare space group (P622). Despite these contradictions, it is puzzling that the symmetry of these crystals is linked at different hierarchies, from the molecular to the microscopic levels. They exhibit a deceptive combination of the three characteristics that define a crystal at different length scales: the unit cell, the organization of these unit cells, and morphology. The structural properties of this system are intrinsic, as no other materials (additives) were used to shape the facets. The unusual concave morphology of the crystals can be a direct consequence of the open molecular packing often found in metal-organic frameworks.

This approach also facilitates the preparation of Os(mesityl)4 (Os3) for the first time, a complex comprising bulky 2,6-dimethyl substituted aryl ligands, albeit in low yield (5%).

Single-crystal X-ray structures of these compounds indicate that the observed yield trend reflects the ease of accommodating aryl substituents into an open pocket that lies directly opposite each M-aryl coordination site.

Here, we have developed a targeted photolysis approach to achieve the efficiently degradation of GPX4. The Photo-Degradation TArgeting Chimeras (PDTACs) were synthesized by conjugating a clinically approved photosensitizer Verteporfin to GPX4-targeting peptides. Although the ligands themselves exhibit neither inhibitory nor degrading activity towards GPX4, these chimeras degraded selectively the target protein in living cells upon red-light irradiation. In contrast to the application of Verteporfin alone, the targeted photolysis of GPX4 resulted in dominant ferroptotic cell death in malignant cancer cells of different origins. Moreover, the dying cells resulted from our chimeras exhibited potent immunogenicity in vitro, and elicited more efficiently anti-tumor immunity in vivo in comparison with those dying from Verteporfin.

The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the rate-determining step was the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) during the formation of the N\u2013H bond on the molybdenum imide complex at high catalyst concentrations. Additionally, we confirmed that the concentration of the catalyst affected the rate-determining step and the dimerisation step of the catalyst became the rate-determining step at a low catalyst concentration. Thus, we designed PCP-type pincer ligands in which various substituents were introduced at the positions 5 and/or 6, to accelerate the rate-determining PCET reaction and observed that the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups promoted the reaction rate, as predicted by density-functional theory calculations. Finally, the molybdenum trichloride complex bearing a trifluoromethyl group containing PCP-type pincer ligand functioned as the most effective catalyst for producing up to 60,000 equivalents of ammonia based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst, with a turnover frequency of up to 800 equivalents/Mo\u00b7min\u22121. The amount of ammonia produced via this reaction, as well as its production rate, were approximately one order of magnitude larger than those obtained under the previous reaction conditions.

However, the development of highly effective, stable and inexpensive materials for such conversion processes is a bottleneck. Hence, establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of catalysts that influence their performance would constitute a major step towards the rational engineering of advanced electrocatalysts. In this study, by investigating a series of metal-substituted manganese oxide (spinel), Mn3O4:M (M = Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), nanoparticles as a model system, we demonstrate experimentally and rationalized the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for ORR and the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M oxides on the properties of the M substituent, viz. the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M that have a low enthalpy of formation of MO (i.e., highly exothermic oxides featuring relatively strong M\u2012O bonding) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which increases its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species on the catalyst surface.

New theoretical approaches are needed to gauge the catalytic activity of high-entropy alloys and optimize the alloy composition within a feasible time frame as a prerequisite for further experimental studies.\nHerein, we establish a workflow for simulations of catalysis on high-entropy alloy surfaces. For each step of the modeling we present our choice of method, however, we also acknowledge that alternative options are available.\nWe apply the developed methodology to predict the net catalytic activity of any alloy composition, within the composition space spanned by Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru, for the oxygen reduction reaction. Based on first-principle calculations, a graph convolution neural network is used to predict adsorption energies of *OH and *O. Subsequently, taking competitive co-adsorption of reaction intermediates into account, we couple the net adsorption energy distribution of a high-entropy alloy surface to the expected current density. Lastly, this procedure is used in conjunction with a Bayesian optimization scheme to search for optimal alloy compositions, which yields several promising compositions.\nThis result shows that an unbiased in silico pre-screening and discovery of catalyst candidates is viable and will help scale the otherwise insurmountable challenge of searching for high-entropy alloy catalysts. It is our hope that our computational framework, which is freely available on GitHub, will aid other research groups to efficiently identify promising high-entropy alloy catalysts.", "date": "2022-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Alloys; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Biochar preparation is among the practical solutions aiming to valorize this agrowaste and make it of a high added value functional material (FM). Herein, we propose a novel zero-waste pathway where sugarcane bagasse was first dispersed in a hydroalcoholic solution and the dispersion was then ultrasonicated in order to extract natural reducing and capping agents. Subsequently, silver and copper ions were added to get adsorbed under a controlled atmosphere prior to heat treatment. The suspension was later filtered to provide (i) Ag/Cu-Ag+/Cu2+-loaded biomass sludge, and (ii) a clear filtrate containing residual metal ions which was microwaved in order to generate unsupported Ag/Cu nanoparticles (NPs). The free Ag/Cu nanoparticles (FM2) were tested as anti-kinetoplastid material against two flagellate models namely Leishmania spp and Trypanosoma cruzi. Free Ag/Cu nanoparticles showed the highest leishmanicidal and trypanocidal effects with an IC50 of 2.909 \u00b1 0.051; 3.580 \u00b1 0.016 and 3.020 \u00b1 0.372 ppm for L.donovani, L. amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi, respectively. The impregnated biomass was pyrolyzed to provide Ag/Cu-loaded biochar (FM1). The latter exhibited high catalytic activity in the total mineralization of methylene blue. The experimental data followed the first and the pseudo-second order rate laws with apparent mineralization rate constants K1 45 10-3 min-1 and K2 0.115 g.mg-1.min-1, respectively. To sum up, sugarcane bagasse agrowaste was valorized as a source of natural reducing agents of metal ions into free and biochar-supported metallic nanoparticles. In this way, we combine two concepts: green chemistry and valorization of agrowaste in a full zero-waste process, for addressing pollution and neglected tropical disease issues.", "date": "2022-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are valid tools to assess HDAC functions. HDAC6 and HDAC10 belong to the class IIb subgroup of the HDAC family. The targets and biological functions of HDAC10 are ill-defined. This lack of knowledge is due to a lack of specific and potent HDAC10 inhibitors with cellular activity. Here, we have synthesized and characterized piperidine-4-acrylhydroxamates as potent and highly selective inhibitors of HDAC10. This was achieved by targeting the acidic gatekeeper residue Glu274 of HDAC10 with a basic piperidine moiety that mimics the interaction of the polyamine substrate of HDAC10. We have confirmed the binding modes of selected inhibitors using X-ray crystallography. Promising candidates were selected based on their specificity by in vitro profiling using recombinant HDACs. The most promising HDAC10 inhibitors 10c and 13b were tested for specificity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with the FLT3-ITD oncogene. By immunoblot experiments we assessed the hyperacetylation of histones and tubulin-\u03b1, which are class I and HDAC6 substrates, respectively. As validated test for HDAC10 inhibition we used flow cytometry assessing autolysosome formation in neuroblastoma and AML cells. We demonstrate that 10c and 13b inhibit HDAC10 with high specificity over HDAC6 and with no significant impact on class I HDACs. The accumulation of autolysosomes is not a consequence of apoptosis and 10c and 13b are not toxic for normal human kidney cells. These data show that 10c and 13b are nanomolar inhibitors of HDAC10 with high specificity. Thus, our new HDAC10 inhibitors are tools to identify the downstream targets and functions of HDAC10 in cells.

Herein we report the development of a highly sensitive, label-free, electrochemical DNA-based sensor for detection of stx1 gene using interdigitated gold microelectrodes (IDEs) on fully integrated silicon chips. Each IDE comprised a working IDE, used for DNA probe immobilisation and generator IDE used for accumulation of methylene blue. First, the working IDE was modified with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and chitosan gold nanocomposite. Afterwards, amine-modified probe DNA was immobilised on the chitosan modified electrode using glutaraldehyde as a linker. The label-free electrochemical detection was undertaken using methylene blue as a redox molecule, which intercalated into the double-strand DNA after applying an open potential circuit at the generator IDEs. Reduction of methylene blue was recorded using square wave voltammetry (SWV). Using this label-free detection, we have achieved linear response between 10-16 and 10-6 M synthetic target strand with the lowest limit of detection of 100 aM after 20 minutes hybridisation time. The chromosomal DNA from four different E. coli strains (two stx1 positives and two stx1 negatives) was used to confirm the selectivity of the presented method.

One of the most prevalent methods for fluorophore attachment is through the formation of amide bonds, which are often facilitated by coupling agents to activate carboxylic acid moieties for subsequent nucleophilic attack by amines. DMTMM is among the most popular of these coupling agents for bioconjugation due to its ability to facilitate amide bond formation in water. After observing quenching of 5-fluoresceinamine (FAM)-conjugated oligonucleotides in the presence of DMTMM, we sought to evaluate the magnitude and scope of this challenge by surveying the effect of DMTMM on a range of fluorescent dyes. A higher quenching effect was consistently observed for xanthene dyes compared to cyanine dyes. Further analysis of the impact of DMTMM on FAM shows that quenching occurs independently of whether the dye is free in solution or attached to a DNA oligonucleotide or antibody. Furthermore, we found that FAM-conjugated DNA was unable to recover its fluorescence after the removal of DMTMM and UV-Vis and NMR analysis suggests the formation of new products. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the specific analogues being formed. This research serves as a word of caution to those utilizing xanthene-containing fluorophores in bioconjugation reactions involving DMTMM.", "date": "2022-03-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The low-temperature, proton-ordered phase of water ice (namely, ice-XI) is investigated. The net effect of a coupled anharmonic treatment of stretching modes is not just a rigid blue-shift of the respective harmonic spectral frequencies but rather a complex change of their relative spectral positions, which can not be captured by simple scaling strategies based on harmonic calculations. The adopted techniques allow for a hierarchical treatment of anharmonic terms of the nuclear potential, which is key to an effective identification of leading factors. We show that an anharmonic independent-mode approximation only describing the \"intrinsic anharmonicity\" of the O-H stretches is unable to capture the correct physics and that couplings among O-H stretches must be described. Inspection of harmonic normal coordinates allows to identify specific features of the O-H stretching motions which most likely enable strong mode-mode couplings. Finally, by coupling O-H stretches to all other possible modes of ice-XI (THz collective vibrations, molecular librations, bendings), we identify specific types of motion which significantly affect O-H stretching states: in particular, molecular librations are found to affect the stretching states more than molecular bendings.

These proteins can have half-lives of many decades and, therefore, experience many tens or hundreds of millions of stress-strain cycles. Such a large number of cycles, even for a modest level of stress, subjects these molecules bond breaking and fatigue failure. To gain further insight into bond breaking in mechanically stressed proteins, the mechanical strength of bonds in the polypeptide backbone are estimated using bond dissociation energies from model compounds for individual amino acids. This analysis shows that the N-C\u03b1 bond in proline has a bond dissociation energy that is ~60 kJ/mol less than the next weakest bond in a polypeptide backbone. Thus, when mechanically stressed, the pyrrolidine ring of proline will open before other backbone bonds break. Such mechanically enhanced proline ring-opening would maintain structural continuity of the peptide backbone while increasing the length of the backbone by ~0.3 nm per ring-opening. The increase in length would redistribute forces to nearby molecules, thus effectively remodeling the mechanical properties of the tissue involved.

Quantifying the turnover of the key players in redox homeostasis is crucial for understanding their physiological dynamics and for targeting them in pathologies. However, suitably selective probes for assessing specific redox enzyme activities in cells are lacking. We rationally developed the first chemical probes targeting the mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) while fully resisting other cellular thiols and oxidoreductases. We used a cyclic selenenylsulfide as a thermodynamically stable and kinetically reversible trigger, oriented to harness the chemistry of TrxR's unique selenolthiol active site, and integrated it into modular probes releasing arbitrary cargos upon reduction. The probes showed remarkable selenocysteine-dependent sensitivity to cytosolic TrxR1, against a panel of oxidoreductases. Lead probe RX1 also had excellent TrxR1-selective performance in cells, as cross-validated by TrxR1 knockout, selenium starvation, TrxR1 knock-in, and TrxRselective chemical inhibitors. Its background-free fluorogenicity enabled us to perform the first quantitative high-throughput live cell screen for TrxR1 inhibitors. This indicated that tempered SNAr electrophiles may be a more favorable drug class than classically-used electrophiles. The RX1 design is thus a robust, cellularly validated, high-performance modular system for mammalian TrxR1. This sets the stage for in vivo imaging TrxR1 activity in health and disease, and can also drive and reorient TrxR1-inhibitor drug design. The thermodynamic and kinetic considerations behind RX1's selectivity also outline paths towards rationally-designed probes for other key players in redox biology.", "date": "2022-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

These interactions can be exploited to design compounds for photochemical applications, including enhanced spectral conversion of light to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. While chemical discovery is time- and resource-intensive experimentally, computational chemistry can be used to screen large-scale databases for molecules of interest in a procedure known as high-throughput virtual screening. The first step usually involves a high-speed but low-accuracy method to screen large numbers of molecules (potentially millions) so only the best candidates are evaluated with expensive methods. However, use of a coarse first-pass screening method can potentially result in high false positive or false negative rates. Therefore, this study uses machine learning to calibrate a high-throughput technique (xTB-sTDA) against a higher accuracy one (TD-DFT). Testing the calibration model shows a ~6-fold decrease in error in-domain and a ~3-fold decrease out-of-domain. The resulting mean absolute error of ~0.14 eV is in line with previous work in machine learning calibrations and out-performs previous work in linear calibration of xTB-sTDA. We then apply the calibration model to screen a 250k molecule database and map inaccuracies of xTB-sTDA in chemical space. We also show generalizability of the workflow by calibrating against a higher-level technique (CC2), yielding a similarly low error.

In this study, high-frequency mutational variants from different geographic regions were pooled in order to study the structural evolution of the spike protein through drug docking and MD simulations. We investigated the mutational burden in the spike sub regions and have observed that the different variants harbour unique signature patterns in the spike sub regions, with certain domains being highly prone to mutations. Further, the MD simulations and docking study revealed that different variants show differential stability when docked for the same set of drug targets. This work sheds light on the mutational burden and the stability landscape of the spike protein across the variants from different geographical regions.", "date": "2022-03-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this context, 195Pt solid-state NMR spectroscopy could be an ideal tool for this task because 195Pt NMR spectra and sizeable chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) are highly sensitive probes of the local chemical environment and electronic structure. However, the broadening of 195Pt solid-state NMR spectra by CSA often results in low NMR sensitivity. Furthermore, characterization of Pt sites on surfaces is complicated by the typical low Pt loadings that are between 0.2 to 5 wt.%. Here, we introduce a set of solid-state NMR methods that exploit fast MAS and indirect detection of a sensitive spy nucleus (1H or 31P) to enable rapid acquisition of 195Pt MAS NMR spectra. We demonstrate that high-resolution wideline 195Pt MAS NMR spectra can be in minutes to a few hours for a series of molecular and single-site Pt species grafted on silica with Pt loading of only 3-5 wt.%. Low-power, long-duration, sideband-selective excitation and saturation pulses are incorporated into t1-noise eliminated (TONE) dipolar heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (D-HMQC), perfect echo resonance echo saturation pulse double resonance (PE RESPDOR) or J-resolved pulse sequences. The complete 195Pt MAS NMR spectrum is then reconstructed by recording a series of 1D NMR spectra where the offset of the 195Pt pulses is varied. Analysis of the 195Pt MAS NMR spectra yields the 195Pt chemical shift tensor parameters. Analysis of the NMR signatures based on relativistic zeroth order approximation (ZORA) DFT calculations enables the rationalization of changes in the observed 195Pt CSA across the series of Pt compounds. Simple and predictive orbital models relate the measured spectral signatures to specific electronic environments and allows the identification of coordination environment by inspection of the CSA (isotropic chemical shift and measured spans).

The A-D-A type molecules play as important role in the organic electronic such as donors and acceptors (ITIC and Y6) in organic solar cells. However, their relatively poor chemical and photostability prevent their industrial application. In this work, we reported a stable A-D-A type open-shell diradical, named LY1-4Cl, by replacing the 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yli-dene)malononitrile (IC)-series end group of typical closed-shell non-fullerene acceptor IT-4Cl.  The new electron-withdrawing building block could give LY1-4Cl the redshift near-infrared (NIR) absorption, the smaller bandgap and highly enhanced photostability comparing with IT-4Cl. The open-shell diradical character of LY1-4Cl originates from the formation of quinoid diradical form. Moreover, benefiting from the broad NIR absorption and radical-promoted nonradiative transition, LY1-4Cl displayed high photothermal properties that an increasing temperature of 188\u2103 was recorded within 60 s under 808 nm laser irradiation of 0.8 W cm-2.

By using the first-principles calculations, in this paper we investigate the mechanical behaviors of monolayer, bilayer, and bulk VP under uniaxial tension. A phase transformation from the open-pore phase to closed-pore phase is observed in VP structures when under a specific tensile strain. It is revealed that the phase transformation is attributed to the competition between the rotation and elongation of sub-nano rods in VP structures during the loading process. Due to the phase transformation, the in-plane Poissons ratio of monolayer VP can become greater than 1.2, while the bulk VP possesses a negative out-of-plane Poissons ratio with a magnitude up to -0.3 at a certain strain. These results indicate that Poisson effects in VP are superior to those in any other existing two-dimensional materials. In addition, based on the tensor analysis of elastic constants, a strong mechanical anisotropy is observed in VP structures both before and after the phase transformation. Besides the mechanical properties, the band gap of all VP structures decreases as the applied tensile strain increases, which can eventually transform into the metallic state prior to their fracture. The combination of unique phase transformation, anomalous Poisson effect, strong mechanical anisotropy and tunable electronic properties render VP be a novel nanoscale metamaterial with multifunctional applications.", "date": "2022-03-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we developed a highly sensitive and multiplexed digital microarray using plasmonic gold nanorods as labels.

Recent advances in these methods have increased their speed, accuracy and precision. This is evident from the increasing number of retrospective as well as prospective studies employing them. However, such methods still have limited applicability in real-world scenarios due to a number of important yet unresolved issues. Here, we report the findings from a large dataset comprising over 500 ligand transformations spanning over 300 ligands binding to a diverse set of 14 different protein targets which furnish statistically robust results on the accuracy, precision and reproducibility of RBFE calculations. We use ensemble-based methods which are the only way to provide reliable uncertainty quantification given that the underlying molecular dynamics is chaotic. These are implemented using TIES (Thermodynamic Integration with Enhanced Sampling) but are equally applicable to free energy perturbation calculations for which we expect essentially very similar results.

We have carried out a systematic study of interaction of methanol with various flat and stepped facets of ZnO by employing Density Functional Theory (DFT). Two flat [(1010)and (1120)] and two stepped [(1013) and (1122)] facets are investigated in detail for methanol adsorption.  Chemisorption of MeOH with varying strength is common to all four facets. Most importantly spontaneous dissociation of O-H bond of methanol is observed on all facets except (1120). Our DFT calculations reveal that molecular adsorption is favored on flat facets, while dissociation is favored on step facets. Also, (1010) facet undergoes substantial reconstruction upon MeOH adsorption. Activation of C-H bond along with strengthening of C-O bond on ZnO facets suggest partial oxidation of methanol.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the characterization of main group radicals.

Parallel-mode EPR (B1 || B0) is almost exclusively employed for the study of S > 1/2 systems but becomes feasible for S = 1/2 systems with large hyperfine couplings, offering a distinct EPR spectroscopic method.

The four different adducts differ by their regio- and stereochemistry. The reaction paths on the force modified potential energy surfaces were characterized by isometric and isotensional approaches and determining stationary points (equilibrium geometries and transition states) as a function of the applied force, as well as by analyzing the redistribution of strain energy over the internal degrees of freedom. We evidence different bond breaking pathways and rate constants for the four isomers, the proximal configurations being favored over the distal ones. The switch from a concerted pathway at zero force to a sequential one occurs for a threshold force that is significantly higher (\u2248 2.4 nN) for the distal-exo adduct than for the other three (\u2248 1 nN), explaining its larger resistance to breaking and its almost inert character under tension. The switch is accompanied by the rupture of one of the two scissile bonds which leads to a twice smaller imaginary frequency of the transition state and an increase of the activation barrier, which then decreases for higher force strengths (> 3nN) to become barrierless at a critical force value.

To overcome these limitations, amphiphilic prodrugs that leverage a hydrophobic drug as both the therapeutic and structure-directing component can be used to create supramolecular materials with higher loading and controlled release kinetics when biodegradable or enzymatically cleavable linkers are used.

Molecular architecture and hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic ratio of PEG-DPCA conjugates strongly influenced their physical state in water, ranging from fully soluble to supramolecular assemblies of micelles and nanofibers. Molecular design and supramolecular structure, in turn, were shown to dramatically alter hydrolytic and enzymatic release, bioactivity, and cellular transport of DPCA.

An appreciable augmentation in AC breakdown voltage (BDV) is observed compared to the state-of-the-art boron nitride (BN) particles. This enhancement in BDV is elucidated by the role of the greater surface area of Maxwell-Garnet \u2018oil-sheet\u2019 interfacial region of the 2D morphology in charge trapping perspective.

The structure has a percolating distorted rock-salt-like network, leading to strong superexchange, but square pyramidal linkages frustrate magnetic ordering. The magnetic structure is assumed to be incommensurate, as simple propagation vectors can be ruled out by powder neutron diffraction.", "date": "2022-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Ceramics; Magnetic Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The OR is calculated for a set of 50 molecules using B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP, and 17 molecules using coupled cluster with single and double ex- citations (CCSD). The calculations employ the correlation-consistent basis sets, aug-cc-pV\u03b6Z with \u03b6 = D, T, Q. An inverse-power extrapolation formula is then utilized to obtain OR values at the complete basis set (CBS) limit. We investigate the basis set convergence for these methods and three choices of gauge: length gauge (with gauge-including atomic orbitals, LG(GIAOs), for DFT), the origin-invariant length gauge [LG(OI)], and the modified velocity gauge (MVG). The results show that all methods converge smoothly to the CBS limit and that the LG(OI) approach has a slightly faster convergence rate than the other choices of gauge. While the DFT methods reach gauge invariance at the CBS limit, CCSD does not. The significant difference between the MVG and LG(OI) results at the CBS limit, 26%, indicates that CCSD is not quite at convergence in the description of electron correlation for this property. On the other hand, gauge invariance at the CBS limit for DFT does not lead to the same OR values for the two density functionals, which is also due to electron correlation incompleteness. A limited comparison to gas-phase experimental OR values for the DFT methods shows that CAM-B3LYP seems more accurate than B3LYP. Overall, this study shows that the LG(OI) approach with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set for DFT, and with the CBS(DT) extrapolation for CCSD, provides a good cost/accuracy balance.", "date": "2022-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, with ZIF-67 derived Co-based carbon frameworks (Co/NC) as a model catalyst, we systematically investigated the effects of different reaction parameters on the HER kinetics, and surprise found that HER activity was not directly dependent on the type of nitrogen in the carbon framework, but on the relative content of surface hydroxyl and water (OH-/H2O) adsorbed on Co active sites embedded in carbon frameworks. When the ratio of the OH-/H2O was close to 1:1, Co/NC nanocatalyst showed the best reaction performance under the condition of high-pH electrolytes, e.g., with an overpotential of only 232 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

They typically contain rings and methyl branches, which gives them high energy densities and low freezing points and makes them appealing candidates for sustainable transportation biofuels. Between the original biosynthesis and upgrading options such as hydrogenation, they have a large degree of freedom of structures, e.g., different carbon skeletons, positions of double bonds, and functional groups. Therefore, structure-property data is needed to downselect potential fuel candidates. Here, we measured the sooting tendencies of 17 C10 monoterpenes and 7 of their hydrogenated analogues. The hydrogenated compounds were custom synthesized, so the quantities were too small for conventional smoke point measurements. Thus, the sooting tendencies were quantified with yield sooting index (YSI), which is based on the soot yield in a fuel-doped non-premixed methane flame. Derived smoke points (DSPs) were estimated from a correlation between YSI and smoke point for other hydrocarbons. The YSI of terpenes and their derivatives varies widely from 85.6 to 248.5. The YSI follows the trend: terpenes > dihydroterpenes > tetrahydroterpenes. The DSPs of all the tetrahydroterpenes and some dihydroterpenes are higher than that of a Jet-A fuel sample, suggesting that they offer soot reduction benefits. The YSIs depend strongly on molecular structure; for example, \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-pinene have identical carbon skeletons and differ only in the position of one carbon-carbon double bond, but the YSI of \u03b1-pinene is 34% higher than that of \u03b2-pinene. Detailed decomposition analysis via density functional theory (DFT) suggests that compared with \u03b2-pinene, \u03b1-pinene requires fewer steps to form the first aromatic ring and the process is more thermodynamically favorable. The YSI difference between the pinenes is mainly affected by the identity of the products from the dominant decomposition pathways.", "date": "2022-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Fuels - Energy Science; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Many frameworks used to predict and tune ion transport, such as the Nernst-Einstein model, assume hydrodynamic transport mechanisms, and hence focus on maximizing electrolyte conductivity by minimizing bulk viscosity. However, the emergence of solid-state electrolytes illustrates that selective, non-hydrodynamic ion transport provides promising avenues for enhancing ionic transport in electrolytes. Increasingly, selective ion transport mechanisms, such as hopping, are proposed for concentrated electrolytes, including ionic liquid-derived materials. Yet viscosity-conductivity scaling relationships in ionic liquids are still often analyzed with hydrodynamic models. Here, we report a data-centric analysis of how well hydrodynamic transport models describe the scaling between viscosity and conductivity in neat ionic liquids by merging three databases to bridge physical properties and chemical descriptors. With this expansive data set, we constrained our scaling analysis using ion sizes defined using simulated molecular volumes, as opposed to prior approaches that estimate sizes from activity coefficients or rely on ad-hoc estimates. Remarkably, we find that many commonly studied ionic liquids exhibit positive deviations from the Nernst-Einstein model, implying that ions move faster than hydrodynamic limitations should allow. We experimentally verify these positive deviations in a common class of ionic liquids using microrheology and conductivity measurements. Our results highlight overlooked super-hydrodynamic regimes in ionic liquid viscosity-conductivity scaling and point to opportunities to understand mechanisms of correlated ion motion in ionic liquids.

Various metal-based catalysts (Ru, Ir, Pt, Rh, etc.) have been developed; however, most systems suffer from low efficiency and poor stability. Here, we revealed that the hydride-like NH2\u03b4- species, generated by the dissociation of NH3 over a core-shell structured Co@CoO catalyst is capable of accelerating the ammonolysis of Schiff bases, the reaction intermediates. This catalyst can handle various reductive aminations of aldehydes and ketones under mild conditions and run 21 times without deactivation. The combination of various spectroscopic measurements and computational modelling illustrated that this catalyst not only drives the dissociation of H2 to active H\u03b4- species, it also enables the homolytic and heterolytic cleavages of NH3 to NH2\u03b4- species. D2 isotopic tracing experiment provided further evidence of the direct participation of hydride-like NH2\u03b4- species in the ammonolysis of the Schiff bases. Theoretical calculations also verified the stable co-adsorption state of the H\u03b4- and NH2\u03b4- species which allows the Schiff base to move freely on the surface of the CoO shell, resulting in the exceptional catalytic activity. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of metal-oxide catalysts for the production of primary amines through reductive amination.", "date": "2022-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The use of coordination chemistry between inverse-phosphocholine (PC) lipid headgroups and surfaces has emerged as a promising strategy to enable SLB formation on other materials such as TiO2 based on covalent forces. However, until now, a cohesive picture of how noncovalent and covalent forces jointly contribute to the latter SLB formation process has been lacking. Herein, we investigated inverse-PC lipid vesicle adsorption onto TiO2 and SiO2 surfaces and discovered how adsorption pathways can be controlled by tuning the balance of noncovalent and covalent forces. On TiO2, SLB formation depended on two key factors: (1) favorable noncovalent forces to facilitate initial vesicle adsorption; and (2) a critical density of lipid-TiO2 coordinate bonds to enable sufficient vesicle deformation triggering fusion and rupture. In other cases, either no adsorption or intact vesicle adsorption without rupture occurred even when coordinate bonds were present. Conversely, on SiO2, conditions were identified to support inverse-PC lipid adsorption whereas vesicles were repelled otherwise. The experimental results were supported by interfacial force modeling and our findings demonstrate how a subtle interplay of noncovalent and covalent forces plays a deterministic role in modulating lipid self-assembly pathways.", "date": "2022-03-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Biophysical Chemistry; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, a mechanistic understanding of their synthesis and scale-up remains underexplored due to the complicated nature of building block interactions.  In this work, we investigate the collective assembly of building units that have been experimentally observed to initiate MOF nucleation, using MIL-101(Cr) as a prototypical example. We use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations under a variety of synthesis conditions and mixture compositions. We observe that the choice of solvent (water or DMF), introduction of ions (Na+, F-) and the relative population of MIL-101(Cr) half-secondary building unit (half-SBU) isomers has a strong influence on the cluster formation process. In more detail, the shape, size, nucleation and growth rates, crystallinity and short and long-range order largely vary depending on the synthesis conditions. We evaluate these properties as they naturally emerge when interpreting self-assembly of MOF nuclei as the time-evolution of an undirected graph. Solution-induced con-formational complexity and ionic concentration have a dramatic effect on the morphology of clusters emerging during assembly, such diversity is captured by key features of the graph representation. More precisely, pure solvent leads to rapid formation of a small number of large clusters, while ions result in slower nucleation through smaller clusters in water. Finally, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on graph properties to successfully deconvolute MOF self-assembly into a small number of molecular descriptors, such as the average coordination number between half-SBUs and fractal dimension, which can be followed by time-resolved spectroscopy.

In this work, we employ electron-rich ammonium iodide or ammonium hydroxide pendant groups capable of self-n-doping the PDI core to form radical anions (R\u25cf\u2015) and dianions (D\u25cf\u25cf\u2015). We observe R\u25cf\u2015 formation is favored at low concentrations where aliphatic linkers are able to freely rotate, while D\u25cf\u25cf\u2015 formation is favored at elevated concentrations likely due to Coulombic stabilization between adjacent chromophores in a similar manner to that of Kasha exciton stabilization.

In this study, we have attempted to elucidate its mechanism, and we do this by calculating rate constants of photosensitization of oxygen by thiothymines (2-thiothymine, 4-thiothymine and 2,4 dithiothymine). The rate constants have been calculated using two approaches: (a) a classical limit of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR), and (b) a time-dependent variant of FGR, where the treatment is purely quantum mechanical. The former approach has previously been developed for bimolecular systems and has been applied to the photosensitization reactions studied here. The latter approach, however, has so far only been used for unimolecular reactions, and in this work, we describe how it can be adapted for bimolecular reactions. Experimentally, all three thiothymines are known to have significant singlet oxygen yields, which are indicative of similar rates. Rate constants calculated using the time-dependent variant of FGR are comparable across all three thiothymines and with experiment. While the classical approximation gives reasonable rate constants for 2-thiothymine, it severely underestimates them for 4-thiothymine and 2,4 dithiothymine, by several orders of magnitude.

A question then arises whether averages observed at small systems are the same as those observed at large, or macroscopic, systems. Utilizing statistical-mechanics formulations in ensembles in which the total numbers of particles are fixed, we demonstrate that system's properties of binding reactions are not homogeneous functions. That means averages of intensive properties, such as the concentration of the bound-state, at finite-systems are different than those at large-systems. The discrepancy increases with decreasing numbers of particles, temperature, and volume. As perplexing as it may sound, despite these variations in average quantities, extracting the equilibrium constant from systems of different sizes does yield the same value. The reason is that correlations in reactants' concentrations are ought be accounted for in the expression of the equilibrium constant, being negligible at large-scale but significant at small-scale. Similar arguments pertain to the calculations of the reaction rate-constants, more specifically, the bimolecular rate of the forward reaction is related to the average of the product (and not to the product of the averages) of the reactants' concentrations. Furthermore, we derive relations aiming to predict the composition of the system only from the value of the equilibrium constant. All predictions are validated by Monte-Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations.

Due to the importance of carbapenems in treatment of healthcare-associated infections, and the increasingly wide dissemination of OXA-48-like enzymes on plasmids, these \u03b2-lactamases are of high clinical significance. Notably, OXA-48 hydrolyses imipenem more efficiently than other commonly used carbapenems, such as meropenem. Here, we use extensive multiscale simulations of imipenem and meropenem hydrolysis by OXA-48 to dissect the dynamics and to explore differences in reactivity of the possible conformational substates of the respective acylenzymes. QM/MM simulations of the deacylation reaction for both substrates demonstrate that deacylation is favoured when the 6\u03b1-hydroxyethyl group is able to hydrogen bond to the water molecule responsible for deacylation, but disfavoured by increasing hydration of either oxygen of the carboxylated Lys73 general base. Differences in free energy barriers calculated from the QM/MM simulations correlate well with the experimentally observed differences in hydrolytic efficiency between meropenem and imipenem. We conclude that the impaired breakdown of meropenem, compared to imipenem, which arises from a subtle change in the hydrogen bonding pattern between the deacylating water molecule and the antibiotic, is most likely induced by the meropenem 1\u03b2-methyl group. In addition to increased insights into carbapenem breakdown by OXA \u03b2-lactamases, which may aid in future efforts to design of antibiotics or inhibitors, our approach exemplifies the combined use of atomistic simulations in determining the possible different enzyme-substrate substates, and their influence on enzyme reaction kinetics.\n \n", "date": "2022-03-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we conduct a multiscale MD study of the amyloidogenic self-assembly of insulin: a small protein with complex topology defined by two polypeptide chains interlinked by three disulfide bonds. In order to avoid kinetic traps, unconventional pre-planarized insulin conformations are used as amyloid building blocks. These starting conformers generated through uniaxial compression of the native monomer in various spatial directions represent 6 distinct (out of 16 conceivable) 2D topological classes varying in N- / C-terminal segments of insulin\u2019s A- and B-chains being placed inside, or outside of the central loop constituted by the middle sections of both chains and Cys7A-Cys7B / Cys19B-Cys20A disulfide bonds.

The various starting topologies are conserved throughout the self-assembly process resulting in polymorphic amyloid fibrils varying in structural features such as helical twist, presence of cavities, as well as the overall stability. Some of the protofilament structures obtained in this work are highly compatible with the earlier biophysical studies on insulin amyloid and high resolution studies on insulin-derived amyloidogenic peptide models postulating presence of steric zippers.

We developed an integrated workflow combining chiral separation by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem-MS detection for quantification of a broad panel of octadecanoids.

Both methods were validated in solvent and surrogate matrix in terms of linearity, lower limits of quantification (LLOQ), recovery, accuracy, precision, and matrix effects. Instrumental linearity was good for both methods (R2>0.995) and LLOQ ranged from 0.03-6.00 ng/mL for SFC and 0.01-1.25 ng/mL for LC.

In recent years the use of 2\u03c0-unsaturated units as coupling partners for the synthesis of heterocycles through C-H bond activation and an-nulation sequence has received immense attention. Among the unsaturated units employed for assembling heterocycles, the use of 1,3-diynes has garnered significant attention due to its ability in rendering the straightforward bis-heterocycles. Earlier methods employed to assemble bis-heterocycle include the use of preformed and pre-functionalized heterocycles via transi-tion metal-catalyzed coupling reactions. The expensive pre-functionalized halo-heterocycles and sensitive & expensive heterocyclic metal reagents limit its use. However, the transition metal-catalyzed C-H activation obviates the need for expensive heterocyclic metal reagents and pre-functionalized halo-heterocycles. The C-H bond activation strategy makes use of C-H bonds as functional groups for effecting the transformation. This renders the overall synthetic sequence both step and costs economic. Hence, this strategy of C-H activation and subsequent reaction with 1,3-diyne is useful for the larger-scale synthesis of chemicals in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite these advances, there is still the possibility of exploration of earth-abundant, and cost-effective first-row transition metals (Ni, Cu, Mn. Fe, etc.) for the synthesis of bis-heterocycles. Moreover, the Cp* ligand free, simple metal salt mediated synthesis of bis-heterocycles is also less explored. Thus, more exploration of reaction conditions for the Cp* free synthesis of bis-heterocycles is called for. We hope this review will inspire scientists to explore the unexplored domains.", "date": "2022-03-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Homogeneous Catalysis; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The mixing behaviour deviates strongly from ideality, exhibiting large negative energies of mixing. In the PIL, the [TEA] cation acts as a HB donor, being able to donate a single HB. Both, the [OMs] and the [OTf] anions can act as HB acceptors, which can accept multiple HBs via their respective SO3-groups. We use a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, calorimetry, and $^1$H-NMR chemical shift measurements to determine the difference in HB strength between the two species to be about 13 kJ/mol, favouring the [TEA]-[OMs] interaction. Based on our MD simulations we are able to formulate a lattice model, discriminating between HB and nonspecific intermolecular interactions. We demonstrate that, due to the ordered structure of the PILs, only the HB interactions contribute to the mixing energy.

Transport occurs only in the extended state when the length of the arm is sufficient to pass the anion between transporters located on opposite sides of the membrane. In contrast, the contracted state of the telescopic arm is too short to mediate effective transport.

Optimal 4e- NRR performance requires sufficient activity as well as selectivity over 6e- (NRR), other mechanistic NRR reaction branching points and the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this study, we perform first principles calculations in conjunction with uncertainty quantification on various monometallic and single atom alloy surfaces to study activity and selectivity of 4e- NRR.

Here, we present MACAW (Molecular AutoenCoding Auto-Workaround), a tool that uses a novel approach to generate molecules predicted to meet a desired property specification (e.g. a binding affinity of 50 nM or an octane number of 90). MACAW describes molecules by embedding them into a smooth multidimensional numerical space, avoiding uninformative dimensions that previous methods often introduce. The coordinates in this embedding provide a natural choice of features for accurately predicting molecular properties, which we demonstrate with examples for cetane and octane numbers, flash points, and histamine H1 receptor binding affinity. The approach is computationally efficient and well-suited to the small- and medium-size datasets commonly used in the biosciences. We showcase the utility of MACAW for virtual screening by identifying molecules with high predicted binding affinity to the histamine H1 receptor and limited affinity to the muscarinic M2 receptor, which are targets of medicinal relevance. Combining these predictive capabilities with a novel generative algorithm for molecules allows us to recommend molecules with a desired property value (i.e. inverse molecular design). We demonstrate this capability by recommending molecules with predicted octane numbers of 40, 80, and 120, which is an important characteristic for biofuels.

The undercoordinated Mo-center pushes the Mo 4d-orbitals close to the Fermi energy in the valence band region while Ni 3d-orbitals lie in the conduction band. Since, electrons are donated from the electron-rich Mo-center to the electron-poor Ni-center, the inverse charge transfer effect navigates the Mo-center to become positively charged and vice versa.

We present a machine learning model based on an equivariant Euclidean Neural Network framework to obtain quantum-accurate electron densities for arbitrary DNA structures that are much too large for conventional quantum methods. The model is trained on representative B-DNA base pair steps that capture both base pairing and base stacking interactions. The model produces accurate electron densities for arbitrary B-DNA structures with typical errors of less than 1%. Crucially, the error does not increase with system size, which suggests that the model can extrapolate to large DNA structures with negligible loss of accuracy. The model also generalizes well to other DNA structural motifs such as the A- and Z-DNA forms, despite being trained on only B-DNA configurations. We show that this machine learning electron density model can be used to calculate electrostatic potentials of DNA with quantum accuracy. These electrostatic potentials produce more accurate results compared to classical force fields and do not show the usual deficiencies at short range. Lastly, the model is used to calculate electron densities of several large-scale DNA structures, and we show that the computational scaling for this model is linear.", "date": "2022-03-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We found that catalysts operating via a covalently bound reactant intermediate show a strong correlation between their distance to the protein surface and their efficiency and that the site-selectivity of the modification is affected by the position of the catalyst. Our results are rationalized using computational simulations, showing that one-point anchoring of the DNA construct leads to notable differences in the site of modification.", "date": "2022-03-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Bioorganic Chemistry; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Prediction of induced paramagnetic NMR shifts requires knowledge of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) parameters: the electronic g tensor, zero-field splitting D tensor, and hyperfine A tensor. The isotropic part of A, called the hyperfine coupling constant (HFCC), is one of the most troublesome properties for quantum chemistry calculations. Yet, even relatively small errors in calculations of HFCC tend to propagate into large errors in the predicted NMR shifts. The poor quality of A tensors that are currently calculated by density functional theory (DFT) constitutes a bottleneck in improving the reliability of interpretation of the NMR spectra from paramagnetic systems. In this work, electron correlation effects in calculations of HFCCs with a hierarchy of ab initio methods were assessed, and the applicability of different levels of DFT approximations and the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method was tested. These assessments were performed for the set of selected test systems comprising an organic radical, and complexes with transition metal and rare-earth ions, for which experimental data are available. Severe deficiencies of DFT were revealed but the CCSD method was able to deliver good agreement with experimental data for all systems considered, however, at substantial computational costs. We proposed a more computationally tractable alternative, where the A was computed with the coupled cluster theory exploiting locality of electron correlation. This alternative is based on the domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster singles and doubles (DLPNO-CCSD) method. In this way the robustness and reliability of the coupled cluster theory were incorporated into the modern formalism for the prediction of induced paramagnetic NMR shifts, and became applicable to systems of chemical interest. This approach was verified for the bis(cyclopentadienyl)vanadium(II) complex (vanadocene), and the metal-binding site of the Zn(II) \u2192 Co(II) substituted superoxide dismutase (SOD) metalloprotein. Excellent agreement with experimental NMR shifts was achieved, which represented a substantial improvement over previous theoretical attempts.

It is natural to ask why it does not exhibit bond equalization and adopt a cumulenic structure. This paper, on the other hand, begins with the opposite question: why we expect it to exhibit bond equalization in the first place. We then reexamine whether these intuitive arguments are theoretically sound. H\u00fcckel model, which was often attributed as the underlying reason for the famous 4N+2 electron-counting rule for aromatics, was reviewed with minimal structural flexibility introduced, which surprisingly revealed that even benzene would undergo bond alternation under the H\u00fcckel framework. This analysis is confirmed by extended H\u00fcckel calculations. DFT and semi-empirical calculations revealed that internuclear repulsion would be necessary for a model to correctly predict the D6h structure of benzene. Similar scenario was observed for C18, except that a greater fraction of exact exchange may result in a small energy gain when molecule distorts from D18h to D9h geometry. HOMO energy lowering and LUMO energy rising were found in the symmetry-lowering distortion of both benzene and C18, thus disqualifying the usual explanation of the bond alternating structure of C18 based on second-order Jahn-Teller effect. Finally, a hydrogen-ring model was presented as a toy model to investigate the origin of bond equalization of so-called aromatic systems, which clearly revealed the role of nuclear repulsion in favoring high-symmetry structure while electronic energy monotonically decreases in symmetry-lowering process.", "date": "2022-03-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Study on the adhesion properties of oil sands to solid substrates is important to minimize the fouling of substrates during mining operation. In this work, we study the influence of hydrophobicity and mechanical properties of the substrates on the adhesion strength of frozen oil sands. By using an adhesion force apparatus with temperature control, we measure the adhesion strength of both ice and frozen oil sands on six types of substrates with water contact angle from \u223c20\u25e6 to \u223c130\u25e6 and Young\u2019s modulus from a few MPa to 300 GPa. A clear linear correlation between the adhesion strength of pure ice and that of frozen oil sands is observed. Furthermore, the adhesion strength increases with the load on the oil sands sample and reaches a plateau at \u223c450 kPa. The maximum adhesion strength may be due to the limit of particle packing of oil sands. We also demonstrate that spray coating of anti-freezing liquids is effective for the mitigation of the adhesion of frozen oil sands. Substrates coated with various anti-freezing liquids showed undetectable oil sands adhesion strength at -20 \u25e6C with 0.06 MPa of load.

Primary cause of the development of cancer is exposure to potentially hazardous environmental factors and unhealthy lifestyle.  Among all types of cancer, breast cancer is most common in women and becomes a public health issue on a global scale. There has been considerable interest in the development of drugs which can target cancer-causing hotspot factors such as mTOR, estrogen receptor alpha, and progesterone receptor to cure breast cancer. The key focus of the present work is to search plant-based phytochemical molecules which can efficiently interact with the targeted proteins responsible for the development and progression of breast cancer using molecular docking studies. \nMethods: We have screened 1064 phytochemical molecules from plant sources against 5 potential hotspot targets: EGFR kinase domain, Human estrogen receptor alpha ligand-binding domain, FRB fragment of mTOR, Progesterone receptor, and NUDT5 of breast cancer. Results: Our results show that among all molecules, 25 phytochemicals exhibit promising therapeutic potential for breast cancer treatment.

Cells respond to signals by changing catalytic activity of enzymes. This signal responsive catalysis is crucial in the regulation of (bio)chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Inspired by these networks, we report an artificial signal responsive system that shows signal-induced temporary catalyst activation. We use an unstable signal to temporarily activate an out of equilibrium CRN, generating transient host guest complexes to control catalytic activity. Esters with favourable binding towards the cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) supramolecular host are used as fleeting signals to form a transient complex with  CB[7], replacing a CB[7]-bound guest. The esters are hydrolytically unstable, generating acids and alcohols, which do not bind to CB[7], leading to guest re-uptake. We demonstrate the feasibility of the concept using signal-controlled temporary dye release and re-uptake. The same fleeting signal controlled system was then used to tune the reaction rate of aniline catalysed hydrazone formation. Varying the ester structure and concentration gave access to different catalyst liberation times and free catalyst concentration, regulating the overall reaction rate. With fleeting signal controlled transient complex formation we can tune the kinetics of a second chemical reaction, in which the signal does not participate. This system shows promise for building more complex non biological networks, to ultimately arrive at signal transduction in organic materials.", "date": "2022-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Physical Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Offer; Monica Marinescu; Yatish Patel", "abstract": "In an effort to increase the specific energy of lithium-ion batteries, silicon additives are often blended with graphite (Gr) in the negative electrode of commercial cells. However, due to the large volumetric expansion of silicon upon lithiation, these Si-Gr composites are prone to faster rates of degradation than conventional graphite electrodes. Understanding the effect of this difference is key to controlling degradation and improving cell lifetimes. Here, we investigate the effects of state of charge and temperature on the ageing of a commercial cylindrical cell with a Si-Gr electrode (LG M50T). Using degradation mode analysis, we were able to quantify the rates of degradation for Si and Gr separately. Loss of active Si is shown to be worse than Gr under all operating conditions, but especially at low state of charge and high temperature, with up to 80% loss in Si capacity after 4 kA h of charge throughput (~400 equivalent full cycles). The results indicate cell lifetimes can be improved by limiting the depth of discharge of cells containing Si-Gr, which suggests Si is not beneficial for all applications. The degradation mode analysis methods developed here provide valuable new insight into the causes of cell ageing by separating the effects of the two active materials in the composite electrode.

This study investigates the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind the oxygen reservoir phenomenon and extends it to other binary and multicomponent oxide ALD systems. NiO ALD is found to exhibit similar saturation behavior and crystallinity trends with ozone as Fe2O3 ALD. Oxygen uptake from ozone into the film is directly detected in situ for both processes, and in vacuo spectroscopy elucidates possible chemical states of the subsurface oxygen reservoirs in each material. In situ process characterization reveals that the reserved oxygen participates in surface combustion reactions capable of activating ALD growth. The oxygen reservoir mechanism is also shown to generalize to other oxide systems, correlating with trends in oxygen mobility, crystallinity, and metal oxidizability.

This heterocycle is substituted with two alkyl chains and a 3-hydroxypropanoyl moiety. We report here our efforts to elucidate the origin of the carbon skeleton of nocuolin A. Supplementation of cyanobacterial cultures with stable isotope-labeled fatty acids revealed that the central C13 chain is assembled from two medium-chain fatty acids, hexanoic and octanoic acids.

This enzyme is part of a phylogenetically well-defined clade within similar genomic contexts.

Even more, most authors will not be able to reproduce the results from a few years ago due to lacking a gap-less record of every processing and analysis step including all parameters involved. There is only one way to overcome this problem: developing robust tools for data analysis that, while maintaining a maximum of flexibility in their application, allow the user to perform advanced processing steps in a scientifically sound way. At the same time, the only viable approach for reproducible and traceable analysis is to relieve the user of the responsibility for logging all processing steps and their parameters. This can only be achieved by using a system that takes care of these crucial though often neglected tasks. Here, we present a solution to this problem: a framework for the analysis of spectroscopic data (ASpecD) written in the Python programming language that can be used without any actual programming needed. This framework is made available open-source and free of charge and focusses on usability, small footprint and modularity while ensuring reproducibility and good scientific practice. Furthermore, we present a set of best practices and design rules for scientific software development and data analysis. Together, this empowers scientists to focus on their research minimising the need to implement complex software tools while ensuring full reproducibility. We anticipate this to have a major impact on reproducibility and good scientific practice, as we raise the awareness of their importance, summarise proven best practices and present a working user-friendly software solution.", "date": "2022-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report on significant anaerobic biodefluorinaiton structures and novel defluorination pathways of specific Cl-PFAS triggered by anaerobic microbial dechlorination. Compared to the H-substituted counterparts, the Cl-substituted per- and polyfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids PFCAs exhibited faster and deeper defluorination, which was attributed to the highly bioreactive Cl-substitutions. The Cl-PFCAs underwent reductive, hydrolytic, and eliminative dehalogenation reactions. It was the hydrolytic dechlorination that led to the following significant spontaneous defluorination forming di-carboxylic acids. The more Cl-substitutions, the more likely the hydrolytic dechlorination would occur at the multiple Cl-substitutions, leading to much higher defluorination and chain-shortening products. About 80% total defluorination was achieved for the chlorotrifluoroethylene tetramer carboxylic acid with four Cl-substitutions. The reductive dechlorination was a non-defluorinating pathway, and the H-substituted products were more recalcitrant to biodefluorination. This study advances the knowledge of the structure-biodegradability and the biodefluorination pathways of Cl-PFCAs in anaerobic conditions. It provides important guidance to assess the environmental fate and transport of Cl-PFAS, including fluoropolymers, and the potential environmental risks. It also sheds light on PFAS source-tracking by suggesting Cl-PFAS as an important source of some emergent PFAS structures detected in impacted fields.

The key to success was designing a catalytic cycle for radical [3+2] cycloaddition involving a pyridine cocatalyst to generate from the diboron(4) catalyst and reversibly mediate the transfer of boronyl radicals. In comparison with known [3+2] cycloaddition with transition metal-based catalysts, the current reaction features not only metal-free conditions, inexpen-sive and stable catalysts, and simple operation, but also remarkably broadened substrate scope. In particular, previously unusable cyclopropyl ketones without an activating group and/or alkenes with 1,2-disubstitution and 1,1,2-trisubstitution pattern were successfully used for the first time. Consequently, challenging cyclopentane compounds with various levels of substitution (65 examples, 57 new products, up to six substituents at all five ring atoms) were readily prepared in generally high to excellent yield and diastereoselectivity. The reaction was also successfully applied in con-cise formal synthesis of an anti-obesity drug and building natural product-like complex bridged or spiralcyclic com-pounds. Mechanistic experiments and computational investigation support the proposed radical relay catalysis featuring a pyridine-assisted boronyl radical catalyst.

However, COFs are insoluble in common solvents and do not melt at high temperatures, which presents a great challenge for the fabrication of COF-based membranes (COFMs). Herein, for the first time, we report a new synthetic strategy to prepare continuous and intact self-standing COFMs, including 2D N-COF membrane and 3D COF-300 membrane. Both COFMs show excellent selectivity of H2/CO2 mixed gas (26 for N-COF membrane and 18.4 for COF-300 membrane), and especially ultrahigh H2 permeance (13165 GPU for N-COF membrane and 12475 GPU for COF-300 membrane), which is superior to those of COFMs reported so far. It should be noted that the overall separation performance of self-standing COFMs exceeds the Robeson upper bound. Furthermore, a theoretical study based on Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation is performed to explain the excellent separation of H2/CO2 through COFMs. Thus, this facile preparation method will provide a broad prospect for the development of self-standing COFMs with highly efficient H2 purification.

Here, we introduce a strategy to overcome these drawbacks of PEC hydrogels by interlacing the electrostatically crosslinked PEC network with a covalently crosslinked polymer network, creating polyelectrolyte complex-covalent interpenetrating polymer network (PEC-IPN) hydrogels. In the PEC-IPN hydrogels demonstrated here, composed of oppositely charged ABA triblock copolymers and photocrosslinkable 4-arm poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), the PEC network self-assembles swiftly in aqueous environs, providing structural rigidity and serving as protective scaffoldings for the covalently crosslinkable PEO precursors. Photocrosslinking of the PEO chains creates a covalent network, supplying structural reinforcement to the PEC network. The resulting PEC-IPN hydrogels possess significantly improved shear and tensile strength, swelling characteristics, and mechanical stability in saline environments while preserving the intrinsic features of PEC networks, including the mesoscale network structure and salt-responsiveness.

Host-guest chemistry can also provide 1:1:1 complexes through the inclusion of electronically complementary donor and acceptor guests, but the photoreactivity of such complexes has not been investigated. In this work, we investigated a series of donor and acceptor stilbenes and found 1:1:1 complexes with cucurbit[8]uril that exhibited charge-transfer (CT) absorption bands in the visible and near-IR regions. Irradiation of the CT band of an azastilbene, 4,4\u2019-stilbenedicarboxylate, and cucurbit[8]uril ternary complex led to a selective cross-[2+2] photocycloaddition, while other substrate pairs exhibited no productive chemistry upon CT excitation. Using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, we were able to understand the variable photoreactivity of different stilbene donor-acceptor complexes. We found that the back electron transfer (BET) following CT excitation of the photoreactive complex is positioned deep in the Marcus inverted region due to electrostatic stabilization of the ground state, allowing [2+2] to effectively compete with this relaxation pathway. Control reactions revealed that the cucurbit[8]uril host not only serves to template the reaction from the ground state, but also protects the long-lived radical ions formed by CT from side reactions. This protective role of the host suggests that donor-acceptor host-guest ternary complexes could be used to improve existing CT-initiated photochemistry or access new reactivity.

Although TDDFT is a widely-used method for computing vertical excitation energies and electronic absorption spectra, it suffers from certain pathologies in the description of conical intersections whenever the ground state is involved.  These issues\nare resolved in SF-TDDFT, albeit at the expense of greater spin contamination that sometimes becomes problematic, and which has motivated the development of spin-complete extensions of TDDFT that produce spin-pure (or nearly spin pure) eigenstates.

Obstacles remain for their practical application, such as capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency resulting from shuttling and reaction of polysulfides with the Li anode. A new supramolecular approach to suppress shuttling using reversible binding of anionic polysulfides, e.g., S3\u2022\u2013, S62\u2013, S72\u2013, S82\u2013, by anion-selective receptors, called cyanostar (CS) macrocycles is reported. Standard separators were coated with the macrocycles and formed chemically selective membranes. Unlike adsorption materials and non-selective supramolecular approaches, cyanostar provides a well-defined molecule-to-molecule mechanism to capture polysulfides as host-guest complexes like (CS)2\u2022S3\u2022\u2013 and (CS)4\u2022S72\u2013. Permselectivity emerges from reversibly binding polysulfides inside the membrane to prevent anions passing while allowing cations to pass. Controls using macrocycles that are not selective for anions do not stop shuttling. Cyanostar-coated membranes turn on charging, reduce capacity fading from 0.51 to 0.36% per cycle and improve Columbic efficiency to 85%. These improvements occur even without addition of lithium nitrate used almost universally to inhibit reactions with the Li anode. This new strategy showcases the benefits of using selective receptors to manage movement of ions in sulfur-based batteries.", "date": "2022-03-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, a series of \u03b71 cupric superoxide complexes bound by tris(phosphinimine) ligands (X-PhMe2P3tren) are reported. Across this series of complexes, the identity of the substituent at the 4 position of a phosphinimine phenyl group was modulated (X = NMe2, H, CF3). The X-PhMe2P3tren ligands impart systematic adjustments to the electronic and secondary coordination sphere electrostatic properties of the copper complexes while maintaining a consistent steric profile in the vicinity of the O2 binding pockets. Key differences in the thermal stabilities and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics were observed among the \u03b71 cupric superoxide complexes, which are discussed in the context of both intra- and inter-molecular electrostatic interactions. Notably, the cupric superoxide complex that was most resistant to decomposition \u2013 [(CF3 PhMe2P3tren)CuII(O2\u20221\u2013)]+ \u2013 displays markedly improved thermal stability compared to the Me3P3tren-bound cupric superoxide complex and can be observed as high as room temperature on a multi-minute timescale. Detailed kinetic and computational analyses suggest that the improved thermal stability in this context results from an electrosteric effect, in which the accumulation of cationic charge in the secondary coordination sphere slows bimolecular decomposition.

In this study we developed methods to derive human macrophages and prepare them for mass spectrometry analysis in order to more-deeply understand the proteomic consequences of macrophage stimulation. Interferon gamma (IF-g), an immune stimulating cytokine, was used to induce macrophage activation, increasing phagocytosis of cancer cells by 2-fold. These conditions were used to perform comparative shotgun proteomics between resting macrophages and stimulated macrophages with increased phagocytic activity. Our analysis revealed that macrophages bias their protein production toward biological processes associated with phagocytosis and antigen processing in response to stimulation. We confirmed our findings by antibody-based Western blotting experiments, validating both previously reported and novel proteins of interest. In addition to whole protein changes, we evaluated active protein synthesis by treating cells with the methionine surrogate probe homopropargylglycine (HPG). We saw increased rates of HPG incorporation during during phagocytosis-inducing stimulation, suggesting protein synthesis rates are altered by stimulation.

However, limited synthetic strategies to access these molecules act as a major bottleneck for a rapid development of this field by uncovering hidden potentials of purposefully designed task-specific expanded heterohelicenes.

Crystallographic fragment screening of the Diamond-SGC Poised Library for binding to Notum, supported by a biochemical enzyme assay to rank inhibition activity, identifed 6a and 6b as a pair of outstanding hits. Fragment development of 6 delivered 8l that restored Wnt signaling in the presence of Notum in a cell-based reporter assay.  Assessment in pharmacology screens showed 8l to be selective against serine hydrolases, kinases and drug targets.

In spite of its increasing importance, the judicious modulation of ChB donor strength remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present, for the first time, the reversible and large-scale modulation of ChB potency by electrochemical redox control. This is exemplified by both the switching-ON of anion recognition via ChB oxidative activation of a novel bis(ferrocenyltellurotriazole) anion host and switching-OFF reductive ChB deactivation of anion binding potency with a telluroviologen receptor. The direct linking of the redox-active centre and ChB receptor donor sites enables strong coupling, which is reflected by up to a remarkable 3 orders of magnitude modulation of anion binding strength. This is demonstrated through large voltammetric perturbations of the respective receptor ferrocene and viologen redox couples, enabling, for the first time, ChB-mediated electrochemical anion sensing. The sensors not only display significant anion-binding induced electrochemical responses in competitive aqueous-organic solvent systems but can compete with, or even outperform similar, highly potent XB and HB sensors. These observations serve to highlight a unique (redox) tuneability of ChB and pave the way for further exploration of the reversible (redox) modulation of ChB in a wide range of applications including anion sensors as well as molecular switches and machines.", "date": "2022-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Sensors; Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

These surfaces are well-sought in energy, water, health care, separation science, self-cleaning, biology, and other lab-on-chip applications. While most of the demonstrations of heterogeneous wettability rely on a series of complex fabrication protocols, we reveal an unconventional approach to achieving heterogeneous wettability through three simple steps (i.e., patterning, silanizing, and rinsing). Here, we show heterogeneous wettability on a planar substrate harnessing (a) the wetting and dewetting behavior of nano-textured conductive surface patterns of Gallium alloys and (b) interfacial chemical reactivity of the native surface oxides of these alloys in the presence of chloro-silane vapor. Alloys of Gallium (eGaIn and others) have emerged as one of the most promising soft metals for the fabrication of soft functional devices harnessing their surface oxides, mostly Gallium Oxide (Ga2O3). These alloys can be 2D patterned utilizing the wetting behavior of the Ga2O3, which seems impossible due to the high surface tension of the bare metal. We utilized such 2D metal patterns on the planar glass surface and exposed the patterns in chloro-silane vapors to begin our study. Chloro-silanes can alter the surface energy of different substrates (i.e., glass, silicon wafer) to offer hydrophobicity and releases Chlorine vapors which etch Ga2O3 that induces the delamination. A simple DI water rinsing operation reveals a thin hydrophilic layer on the pre-patterned area that we utilized for an open-ended microfluidic demonstration, as well. We confirmed hydrophilicity through contact angle measurements; elemental compositions, and Chlorine's presence through energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) analyses. We believe such an unconventional approach of achieving heterogeneous wettability has the potential for fundamental studies related to bioinspired and biomimetic applications.", "date": "2022-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this vein, a fully electric process in which water-splitting-derived hydrogen and air-separation-derived nitrogen are reacted in an electrochemical process to produce ammonia is attractive. Such a process has the potential to be highly flexible and utilize intermittent renewable energy well. Here, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of large-scale fully electric ammonia production relying on renewable electricity sources in conjunction with different types of storage and flexible operation, using a mixed-integer linear programming framework. The approach incorporates a first-principle, chemistry-independent representation of reactor power consumption and its dependence on reactor sizing and electrochemical parameters, the impact of product separation and recycling unconverted reactants, and plant dynamics in response to temporal variability in renewable energy availability. Given the emerging nature of electrochemical ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and hydrogen, we used the model to identify the reaction descriptors and their threshold values that enable cost parity between fully electric ammonia production with commercially viable production using thermochemical synthesis coupled with electrolytic hydrogen powered by renewable energy. We found that ammonia can be produced in an economically competitive manner, i.e. at costs <1 $/kg, at large scales if the electrochemical reactor can produce ammonia at partial currents exceeding 400 mA cm-2, energy efficiencies exceeding 30%, and process lifetimes of several years. In light of this, novel chemistries that can reduce nitrogen at high rates and moderate (<2.5 V) overpotentials are necessary for economic, large-scale ammonia production.", "date": "2022-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, compared to their living counterparts, synthetic materials made by self-assembly usually lack some of the interesting properties of living systems such as multicomponent character or capability to adapt, transform and evolve. Here we describe an isothermal multicomponent DNA self-assembly method that recapitulates all these characteristics and leads to user-defined objects with programmable shape, site-specific function, intrinsic reconfigurability and unprecedented capacity of major transformation and shape evolution. Using a generic magnesium-free buffer containing NaCl, we show that a complex cocktail of hundreds of different DNA strands can spontaneously assemble at room or body temperature to form desired DNA origamis of various shapes with site-specific protein functionalization, extended nanogrids or single-strand tile-assemblies. In situ atomic force microscopy allows us to follow the self-assembly process and demonstrate that DNA origami assembly proceeds through multiple folding pathways, the system escaping kinetic traps until it reaches its equilibrium target structure. We also show that, under thermodynamic control, this method allows a given system to self-select its most stable shape in a large pool of competitive DNA strands. We finally demonstrate the first giant morphological transformation of DNA origamis spontaneously evolving at constant temperature from one shape to a radically different one by the massive exchange of all its constitutive staple strands. This method greatly expands the repertoire of shapes and functions attainable by isothermal self-assembly as well as provides tools to design evolutive DNA assemblies, with applications ranging from directed or self-adaptive morphological changes to nanostructure optimization by evolution.", "date": "2022-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Quantitative measurements of dopamine are essential for understanding dopamine functional dynamics. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is the most widely used electrochemical technique for measuring real-time in vivo dopamine level changes. Standard FSCV has only been used to analyze \u201cphasic dopamine\u201d (changes in seconds), because the gradual generation of background charging current is inevitable, and acts as the main noise source in the low-frequency band. Although \u201ctonic dopamine\u201d (changes in minutes to hours) is key for understanding the dopamine system, an electrochemical technique capable of simultaneously measuring phasic and tonic dopamine in an in vivo environment has not been established. Several modified voltammetric techniques have been developed for measuring tonic dopamine, but the sampling rates (0.1-0.05 Hz) are too low to be useful. Further investigation of the in vivo applicability of previously developed background drift removal methods for measuring tonic dopamine levels is required. We developed a second-derivative-based background removal (SDBR) method for simultaneously measuring phasic and tonic neurotransmitter levels in real-time. The performance of this technique was tested via in silico and in vitro tonic dopamine experiments. Furthermore, its applicability was tested in vivo. SDBR is a simple, robust, post-processing technique that can extract tonic neurotransmitter levels from all FSCV data.

Treating the various intricacies of excimer binding at an adequate level is expected to be particularly challenging for time-dependent Density Functional Theory (TD- DFT) methods. In addition to well-known limitations for some TD-DFT methods in the description of charge transfer or exciton coupling, the inherent London dispersion problem from ground-state DFT translates to TD-DFT. While techniques to appropriately treat dispersion in DFT are well- developed for electronic ground states, these dispersion corrections remain largely untested for excited states. Herein, we aim to shed light on current TD-DFT methods, including some of the newest developments. The binding of four model excimers is studied across nine density functionals with and without the application of additive dispersion corrections against a wave function reference of SCS-CC2/CBS(3,4) quality, which approximates select CCSDR(3)/CBS data adequately. To our knowledge, this is the first study that presents single-reference wave function dissociation curves at the complete basis set level for the assessed model systems. It is also the first time range-separated double-hybrid density functionals are applied to excimers. In fact, those functionals turn out to be the most promising for the description of excimer binding followed by global double hybrids. Range-separated and global hybrid\u2014particularly with large fractions of Fock exchange\u2014are outperformed by double hybrids and yield worse dissociation energies and inter-molecular equilibrium distances. The deviation between assessed functional and reference increases with system size, most likely due to missing dispersion interactions. Additive dispersion corrections of the DFT-D3(BJ) and DFT-D4 types reduce the average errors for TD-DFT methods but do so inconsistently and therefore do not offer a black-box solution in their ground-state parametrised form. The lack of appropriate description of dispersion effects for TD-DFT methods is likely hindering the practical application of the herein identified more efficient methods. Dispersion corrections parametrised for excited states appear to be an important next step to improve the applicability of TD-DFT methods and we hope that our work assists with the future development of such corrections.", "date": "2022-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The light--matter coupling is included via the collective vacuum Rabi frequency $\\Omega_0$. Using our model, we obtain excellent agreement with a series of experimental extinction spectra of particles with various coupling strengths due to a systematic size variation.

In this ten-electron-oxidation process, four \u03c3 bonds, one \u03c0 bond, and three six-membered rings are formed in a reaction sequence of up to nine steps to yield a 72-carbon-atom warped framework, comprising two configurationally locked [7]helicene units, fluorescent peropyrene unit, and two precisely installed sp3-defects.The key intermediate in this cascade is a closed nonacethrene derivative with one quaternary center, presumably formed via an electrocyclic ring closure of nonacethrene, which\u2014\nwhen activated by oxidation\u2014undergoes an oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene. By controlling the amount oxidant used, two intermediates and one side product could be isolated and fully characterized, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and one intermediate was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In concert with density functional theory calculations, these intermediates support the proposed reaction mechanism. Compared to peropyrene, the absorption and emission of hypercethrene are slightly red-shifted on account of extended conjugation and the fluorescence quantum yield of 0.45 is decreased by a factor of ~2.

Of interest are both sensitive as well as highly selective sensors. Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonator-based biochemical sensors are among the most sensitive sensors in existence due to their long photon confinement times. One main concern with these devices, however, is their selectivity towards specific classes of target analytes. Here, we employ frequency locked whispering gallery mode microtoroid optical resonators covalently modified with various polymer coatings to selectively detect the chemical warfare agent surrogate diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) as well as the toxic industrial chemicals formaldehyde and ammonia at parts-per-trillion concentrations. This is 1-2 orders of magnitude better than previously reported, depending on the target, except for pristine graphene and pristine carbon nanotube sensors, which demonstrate similar detection levels but in vacuum and without selectivity. Selective polymer coatings include polyethylene glycol (PEG) for DIMP sensing, accessed by the modification of commercially available materials, and 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl-terminated polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) for ammonia sensing. Notably, we developed an efficient one-pot procedure to access 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl-terminated PVAc that utilizes cobalt-mediated living radical polymerization and a nitroxyl polymer-terminating agent. Alkaline hydrolysis of PVAc coatings to form polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) coatings directly bound to the microtoroid proved to be reliable and reproducible, leading to WGM sensors capable of the rapid and selective detection of formaldehyde vapors. The selectivity of these three polymer coatings as sensing media was predicted, in part, based on their functional group content and known reactivity patterns with the target analytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microtoroids coated with a mixture of polymers can serve as an all-in-one sensor that can detect multiple agents. We anticipate that our results will facilitate rapid early detection of chemical agents, as well as their surrogates and precursors.

Recent reports find that the use of drugs of abuse increases the production of dynorphin and overall activation of KOR. Long-acting KOR antagonists, such as norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI), JDTic, and 5'-guanidinonaltrindole (GNTI), have been shown to stop depressive and anxiety-related disorders, which are the common side effects of withdrawal that can lead to the relapse in drug use. Unfortunately, these prototypical KOR antagonists are known to induce selective KOR antagonism that is delayed by hours and extremely prolonged, and their use in humans comes with serious safety concerns because they possess a large window for potential drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, their persistent pharmacodynamic activities can hinder the ability to reverse unanticipated side effects immediately. Herein we report our studies of the lead selective, salvinorin-based KOR antagonist (1) as well as nor-BNI on C57BL/6N mice for spontaneous cocaine withdrawal. Assessment of pharmacokinetics showed that 1 is a short-acting compound with an average half-life of 3.75 h across different compartments (brain, spinal cord, liver, and plasma). Both 1 (5 mg/kg) and nor-BNI (5 mg/kg) were shown to reduce spontaneous withdrawal behavior in mice, with 1 producing additional anti-anxiety-like behavior in a light-dark transition test (however, no mood-related effects of 1 or nor-BNI were observed at the current dosing in an elevated plus maze or a tail suspension test). Our results support the study of selective, short-acting KOR antagonists for the treatment of psychostimulant withdrawal and the associated negative mood states that contribute to relapse. Furthermore, we identified pertinent interactions between 1 and KOR via computational studies, including induced-fit docking, mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations, to gain insight into the design of future selective, potent, and short-acting salvinorin-based antagonists.", "date": "2022-03-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Second, we elucidate the precursor conversion mechanism that leads to the formation of Cu3N from copper(II) nitrate and oleylamine. We find that oleylamine is both the reductant and nitrogen source. Oleylamine is oxidized to a primary aldimine and the latter reacts further with oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with Cu(I) to form Cu3N.

This regulatory difference provides an economic incentive to use or claim the use of SyN to remain on the market without submitting a Premarket Tobacco Product Application. TDN is ~99.3% (S)-nicotine, whereas SyN can vary from racemic (50/50 (R)/(S)) to \u2265 99% (S)-nicotine, i.e., chemically identical to the tobacco-derived compound.

A major component towards achieving this goal is both the removal of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) and the generation or recovery of oxygen (O2). NASA\u2019s current technology only operates at about 50% efficiency due to the need to vent the methane that is produced during the CO2 reduction process. One method of improving the efficiency of this process is through plasma pyrolysis, wherein the methane is pyrolyzed to produce hydrogen and various dehydrogenated carbon byproducts. In this process, acetylene is one of the main components of this byproduct stream. Unfortunately, while the concentration of this effluent is generally high in hydrogen (>90% typically) the presence of the acetylene waste product can act as a poison for the ruthenium-alumina catalyst used in the CO2 reducing Sabatier process, requiring a removal step. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a valuable method for removing these unsaturated hydrocarbons due to their high tunability, particularly through the incorporation of open metal sites. In this study, two common iron-based MOFs, MIL-100 and PCN-250, were studied for their ability to adsorb acetylene. A combination of gas adsorption analysis and density functional theory calculation results show the ability of these materials to undergo a thermal induced reduction event which results in an improvement in gas adsorption performance. This improvement in gas performance appears to be at least partially due to the increased presence of \u03c0-backbonding towards the acetylene molecules.", "date": "2022-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Industrial Manufacturing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, this fluorination technique has been applied so far only to a narrow range of carbon rich organic substrates. In this preliminary study, based on quantum chemical modeling of several key stages in the presumed mechanism of this reaction, we put forward a hypothesis to explain difficulties of extending the Mn-porphyrin-catalyzed fluorination to nitrogen rich drug-like molecules, namely, a significant growth of the height of the activation barrier for drug-like substrates. Specifically, we demonstrate that reaction energies are comparable for various substrates, including those for which Mn-porphyrin-catalyzed fluorination occurs and those for which it does not occur, and hence, thermodynamic factors are unlikely to control the observed differences in the reactivity. Next, we carry out a first-pass modeling of fluorination reaction paths for two substrates, cyclohexane versus piperidine, as a representative of the type of nitrogen rich compound that can and cannot be fluorinated under recommended conditions, and found a significant difference in activation energies (~7 kcal/mol vs ~40 kcal/mol), which might point at the reason for the difference in the reactivity.

To identify the origins of its exceptional performance and inform future catalyst design, we report a combined computational and experimental study that establishes two distinct mechanistic pathways for electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyzed by [Fe]2+ as a function of applied overpotential. Electrochemical data shows the formation of two catalytic regimes at low (hTOF/2 of 160 mV) and high (hTOF/2 of 590 mV) overpotential plateaus. We propose that at low overpotentials [Fe]2+ undergoes a two-electron reduction, two-proton transfer mechanism (electrochemical-electrochemical-chemical-chemical, EECC), where turnover occurs through the dicationic iron complex, [Fe]2+. Computational analysis supports the importance of the singlet ground state electronic structure for CO2 binding and that the rate-limiting step is the second protonation in this low-overpotential regime. When more negative potentials are applied, an additional electron transfer event occurs through either a stepwise or proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway, enabling catalytic turnover from the monocationic iron complex ([Fe]+) via an electrochemical-chemical-electrochemical-chemical (ECEC) mechanism. Comparison of experimental kinetic data obtained from variable controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments with direct product detection with calculated rates obtained from the energetic span model support the PCET pathway as the most likely mechanism.

Stabilization of the chemisorbed state occurs in sys-tems such as Cu-Fe where there is a delocalization of orbitals around the Fermi level, causing the large charge transfer from the cata-lyst to CO2. We have also conducted calculations of the free energy profiles of the CO2-to-CO conversion and the competitive hy-drogen evolution reaction (HER). The CO2 reduction reaction is dominant over HER on the Cu randomly generated cluster due to the lower potential limiting step. Among other considered bimetallic, the core@shell models also display good catalytic activity and selectivity towards the CO2 reduction reaction. This work identifies insightful structure-property relationships for CO2 activation, highlighting the influence of size and composition on the CO2 activation and intermediate stability in designing catalytic cupper-based mono- and bi-metallic clusters for the CO2 reduction reaction.", "date": "2022-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Carbapenems were formerly considered \u2018last resort\u2019 antibiotics because they escaped breakdown by most \u03b2-lactamases, due to slow deacylation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, an increasing number of Gram-negative bacteria now produce \u03b2-lactamases with carbapenemase activity: these efficiently hydrolyze the carbapenem \u03b2-lactam ring, severely limiting treatment of some bacterial infections. Here, we use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the deacylation reactions of acyl-enzyme complexes of eight \u03b2-lactamases of class A (the most widely distributed \u03b2-lactamase group) with the carbapenem meropenem to investigate differences between those inhibited by carbapenems (TEM-1, SHV-1, BlaC, CTX-M-16) and those that hydrolyze them (SFC-1, KPC-2, NMC-A, SME-1). QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations confirm the two enzyme groups to differ in the preferred acyl-enzyme orientation: carbapenem-inhibited enzymes favor hydrogen bonding of the carbapenem hydroxyethyl group to the deacylating water (DW). QM/MM simulations of deacylation give activation free energies in good agreement with experimental hydrolysis rates, correctly distinguishing carbapenemases. For the carbapenem-inhibited enzymes activation free energies for deacylation are significantly higher than for the carbapenemases, even when the hydroxyethyl group was restrained to prevent interaction with the DW. Analysis of these simulations, and additional simulations of mutant enzymes, shows how factors including the hydroxyethyl orientation, the active site volume and architecture (conformations of Asn170 and Asn132; organization of the oxyanion hole; and the Cys69-Cys238 disulfide bond) collectively determine catalytic efficiency towards carbapenems.", "date": "2022-03-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The challenge even extends to the modeling of oxygenated graphite surfaces in computational studies. However, determination of both the types and composition of oxygen functional groups on graphite surfaces is of paramount importance as it plays a significantly important role in dictating the behaviors and performances of electrochemical systems. For example, the surface structure and composition of the graphitic anode used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) determines the quality of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that forms at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which in turns substantially affects the stability and lifetime of the devices. To help predict the structure and the composition of the surface oxygen functional groups on graphite surfaces resulting from solution-based synthesis and modification processes, we analyze the adsorption of different oxygen functional groups at both edge and basal sites of graphite as a function of pH under which the solution-based processes may take place. A series of DFT calculations reveal that at room temperature and for a pH range from 0 to 14, the (112 \u03050) edge surface of graphite will be fully oxygenated, while the basal sites remain unsaturated. The oxygen functional groups at the edge sites are comprised of mostly hydroxyl and ketonic groups, with carboxyl and carbonyl groups are present only in small amounts. Furthermore, we observe transformation of carbonyl group into ketonic group in the presence of empty surface carbon sites, which further stabilize the graphite surface. Meanwhile, carboxyl groups are more stable when all surface sites within a carboxyl layer are all populated. We conclude that the population of oxygen groups that can be found at the edge surface of a graphite in the ascending order are carboxyl < carbonyl < hydroxyl < ketonic. On the contrary to the edge plane, a small amount of oxygen functional groups may be forced to adsorb on the basal surface upon application of an external potential. The adsorbed groups are found to prefer to cluster together on basal sites in a highly ordered fashion, while the edge surface does not show this preference for adsorption sites.", "date": "2022-03-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Current cancer treatments still face several limitations, such as severe side effects and a high incidence of disease recurrence. Drug combination therapies are a promising strategy to achieve higher therapeutic effects while reducing side effects. This new direction in cancer drug research has led to data-driven medicine. To predict whether certain drugs would have a synergistic effect when combined, the DREAM Challenge coordinators released data for thousands of experimentally tested drug combinations. The DREAM Challenge served as inspiration for selecting drug combinations that have the potential to be synergistic. We here describe an approach using biological pathway knowledge and applying this to the selected combinations with a previously described mathematical model, the Loewe-Additivity approach.  The calculated interaction index (II) served to distinguish between synergistic (II < 1), additive (II = 1) and antagonistic (II > 1). Pre-selection of putative drug combinations was performed prior to synergy prediction based on four case scenarios: 1) two drugs share the same target protein, 2) two drugs share the same pathway,  3) drugs are separated by one degree from two targets or 4) drugs are separated by more than one degree from two targets but act upon the same biological pathway.\nResults: The first method tried was using a drug synergy prediction method called the Loewe-Additivity model, in which two drugs share the same target and form the initial findings for this paper.  The Loewe model acts as a baseline estimation to see if more combinations can be identified using the other methods tested.  The remaining methods used were able to find additional drug combinations that were not proposed by the standard Loewe model.  Although the additional methods did find additional combinations that would be predicted to be synergistic, a prediction is not a guarantee of success, so validation of the new or novel combinations would be needed to verify their effectiveness. This could be done by comparing our results to known data or against biological assays.

Modified nanocrystals of the prototypical zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were generated in triethylamine (Et3N) via an in-situ supramolecular modulation method. We demonstrate that using triethylamine as a modulator results in a conspicuous decrease in elastic modulus (0.7 \u00b1 0.2 GPa) compared to the unmodified nanocrystals of ZIF-8 (2.1 \u00b1 0.8 GPa). Argon gas adsorption analysis also reveals that the more flexible, amine-modified framework exhibited gradual and cooperative gate-opening structural transitions (P/P0 = 0.33 \u00b1 0.02) compared to the steep and stepwise characteristics of unmodified samples of ZIF-8 (P/P0 = 0.45 \u00b1 0.02).

However, at present, controlling and combining the electronic properties of multiple circuits within a single-molecule junction remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we describe the molecular conductance distributions for five single terminal circuits each within three constitutional isomers of a bis-terpyridine-based molecular breadboard junction through a rigorous computational framework which accounts for molecular conformational flexibility and the relative electrode accessibility (REA) of anchoring groups. The isomers, termed TPo, TPm, and TPp, differ in the relative placement of the linking nitrogen (N) atoms at ortho, meta, and para positions, respectively, of the peripheral pyridyl rings. We demonstrate that quantum interference effects (QIE) and REA of the anchoring N atoms can be exploited to alter the relative conductance of the five single terminal circuits within the molecular breadboards by ~ 4\u201332 times. We introduce a phase-plot-analysis to highlight the interdependence of QIE- and REA-induced changes in the conductance states of the basis circuits across breadboard pairs. Our studies predict that REA should not impact the QIE-induced boost in circuit conductance for TPp relative to that in TPm. In contrast, REA suppresses the QIE boost for circuit conductance in TPo relative to that in TPm.

Surface strain can increase or decrease the adsorption energy depending on the surface composition, adsorbate composition, surface facet, and adsorbate site, breaking traditional scaling relationships which inhibit energy barrier alteration in reactions such as ammonia synthesis. We aim to generate a model that maps the adsorption energy response to a given input strain for a range of adsorbates and catalyst structures. After generating a training dataset of strained copper binary alloy catalyst + adsorbate complexes from the Open Catalyst Project and calculating the adsorption energy with first-principles calculations (dataset made\navailable), we train a graph neural network to learn the relationship between catalyst + adsorbate structure, surface strain, and adsorption energy. The model successfully predicts the nature of the adsorption energy response for 85% of surface strains, outperforming simpler model baselines. Using the ammonia synthesis reaction as an example system, we identify Cu-S alloy catalysts as promising candidates for strain engineering since the majority of surface strain patterns raise the adsorption energy of the *NH intermediate. We find that the strain response of similar adsorbates on the same surface can greatly vary due to the competition between surface\nrelaxation under strain and relaxation of the coordination environment.

Theoretical characterization of SEI properties will help understand the origin of interfacial stability (and instability) between solid electrolytes and electrodes. Among solid electrolytes for Lithium(Li)-ion ASSBs, the lithium phosphorus oxynitride LixPOyNz (LiPON) is one of the most stable against Li metal anode. However, it has been shown that LiPON reacts with Li metal and forms SEIs. The SEI formation stops after a thin layer is formed, but the mechanism that enables this apparent stabilization is unclear. Thermodynamics underpins the defect formation in materials and in turn, creation of electronic charge. Materials for energy storage, including solid electrolytes, are no exception to this fundamental process.\nHere, we computationally evaluate the electronic passivation of SEIs and its role in stabilizing the Li-LiPON interface. Specifically, we determine the defect and charge carrier concentrations in Li-LiPON SEIs, including Li2O, Li3N, Li3P, and Li3PO4. The defect and charge carrier concentrations were calculated from defect thermodynamics. We then predicted the electronic conductivity of the SEIs under different electrochemical conditions, which correspond to varying  potentials to the Li metal anode. Our results reveal that the stoichiometrically abundant and uniformly distributed Li2O has expectedly negligible electronic conductivity, while the electronically conducting components, such as Li3N and Li3P, show preferential distribution in the SEI.

We identified this phenomenon in a set of well-established and new Mn pincer catalysts that suffer from persistent product inhibition in ester hydrogenation. Although alkoxide base additives do not directly participate in inhibitory transformations, they can affect the equilibrium constants of these processes. Experimentally we confirm that by varying base promotor concentration one can control catalyst speciation and inflict substantial changes to the standard free energies of the key steps in the catalytic cycle. Despite the fact that the latter are universally assumed to be constant, we demonstrate that reaction thermodynamics and catalyst state are subject to external control. These results suggest that reaction promotors can be viewed as an integral component of reaction medium, on its own capable of improving catalytic performance and reshaping the seemingly rigid thermodynamic landscape of the catalytic transformation.", "date": "2022-03-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Homogeneous Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions; Spectroscopy (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With broader scope for assays and trials against a diverse array of viral infections, we review elucidations of the pharmacokinetic mechanisms of polyphenolic compounds over the past two decades and survey their putative frequent-hitter behavior.  Many polyphenols are indeed promiscuous binders, suggesting a candidate mechanism of non-specific inhibition combined with inflammation-targeting specificity.  Since such a specificity mechanism combined with promiscuity poses a possible pathway of inhibiting viral replication uniquely in infected tissue, we highlight pre-clinical studies of polyphenol aglycones that reduce virion replication.  It is hoped that greater awareness of the potential specificity of polyphenolic activation to sites of pathogenic infection will spur renewed research and clinical attention on assaying and trialing against several infectious viral diseases. \n", "date": "2022-03-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Results suggested that the two different taxa of T. atristriga respond differently to the female sex pheromone compounds. The first taxon responds equally to the two-component and other blends including the six-component blend.

During biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin, produced by Streptomyces coelicolor, one such key binding event is between an ACP carrying a 16-carbon octaketide chain (actACP) and a ketoreductase (actKR). Once the octaketide is bound inside actKR, it is likely cyclized between C7 and C12 and regioselective reduction of the ketone at C9 occurs: how these elegant chemical and conformational changes are controlled is not yet known. Here, we perform protein-protein docking, protein NMR, and extensive\nmolecular dynamics simulations to reveal a probable mode of association between actACP and actKR; we obtain and\nanalyze a detailed model of the C7-C12-cyclized octaketide within the actKR active site; and confirm this model through multiscale (QM/MM) reaction simulations of the key ketoreduction step. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the most thermodynamically stable cyclized octaketide isomer (7R,12R) also gives rise to the most reaction competent conformations for ketoreduction.

The findings further reveal a qualitative similarity of the impact of tether length on widely different type of binding interactions, viz. gold nanoparticle binding to tethered amine layers, and neutravidin binding to tethered biotin layers. By independent determination of tether densities, our investigations decouple the impact of receptor densities, and the tether conformations, and confirm the role of tether length on adsorption densities and kinetics.  The results agree with theoretical reports in literature that predict enhanced analyte capture by receptors anchored to surface via long, flexible tethers, owing to enhanced freedom of movement and thereby its ability to \u201cseek\u201d the analyte in solution. These findings highlight the significance of factoring in the structure of the molecular tether to enhance analyte capture by tethered receptors, and thereby the performance of affinity biosensors.

With the unlimited ability to synthesise any DNA and RNA and transfer it to almost any organism, we are at the dawn of a new era in which biology is being recreated in ways never before possible.  It has reached a maturity level that enables construction of artificial  communities of synthetic organisms. Considering the strong engineering component in synthetic biology design, we highlight the role of computational models in reaching the full potential of this emerging field. Computational models have been shown to be an essential part of biology entangling the nonlinearly increasing complexity with the growing number of components, and emerging properties of biological phenomena. In recent years, great hope has been put in modelling efforts to guide synthetic biology approaches in much the same way as they guided engineers to design new technical devices. Yet, till now, modelling has not been fully integrated into the synthetic design process. Here we summarise the state of the art and discuss how synthetic biology design can be supported with an organism-free modular modelling approach focussing on designing synthetic multi-species communities. We argue that efforts should shift from organism- and context-specific complex systems or even whole-cell models to modular computational models with mathematical descriptions of parts and circuits, from which synthetic systems could be systematically assembled. Such an approach would be more compatible with synthetic biology approaches, opening the door to designing artificial communities.

Levulinic acid, an organic compound formed during the hydrothermal processing of lignocellulosic biomass, has been shown to efficiently dissolve lignin.

Here we present an unexplored strategy for biocatalysis: the application of SHC spheroplasts. By removing the outer cell membrane, we produced stable and substrate-accessible biocatalysts.

Upon reduction of this diiron site the ligand arrangement of a third CO ligand is heavily debated. Two main geometries that differ by the origin of a bridging ligand in between the iron ions and the occupation of a free binding site are discussed.

Notable examples are enzymes, which selectively bind reactants and exquisitely regulate their conversion into products. In the attempt to mimic natural catalytic systems, supramolecular metal-organic cages capable of encapsulating guests in their cavity and of controlling/accelerating chemical reactions under confinement are attracting increasing interest. However, the complex nature of these systems, where reactants/products continuously exchange in-and-out the host, makes it often difficult to elucidate the factors controlling the reactivity in dynamic regimes. As a case study, here we focus on a coordination cage that can encapsulate amide guests and enhance their hydrolysis by favoring their mechanical twisting towards reactive\nmolecular configurations under confinement. We designed an advanced multiscale simulation approach that allows us to reconstruct the reactivity in such host-guest systems in dynamic regimes. In this way, we can characterize the amide encapsulation/expulsion in/out the cage cavity (thermodynamics and kinetics), coupling such host-guest dynamic equilibrium with the characteristic hydrolysis reaction constants. All computed kinetic/thermodynamic data are then combined, obtaining a statistical estimation of reaction acceleration in the host-guest system that is found in optimal agreement with the available experimental trends. This shows how, to understand the key factors controlling accelerations/variations in the reaction under confinement, it is necessary to take into account all dynamic processes that occur as intimately entangled\nin such host-guest systems.

Functional specificity depends strongly on the complexity of structures that polysaccharides can adopt based on their subunit composition, length, extent of branching, glycosidic bond connectivity and anomeric configuration. However, a rapid and comprehensive characterization of glycan isomers can be challenging owing to limitations associated with their separation. Here, ten composition, anomeric and connectivity disaccharide isomers were separated and detected using high-resolution differential ion mobility-mass spectrometry (DMS-MS, also known as FAIMS). Focus was primarily directed to compositional isomers corresponding to epimers that differ by the axial or equatorial position of a single hydroxyl group. DMS resolving power was enhanced 14-fold primarily by increasing the fraction of helium in the ion carrier gas and lowering the flow rate. At relatively high disaccharide concentrations, DMS-MS of each disaccharide resulted in complex and unique multi-peak spectra with up to ten fully and partially resolved peaks for \u03b2-1,4-mannobiose (Man-1,4\u03b2-Man), which can be attributed to the DMS separation and subsequent dissociation of ionic non-covalently bound oligomers into monomer ions. Each DMS spectrum has at least one differentiating peak that is not in the other spectra, indicating that DMS can be used to fully or partially resolve composition, configuration and connectivity isomers. At relatively low disaccharide concentrations, disaccharide epimers can also be readily separated by DMS.

In particular, we use the standard linear viscoelastic model where the two constituents, rubber represented by Hookean spring and wax represented by Maxwellian liquid, are connected in parallel; hence, we assume that the contribution of each component in the total stress is distributed in proportion of the composition. Via simulation, we establish that wax and rubber, individually do not exhibit shape memory behavior but do so upon blending; the shape memory behavior is qualitatively validated from experiments. We also confirm that the shape memory properties of our rubber-wax blends, namely, the shape fixity and shape recovery ratios at different concentrations, is in qualitative agreement with the properties of SMPs. Our findings indicate that polymer blending can be seen as an alternative strategy to design SMPs; the properties of these polymers can be varied directly by changing the composition of the blend.", "date": "2022-03-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Polymer blends", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We have performed several molecular dynamics simulations of molecules in water and lipid bilayers to obtain multidimensional time-series data of features. Deep learning architectures based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, attention mechanisms, and dense layers are built to estimate free energy from the time series data. The prediction errors for the test set and an external validation set are much lower than that of existing data-driven approaches, with R2 of the best model around 0.99 and 0.82 for the two cases. Our approach reduces the time required for free energy calculations by an order of magnitude.

Development of such technologies requires photoelectrode materials that are both photocatalytically active and operationally stable in harsh oxidative and/or reductive electrochemical environments. Such photocatalysts can be discovered based on co-design principles, wherein design for stability is based on the propensity for the photocatalyst to self-passivate under operating conditions and design for photoactivity is based on the ability to integrate the photocatalyst with established semiconductor substrates. Here we report on synthesis and characterization of zinc titanium nitride (ZnTiN2) that follows these design rules by having a wurtzite-derived crystal structure and showing self-passivating surface oxides created by electrochemical polarization. The sputtered ZnTiN2 thin films have optical absorption onsets below 2 eV and n-type electrical conduction of 0.1 S/cm. The band gap of this material is reduced from the 3.5 eV theoretical value by cation site disorder, and the impact of cation antisites on the band structure of ZnTiN2 is explored using density functional theory. Under electrochemical polarization, the ZnTiN2 surfaces have TiO2- or ZnO-like character, consistent with Materials Project Pourbaix calculations predicting the formation of stable solid phases under near-neutral pH.

Herein, we present an integrated computational and experimental strategy to determine both primary and secondary bonding interactions within the XANES pre-edge region for organovanadium complexes, which was developed using a series of well-defined molecular vanadium complexes and then applied to the characterization of a supported organovanadium olefin hydrogenation catalyst. Time-dependent density functional theory is used to predict the energy of pre-edge XANES features for a series of vanadium complexes with a variety of oxidation states and local coordination environments. A calibration scheme incorporating different density functionals and basis sets is established, resulting in an optimized scheme that accurately predicts pre-edge energies with a mean absolute error of 0.40 eV. Second-shell coordination (e.g., V---V) effects within XANES are identified through the analysis of the computed dominant orbital contributions for multi-vanadium complexes. Orbital analysis also provided confirmation that the vanadium-hydride formation combined with the heterogeneity of the catalytic active species in olefin hydrogenation caused the energy shift and broadening of the pre-edge peak after hydrogen treatment of the silica-supported organovanadium pre-catalyst.

In the latest benchmark\nCASF-2016 for comparative assessment of scoring functions, AutoDock Vina won the best docking power among all the docking tools. Modern drug discovery is facing the most common scenario on large virtual screening of drug hits from huge compound databases. Due to the seriality characteristic of the AutoDock Vina algorithm, there is no successful report on its parallel acceleration with GPUs. Current acceleration of AutoDock Vina typically relies on the stack of computing power as well as the allocation of resource and tasks, such as the VirtualFlow platform. The vast resource expenditure and the high access threshold of users will seriously limit the popularity of AutoDock Vina and the flexibility of usage in modern drug discovery.

However, for longer periods, such as a full working day (7.5 hours), and for more infectious strains of SARS-CoV-2, the 2 or 4 square meter rule did not adequately address infection risk. Use of two additional controls, mask wearing and ensuring that all occupants had received a third boosted vaccine dose, was estimated to reduce the probability of infection by 3.75-fold assuming infection with the Omicron variant. Including both controls increased the predicted maximum occupancy to values greater than the 2 and 4 square meter rule for most scenarios. Air movement outside the meeting room was investigated by filling the room with tracer gas and allowing the air to move freely by keeping the door open. Airflow was most influenced by the ventilation system of the laboratories in the north wing of building, rather than laboratories in the south wing. The plug of tracer gas was largely removed from the building within 30 minutes, although detectable concentrations were measured in some areas with lower air flow at the end of the 2-hour experiment. High concentrations were also noted in front of the elevators, however tracer gas concentrations were below detection on other floors. The techniques employed in this study are suitable for measuring air movement and ventilation in other buildings where aerosol transmission of COVID-19 is of concern.", "date": "2022-03-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Environmental Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Established schemes for the construction of surrogate models depend on a logarithmic scaling of the source terms, which limits their application to cases where species are exclusively consumed or produced under all conditions of interest. We propose a new approach based on interpolating the forward- and reverse rates of the rate-determining reactions and thus overcoming this limitation.\nThe new scheme is demonstrated using a surface reaction mechanism describing the oxidation of CO and H2 as well as the water gas shift reaction including 5 gas species, 9 surface species and 18 reversible reactions. Multivariate spline interpolation is used for a first evaluation of our approach. With the splines, the new method reproduces the source terms of CO with an error of 0.5 % which is 50 to 100 times more accurate than the established approaches of either mapping the source terms directly (49.9 % error) or mapping adsorption/desorption rates (23.7 % error). \nThe true potential of the new approach develops in combination with machine learning techniques like neural networks. Even very small neural networks with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes yield an error of 0.35 %. This is about 200 times more accurate than the same neural networks used with the established approaches. Increasing the network size to still moderate 30 nodes in two hidden layers (2342 parameters in total) reduces the error to 0.0058 %. \nBesides the increased accuracy, the neural networks also outperform spline interpolation by at least an order of magnitude with respect to interpolation time, storage space and required amount of training data.\nDue to the extremely low errors achieved with moderate size neural networks and small training data sets, the proposed method based on mapping the rate-determining steps shows promise to scale to much larger and more complex reaction systems in catalysis and other fields like combustion, atmospheric chemistry or systems biology.", "date": "2022-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The introduction of fluorine into peptides, in fact, offers unique opportunities to tune their biophysical properties and intermolecular interactions. In particular, the degree of fluorination plays a crucial role in peptide engineering as it can be used to control the intensity of fluorine-specific interactions. Here, we designed and explored a series of amphipathic self-assembling peptides by incorporating the fluorinated amino acids (2S)-4-monofluoroethylglycine (MfeGly), (2S)-4,4-difluoroethylglycine (DfeGly) and (2S)-4,4,4-trifluoroethylglycine (TfeGly) as main components. This approach enabled studying the impact of fluorination on secondary structure formation and peptide self-assembly on a structural basis. We show that the interplay between polarity and hydrophobicity, both induced by varying degrees of side chain fluorination, affects peptide folding and leads to the generation of peptide hydrogels composed of fluorinated aliphatic amino acids. Molecular simulations revealed the formation of electrostatically driven intra-chain and inter-chain contact pairs caused by side chain fluorination.

Despite decades of investigation, this effect remains poorly understood at a molecular level. A common, phenomenological approach is to individuate the molecular factors that influence the Soret coefficient, the parameter that quantifies the resulting concentration-gradient. Experimental studies, often performed on organic mixtures, as well as simulations of model particle systems have evidenced that the difference in masses between the mixture components has an important effect on the amplitude of the Soret coefficient. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of a thermophoretic setting to investigate the mass dependence of the Soret coefficient in dilute aqueous solutions. An advantage of simulation approaches is that they are not limited in the range of explored molecular masses, which is often limited to isotopic substitutions in the experiments. Our simulations reveal that the mass dependence of the Soret coefficient in these solutions is in agreement with previous experimental and simulation work on molecular-size systems. In particular, it is sensitive to the relative mass difference between the solute and the solvent, but not to their absolute mass. Adjusting the mass of the solvent and of the solute can turn a thermophobic solution into a thermophilic one, where solute accumulation is reversed. This demonstrates that the mass effect can indeed compensate for the other contributions to the Soret coefficient. Finally, we find that changing the molecular moments of inertia has a much more limited impact as compared to a change in the total molecular mass.", "date": "2022-03-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We examine their electronic structures and put them in relation to 3D-aromatic molecules (e.g., closo-boranes) and to 2D-aromatic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Using qualitative theory combined with quantum chemical calculations, we find that the macrocycles explored thus far should be described as 2D-aromatic with three-dimensional molecular structures (abbr. 2D-aromatic-in-3D) and not as truly 3D-aromatic. 3D-aromatic molecules have highly symmetric structures (or nearly so), leading to (at least) triply degenerate molecular orbitals, and for molecules with tetrahedral or octahedral structures an aromatic closed-shell electronic structure results with 6n + 2 electrons. On the other hand, 2D-aromatic-in-3D structures exhibit aromaticity that results from the fulfillment of H\u00fcckel\u2019s 4n + 2 rule for each individual macrocyclic path, yet, their pi-electron counts are coincidentally 6n + 2 numbers for macrocycles with three tethers of equal lengths. The 3D-macrocyclic molecules, suggested to be 3D-aromatic, are instead similar to naphthalene. It is notable that 2D-aromatic-in-3D macrocyclic cages can be aromatic with tethers of different lengths, i.e., when their pi-electron counts differ from 6n + 2. Finally, we identify tetrahedral and cubic pi-conjugated molecules that fulfill the 6n + 2 rule and exhibit significant electron delocalization. Yet, their properties resemble those of analogous compounds with electron counts that differ from 6n + 2.

Stoichiometric metallic reductants such as alkali metals and SmI2 are commonly employed for these reactions, however considerations including expense, ease of use, safety, and waste generation limit the practicality of these methods. Recent approaches utilizing energy from multiple photons or electron-primed photoredox catalysis have accessed reduction potentials equivalent to Li0 and shown how this enables selective transformations of aryl chlorides via aryl radicals. However, in some cases low stability of catalytic intermediates can limit turnover numbers. Herein we report the ability of CdS nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) to function as strong photoreductants and present evidence that a highly reducing electron is generated from two consecutive photoexcitations of CdS QDs with intermediate reductive quenching. Mechanistic experiments suggest that Auger recombination, a photophysical phenomenon known to occur in photoexcited anionic QDs, generates transient thermally excited electrons to enable the observed reductions. Using blue LEDs and sacrificial amine reductants, aryl chlorides and phosphate esters with reduction potentials up to -3.4 V vs. SCE are photo-reductively cleaved to afford hydrodefunctionalized or functionalized products. In contrast to small molecule catalysts, the QDs are stable under these conditions and turnover numbers up to 47500 have been achieved.

In this work, we are able to prepare oligomeric aggregates of A\u03b2 with uniform size and high structural homogeneity. Our experimental design is to incubate A\u03b2 peptides in reverse micelles (RMs) so that the peptides could aggregate only through a single nucleation process and the size of the oligomers is confined by the physical dimension of the reverse micelles. The hence obtained A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) are 23 nm in diameter and they belong to the category of high molecular-weight (MW) oligomers. The solid-state NMR data revealed that A\u03b240Os adopt the structural motif of \u03b2-loop-\u03b2 but the chemical shifts manifested that they are structurally different from low-MW A\u03b2Os and mature fibrils. From the thioflavin-T results, we found that high-MW A\u03b242Os can seed the fibrillization of A\u03b240 monomers. Our protocol allows performing cross-seeding experiments among oligomeric species. By comparing the chemical shifts of A\u03b240Os cross seeded by A\u03b242Os and those of A\u03b240Os prepared in the absence of A\u03b242Os, we observed that the structures of E11, K16, and E22 were altered, whereas the backbone conformation of the \u03b2-sheet region near the C-terminus is structurally invariant.

Structure-based virtual screening is a promising approach to discovering such small-molecule PD1/PDL1 inhibitors. Here we investigate which type of generic scoring functions is most suitable to tackle this problem. We consider CNN-Score, an ensemble of convolutional neural networks, as the representative of machine-learning scoring functions. We also evaluate Smina, a commonly used classical scoring function, and IFP, a top structural fingerprint similarity scoring function. These three types of scoring functions were evaluated on two test sets sharing the same set of small-molecule PD1/PDL1 inhibitors, but using different types of inactives: either true inactives (molecules with no in vitro PD1/PDL1 inhibition activity) or assumed inactives (property-matched decoy molecules generated from each active). On both test sets, CNN-Score performed much better than Smina, which in turn strongly outperformed IFP. The fact that the latter was the case, despite precluding any possibility of exploiting decoy bias, demonstrates the predictive value of CNN-Score for PDL1. These results suggest that re-scoring Smina-docked molecules with CNN-Score is a promising structure-based virtual screening method to discover new small-molecule inhibitors of this important therapeutic target.", "date": "2022-03-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

A particular challenge faced by amine-based sorbents\u2014the current leading technology for carbon capture\u2014is poor stability towards O2, which is present in high partial pressures in most emission streams of interest as well as in air. Sorbents containing oxygen-based nucleophiles, such as hydroxide (OH\u2212), can reversibly react with CO2 to form (bi)carbonate (HCO3\u2212) species and should display improved oxidative stabil-ities compared to amine-based materials.

However, the development of successful antimicrobial polymers (APs) requires careful control of factors such as amphiphilic balance, molecular weight, dispersity, sequence, and architecture. While most of the earlier developed APs focused on random linear copolymers, the development of APs with advanced architectures proved to be more potent in the mimicry of antimicrobial peptides. We recently developed multivalent bottlebrush APs with improved antibacterial and hemocompatibility profiles, outperforming their linear counterparts. Understanding the rationale behind the outstanding biological activity of these newly developed antimicrobials is vital to further improving their performance. This work investigates the physicochemical properties governing the differences in activity between linear and bottlebrush architectures using diverse spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Linear copolymers are more solvated, thermo-responsive and possess facial amphiphilicity resulting in random aggregations when interacting with liposomes mimicking E. coli-membranes.

The efficiency of the new design strategy was evaluated by comparing the Kekul\u00e9 system with an isomeric non-Kekul\u00e9 diradical of identical size, i.e., a system where the radical centers cannot couple via resonance and the high-spin ground state is unavoidable.

Such a fluorescent molecular probe is ideally suited for elucidation of complex self-assembly processes and to decipher the intracellular dynamics of LDs. Invoking the concept, the main skeleton of 1,4-bis(1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)benzene abbreviated as BPIB, was functionalized with a varying number of octyl chains to obtain BPIB1 and BPIB2.

We deciphered the reversible morphological transformation between supramolecular fibers and spherical nanoaggregates using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The gradual progression in the fluorescence lifetime provides a unique strategy for exploring the dynamics of the self-assembly process. Furthermore, BPIB1 was found to be a specific marker for LDs in multiple cell lines. The fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed the microenvironments near LDs.

Aktan; Marie Van der Gucht; Hanne Hendrix; Greetje Vande Velde; Kitty Baert; Tom Hauffman; Manuela S. Killian; Rob Lavigne; Annabel Braem", "abstract": "Implant-associated infections (IAIs) can cause serious problems due to the difficult-to-treat nature of biofilms formed on the implant surface. The biofilm matrix, consisting of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and extracellular DNA (eDNA), forms a protective environment for the residing bacteria in mature biofilms. Recently, indirect prevention of biofilm growth through the degradation of eDNA using an enzyme, such as deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I, is being considered a promising strategy in the battle against IAIs. In this study, the immobilization of protective DNase I coatings on titanium implant materials was investigated. The effectiveness of alternating current electrophoretic deposition (AC-EPD) as a novel processing route to apply DNase I on titanium using polydopamine (PDA) as an intermediate was examined and compared with the commonly applied diffusion methodology (i.e. classic dipping). The use of AC-EPD significantly increased the amount of deposited protein for the same processing time, yielding homogeneous coatings with a thickness of 12.8 nm and increased average surface roughness, Sa, of ~20 nm. The surface free energy components revealed an increase in \u03b3- from 10.2 to ~20 mJ m-2 upon PDA functionalization and enzyme coating regardless of the coating procedure, indicating monopolar surfaces with increased electron-donor capacity . Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of peptide bonds on all DNase-coated substrates. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry detected a more dense DNase I layer in the case of AC-EPD, which was selectively deposited on the electrode coupled as anode during the high-amplitude half cycle of AC signal. Disulfide signals did not differ from those obtained from a dipped DNase reference sample, confirming that the tertiary enzyme structure was not influenced by the deposition methodology. The enzyme activity, release kinetics, and shelf life of DNase I coatings were monitored in real-time using a quantitative qDNase assay. DNase I coatings produced using AC-EPD are threefold more active compared to coatings prepared by classic dipping. In line with covalent linking of DNase to PDA, both deposition methods enable a stable attachment of a small fraction of the DNase activity to the surface, while loosely adhering superimposing DNase deposits are released from the surface in a high burst. Interestingly, coatings prepared with AC-EPD exhibit a prolonged, gradual release of DNase activity. The AC-EPD DNase coatings significantly reduce biofilm formation of both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa up to 20 h, whereas DNase coatings prepared by short classic dipping only reduce S. epidermidis biofilm formation, and to a lesser extent. Overall, this study indicates that AC-EPD allows to rapidly concentrate DNase I on PDA-functionalized titanium, while maintaining the enzyme activity and anti-infectivity properties. This highlights the potential of AC-EPD as a time-efficient coating strategy (as opposed to the much slower dip-coating methodologies) for bioactive molecules in a wide variety of biomedical applications.", "date": "2022-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Biological Materials; Coating Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Accurately establishing the selectivity of reactions facilitated by molecular catalysts, however, remains a challenging task for computational chemistry. The small free energy differences that lead to large variations in the enantiomeric ratio represent particularly tricky quantities to predict with sufficient accuracy to be helpful for prioritizing experi- ments. Further complicating this problem is the fact that standard approaches typically consider only one or a handful of conformers identified through human intuition as pars pro toto of the conformational space. Obviously, this assumption can potentially lead to dramatic failures should key energetic low-lying structures be missed. Here, we in- troduce a multi-level computational pipeline built upon the graph-based Molassembler library that combines conformer generation and tailored functionalization to facilitate high-throughput mechanistic investigations of chemical reactions. The capabilities of this approach are validated by examining a Rh(III) catalyzed asymmetric C-H activa- tion reaction and assessing the limitations associated with the underlying ligand design model. Specifically, the presence of remarkably flexible chiral Cp ligands, which induce the experimentally observed high level of selectivity, present a rich configurational landscape where multiple unexpected conformations contribute to the reported enan- tiomeric ratios (er). Using Molassembler, we show that considering about 20 transition state conformations per catalysts, which are generated with little human intervention and are not tied to \u201cback of the envelope\u201d models, accurately reproduces experimental er values with limited computational expense.", "date": "2022-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The synthesis methodology is then adapted to a high-throughput protocol using liquid handling robots for the rapid synthesis of DES combinations.

The use of ion exchange chromatography as a solid phase extraction method that can be utilized in a remote analysis is investigated in this work.  The method developed relied on strong exchangers, with the use of pH changes to elute only analytes while keeping salt ions bound.  Method development revealed the need for a pre-elution step in the process to ensure good charge switching of the analytes.  Both anion and cation exchange media were evaluated for the capture of analytes from a high salt solution, as would be expected of liquid samples collected on a remote body.  Cation exchange media provided the best results, with capture of almost all of the various analytes tested for extraction from simulated ocean water, including amino acids, nucleotides, peptides, and an oligonucleotide.  In fact, cation exchange media even captured anionic components such as organic acids, likely through mixed mode hydrophobic based capture.  Even though these analytes were released in the wash step, most of the salt removal was completed before release of these analytes, allowing this method to be used for desalting of these analytes.  On the other hand, anion exchange media did not capture many of the anionic analytes it was expected to capture when the salt concentration was high.  Irradiation exposure, as a model for the solar irradiation expected during deployment of these materials to extraterrestrial locations, did not affect the performance of the ion exchange media tested.

Five HDAC inhibitors have been approved for anticancer therapy and many are in clinical trials. Among the 11 zinc-dependent HDACs, HDAC10 has received relatively little attention by drug discovery campaigns, despite its involvement, e.g., in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. This is due in part to a lack of robust enzymatic conversion assays. In contrast to the protein lysine deacetylase and deacylase activity of most other HDAC subtypes, it has recently been shown that HDAC10 has strong preferences for deacetylation of oligoamine substrates like acetyl-putrescine or -spermidine. Hence, it is also termed as a polyamine deacetylase (PDAC). Here, we present the first fluorescent enzymatic conversion assay for HDAC10 using an aminocoumarin-labelled acetyl-spermidine derivative to measure its PDAC activity, which is suitable for high-throughput screening. Using this assay, we identified potent inhibitors of HDAC10-mediated spermidine deacetylation in vitro. Based on the oligoamine preference of HDAC10, we also designed inhibitors with a basic moiety in appropriate distance to the zinc binding hydroxamate that showed potent inhibition of HDAC10 with high selectivity, and we solved a HDAC10-inhibitor structure using X-ray crystallography.

Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue that targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The solution of multiple RdRp structures has been one of the main axes of research in the race against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Several hypotheses of the mechanism of inhibition of RdRp by remdesivir have been proposed, although open questions remain. This work uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the impact of remdesivir and two analogues as incoming nucleotides, and of up to four incorporations of remdesivir along the primer strand on RdRp. The simulation results suggest that the overall structure and dynamical behavior of RdRp is destabilized by remdesivir and the two analogues in the incoming position. The incorporation of remdesivir along the primer strand im- pacts specific non-bonded interactions between the nascent RNA and the polymerase subunit, as well as overall dynamical networks on RdRp. The strongest impact on the structure and dynamics are observed after three incorporations, when remdesivir is located at position -A3, in agreement with previously reported experimental and computational results. Our results provide atomic-level detail on the role played by remdesivir on the disruption of RNA synthesis by RdRp, and the main drivers of these disruptions.", "date": "2022-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Sorption-desorption interactions with soils and sediments are of significant fundamental and applied interest since they control the transport and fate of chemicals in environmental systems. SDH expressed as a difference between sorption and desorption isotherms determined in solutions may demonstrate time-independent behavior. This work aims to propose a concept that could mechanistically explain and allow predictions of time-independent SDH in three different scenarios: (1) sorbed molecules are entrapped and physically blocked from their exchange with the environment; (2) sorbed molecules are irreversibly bound to sorbent matrix such that the sorption sites capable of irreversible binding are not fully occupied in the presence of non-zero concentrations of solutes; (3) SDH is associated with forming of a non-relaxed sorbent state where the free exchange of sorbate molecules with the environment occurs. The proposed concept introduces the gates present in a sorbent matrix and capable of concentration-dependent cooperative opening/closure, thus acting as a switch: sorbate interactions with sorption sites are allowed at increased solute concentrations but not the opposite. Coupling the gates distribution with the distribution of sorption sites allows addressing each scenario of interest and explaining time-independent SDH. The models developed within the concept can represent and even predict desorption data using a minimal number of adjustable parameters. This predictive potential may be improved by accounting for the assumptions introduced while developing the models.

Hydrates materials containing confined water widely exist in nature or can be easily synthesized.

In this work, we demonstrate that confined water can enhance Li-ion transport while not compromising the stability window of solid electrolytes using Li-H-Ti-O quaternary compounds as an example system. Three Li-H-Ti-O quaternary compounds containing different amounts of confined water were synthesized, and their ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability are compared. The compound contains nano-confined pseudo-water is demonstrated to have an ionic conductivity that is 2~3 order of magnitude higher than the water-free Li4Ti5O12 and similar stability window. A solid-state battery is made with this new compound as the solid electrolyte, and good rate and cycling performance are achieved, which demonstrates the promise of using such confined-water-containing compounds as Li-ion solid electrolytes. The knowledge and insights gained in this work open a new direction for designing solid electrolytes for future solid-state Li-ion batteries.

The properties of these soft materials mimic those of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of biological tissue and therefore they have found many biomedical uses in tissue engineering, wound healing, drug delivery, biosensing and bioprinting applications.

Different responses are obtained depending on the catalyst mass (Ni/Al2O3) and the operation temperature (170\u00b0C-300\u00b0C).

Their biophysical details (e.g. thermodynamics, kinetics, binding modes and binding site orientation) are thus highly valuable, not only for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, but also for guiding the design of multivalent therapeutics against specific MLGIs. However, these details are not readily available due to the limitations of conventional biophysical techniques in probing such complex, flexible interactions. We have recently established densely glycosylated quantum dots (glycan-QDs) as novel structural probes for MLGIs. Using a pair of important, almost identical tetrameric lectins, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, as the model lectins, we have shown that glycan-QDs can not only provide quantitative binding affinities but also dissect their distinct binding modes: DC-SIGN binds simultaneously with one glycan-QD whereas DC-SIGNR inter-cross-links. Herein, we further extend the capacity of the glycan-QD probes to investigate how binding mode affects the binding thermodynamics and kinetics, and probe a structural basis of their binding nature. We show that, while both lectin-glycan-QD interactions are enthalpy driven, with similar binding enthalpy changes (~4 times that of monovalent binding measured by ITC), DC-SIGN binding pays a lesser entropy penalty than DC-SIGNR, giving rise to a stronger affinity. We also reveal that a short C-terminal segment at the flexible junction between the tetramerization domain and glycan binding domain in DC-SIGN, absent in DC-SIGNR, plays a critical role in maintaining DC-SIGN\u2019s glycan-QD binding properties: its removal leads to an entirely different binding enthalpy and entropy profile, despite maintaining the same binding mode. Furthermore, we show that the simultaneous lectin-glycan-QD binding partners give single 2nd-order kon rates which rapidly reach saturation, whereas cross-linking partners give two distinct on-rates: a rapid initial association step, followed by a much slower secondary interaction. Together, our work have established glycan-QDs as a powerful new biophysical platform for solution-based MLGI studies which can provide a wide range of important biophysical parameters.", "date": "2022-03-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Biochemical Analysis; Biophysical Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We report dead times as low as 14\u00b12 ns achieved using less than 1 W of power at X-band (nominally 9.5 GHz) on a molecular ruler and a T4-lysozyme sample.

While iron-based catalysts are in principle suitable for that purpose, the active metal Fe undergoes complex transformation during the chemical reaction process. However, only little is known on the change in catalytically active species under reaction conditions, primarily caused by structural changes in the catalyst material, so far. By using core-shell model-materials, factors that alter the catalyst structure can be excluded, making it possible to observe the direct influence of the reactants on the activity in the present work. Furthermore, stoichiometric analysis is used as a key tool for the evaluation of individual key reactions in the complex reaction network purely from experimental data and thus, makes it possible to draw conclusions about the catalyst state. In the case of CO hydrogenation, the presumed Boudouard reaction and the associated carburization of the catalyst can be quantified and the main reaction (CO methanation) can be determined. The results of CO2 hydrogenation show that here mainly reverse water-gas-shift reaction takes place, but under ongoing change of the catalytic active iron phase. Due to the systematic exchange between CO and CO2 in the reactant gas stream, a mutual influence could also be observed.

Bulk studies using graphene oxide flakes have demonstrated impressive metal adsorption. However, little interfacial information about water and metal organization near graphene oxide is available. A mechanistic understanding of water and ions interactions with graphene oxide films is critical toward advanced separations, including improved sorption efficiency and membrane regeneration. We study metal ion and local water organization near graphene oxide thin films formed at the air/water interface. These films are not typical membranes and allow us to determine nanoscale information about the graphene oxide-water interface. We accomplish this with x-ray reflectivity (XR), x-ray fluorescence near total reflection (XFNTR), and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG). These interface-specific techniques provide the electron density profile normal to the interface, number of adsorbed ions, and information about the orientational ordering and hydrogen-bonding network of interfacial water, respectively. Via XFNTR and SFG, we find that trivalent yttrium ions preferentially adsorb to graphene oxide and affect its structure, compared to divalent strontium and monovalent cesium ions. Two different interfacial water populations can be described, based on their hydrogen bonding strength, and the adsorbed ions affect these populations differently. These results provide fundamental information about ion and water organization at the interface and help address the large computational-experimental agreement gap for graphene oxide systems.

Based on results obtained from atomic detail molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we derive a lattice model, discriminating between HB and nonspecific intermolecular interactions. We demonstrate that due to the ordered structure of the PILs, mostly the HB interactions contribute to the mixing energy.

In particular, we modelled the thermal behaviour of an arbitrary FK phase of 4-aminopyridinium chloride prior the melting and after cooling the molten phase, exploring the mechanisms of dehydration of these phases and nucleation from the melt. The results, also confirmed by experiments, suggest that the dehydration of these phases can occur without dramatic changes in the crystal packing.

Most importantly, molecular dynamics simulated by cooling the melt of this anhydrous phase, showed the formation of mainly two types of aggregates identical to those observed in the experimental crystal structures. These results confirm that other unknown FK structures might be obtained for our system, either from the melt or by dehydration of the known phases. Moreover, they provide further evidence that their crystallisation follows a non-classical path with a probable formation of two types of highly symmetric clusters that assemble into the solid-state only when the relative ratio of these reaches a threshold. \n", "date": "2022-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the capabilities of such advanced GNNs have been extensively demonstrated on benchmark datasets, there have been few applications in real atomistic simulations. Here, we therefore put the robustness of GNN interatomic potentials to the test, using the recently proposed GemNet architecture as a testbed. Models are trained on the QM7-x database of organic molecules and used to perform extensive MD simulations. We find that low test set errors are not sufficient for obtaining stable dynamics and that severe pathologies sometimes only become apparent after hundreds of ps of dynamics.

Here, we describe a method for incorporating bioactive fibronectin domain proteins with DNA nanostructures using two orthogonal coiled-coil peptides. One peptide from each coiled-coil pair is attached to a DNA origami cuboid in a multivalent fashion by attaching the peptides to DNA handles. These structures can then be assembled into one-dimensional arrays through the addition of a fibronectin domain linker genetically fused with the complementary peptides to those on the origami. We validate array formation using two different self-assembly protocols and characterize the fibers by atomic force and electron microscopy. Finally, we demonstrate that surfaces coated with the protein-DNA nanofibers can serve as biomaterial substrates for fibroblast adhesion and spreading, with the nanofibers enhancing bioactivity compared with the monomeric protein.", "date": "2022-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Perdew; Francesco Paesani", "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method, due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness. The accuracy of a DFT calculation de- pends not only on the choice of the density functional approximation (DFA) adopted but also on the electron density produced by the DFA. SCAN is a modern functional that satisfies all known constraints for meta-GGA functionals. The density-driven errors, defined as energy errors arising from errors of the self-consistent DFA electron density, can hinder SCAN from achieving chemical accuracy in some systems, including water. Density-corrected DFT (DC-DFT) can alleviate this shortcoming by adopting a more accurate electron density which, in most applications, is the electron density obtained at the Hartree-Fock level of theory due to its relatively low computational cost. In this work, we present extensive calculations aimed at determining the accuracy of the DC-SCAN functional for various aqueous systems. DC-SCAN (SCAN@HF) shows remarkable consistency in reproducing reference data obtained at the coupled cluster level of theory, with minimal loss of accuracy. Density-driven errors in the description of ionic aqueous clusters are thoroughly investigated. By comparison with the orbital-optimized CCSD density in the water dimer, we find that the self-consistent SCAN density transfers a spurious fraction of an electron across the hydrogen bond to the hydrogen atom (H\u22c6, covalently bound to the donor oxygen atom) from the acceptor (OA) and donor (OD) oxygen atoms, while HF makes a much smaller spurious transfer in the opposite direction, consistent with DC-SCAN (SCAN@HF) reduction of SCAN over-binding due to delocalization error. While LDA seems to be the conventional extreme of density delocalization error, and HF the conventional extreme of (usually much smaller) density localization error, these two densities do not quite yield the conventional range of density-driven error in energy differences. Finally, comparisons of the DC-SCAN results with those obtained with the Fermi-Lowdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLOSIC) method show that DC-SCAN represents a more accurate approach to reducing density-driven errors in SCAN calculations of ionic aqueous clusters.", "date": "2022-04-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Properties; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

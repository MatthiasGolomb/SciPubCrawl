While the properties of individual H-bonds have been extensively studied, the topological characteristics of the resulting H-bond network remain less explored. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to examine various aqueous interfaces, uncovering an increased number of H-bonds parallel to surfaces compared to bulk water. To quantify the topology of these networks, we introduce novel estimators for network percolation and dimensionality. Our findings reveal that the elevated proportion of H-bonds parallel to the interface significantly influences network connectivity, reducing both the number of water layers and the distance from the surface at which the network achieves full connectivity. Consequently, H-bond networks at interfaces exhibit more \"two-dimensional\" characteristics than those in bulk water due to high local water density and the competition between water-water H-bonds and water-surface interactions.", "date": "2024-06-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In general, POMs are redox active, stable in solution, and functional at the nanoscale. Computational chemistry calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to reproduce redox potentials have often been reported without accounting for the electrolyte environment and counterions. These calculations typically use implicit solvation models and compare theoretical results with previously published experimental data, which may not be synchronous. Herein, we employed DFT calculations to assess the accuracy of various exchange-correlation (x-c) functionals in reproducing experimental redox potentials for X5[M(H2O)PW11O39] salts; where X= Li, Na or K, and M = Mn(III/II), Fe(III/II) or Co(III/II). Our aim was to ensure that the experimental conditions and theoretical results are closely fit enabling a higher accuracy when reproducing experimental redox processes. Optimal accuracy was accomplished with PBE/TZP demonstrated by the lowest score for mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.55 V across all compounds in our work. Further analysis of MAE revealed increasing contributions to HF-exchange coincided with larger discrepancies from experimental potentials, U0Exp. The challenge in attaining accurate potentials is effectively controlling the proximity of the ion-pairing. To address this, we have explicitly specified the heteroatom-counterion, dP-X, geometries at discrete intervals (6-10 \u00c5).

A simple protocol was developed for small plasma volumes (100-200 \u00b5L) by using isohexane (H) to extract supernatants of acetonitrile-plasma (A-P). The HA-P method was quantitative for a wide range of hydrophobic multiclass target analytes (i.e. log Kow >3.0), and the extracts were free of major lipids, thereby enabling robust large-volume injections (LVI; 25 \u00b5L) in long sequences to a GC-Orbitrap HRMS. Without lipid removal, LVI was counter-productive because method sensitivity suffered from the abundant matrix signal, resulting in low ion injection times to the Orbitrap. The median method quantification limit was 0.08 ng/mL (range 0.005\u20134.83 ng/mL), and good accuracy was shown for a certified reference serum.

Simultaneous nontarget analysis resulted in 112 structural annotations (12.8% annotation rate), and Level 1 identification was achieved for 7 of 8 substances in follow-up confirmations.

In this study, we search across pathways for common nonenzymatic conditions for a recurring chemical transformation in metabolism: alkene hydration. The mild conditions that we identify (Fe oxides such as green rust) apply to all hydration reactions of the rTCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, including the hydration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2PGA), which had not previously been reported under nonenzymatic conditions.

Applied to the larger and structurally diverse NAH159 set in a black-box fashion, the method maintains a small error (1.2 kcal/mol) and accurately predicts gap signs in 83% of cases, confirming its robustness and suitability for screening workflows.", "date": "2024-06-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Consequently, delineating the protein targets, including the specific binding sites, for chemical probes and clinical candidates is essential to ensure potent on-target activity and to minimize engagement of unfavorable off-targets. The pairing of mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomics with photoaffinity labeling (PAL) has emerged as a favored approach to generate proteome-wide target engagement maps for reversible compounds. However, a key limitation of most PAL-based proteomic platforms is the absence of strategies that report precise binding sites and enable direct head-to-head comparisons of relative target engagement at these sites by different lead compounds. This gap stems from a confluence of factors including the complex fragmentation patterns for crosslinked peptides, poor recovery of peptides crosslinked with large hydrophobic molecules, and modification masses that differ between molecules of interest (MOI). To address these challenges, here we establish the Silyl Ether Enables Chemoproteomic Interaction and Target Engagement (SEE-CITE)  approach.

Hybrid electrolytes, in which supporting salt ions and substrates are dissolved in a binary mixture of organic solvent and water, represent a new piece to this complex puzzle, as they offer a unique opportunity to harvest water as the oxygen or proton source in electrosynthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that modulating water-organic solvent interactions drastically impacts the solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes. Combining various spectroscopies with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the size and composition of aqueous domains forming in hybrid electrolytes can be controlled. We demonstrate that water is more reactive for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous domains than when strongly interacting with solvent molecules, which originates from a change in reaction kinetics rather than from a thermodynamic effect. We examplify novel opportunities arising from this new knowledge for optimizing electrosynthetic reactions in hybrid electrolytes. For reactions proceeding first via the activation of water, fine tuning of aqueous domains impact the kinetics and potentially the selectivity of the reaction. Instead, for organic substrates reacting prior to water, aqueous domains have no impact on reaction kinetics, while selectivity may be affected.

Here, we designed a new class of organic spacer employing a malononitrile (MN) functionality giving a calculated dipole moment of 7.9 D. Malononitrile phenethyl ammonium (MNPEA) was successfully incorporated into lead iodide-based LHPs thin films and as single crystals. Comparing the MNPEA-based LHP to phenethyl ammonium (PEA) and biphenethyl ammonium (BPEA), selected as reference cations to elucidate the influence of increased dipole moment while excluding the contribution of increased interlayer distance, clarified the effect of the large organic dipole.

Ratio-based imaging with fura-2 was the most accurate and reliable method for measuring Ca2+ concentrations. Two drawbacks to fura-2 exist. First, it requires ultraviolet (UV) excitation, which is more toxic to living cells than visible light. Second, our ability to use fura-2 for accurate, stable, ratio-based determinations of Ca2+ concentration in living cells is fast becoming a method of the past.

Herein, we investigate the prototypical halide receptor meso Octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole (OMCP) complexed with either chloride or bromide anions in both dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform (trichloromethane, TCM) solvent using ultrafast infrared transient absorption and 2D IR spectroscopies. OMCP\u2219Br\u2012 complexes in both solvents display slower vibrational relaxation dynamics of the OMCP pyrrole NH stretches, consistent with weaker H bonding interactions with OMCP compared to chloride and less efficient intermolecular relaxation to the solvent. Further, OMCP\u2219Br\u2012 complexes show nearly static spectral diffusion dynamics compared to OMCP\u2219Cl\u2012, indicating larger structural fluctuations occur within chloride complexes. Importantly, distinct differences in the vibrational spectra and dynamics are observed between DCM and TCM solutions. The data are consistent with stronger and more perturbative solvent effects in TCM compared to DCM, despite DCM\u2019s larger dielectric constant and smaller reported OMCB\u2219X\u2012 binding affinities. These differences are attributed to the presence of weak H bond interactions between halides and TCM, in addition to competing interactions from the bulky tetrabutylammonium countercation. The data provide important experimental benchmarks for quantifying the role of solvent and countercation interactions in anion host-guest complexes.

Sanjeeva Murthy", "abstract": "Viscoelastic properties of polymer nanoshell coatings fabricated by electrospray deposition (ESD), on gold-coated quartz crystals and spin-coated polystyrene (PS) surfaces, were evaluated using Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D). For PS particles on gold, as ESD flow rate increases from 0.5 to 1.5 mL/h, film thickness increases from ~200 to 400 nm, while dissipation increases by an order of magnitude. This is attributed to larger particle sizes resulting from shorter droplet flight times during ESD. Absence of this effect on spin-coated PS films suggest complex interfacial interactions between ESD PS shells and spin-coated PS films. Shear moduli for ESD coatings on gold are found to be virtually independent of flowrate (i.e. particle size) and are consistent with literature on expanded polystyrene foams. While the QCM-D modulus of the spray coated film is only 0.08-0.20% of the bulk PS modulus, the stiffness ratio of spray coated PS to a single shell is 5.00 - 13.3 x 103 m-1, due the more rigid response arising from shell-shell and shell-substrate interactions. These results underscore QCM-D, with nanograms of material, has the potential to predict the mechanical properties of particulate viscoelastic films suitable for high surface area sensor applications such as size-selective membranes relevant to protein or electrolyte adsorption.", "date": "2024-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Coating Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Thin Films", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our screening of 30 methanolic leaf extracts against S. cereviseae revealed that three Piper species produce compounds that exhibit prominent antifungal activity. By incorporating known structural motifs into the 1H NMR networks of crude extracts, we could approximate general structural types of some of the bioactive compounds during the initial phases of this targeted approach. Using unique resonances that correlated with antifungal activity, we isolated and characterized four novel compounds, three of which were identified as the active antifungal components of the mixtures. Subsequent growth inhibition assays with purified or synthetic compounds validated their efficacy, demonstrating the potential of this approach.

While the theoretical results were found to be in reasonably good agreement with the available spectroscopic data, it was also evident that it is highly desirable to develop a more accurate 12D PES of HF trimer. Motivated by this, here we report a new 12D PES of this paradigmatic system. Approximately 42,540 geometries were sampled and calculated at the level of CCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ. The permutationally invariant polynomial-neural network based \u0394-machine learning approach [Y. Liu and J. Li, J. Phys. Chem.

By strategically selecting data points, this approach facilitated the construction of a high-precision PES with BSSE correction, while requiring only a minimal number of BSSE value computations. The fitting error of the final PES is only 0.035 kcal/mol. To assess its performance, the 12D fully coupled quantum calculations of excited intra- and intermolecular vibrational states of HF trimer are carried out using the rigorous methodology developed by us earlier.

Biological degradation technologies employing microorganisms offer promising solutions. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome and proteome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a plastic-degrading microorganism found in the gut of superworms, to identify the genes and enzymes upregulated during polyethylene degradation. Functional analyses of these upregulated genes and enzymes using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology databases revealed an increase in lipid and hydrophobic amino acid metabolism, suggesting their involvement in polyethylene degradation. Based on these analyses, we identified phenylalanine monooxygenase, which is capable of oxidizing plastics, and isocitrate lyase, which is involved in C-C bond cleavage. To investigate the involvement of these enzymes in polyethylene degradation, phhA and aceA were transformed into Escherichia coli, and the enzymes were produced and purified. The purified enzymes were then reacted with polyethylene and analyzed. The results revealed the formation of hydroxyl (-OH) and C-O groups on the polyethylene surface after treatment with phenylalanine monooxygenase, confirming its ability to oxidize polyethylene. Isocitrate lyase alone did not affect polyethylene production; however, when combined with phenylalanine monooxygenase, it contributed to a reduction in molecular weight. This suggests a two-stage process of polyethylene degradation involving oxidation and depolymerization that requires sequential action of multiple enzymes. Thus, we identified the enzymes involved in each stage and demonstrated the degradation ability of polyethylene using purified enzymes.", "date": "2024-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Polymer Science; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The most common types of reagents for bioimaging employ a fluorescence readout, but the relatively broad emission bands of this modality and need to alter the chemical structure of the fluorophore to achieve different signal colors can potentially limit multiplex imaging. Here we report a generalizable approach to multiplex analyte imaging by leveraging the comparably narrow spectral signatures of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in an activity-based sensing (ABS) mode. We illustrate this concept by developing two Copper Raman Probes (CRPs), CRP2181 and CRP2153.2, that react selectively with loosely-bound Cu(I/II) and Cu(II) ions, respectively, termed the labile copper pool, through copper-directed acyl imidazole (CDAI) chemistry. These reagents label proximal proteins in a copper-dependent manner using a dye scaffold bearing a 13C\u2261N or 13C\u226115N isotopic SRS tag but otherwise having nearly identical physiochemical properties in terms of shape and size. SRS imaging with CRP2181 and CRP2153.2 enables duplex monitoring of changes in intracellular labile Cu(I) and Cu(II) pools upon exogenous copper supplementation or copper depletion, or through genetic perturbations to essential copper transport proteins. Moreover, CRP imaging reveals reciprocal increases in labile Cu(II) pools upon decreases in activity of the antioxidant response transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) in cellular models of lung adenocarcinoma. By showcasing the use of narrow-bandwidth, ABS probes for multiplex imaging of copper pools in different oxidation states and identifying alterations in labile metal nutrient pools in cancer, this work provides a starting point for the broader development of SRS for analyte-responsive, multiplex imaging in biological systems.", "date": "2024-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Two major phenomena emerge in RCC that are not predominant in the electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction, namely, the rapid corrosion and restructuring of the catalyst in the presence of the CO2-ammonia adducts, and the promotion of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The prevalence of HER in RCC is correlated to the electrostatic attraction of the protonated amine to the electrode and the repulsion of the captured CO2, using the potential of zero charge (PZC). The stability of catalysts under RCC conditions is a function of the applied potential and cannot be readily predicted using binding energy descriptors commonly used in the prediction of CO2R activity. Three different trends are experimentally observed under RCC testing: i) Cu, and Sn corrode under open circuit potential and produce predominantly hydrogen, ii) Au and Ag show activity for the reduction of dissolved CO2 and restructure under cathodic potentials, and iii) Ti does not corrode under open circuit conditions and only generated hydrogen as reduction product. This work shows that a direct correlation between calculated binding energies of CO2R intermediates, atomic oxygen, hydrogen, and ammonia, and the activity and stability of transition metal for RCC cannot be found, highlighting the need for further development of activity and stability descriptors beyond those known for CO2R.

However, there is limited consensus regarding which computational methods are appropriate for modeling flavin\u2019s photophysics. We compare the energies of low-lying excited states of flavin computed with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), equation of motion coupled cluster (EOM-EE-CCSD), scaled opposite-spin configuration interaction (SOS-CIS(D)), multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT), and several multi-reference perturbation theory (MR-PT2) methods. In the first part, we focus on excitation energies of the first singlet excited state (S1) of five different redox and protonation states of flavin, with the goal of finding a suitable active space for MR-PT2 calculations. In the second part, we construct two sets of one-dimensional potential energy surfaces connecting the S0 and S1 equilibrium geometries (S0\u2013S1 path) and the S1 (\u03c0,\u03c0*) and S2 (n,\u03c0*) equilibrium geometries (S1\u2013S2 path). The first path therefore follows a Franck-Condon active mode of flavin while the second path maps crossings points between low-lying singlet and triplet states in flavin. We discuss the similarities and differences in the TD-DFT, EOM-EE-CCSD, SOS-CIS(D), MC-PDFT and MR-PT2 energy profiles along these paths. We find that (TD-)DFT methods are suitable for applications such as simulating the spectra of flavins but are inconsistent with several other methods when used for some geometry optimizations and when describing the energetics of dark (n,\u03c0*) states. MR-PT2 methods show promise for the simulation of flavin\u2019s low-lying excited states, but the selection of orbitals for the active space and in the number of roots used for state averaging must be done carefully to avoid artefacts.

Real-time two-dimensional terahertz correlation maps were used to identify the pure rotational spectrum of water vapor, thus characterizing the evaporation part of the dewetting kinetics problem. We conclude with a kinetic model that accounts for our observations through a microscopic mechanism involving the interconversion between bulk water, water clusters, and individual water molecules in the gas phase. Overall, the approach presented here illustrates an application of femtosecond time-resolved experiments in the terahertz spectral range to the study of kinetic processes.", "date": "2024-06-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite this potential, the pervasive presence of defects in 2D dichalcogenides results in carrier mobility and photoluminescence (PL) that fall significantly short of theoretical predictions. Although defect passivation offers a potential solution, its effects have been inconsistent. This inconsistency arises from the current materials and methods, which fail to achieve the desired binding chemistry and band structure engineering necessary to enhance optical and electrical properties simultaneously. In this work, we uncover new binding chemistry using a sequence-specific chemical passivation (SSCP) protocol based on 2-furanmethanothiol (FSH) and bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI), which allows us to demonstrate a synchronized 100-fold enhancement in both carrier mobility and photoluminescence (PL) in WS2 monolayers.

We use this framework to screen 6155 ternary-phase spinel oxides and have isolated 33 candidates which are predicted to have potentially high OER activity. We have also trained a machine learning model to predict the binding energies of the *O, *OH and *OOH intermediates calculated within this workflow to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between electronic structure descriptors and OER activity. Out of the 33 candidates predicted to have high OER activity, we have synthesized three compounds and characterized them using linear sweep voltammetry to gauge their performance in OER.

However, the relationship between the features of a surface and its ice-philicity is not well understood, and for surfaces with chemical or topographical heterogeneity, such as proteins, their ice-philicity is not even well-defined. In the analogous problem of surface hydrophobicity, it has been shown that hydrophobic surfaces display enhanced low water-density (vapor-like) fluctuations in their vicinity. To interrogate whether enhanced ice-like fluctuations are similarly observed near ice-philic surfaces, here we use molecular simulations and enhanced sampling techniques. Using a family of model surfaces for which the wetting coefficient, k, has previously been characterized, we show that the free energy of observing rare interfacial ice-density fluctuations decreases monotonically with increasing k. By utilizing this connection, we investigate a set of fcc systems and find that the (110) surface is more ice-philic than the (111) or (100) surfaces. By additionally analyzing the structure of interfacial ice, we find that all surfaces prefer to bind to the basal plane of ice, and the topographical complementarity of the (110) surface to the basal plane explains its higher ice-philicity. Using enhanced interfacial ice-like fluctuations as a measure of surface ice-philicity, we then characterize the ice-philicity of chemically heterogeneous and topologically complex systems. In particular, we study the spruce budworm anti-freeze protein (sbwAFP), which binds to ice using a known ice-binding site (IBS) and resists engulfment using non-binding sites of the protein (NBSs). We find that the IBS displays enhanced interfacial ice-density fluctuations and is therefore more ice-philic than the two NBSs studied. We also find the two NBSs are similarly ice-phobic.

However, operational simplicity comes at a cost, with one-pot assays typically being less sensitive than corresponding two-step NAAT\u2013CRISPR-Cas assays and often failing to detect targets at low concentrations. It is thought that these performance reductions result from the competition between the two enzymatic processes driving the assay, namely Cas-mediated cis-cleavage and polymerase-mediated amplification of the target DNA. Herein, we describe a novel one-pot RPA\u2013Cas12a assay that circumvents this issue by leveraging in situ complexation of the target-specific sgRNA and Cas12a to purposefully limit the concentration of active Cas12a during the early stages of the assay. Using a clinically relevant assay against a DNA target for HPV-16, we show how this in situ format reduces competition between target cleavage and amplification and engenders significant improvements in detection limit when compared to the traditional one-pot assay format, even in patient-derived samples. Finally, to gain further insight into the assay, we use experimental data to formulate a mechanistic model describing the competition between the Cas enzyme and nucleic acid amplification.

For training data, we built a new dataset, ProteinReactiveDB, composed primarily of covalent and noncovalent inhibitors from  the DrugBank, BindingDB, and CovalentInDB databases. To assess the transferability of the trained models, we created a custom set of covalent and noncovalent inhibitors, which was constructed from the recent literature. Baseline models were developed using Morgan fingerprints as training inputs, but they performed poorly when applied to compounds outside the training set.

We also explore the interpretability of these GNNs using Gradient Activation Mapping (GradCAM), which shows regions of the molecules GNNs deem most relevant when making a prediction. These maps indicated that our trained models can identify electrophilic functional groups in a molecule and classify molecules as protein-reactive based on their presence.

Transaminases (TAs) are able to produce chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivity and in mild conditions, and can be immobilized to target stability, recoverability, and reusability. In the perspective of process intensification, we propose to study TA immobilization onto polymeric membranes. Two main immobilization strategies were investigated, requiring prior membrane surface functionalization. On the one hand, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane surface was partially hydrolyzed and coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) to electrostatically trap TAs. On the second hand, a polypropylene (PP) membrane was coated with polydopamine (PDA), which was subsequently modified with glycerol diglycidyl ether (GDE) in order to covalently graft TAs. The successful membranes functionalization was confirmed by surface characterization techniques (infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, and scanning electron microscopy). Enzyme leaching was observed from the functionalized PAN membrane, highlighting the need to post-treat the reversibly immobilized TAs to improve their anchoring. The covalent coupling of TAs with PEI using glutaraldehyde (GA) was found highly effective to avoid leaching and to increase the enzyme loading, without affecting the specific activity of the biocatalyst. Similarly, the covalent grafting of TA onto functionalized PP membranes yielded very efficient biocatalysts (retaining 85 % specific activity with respect to soluble TA) displaying perfect recyclability throughout successive cycles. Immobilizing either the S-selective HeWT or the R-selective TsRTA resulted in robust heterogeneous biocatalysts with antagonist enantioselectivities. Thus, chiral amine synthesis can be performed effectively with biocatalytic membranes, which paves the way to intensified continuous flow synthesis processes.

Dioxetane probes that undergo rapid, flash-type chemiexcitation demonstrate higher detection sensitivity than those with a slower, glow-type chemiexcitation rate. This is primarily because the rapid flash-type produces a greater number of photons within a given time. Herein, we discovered that dioxetanes fused to 7-norbornyl and homocubanyl units, present accelerated chemiexcitation rates supported by DFT computational simulations. Specifically, the 7-norbornyl and homocubanyl spirofused dioxetanes exhibited a chemiexcitation rate of 14.2-fold and 230-fold faster than the spiro-adamantyl-dioxetane, respectively.

However, a minimal theoretical model that is clear and adequate to address all these effects, as well as the linewidth scaling relations remains missing.  In this work, based on the single mode 1D Holstein-Tavis-Cummings (HTC) model, we studied the motional narrowing effect of the polariton linear absorption (LA) spectra via both semi-analytic derivations and numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. The results reveal that under collective light-matter coupling between a cavity mode and $N$ molecules, the polariton linewidth scales as $1/\\sqrt{N}$ under the slow limit, while scales as $1/N$ under the fast limit, due to the polaron decoupling effect. Further, by varying the detunings, the polariton linewidths exhibit significant motional narrowing, covering both characters mentioned above. Our analytic linewidth expressions agree well with the numerical exact simulations in all the parameter regimes we explored. These results indicate that the physics of motional narrowing is adequately accounted for by the single-mode 1D HTC model. We envision that both the numerical results and the analytic polariton linewidths expression presented in this work will offer great theoretical value for providing a better understanding of the exciton-polariton motional narrowing based on the HTC model.", "date": "2024-06-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Coherent oscillations on the 5MC surface are observed as a modulation in the XANES spectrum with a frequency of 103 cm-1 and a spectral shape that is characteristic of the symmetric Fe-N stretch.  These dynamics and spectra are similar to those previously observed for Fe(phen)32+ (phen = phenanthroline).

However, predicting and understanding the addition patterns in functionalized carboncones and fullerenes are extremely challenging due to the formidable complexity of the regioselectivity exhibited in the adducts. Existing predictive models fall short in systems where the carbon molecular framework undergoes severe distortion upon high degrees of addition. Here, we propose an incremental deep learning approach to predict regioselectivity in the hydrogenation of carboncones and chlorination of fullerenes. Utilizing exclusively graph-based features, our deep neural network (DNN) models rely solely on atomic connectivity, without requiring 3D molecular coordinates as input or iterative optimization of them. This advantage inherently avoids the risk of obtaining chemically unreasonable optimized structures, enabling the handling of highly distorted adducts. The DNN models allow us to study regioselectivity in hydrogenated carboncones of C70H20 and C62H16, accommodating up to at least, 40 and 30 additional H atoms, respectively. Our approach also correctly predicts experimental addition patterns in C50Cl10 and C76Cln (n = 18, 24, and 28), whereas in the latter cases all other known methods have proven unsuccessful.

The rational design of dielectric fluids for this application requires a molecular-level understanding of the heat flow across the battery casing/dielectric fluid interface. Here, we use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to quantify the interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) between hematite and poly-\ud835\udefc-olefin (PAO), which are representative of the outer surface of the steel battery casing and hydrocarbon dielectric fluid, respectively. After identifying the most suitable force fields to model the thermal properties of the individual components, we then compared different solid-liquid interaction potentials for the calculation of the ITR. These potentials lead to a wide range of ITR values (4-21 K m^2 / GW), with stronger solid-liquid interactions leading to lower ITR. The increase in ITR is correlated with an increase in density of the fluid layer closest to the surface. Since ITR has not been experimentally measured for the hematite/PAO interface, we validate the solid-liquid interaction potential using the work of adhesion calculated using the dry-surface method. The work of adhesion calculations from the simulations were compared to those derived from experimental contact angle measurements for PAO on steel. We find that all of the solid-liquid potentials overestimate the experimental work of adhesion. The experiments and simulations can only be reconciled by further reducing the strength of the interfacial interactions. This suggests some screening of the solid-liquid interactions, which may be due to the presence of an interfacial water layer between PAO and steel in the contact angle experiments. Using the solid-liquid interaction potential that reproduces the experimental work of adhesion, we obtain a higher ITR (33 K m^2 / GW), suggesting inefficient thermal transport. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for NEMD simulations to improve understanding of the nanoscale thermal transport across industrially-important interfaces.

Reverse reactions are disregarded.  We delve into a previously unexplored parameter regime. Specifically, we consider a scenario where the growth rate of the first newly formed particle is of the same order of magnitude as the nucleation rate, in contrast to the classical scenario where in the initial stage nucleation dominates over growth.\n\nIn this regime, we investigate the final size distribution as the initial number of monomers tends to infinity through extensive simulation studies utilizing state-of-the-art stochastic simulation methods with an efficient implementation and supported by high-performance computing infrastructure. We observe the emergence of a deterministic limit for the particle's final size density.\n\nTo scale up the initial number of monomers to approximate the magnitudes encountered in real experiments, we introduce a novel approximation process aimed at faster simulation. Remarkably, this approximating process yields a final size distribution that becomes very close to that of the original process when the available monomers approach infinity. Simulations of the approximating process further support the conjecture of the emergence of a deterministic limit.", "date": "2024-06-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Several structural models with specific ordering in chain orientations and correlations along the crystals have been proposed.

Izaguirre; Huafeng Xu; Woody Sherman; Weiping Tang; Xuhui Huang", "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer and other diseases, with an increasing number of programs demonstrating its efficacy in human clinical trials. One notable method for TPD is Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs, or heterobifunctional degraders) that selectively degrade a protein of interest (POI) through E3-ligase induced ubiquitination followed by proteasomal degradation. PROTACs utilize a warhead-linker-ligand architecture to bring the POI (bound to the warhead) and the E3 ligase (bound to the ligand) into close proximity. The resulting non-native protein-protein interactions (PPIs) formed between the POI and E3 ligase lead to the formation of a stable POI-degrader-ligase ternary complex, enhancing cooperativity for TPD. A significant challenge in PROTAC design is the time-consuming and resource-intensive screening of the degrader linkers to induce favorable non-native PPIs between POI and E3 ligase. In this work, we present a physics-based computational protocol to systematically predict non-canonical and metastable PPI interfaces between an E3 ligase and a given POI, aiding in the design of linkers to stabilize the PROTAC ternary complex and enhance degradation. In our protocol, we build the non-Markovian dynamic model using the Integrative Generalized Master Equation (IGME) method from approximately 1.5 millisecond all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of linker-less encounter complex, to systematically explore the inherent PPIs between the oncogene homologue (KRAS) protein and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase. Our IGME model successfully revealed six metastable states each containing a different PPI interface. We selected three of these metastable states containing promising PPIs for linker design. Our selection criterion included the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of these PPIs and the accessibility of the linker to the solvent-exposed sites on the warheads and the E3 ligand. One of our selected PPIs closely matches a recent co-crystal PPI interface structure induced by an experimentally designed PROTAC with potent degradation efficacy. We anticipate that our IGME approach has significant potential for widespread application in predicting metastable POI-ligase encounter complex interfaces that can enable subsequent rational design of novel PROTACs.", "date": "2024-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Evaluation of these catalysts for NO reduction by CO, as well as CO and propylene oxidation under model and industrially relevant conditions reveals pronounced reactivity and stability differences. Different modes of interaction of Rh+3 ions with the ceria facets and their facile reducibility were shown to be the crucial parameters controlling reactivity, resulting in pronounced activity and stability variations.

(111)-enriched ceria nanoparticles survive extremely harsh hydrothermal aging at 950 \u00b0C by maintaining and preserving (111) facets, unlike ceria nanoparticles which sinter into irregularly shaped particles.

Despite widespread applications of DNP, the role of these nearby nuclear spins has never been properly characterized because they were hitherto believed to be unobservable or \u2018hidden\u2019 due to severe shifts or line broadening due to strong electron-nuclear couplings, i.e., their NMR resonances are \u2018hypershifted\u2019 beyond detection limit. By using DNP on a frozen glycerol-water mixture (\u2018DNP juice\u2019) doped with TEMPOL at 1.4 K, we employed a newly introduced technique known as SPIn Diffusion Enhanced Saturation Transfer (SPIDEST), to indirectly reveals the spectrum of these hypershifted spins. Then, we performed direct two-pulse echo experiment, and we report here the results of the first direct observation of these hypershifted 1H nuclear spins under actual DNP conditions. The inhomogeneously broadened 1H NMR lines span a range of 10 MHz and can be directly observed by acquiring a series of frequency-stepped NMR spectra. Experiments repeated with deuterated TEMPOL proves that the hypershifted 1H signals indeed originate from methyl and methylene protons that are covalently attached to TEMPOL. In addition to characterizing the relaxation times (T1 and T2) of these nearby nuclei, we show that their polarization can be transferred to the bulk via spin diffusion using 2D NMR, i.e., the transport is not impeded by a spin diffusion barrier, as has been widely believed so far. This work presents a new form of spectroscopy that directly characterizes the nearby nuclei that we like to refer to as \u201chypershifted\u201d nuclei.

Lugdunomycin is a highly rearranged angucycline polyketide produced by Streptomyces sp. QL37, but the later stages of its biosynthesis so far remained elusive. Here, using combined biomimetic chemical synthesis, computational methods, genomics and mutational analysis, we shed important new light on the biosynthesis of a molecule with highly complex chemical scaffold. We show that lugdunomycin is formed by a rare intermolecular Diels-Alder reaction, with elmonin as a masked diene and iso-maleimycin as dienophile. The biosynthesis of the two substrates is encoded by distinct biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), whereby elmonin is specified by an angucycline BGC, while the biosynthesis of iso-maleimycin is encoded by a BGC for a \u03b2-lactone-like compound. Biomimetic total synthesis of lugdunomycin showed that the Diels-Alder reaction leads to the production of a diastereomer of lugdunomycin as the main product in vitro.

Components of essential oils (EOs) that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial properties are promising candidates. However, due to their high volatility and low solubility, their administration remains difficult. A promising method is to load materials with the active component and design a triggered release system to avoid rapid exhaustion of the carried material. If such a drug-release system would additionally exhibit antibacterial properties itself, it could significantly advance combatting bacterial infections. Therefore, in the present study, we combine the light-triggered and simultaneous release of the antimicrobial substance thymol with antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) within one nanoparticle. The irradiation of an immobilized photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidatively cleave a linker and ultimately releases thymol detected by GC-MS. Antibacterial properties towards Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation were verified by ATP-based viability assay. To improve the application for deep tissue delivery, we also take into account the low transmittance of visible light. A highly developed trifunctional material enables 2-photon excitation via F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and thus shifts the wavelength into the biological window. The release of the third functionality can be monitored in situ by fluorescence microscopy.

Based on the LIF and R2PI spectroscopy, we have identified two distinct isomers of 1:1 (PBI-H2O) and 1:2 (PBI-(H2O)2) complexes. In the cases of PBI-CH3OH and PBI-NH3 systems, a single 1:1 and 1:2 complex was identified in each case. Computational analyses predicted the most stable structure, labelled as PBI-S-a with NIH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S and SH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7NP (NIH = imidazolyl NH and NP: Pyridyl-N) hydrogen bonds at site-a. The structures were associated with significantly higher stability of the S1 state (D0(S1)>D0(S0)) compared to that in the corresponding ground states. The structure of PBI-H2O-b isomer, with CPH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S and SH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7NI hydrogen bonds, was characterized by a blue-shifted band origin transition, validating computational predictions. The PBI-(S)2-aa (S=H2O, CH3OH, and NH3) isomers exhibited large red-shifted S0\u2192S1 band origins, as predicted computationally. A unique PBI-(H2O)2-ab isomer was detected with a significantly lowered redshifted band origin transition compared to the aa-isomer, in which a solvent molecule is bound to the sites a and b PBI molecule. Notably, PBI-H2O complexes exhibit solvent-to-chromophore proton transfer reactions, with varying energy barriers depending on the isomeric configuration. The energy barriers for proton transfer reactions in PBI-H2O-b isomers demonstrated significantly elevated barriers (> 800 cm-1). In PBI-(H2O)-aa, the energy barrier (>436 cm-1) is marginally elevated from 420\u00b110 cm-1 in PBI-H2O-a isomer.

CMA1 has two excited-state conformations with distinct excited state dynamics.

AB can release hydrogen via pyrolysis, alcoholysis, hydrolysis, etc. Among these, AB hydrolysis is a safe and effective route, as it proceeds under mild conditions in the presence of an appropriate catalyst without the need for additional heat sources. For practical application, it is important to develop an efficient catalyst that further improves the hydrolytic dehydrogenation properties of AB.

PDC is a pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acid that can aggregate in aqueous solution. Aggregation depends upon  PDC-PDC, PDC-water, and PDC-ion interactions that are representative of interactions in similar charged, aromatic compounds. These interactions both dictate PDC aggregation and the likelihood that PDC aggregates exhibit parallel  stacking configurations that may promote PDC crystallization, which can be leveraged to separate PDC from solution. However, the interplay of interactions that drive aggregation and structure formation, and how these depend upon the charge of PDC and ionic species present in solution, remains unclear. In this work, we investigate PDC aggregation in diverse ionic solutions using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and molecular clustering analysis. We consider ion-induced dipole interactions by using a modified Lennard-Jones non-bonded model for divalent ions in solutions. From molecular clustering analysis, we derive characteristic parameters to quantify aggregate sizes and parallel stacking configurations.  We show that acid dissociation facilitates PDC aggregation in ionic solutions via ion-mediated interactions, and different ionic solutions influence both the likelihood of aggregation and the formation of parallel aggregates. In particular, we find that parallel stacking is primarily found in solutions with monovalent ions, whereas divalent ions promote larger, but less structured, aggregates.

While IDPs lack a stable three-dimensional structure they sample a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations that can, in principle, be assessed through molecular dynamics simulations. However, describing the structure and aggregation of large IDPs is challenging due to force field (FF) accuracy and sampling limitations. To cope with the latter, coarse-grained (CG) FFs emerge as a potential alternative at the expense of atomic detail loss. Whereas CG models can accurately describe the structure of the monomer, less is known about aggregation. The latter is key for assessing aggregation pathways and designing aggregation inhibitor drugs. Herein, we investigate the structure and dynamics of \u03b1-syn using different resolution CG (Martini3 and Sirah2) and all-atom (Amber99sb and Charmm36m) FFs, to gain insight into the differences and resemblances between these models. The dependence of the magnitude of protein-water interactions and the putative need of enhanced sampling (replica-exchange) methods, in CG simulations, are analyzed to distinguish between force field accuracy and sampling limitations. The stability of the CG models of an \u03b1-syn fibril was also investigated. Additionally, \u03b1-syn aggregation was studied through umbrella sampling for the CG models and CG/all-atom models for an 11-mer peptide (NACore) from an amyloidogenic domain of \u03b1-syn. Our results show that despite the \u03b1-syn structures of Martini3 and Sirah2, with enhanced protein-water interactions, are similar, major differences exist concerning aggregation. The Martini3 fibril is not stable, and the binding free energy of \u03b1-syn and NACore is positive, opposite to Sirah2. Sirah2 peptides in a zwitterionic form, in turn, display too strong termini interactions, resulting in end-to-end orientation. Sirah2 with enhanced protein-water interactions and neutral termini provides, however, a peptide aggregation free energy profile similar to that found with all-atom models. Overall, we find that Sirah2 with enhanced protein-water interactions is suitable for studying protein-protein and protein-drug aggregation.", "date": "2024-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the pursuit of this new field a dizzying array of technologies and techniques have demonstrated the ability to quantify hundreds to a few thousand proteins in single mammalian cells of typical size. One striking characteristic of these methods is the wide range of relative costs associated with the analysis of each single cell. We have attempted to estimate the cost per cell across 17 different studies based on quotes we have obtained for hardware, reagents and instrument support plans in relation to number of cells that can be analyzed per day. Before including labor or facilities, we find that the cost to analyze a single mammalian cell of typical size can range from less than <$2 per cell to over $50 per cell. The increase in cost appears directly related to the decrease in relative throughput as measured in theoretical maximum number of cells analyzed per day. Perhaps the most surprising observation is that the average number of single cells analyzed across these studies appears to decrease each year. This is striking when compared to the emergence of single cell RNA sequencing where throughput increased, and cost/cell decreased exponentially over the first 7 years of the field\u2019s emergence.  While we have made many assumptions to obtain these estimates, we hope that these will be informative for scientists interested in obtaining SCP data and for mass spectrometrists who are considering entering this new field.

Electrolytic ironmaking processes emerge as one promising route for sustainable ironmaking, because of their potential to decarbonize process heat and eliminate carbon-based reductants, the two major carbon emission sources in ironmaking. Among various electrolytic ironmaking routes, molten oxide electrolysis and alkaline electrolysis have attracted the most attention in the past decade. Acidic electrolysis, despite its unique advantages, remains less studied due to the severe hydrogen evolution side reaction and the resulting low faradaic efficiency. In this work, we report a novel ironmaking process in acidic electrolytes, Acidic electro-Winning in Anion-Rich Electrolytes (AWARE), which successfully addresses the low-efficiency problem of acidic electrolysis by leveraging novel anion-rich electrolytes that were invented based on recent breakthroughs in aqueous electrolyte science. Both batch- and continuous-mode ironmaking were demonstrated using oxide Fe ores in various current densities. High-efficiency production (up to 99.8%) of high-purity Fe (>99%) from two oxide Fe ores (impurity up to 10.2 wt%) with high current densities (up to 1000 mA/cm2) at low temperatures (25-80\u00b0C) were demonstrated. The roles of process parameters (current, flow rate, type of feedstock, temperature) and electrolyzer design (electrolyte, electrode, and membrane) were systematically studied. A comprehensive analysis of the technological and economic potential of emerging electrolytic ironmaking processes was conducted. Based on the results and analysis, it is concluded that the proposed AWARE represents a new generation of sustainable ironmaking technology that has the potential to transform ironmaking due to its low operation temperatures (< 100 \u00b0C), high efficiency (>99%), high impurity tolerance, zero chemical usage, zero waste production, and zero carbon emissions.", "date": "2024-06-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Genetically incorporating a photoreactive amino acid offers two key advantages: any site can be targeted, including those that are inaccessible to conventional crosslinking reagents, and photoreactive amino acids can potentially react with a broad range of interaction partners. However, broad reactivity imposes additional challenges for crosslink identification. In this study, we incorporate benzoylphenylalanine (BPA), a photoreactive amino acid, at selected sites in an intrinsically disordered region of the human protein HSPB5.

We routinely identify 30 to 300 crosslinked peptide spectral matches with this workflow, which is up to ten times more than existing tools for residue-level BPA crosslink identification. Most identified crosslinks are assigned to a precision of one or two residues, which is supported by a high degree of overlap between replicate analyses.

Based on electrochemical analysis and AIMD simulation, the identity and concentration of the cation and anion play more important roles in controlling the CO2R reaction pathway than the bulk CO2 solubility and the bulk pH of electrolytes. In-situ ATR-SEIRAS suggests that, unlike 1 M HCOOK, the *CO-bridge binding mode on Cu is dominant in 7.1 M HCOOK electrolyte, which potentially results in less CO release and higher yield of C2H4. This study demonstrates that while we can tailor the electrolyte composition to shift product selectivity, the factors that control the product selectivity are numerous and cannot be distilled down into one correlated property-reactivity relationship.

Fillers made of silicon dioxides can be found in countless polymeric materials. Because the interaction of the silica with the polymer determines the physical properties, factors like the surface-to-volume ratio (controlled via the particle size) and surface modification are important. Systems in which the particles are just physically dispersed in the polymer behave significantly differently to those for covalent anchoring of the fillers. Another possible functionality of the filler particles we focus on in the current publication is that they can bring stimuli-responsive properties to the system. Our concept is that photo-degradable organosilica nanoparticles can change the mechanical properties of a polymer/filler composite after it has been prepared. Because of the of the huge applicability of polysiloxanes ranging from building materials to medicine, silicones were selected as the center of interest for the current paper. After the synthesis of organosilica nanoparticles containing a bridging nitrobenzyl ether, and the investigation of the photochemical decomposition processes, the preparation of the composites is described. It is shown that vinyl groups attached to the surfaces are crucial for securing a homogeneous distribution of the filler particles inside the polymer matrix. Finally, the light-induced decomposition of the organosilica is executed and the mechanical properties are investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis. Other than expected, the material becomes stiffer. This effect is explained by a coupled increase of the surface-to-volume ratio of the silica particles accompanied by the emergence of hydroxy groups which interact with the polysiloxane backbone.", "date": "2024-06-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymer blends; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our investigation of exchange correlation functionals reveals that CAM-B3LYP demonstrates the best performance. In the framework of NEO-DFT, the interaction with the quantum nuclei is treated via electron-proton correlation functionals. Here, the epc17-2 gave a similar performance to the computationally more demanding epc19.

Additionally, the nuclear basis sets show negligible effects on proton affinity accuracy and lack any trend.

To this end, atomic-resolution information is accessible in chemical structures by observing model response to atomic perturbations of an input molecule; however, no methods exist that systematically utilize this information for model and molecular analysis.

First, 2-chloro-3-aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2-halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen-bonding between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen-bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron-rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site-selectivity for hydrogen-bond donating substrates. Second, electron-deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site-selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C\u2013X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C\u2013X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less-polar 3-centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states.

Trial-and-error random exploration is prohibitively expensive due to the vastness of the materials space. A more practical approach is to search for new materials within the proximity of known compounds that possess the desired property. In such an approach, assessing materials\u2019 similarity requires deriving some fingerprint relevant for material\u2019s performance. Typically, material\u2019s structure is used as the fingerprint, which often does not translate into similarity in properties. Electronic structure fingerprints, e.g., density of states (DOS) or electronic band structure, were proposed as a better alternative, however, the computational cost of their calculation on the scale of 100,000 materials remains too high for rapid exploration. In this work, we developed a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) ProDosNet which is trained on orbital-resolved and atom-resolved projected density of states (PDOS) data and is capable of predicting the electronic structure of materials at extremely low computational cost. With this model, we were able to generate PDOS fingerprints for all compounds present in the Materials Projects database and cluster them by similarity of their orbital-resolved PDOS.

It is reportedly the second most abundant greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere after CO2 and also has 25 times as much greenhouse effect as CO2. Therefore, the conversion of methane to methanol is a transformative approach to creating fuels and important chemical feedstocks and intermediates and also a sustainable way to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate global warming. Currently, methanol is manufactured industrially at a commercial scale from methane via the indirect energy-intensive syngas/FTS route which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly and proceeds at high temperatures and pressures. Therefore, direct conversion of methane to methanol is desirable to replace the indirect syngas/FTS with the possible advantages of reduced energy consumption, simplified process routes, and potentially higher selectivity and yield.

However, the transduction role of chemical energy in facilitating vesicle division has been less explored. This study investigates a mechanism of vesicle self-division driven by chemical energy without complex molecular machinery. We demonstrate that simple vesicles can undergo division into smaller daughter vesicles upon exposure to a chemical fuel. Our findings reveal that the division mechanism is finely controlled by adjusting fuel concentration, offering valuable insights into primitive cellular dynamics. This process showcases the robustness of self-division across different fatty acids, retaining encapsulated materials during division and suggesting protocell-like behavior.

As benchmarked in a diverse array of representative models with localized nonadiabatic couplings, DCC not only achieves fully consistent results (i.e., identical populations calculated based on wave functions and active states), but also closely reproduces the exact quantum results. Due to the high performance, our new DCC method has great potential to give a consistent and accurate mixed quantum-classical description of general nonadiabatic dynamics after further development.", "date": "2024-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, physics-based modeling elucidates how complex coupling of transport and kinetics dictates the performance of FB-BPMs in electrochemical devices. Simulations reveal that the open-circuit potential (OCP) of FB-BPMs is dictated by the balance of ion recombination and crossover, where recombination of buffering counter-ions attenuates OCP.

However, most organic cathodes are n-type polyaromatic compounds and conjugated polymers, which require sophisticated synthesis and provide a low operational voltage and slow Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Herein, we report access to p-type radical polymer cathodes from a commercially available poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride) (poly(MVE-alt-MA)) polymer. The modification of poly(MVE-alt-MA) with 4-amino-TEMPO produces radical polymers (PTEMPO) that are easily scalable to tens of grams. The corresponding polymer AZIBs deliver a capacity of 92 mAh g-1 at 10 C with 95% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Importantly, the electrode composites and battery assembly procedure are optimised so that no fluoro-containing electrolytes and binders are needed, and cheap carbon additives can be used. We assemble the Swagelok batteries, small pouch and large pouch batteries with mass loading of 7.8 to 50 mg cm-2, demonstrating nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. The pouch battery with 0.8-0.9 g of active polymer displayed a 60-mAh capacity with 1.5 V operational voltage.

Amphiphilic block copolymers are well known for their ability to create a wide range of supramolecular nanostructures in solution. Arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) are versatile molecular photoswitches, which change their configuration and hydrophobicity via irradiation with UV light (365 nm, Z isomer, less hydrophobic) and green light (520 nm, E isomer, more hydrophobic). In this work, photoswitchable block copolymers containing arylazopyrazole tetraethylene glycol methacrylate (AAPMA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA) forming amphiphilic POEGMA b PAAPMA with varying block lengths are prepared by RAFT polymerization. The photochemical properties of AAP persist in the polymers. Due to their amphiphilic structure, the polymers self-assemble into supramolecular morphologies in water. Remarkably, photoisomerization results in a reversible change in the self-assembly behavior.

The number of found NPs is so large that efficient dereplication is highly desirable. NMR spectroscopy is still the gold standard of structural identification. 13C NMR spectra is an effective molecular fingerprint but its acquisition is time-consuming, especially for mass-limited NPs. Several alternative meth-ods or tools have been proposed but never reached general use for some reasons. Here, a new artificial intelligence tool using con-trastive learning between 1H-13C HSQC spectra and structures, HSQCid, is proposed for effective structural identification. Two structure encoders are compared and Graph neural network is preferred over Transformer. In this way, 80% and 20% of about 400K predicted data could be used for training and testing, respectively. Besides, with 18K experimental data as external test data, top-1 and top-5 accuracy reaches 74.9% and 92.2%, respectively. Top-1 accuracy increases by at least 12% when combined with other easily obtainable structure features, such as total number of hydrogens connected to carbons from 1H NMR spectra. Further data analysis shows that the filters by structure features nearly eliminate the influence (>10%) of the difference between predicted and experimental data. Surprisingly the influence of the number or the ratio of quaternary carbons on the identification accuracy is only significant in specific and rare cases (less than 3%). Furthermore, benchmark method by matching 13C peaks is compared and markedly inferior to the proposed method. HSQCid will be available online in the near future for free public use. It is believed that HSQCid contributes to paving the way to high throughput or highly effective structural dereplication for NPs", "date": "2024-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study presents the design and characterization of a novel activity screening platform of immobilized photocatalytic films for degrading water pollutants. The compact testing system is engineered with four 3D-printed microreactors and a rotative multi-wavelength LED light source, which is capable of emitting at the 395, 409, 413, and 443 nm. Despite the different LEDs being placed in a compact space, 95% of the light that reaches the photocatalytic films is emitted by the LEDs directly opposite them. Therefore, the design allows for a minimum of 16 distinct testing conditions by simply rotating the light source. The performance of the microfluidic platform was characterized using the photocatalytic degradation of a pesticide, imidacloprid, in the presence of P25 TiO2, immobilized as thin film on glass plates. The results demonstrated a consistent degradation efficiency of around 35 % at 395 nm, with negligible variation across the four microreactors and no influence of the testing order at 395, 409, 413 and 443 nm. Notably, the photocatalytic film activity did not decrease after 6 hours of operation and under five successive illumination conditions. The screening conditions were optimized using the dynamic water infusion which increased the degradation efficiency of the imidacloprid to 71 %. In addition, the dynamic illumination allowed the sequential operation of the 4 types of LEDs, and led to a halved degradation efficiency despite the LEDs were lighted up for only a quarter of the time. This microfluidic platform diminishes the manual labor and the quantities of photocatalyst and polluted water required per test compared to the batch screening, consequently, it emerging as an efficient and sustainable tool that is suitable for the automated screening of immobilized photocatalysts.\n\n", "date": "2024-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Cu+ homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu+ chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu+ chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu+ chaperone-inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap-FFMTCGGCR peptide self-assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu+ due to the presence of the unique MT/CGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu+ chaperones. Nap-FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), impairs the activity of Cu+ dependent co-chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap-FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self-assembly and Cu+ binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu+ homeostasis. We show that assembly-enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease-relevant metal ion homeostasis.

This report explores its photocatalytic activity over an unusually wide excited-state redox window. To illustrate further, the dye molecule exhibits bimodality and proves itself as a simultaneous super-reductant and -oxidant, spanning a massive redox window of 5.98 V. This extreme bimodal behavior in indigo originates from the viability of two electron redox processes on the parent architecture. In comparison, major popular photocatalysts (PC) usually can accept or donate only one electron, limiting the span of its bimodal redox window significantly. In the presence of KOtBu and white light irradiation, indigo is converted to its tetraanionic form, Ind4- which displays its super-reducing power to an extent of -3.6 V vs SCE. Such an in situ-generated species has been separately synthesized and the reductive prowess of the PC has been examined for a wide array of reactions which starts with a reductive cleavage of the C-Cl bonds. On the contrary, the super-oxidant behavior of indigo has been explored in the presence of a mild oxidant and blue light irradiation, generating dehydroindigo.

One common approach is scaffold hopping, which is the manual design of novel scaffolds based on known chemical matter. One major limitation of this approach is narrow chemical space exploration, which can lead to difficulties in maintaining or improving biological activity, selectivity, and favorable property space. Another limitation is the lack of preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) data around these designs, which could lead to selecting suboptimal scaffolds to advance lead optimization. To address these limitations, we propose AutoDesigner - Core Design (CoreDesign), a de novo scaffold design algorithm. Our approach is a cloud-integrated, de novo design algorithm for systematically exploring and refining chemical scaffolds against biological targets of interest. The algorithm designs, evaluates, and optimizes a vast range - from millions to billions - of molecules in silico, following defined project parameters encompassing structural novelty, physicochemical attributes, potency, and selectivity. In this manner, CoreDesign can generate novel scaffolds and also explore preliminary SAR around each scaffold using FEP+ potency predictions. CoreDesign requires only a single ligand with quantifiable binding affinity and an initial binding hypothesis, making it especially suited for the hit-identification stage where experimental data is often limited. To validate CoreDesign in a real-world drug discovery setting, we applied it to the design of novel, potent Wee1 inhibitors with improved selectivity over PLK1. Starting from a single known ligand, CoreDesign rapidly explored over 23 billion molecules to identify 1,342 novel chemical series with a mean of 4 compounds per scaffold. Importantly, all chemical series met the predefined property space requirements. To rapidly analyze this large amount of data and prioritize chemical scaffolds for synthesis, we utilize t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plots of in silico properties. The chemical space projections allowed us to rapidly identify a structurally novel 5-5 fused core meeting all the hit-identification requirements. Several compounds were synthesized and assayed from the scaffold, displaying good potency against Wee1 and excellent PLK1 selectivity. Our results suggest that CoreDesign can significantly speed up the hit-identification process and increase the probability of success of drug discovery campaigns by allowing teams to bring forward high-quality chemical scaffolds de-risked by the availability of preliminary SAR.", "date": "2024-06-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, overreliance on fossil fuels as a primary energy source has posed a significant threat to the planet and its habitats because of high GHG emissions into the atmosphere, resulting in an unstable climate change. To mitigate this challenge, there is a need to balance energy demand with sustainability and social, economic, and environmental impacts associated with energy usage. Unfortunately, Louisiana depends excessively on non-sustainable forms of energy to meet its high energy demands with only 3.5% of its utility-scale electricity generated from renewable energy resources, despite being blessed with an abundance of sustainable energy resources. This project conducted a feasibility study on the energy resources available in Louisiana for different energy-efficient indicators, aiming at designing an energy portfolio that is sustainable, reliable, affordable, versatile, and meets the State\u2019s high-energy demand.

The ability to target a specific bond by aligning it with a bond-weakening electric field may be beneficial in mechanochemical reactions, which use mechanical force to selectively rupture specific bonds. Previous computational studies have focused primarily on a static description of molecules in OEEFs, while the crucial influence of thermal oscillations on the stability of the molecules has been neglected. Here, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the behaviour of a model mechanophore under the simultaneous influence of thermal and electric field effects. We examine and compare the changes to the bond and its thermal oscillations in strong OEEFs at various temperatures, without and with mechanical stretching forces applied to the molecule. We show that the change in bond length caused by an electric field is largely independent of the temperature, both without and with applied mechanical force. The amplitude of the thermal oscillation increases with increasing field strength and with increasing temperature, but at low temperatures, the application of mechanical force leads to an additional increase in amplitude. Our research shows that methods for applying mechanical force and OEEFs can be safely combined and included in an AIMD simulation at both low and high temperatures, allowing researchers to computationally investigate mechanochemical reactions in realistic application scenarios.", "date": "2024-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Heard; Luk\u00e1\u0161 Grajciar", "abstract": "Germanosilicate zeolites have played a pivotal role in the recent surge in synthesis of novel zeolite topologies. This success has been attributed to the combined effect of the high hydrolytic lability and specific distribution of germanium within the zeolitic framework, e.g., favoring the double four-ring (D4R) structural units. While experimental determination of germanium distributions remains limited, their in silico investigation has been hampered by the high computational cost of ab initio calculations. To overcome these limitations, we have developed neural network potentials (NNPs) that can efficiently explore a wide range of distributions in germanosilicate zeolites, while maintaining the accuracy of the ab initio (dispersion-corrected GGA DFT) training dataset. Through comprehensive screening of low-energy germanium distributions for five zeolite topologies (UTL, BEC, UOV, IWW and *CTH) across a broad range of Si/Ge ratios, we have identified a key factor governing the distribution of germanium in these D4R-containing zeolites, which is the tendency of germanium to cluster. The clustering initiates at the D4R units, leading to a preference to occupy these units at low to medium Ge loading (Si/Ge > 5). However, at high Ge loading, the Ge tends to phase separate into Ge-rich and Ge-poor regions, regardless of the specific structural unit. The zeolite topology was shown to be capable of modulating these trends in germanium distribution (e.g., UTL strongly favors D4R occupation even for low Si/Ge ratios), which suggests the possibility to develop design strategies for targeted zeolite synthesis.  The NNPs presented herein enable rapid evaluation of these design strategies across a wide range of candidate zeolite structures and experimentally relevant Si/Ge ratios.", "date": "2024-06-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysts; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this study, we present an ultrafast amperometric ACh biosensor enabling electrochemical recording that captures spontaneous bursts of single presynaptic exocytosis events at axon terminals of cholinergic cells with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Characterization of the recorded amperometric time trace revealed seven distinct current spike types, each displaying variations in both spike shape, time scale and quantities of ACh released through the synaptic vesicle fusion pore. This observation suggests the presence of multiple exocytosis modes at these cells. Quantifying the absolute number of ACh molecules released at single exocytosis events was achieved through sensor calibration using electroanalytical measurements of synthetic lipid vesicles containing varying concentrations of ACh. Notably, the largest quantal release was estimated at approximately 8000 ACh molecules, likely representing full exocytosis, while the fractional release of roughly 5000 ACh molecules correspond to a partial exocytosis mode. Following a local administration of bafilomycin A1, a V-ATPase inhibitor, the cholinergic cells exhibited both a higher frequency and larger quantity of ACh released during exocytosis events. Hence, this ACh sensor introduces means to monitor minute amounts of ACh and investigate regulatory mechanisms at single-cell level, which is vital for understanding healthy brain function, pathologies, and optimizing drug treatment for disorders.", "date": "2024-06-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Electrochemical Analysis; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, applying these algorithms to deeper chemical reaction network (CRN) exploration still requires the development of more efficient and accurate exploration policies. Here, an exploration al- gorithm, which we name Yet Another Kinetic Strategy (YAKS), is demonstrated that uses microkinetic simulations of the nascent network to achieve cost-effective and deep network exploration. Key features of the algorithm are the automatic incorporation of bimolecular reactions between network intermediates, compatibility with short-lived but kinetically important species, and the incorporation of rate uncertainty into the exploration policy. In validation case studies of glucose pyrolysis, the algorithm rediscovers reaction pathways previously discovered by heuristic exploration policies and also elucidates new reaction pathways to experimentally obtained products. The resulting CRN is the first to connect all major experimental pyrolysis products to glucose. Additional case studies are presented that investigate the role of reaction rules, rate uncertainty, and bimolecular reactions. These case studies show that naive exponential growth estimates can vastly overestimate the actual number of kinetically relevant pathways in physical reaction networks.

Among all complexes, the largest cage escape yields (0.67-1) were recorded for the Ir(III) photosensitizer showing the highest potential as a photocatalyst in photoredox catalysis. These yields dropped to values around 0.65 for both Ru(II) photosensitizers and to values around 0.38 for the Os(II) photosensitizer. Interestingly, for both open shell Fe(III) complexes, the yields were small (<0.1) in solvents with dielectric constants greater than 20 but were shown to reach values up to 0.58 in solvents with low dielectric constant. The results presented herein on closed shell pho-tosensitizers suggest that the low rate of triplet-singlet intersystem crossing within the manifold of states of the geminate radical pair implies that charge recombination towards the ground state is a spin forbidden process, favoring large cage escape yields that are not influenced by dielectric effects. Geminate charge recombination in open-shell metal complexes, such as the two Fe(III) photosensitizers studied herein, is no longer a spin forbidden process and becomes highly sensitive to solvent effects.

The advantages of dynamic systems are their injectability (shear-thinning and self-healing), reprocessability, and dynamic (time-dependent) mechanical properties, sometimes uncovering unique behavior or functions in the desired application. These properties arise from the inherent relationship between the rate and equilibrium constants (RECs) of molecular junctions (cross-links) and the resulting macroscopic behavior of dynamic networks. However, there are few examples of explicitly measured rate and equilibrium constants establishing this connection between RECs and materials properties, particularly for polymeric hydrogel systems. Here we use dynamic covalent imine formation to study how single-point compositional changes in amine nucleophiles affect binding constants and resulting hydrogel mechanical properties. We find that there is over a 3 decade change in RECs, in both model small molecule studies and model polymeric backbones. Based on established relationships in the literature, we then developed a simple model to describe the cross-linking equilibrium and predict changes in hydrogel mechanical properties. This allowed us to uncover a regime where adding crosslinker before saturation can decrease the crosslink density of a hydrogel. Having determined explicit equilibrium constants, we were then able to demonstrate the veracity of this predicted behavior experimentally. Notably this emergent behavior is not accounted for in covalent hydrogel theory. This study expands upon the structure-reactivity relationships for imine formation, highlighting how quantitative determination of rate and equilibrium constants facilitates predicting the macroscopic behavior of soft materials. Furthermore, while the present study focuses on dynamic covalent imine formation, the underlying principles of this work are applicable to the general bottom-up design of soft and recyclable dynamic materials.", "date": "2024-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Hydrogels; Chemical Kinetics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Weak acid cation exchangers loaded with zinc exhibit high ammonia selectivity but face two implementation barriers: the stability of the zinc-carboxylate bond in complex wastewaters and energy- and logistics-intensive adsorbent regeneration with acidic solutions. In this study, we examined the stability of the zinc-carboxylate bond in varying solutions (pure ammonium solution, synthetic urine, and real urine) and during electro-assisted regeneration. For electrochemical regeneration, both electrolyte concentration and current density influenced the tradeoff between ammonia regeneration and zinc elution. Using 10 mM K2SO4 anolyte at 0.08 mA/cm2 current density, we achieved 4% zinc elution and 61% ammonia regeneration. In contrast, using 100 mM K2SO4 at 4.96 mA/cm2 improved regeneration efficiency to 97% but eluted 60% of zinc.

A notable modification site is the aromatic side chain of Tyr, which undergoes modifications, such as phosphorylation and nitration.

This knowledge gap arises from the absence of natural amino acids that can mimic these PTMs and the lack of synthetic tools for the site-specific introduction of aromatic PTMs into proteins. Herein, we describe a facile method for the site-specific chemical installation of aromatic PTMs into proteins through palladium-mediate S-C(sp2) bond formation under ambient conditions. We demonstrate the incorporation of novel PTMs such as Tyr-nitration and phosphorylation analogs to synthetic and recombinantly expressed Cys-containing peptides and proteins within minutes and in good yield. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we employed it to prepare 10 site-specifically modified proteins, including nitrated and phosphorylation analogs of Myc and Max proteins. Furthermore, we prepared a focused library of site-specifically nitrated and phosphorylated \u03b1-Syn protein, which enabled for the first time deciphering the role of these competing modifications in regulating \u03b1-Syn conformation aggregation in vitro.

While each effect has been observed separately, here we report the paradoxical impact of surface roughness on spherical and anisotropic ellipsoidal polymer colloids. Using a seeded emulsion polymerization technique, we synthesize spherical and ellipsoidal particles with controlled roughness magnitude and topography (concave/convex). Via in situ measurement of the interfacial deformation around colloids at an air-water interface, we find that while surface roughness strengthens the quadrupolar deformation in spheres as expected by theory, in stark contrast, it weakens the same in ellipsoids. As roughness increases, particles of both shapes become more hydrophilic and their apparent contact angle decreases. Using numerical predictions, we show that this partially explains the decreased interfacial deformation and capillary interactions between ellipsoids. Therefore, particle surface engineering has the potential to decrease the capillary deformation by asymmetric particles via changing their capillary pinning as well as wetting behavior at fluid interfaces.

Molecular dynamics simulations were used to compare and contrast the dielectric response of a nonpolar (1,2-dichloroethane/water) and polar (1-octanol/water) liquid-liquid interface system. We found that enhanced dielectric permittivity at the nonpolar interface is attributed to the increased water dipole orientation and polarization density. In the case of the polar interface, strong association of the immiscible solvents inhibit the molecular dipole orientation, counteracting the effect from the enhanced surface water polarization density and resulting in a standard dielectric response. Detailed knowledge of the hydrogen bond networks and molecular dipole orientation with respect to the specific instantaneous interfacial and bulk regions reveals the effect of molecular proximity and the interaction with the opposing interfacial molecules upon the mechanism of the dielectric permittivity response across the liquid-liquid interface phase boundary.", "date": "2024-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using a variety of complementary analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy imaging, in-situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy, we discovered that minor changes in the ligand arrangement of molecular Au phosphine complexes result in significantly different activation behaviors of alumina-supported Au catalysts under reaction conditions. When using [Au2(\u03bc2-POP)2]OTf2 (POP = tetraphenylphosphoxane) as a single-source precursor, we obtained an active supported Au oxidation catalyst in the second light-off, outperforming both a commercial Au/TiO2 and a P-free Au/Al2O3 reference catalyst. Conversely, using [Au2(\u03bc2-dppe)2]OTf2 (dppe = diphenylphosphinoethane) on alumina led to a significant decrease in CO oxidation activity. This difference is attributed to the formation of a P-containing binding pocket in the case of [Au2(\u03bc2-POP)2]OTf2/Al2O3, which not only enhances the thermal stability of the Au particles but also affects their electronic properties through charge transfer processes from Au to P. In contrast, the molecular precursor of [Au2(\u03bc2-dppe)2]OTf2/Al2O3 is too stable and produces gold nanoparticles with blocked active sites. This work provides detailed insights into the ligand decomposition of molecular gold phosphine complexes under reaction conditions and demonstrates the delicate balance between the stabilization of Au particles, clusters and complexes using ligands and the blocking of active surface sites by strongly coordinating molecules.

We approach these challenges from a novel multimodal perspective, and propose a multimodal generative method, MolEdit, to explicitly model both the discrete atomic constituents and their continuous positions in 3D space. MolEdit is based on a group-optimized score matching algorithm which preserves the symmetry of atomic positions on top of a joint model which generates the molecular constituents.

Nevertheless, the relationship between water adsorption energy Eads and EDLs is not fully understood, in particular for electrode surfaces with weakly adsorbed water. Here, by applying density functional theory-based finite-field molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied the effect of water adsorption energy Eads on surface acidity and the Helmholtz capacitance of BiVO4 as an example of metal oxide electrodes with weakly chemisorbed water. This allows us to establish the effect of Eads on the coordination number, the H-bond network, the orientation of chemisorbed water by comparing a oxide series composed of BiVO4, TiO2 and SnO2. In particular, it is found that a positive correlation exists between the degree of asymmetry \u2206CH in the Helmholtz capacitance and the strength of Eads. This correlation is verified and extended further to graphene-like systems with physisorbed water, where EDLs is controlled by electronic charge rather than proton charge as in the oxide series.

However, H2 adsorption enthalpies in such materials are generally weak (\u22123 to \u22127 kJ/mol), leading to low capacities at ambient temperature. Metal\u2013organic frameworks with well-defined structures and synthetic modularity could allow for tuning adsorbent\u2013H2 interactions for ambient-temperature storage. Recently, Cu2.2Zn2.8Cl1.8(btdd)3 (H2btdd = bis(1H-1,2,3-triazolo-[4,5-b],[4\u2032,5\u2032-i])dibenzo[1,4]dioxin; CuI-MFU-4l) was reported to show a large H2 adsorption enthalpy of \u221232 kJ/mol owing to \u03c0-backbonding from CuI to H2, exceeding the optimal binding strength for ambient-temperature hydrogen storage (\u221215 to \u221225 kJ/mol). Toward realizing optimal H2 binding, we sought to modulate the \u03c0-backbonding interactions by tuning the pyramidal geometry of the trigonal CuI sites. A series of isostructural frameworks, Cu2.7M2.3X1.3(btdd)3 (M = Mn, Cd; X = Cl, I; CuIM-MFU-4l), was synthesized through post-synthetic modification of the corresponding materials M5X4(btdd)3 (M = Mn, Cd; X = CH3CO2, I; MX-MFU-4l). This strategy adjusts the H2 adsorption enthalpy at the trigonal pyramidal CuI sites as a function of the ionic radius of the central metal ion of the pentanuclear cluster node, leading to \u221233 kJ/mol for M = ZnII (0.74 \u00c5), \u221227 kJ/mol for M = MnII (0.83 \u00c5), and \u221223 kJ/mol for M = CdII (0.95 \u00c5). Thus, CuICd-MFU-4l provides a second, more stable example of optimal H2 binding energy for ambient-temperature storage among reported metal\u2013organic frameworks.

Comparing to the explicit model and continuum model, the discrete-continuum model of solvation is a hybrid solvation model in which the first solvation shell is described explicitly, and the remainder of the bulk liquid is characterized by a continuum model, which provides an excellent balance between accuracy and computational costs. This work serves as a systematic benchmark of the discrete-continuum model for the solvation of cations with +2, +3, and +4 charges.

Although biocatalysis permits straightforward access to Rib1P directly from natural nucleosides, these transformations are tightly thermodynamically controlled and suffer from low yields and non-trivial work-up procedures. To address these challenges, we developed a biocatalytic cascade that allows near-total conversions of natural guanosine into \u03b1-anomerically pure Rib1P. The key to this route is a guanine deaminase, which removes the accumulated guanine byproduct. Under optimised conditions, this cascade proved readily scalable to the gram scale, delivering isolated yields of up to 79% and a purity of 94% without any chromatography. Our cascade approach reduced the need for toxic reagents and purification steps inherent to previous methods, reducing the environmental burden of the route, as confirmed by CHEM21 Zero Pass and E-factor calculations.

The electrophoretic mobility of hydrophobic nanodroplets in water doubles in magnitude when the pH is varied from neutral to mildly basic (pH 7 to pH 11). Classical continuum theory predicts that this increase in mobility is due to an increased surface charge. Here, by combining all-optical measurements of surface charge and molecular structure, as well as electronic structure calculations, we show that surface charge and molecular structure at the nanodroplet surface are identical at neutral and mildly basic pH. We propose that the force that propels the droplets originates from two factors: Negative charge on the droplet surface due to charge transfer from and within water, and anisotropic gradients in the fluctuating polarization induced by the electric field. Both charge density fluctuations couple with the external electric field, and lead to droplet flow. Replacing chloride by hydroxide doubles both the charge conductivity via the Grotthuss mechanism, and the droplet mobility. This general mechanism deeply impacts a plethora of processes in biology, chemistry, and nanotechnology and provides an explanation of how pH influences hydrodynamic phenomena and the limitations of classical continuum theory currently used to rationalize these effects.", "date": "2024-06-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have led to routines that surpass the accuracy of ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) in estimating experimental $^{13}$C shifts. The extraction of knowledge from other models, known as transfer learning, has demonstrated remarkable improvements, particularly in scenarios with limited data availability. However, the extent to which transfer learning improves predictive accuracy in low-data regimes for experimental chemical shift predictions remains unexplored. \nThis study indicates that atomic features derived from a message passing neural network (MPNN) forcefield are robust descriptors for atomic properties. A dense network utilizing these descriptors to predict $^{13}$C shifts achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.68 ppm. When these features are used as node labels in a simple graph neural network (GNN), the model attains a better MAE of 1.34 ppm. On the other hand, embeddings from a self-supervised pre-trained 3D aware transformer are not sufficiently descriptive for a feedforward model but show reasonable accuracy within the GNN framework, achieving an MAE of 1.51 ppm. Under low-data conditions, all transfer-learned models show a significant improvement in predictive accuracy compared to existing literature models, regardless of the sampling strategy used to select from the pool of unlabeled examples.\nWe demonstrated that extracting atomic features from models trained on large and diverse datasets is an effective transfer learning strategy for predicting NMR chemical shifts, achieving results on par with existing literature models.

In this work, we discover that nanoscale heterogeneous Ag+ doping dramatically affects lithium intrusion in Li6.6La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12 (LLZO), a brittle solid electrolyte. We generate nanoscale Ag+ doping by thermally annealing a 3-nm-thick metallic film. The metallic Ag undergoes Ag-Li ion exchange, completely disappears, and diffuses into LLZO bulk and grain boundaries to a depth of 20-50 nm. Density functional theory calculations predict this Ag-Li ion exchange exhibits negligible impact on electronic properties.  Mechanically, nanoindentation experiments (n = 69) show a fivefold increase in the force required to fracture Ag+ surface-doped LLZO (Ag+-LLZO), providing direct evidence that surface modification due to Ag+ incorporation prevents crack opening. Conducting 121 plating experiments via operando microprobe scanning electron microscopy, we further confirm that the Ag+-LLZO surface exhibits improved lithium plating even under a large local indentation stress of 3 GPa. Surprisingly, microprobe plating reveals that Ag+ increases the diameter of plated Li at failure by more than 4 times, demonstrating its role in enhancing the defect tolerance of LLZO.

This system forms a stable organic NDI-based radical-anion upon exposure to light in a solvent containing a small amount of an amine that acts as an electron donor. The radical anion formtion has also been demonstrated with chemical reductant. The photoisomerization of this photochromic system converts it into a less-conjugated and less-electron-rich form, affecting the generation of the radical as well as its stability. Consequently, light-induced isomerization effectively quenches the radical. Thus, the formation and existence of the radical can be adjusted by manipulating the photoisomerization of the photochromic unit under diverse light sources.

While methods for estimating prediction reliability, such as the applicability domain (AD), have been proposed for mitigating reward hacking, multi-objective optimization makes it challenging. The difficulty arises from the need to determine in advance whether the multiple ADs with some reliability levels overlap in chemical space, and to appropriately adjust the reliability levels for each property prediction.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we designed candidates for anticancer drugs as a typical example of multi-objective optimization.

Despite their extensive use, a full, fundamental understanding of the role of coatings in reducing degradation and extending cycling lifetimes is currently lacking. In this work, the interactions between an atomic layer deposited (ALD) alumina coating on polycrystalline LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) and a carbonate-based battery electrolyte are studied. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) heteronuclear experiments show that the Al2O3 coating transforms by reacting with electrolyte species present before and during electrochemical cycling, scavenging protic and acidic species. Density-functional theory calculations highlight the additional chemical effect of the coating in locally stabilising the structure of the NMC811, limiting oxidation of the oxygen atoms coordinated to both Al and Ni, thereby limiting the surface reconstruction process and improving the electrochemical performance. Improved NMC811 surface stability is confirmed by monitoring gaseous degradation species by operando electrochemical mass-spectrometry and via X-ray spectroscopic analysis of the electrochemically aged samples to examine changes in Ni and O oxidation state and local structure. The combination of this experimental and theoretical analysis suggests that Al2O3 coatings have a dual role: as a protective barrier against attack from chemical species in the electrolyte, and as an artificial passivating layer hindering oxygen loss and surface phase transformations.

Current adsorbent-based methods achieve satisfactory storage densities predominantly under cryogenic temperatures and/or high pressures, which imposes problems with cost-efficient and safe implementation of this technology. Materials that can bind hydrogen gas reversibly at ambient temperatures and more moderate pressures could play a pivotal role in enabling hydrogen-powered technologies. In this study, we use reliable computational modelling to investigate two synthetically feasible paths for tuning the enthalpy of H2 binding in MFU-4-type metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), aiming to maximize usable capacity. This study examines MIMII4Cl3(bta)6 (bta\u2212 = benzotriazolate) Kuratowski-type clusters as a model for strong binding sites in MFU-4l frameworks. We systematically evaluate the impact of separately tuning the central MII metal ion (which plays a structural role) and the peripheral MI metal ion (which binds the substrate) on the energetics of H2 binding. Our computational findings reveal that there exist several combinations of MI and MII ions that provide optimal binding enthalpies for H2 storage. As a result, three of these new cluster compositions achieve high fractional usable capacities of the total H2 adsorbed under a pressure swing from 5 to 100 bar at room temperature. Additionally, we examine the nature of the binding interaction between the peripheral metal atom and the hydrogen molecule. While charge transfer predominantly induces this interaction, for several atom combinations change in the polarization (associated with variations in the ionic radius of the MI binding atom) is another important factor for adjusting the strength of the interaction.

This prominent strategy relies on the generation of alkoxy radicals, which can react via various radical pathways to give carbon-centered radicals that can be engaged in C-C bond formation reactions. However, cross-coupling reactions involving catalytic generation of alkoxy radicals directly from native alcohols is highly challenging and the scope of existing catalytic methods remains particularly limited. Moreover, a unified strategy that can incorporate a broad range of alcohols in catalytic cross-coupling with aryl halides is currently unavailable. Herein, we report a general photocatalytic platform that combines nickel and iron ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) catalysis for the selective deconstructive Csp2-Csp3 bond cleavage and arylation of various unactivated alcohols. This protocol lever-ages the ability of photoinduced iron LMCT catalysis to generate radicals from diversely substituted alcohols, enabling im-plementation of various C-C bond-forming manifolds. These include dehydroxymethylative arylation of aliphatic alcohols, remote arylation of cyclic alcohols to yield alkyl ketones, and unprecedented use of tertiary alcohols for methylation of aryl halides. This methodology offers a practical and unified strategy for engaging a large variety of commercially available alcohols in cross-coupling reactions under mild conditions, using abundant nickel and iron catalysts.

Our method can separate PLGA polymers with a molecular weight of up to 185 kDa and simultaneously separate the difference in lactic acid (LA)/glycolic acid (GA) ratios.\nTo achieve this, we used a cross-linked diol column with a ternary gradient from hexane to 0.1% v/v triethylamine in THF to 0.1% v/v formic acid in THF. This allowed for the elution of ester-terminated PLGA, followed by acid-terminated PLGA. We also separated ester-terminated PLGA in the difference of the LA/GA ratio.\nOur method is expected to help understand the correlation between PLGA\u2019s FTD, CCD, and physical properties, which will facilitate product development.\n", "date": "2024-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Second, catalytic ratchets are defined by the catalyst state of strong or weak binding that permit reactants to proceed through the transition state.

However, the curing of their solvent-free formulations at near room temperatures is often very slow and requires the utilization of organocatalysts, limiting the large-scale deployment of the technology. Herein, we study the impact of water, introduced as an additive (2 to 10 wt.%), on the crosslinking rate of common solvent-free thermosetting PHU formulations composed of a polycyclic carbonate and a diamine. Rheology measurements, using a multi-frequency approach, indicate that even very small amounts of water (< 5 wt.%) impressively shorten gel times, by up to 5 folds at 40 \u00b0C. The multi-frequency methodology highlights for the first time the strong interactions of water with the growing PHU network during the crosslinking reaction. It suggests that water breaks down the multiple intra-/inter-molecular H-bond interactions within the PHU clusters, consequently enhancing the molecular mobility and delaying the vitrification (hydroplasticization), both phenomena contributing to accelerate the crosslinking rate. On top of that, through a combination of model reactions and computational calculations, we demonstrate that water is an actual catalyst of the cyclic carbonate aminolysis.  Eventually, thanks to its multifaceted role, water can efficiently substitute the organocatalysts (e.g. TBD, DBU) usually required to cure PHU formulations at near ambient temperature. This work demonstrates that the use of additive amounts of water in solvent-free formulations is a cost-effective, non-toxic, and robust solution to accelerate the production of PHU materials, free of any organocatalyst.

The catalyst is bulk sized and works in-situ by virtue of the electroactivation of the morphologically rough MoS2 surface with nascent active sites. Such active sites are different from the conventional defect based active sites since these are composed of paramagnetic Mo5+ centers. These paramagnetic centers are generated during the mechanical grinding process and get exposed to the reactant at the outset of the reduction providing alternative reduction pathways. The epitactically transformed oxalic acid dihydrate which is physisorbed on the MoS2 surface during the catalyst\u2019s preparation process, gets released in aqueous medium lowering the pH and accelerating the hydrolysis of BH4- .

We introduce a capacitive decarbon (CDC) reactor that converts carbonate ions into CaCO3, a construction material, using only calcium ions (Ca2+) from seawater and renewable electricity. After optimizations of the electrode and electrolytic reactor, the CDC reactor achieves ocean carbon removal with an exceptionally low energy consumption of 16 kJ mol\u22121 CO2, which is one order of magnitude lower than previously reported values. This energy requirement increases to 107 kJ mol\u22121 CO2 when factoring in the seawater intake and pre-treatment.

Farmyard manure (FYM) addition to arable soils is a measure to increase SOM content, microbial activity and abundance of microbial metabolites (e.g., necromass (NM) markers). However, understanding the mechanistic links between soil dynamics and energy storage is hampered due to the chemical complexity of SOM. Non-targeted molecular-level methods like liquid chromatography coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC-FT-ICR-MS) can be used to explore the complex dynamics of SOM, revealing energetic fingerprints and long-term changes in SOM due to FYM addition. We compared water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) from soils of four long-term FYM addition experiments with representative WEOM signatures from maize, bacterial and fungal NM. Long-term FYM addition increased the complexity of WEOM, most pronounced in polar, unsaturated, oxidised and energy-poor compounds. These changes were linked to a 2-3-fold increase in bacterial, plant and fungal NM signatures. Especially bacterial NM in FYM-amended WEOM indicated a shift in dominant energy use channels. Control soils showed a much lower overlap with all NMs, but indicated a higher dominance of fungal energy-use channels, especially for N-containing compounds. A large fraction of WEOM signals (79% in FYM-amended, 94% in control soils) was unrelated to any of the three NM signatures, and was also mainly responsible for the shift in nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) between the fertilisation treatments. LC-FT-ICR-MS provided access to ~600 novel microbial NM markers which are readily soluble and compositionally distinct from classical NM markers (ergosterol, aminosugars, etc.). Overall, we highlight novel insights into NM contribution to SOM by LC-FT-ICR-MS, and how it can assist to constrain compositional and energetic impacts of FYM addition on soils.", "date": "2024-06-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Soil Science; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Targeted free energy perturbation (TFEP) can significantly lower the computational cost of FEP calculations by choosing a set of invertible maps used to directly connect the distributions of interest, achieving the necessary statistically significant overlaps without sampling any intermediate states. Probabilistic generative models (PGMs) based on normalising- flow architectures can make it much easier via machine learning to train invertible maps needed for TFEP. However, the accuracy and applicability of approaches based on empirically learned maps depend crucially on the choice of reweighting method adopted to estimate the free energy differences. In this work, we assess the accuracy, rate of convergence, and data efficiency of different free energy estimators, including exponential averaging, BAR, and MBAR, in reweighting PGMs trained by maximum likelihood on limited amounts of molecular dynamics data sampled only from end-states of interest. We carry out the comparisons on a set of simple but representative case studies, including conformational ensembles of alanine dipeptide and ibuprofen. Our results indicate that BAR and MBAR are both data efficient and robust, even in the presence of significant model overfitting in the generation of invertible maps.

ABFE calculations quantitatively rank and estimate the affinity of the ligands in relation to microcalorimetry, with a mean signed error in binding free energy of -0.63 \u00b1 0.04 kcal/mol. Consequently, the diminished binding efficiencies of the larger carbohydrate ligands are closely reproduced: the ligand efficiency values from isothermal titration calorimetry for the glycan core pentasaccharide and its constituent trisaccharide and monosaccharide compounds are respectively -0.14 \u00b1 0.00, -0.22 \u00b1 0.00 and -0.41 \u00b1 0.00 kcal/mol per heavy atom.

In this study, we explore the effect of converting BeRST to diEt BeRST, by replacing the dimethyl aniline of BeRST with a diethyl aniline group. The new VF dye, diEt BeRST, has a voltage sensitivity of 40% \u0394F/F per 100 mV, a 33% increase compared to the original BeRST dye, which has a sensitivity of 30% \u0394F/F per 100 mV. In neurons, the cellular brightness of diEt BeRST is about 20% as bright as BeRST, which may be due to the lower solubility of diEt BeRST (300 \u03bcM) compared to BeRST (800 \u03bcM). Despite this lower cellular brightness, diEt BeRST is able to record spontaneous and evoked action potentials from multiple neurons, simultaneously, and in single trials. Far-red excitation and emission profiles enable diEt BeRST to be used alongside existing fluorescent indicators of cellular physiology, like Ca2+-sensitive Oregon Green BAPTA (OGB).

Thus, to explore new possibilities for liprotide synthesis, mung bean albumins and globulins were each extracted and combined with oleic acid (OA) at different temperatures (40 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C) to synthesize four variations of plant-based liprotides (Alp40, Alp80, Glp40, and Glp80). These, along with OA and protein controls, were characterized through ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, visual stability testing, particle size analysis, and zeta potential analysis. The IR spectra of the liprotides compared to the controls suggested that the OA molecule was encapsulated within the protein shell as intended. Peak shifts in characteristic absorption bands were also observed, indicating possible structural changes that may or may not be correlated to liprotide formation. Particle size analysis showed that the synthesized liprotides had significantly larger diameters than those indicated in published data and were highly polydispersed (PdI > 0.4). Lastly, zeta-potential analysis of the samples revealed that the oleic acid controls garnered a negative zeta-potential greater than -70 mV.

The photophysical characterization combined with structural, surface and chemical inquiries (XRD, XPS, FTIR) along with DFT calculations revealed the fundamental reasons for RTP, associated with the interactions between cellulose, hemicelluloses and the residual lignin. Multiple emissive oxygen-containing clusters and aromatic chromophores in the B-fibers were shown to be RTP-active (wavelengths going from 450 to 530 nm at an increased excitation from 240 to 360 nm). Green afterglow with a lifetime of 294.9 ms (excitation wavelength = 270 nm) was observed while blue fluorescence and long-lived yellow-green RTP took place under 365 nm irradiation.

The democratization of high-quality chemistry education faces several challenges, including heterogeneity among sub-fields, limited access to personalized guidance, and an uneven distribution of resources.

For validation purposes the models were tested on an external data set of chlorinated compounds. In addition, models were further applied to an external test set of monomeric units representing polymers to assess the capability of the model to estimate the biodegradability of polymers, where the models showed statistical robustness. The developed SVR model could be used for accurate prediction of biodegradability of various organic molecules, as well as materials based on organic compounds.

Here, we report a coupling between simple alkenes, heteroarenes and unactivated aliphatic aldehydes via an electrochemically induced reductive activation of C\u2013C \u03c0 bonds.

Nevertheless, the faint luminescence significantly constrains the mechanism exploration of biomolecules as well as their practical applications. We here report a serendipitous finding of synergetic PL enhancement by coupling both weakly emissive nonaromatic amino acids and sugars via glycosidic bonds. Namely, glycosylation drastically boosted the quantum yields of nonaromatic amino acids from 0.3% to as high as 9.2%, accompanied by the emergence of pro-nounced persistent room temperature phosphorescence (p-RTP). This synergistic PL enhancement arises from the ingenious integration of the electron-rich oxygen clusters present in sugar with the charge separation characteristics of amino acids. Driven by amino acids, ample electrons supplied by the sugar rings are directionally induced to promote electron delocaliza-tion, as well as subsequently enhanced absorption, resulting in a more efficient excitation process. Furthermore, the ultrafast femtosecond to nanosecond transient absorption (fs-TA, ns-TA) spectroscopy and theoretical calculations further reveal the importance of hybridization of the locally excited (LE) and the charge transfer (CT) states for PL enhancement and p-RTP features.

We tested symmetric cells of anthraquinone disulfonic acid (AQDS) with Nafion membranes of varied thickness and manufacture (NR211, NR212, N115, and N117, ranging 25\u2013183 \u03bcm).

However, we observed increased capacity fade with increased permeability through pretreated membranes. Supported by zero-dimensional modeling and operando UV-vis spectrophotomety, we propose a mechanism for net crossover in AQDS symmetric cells based on a higher time-averaged concentration of quinhydrone dimers in the non-capacity limiting side (NCLS) compared to the capacity limiting side (CLS), driving net crossover of AQDS reactants out of the CLS.

Limitations were identified for components that did not meet the acceptance criteria (e.g., inability for isomer differentiation).

Here, we show how nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, relaxometry, and diffusometry enable monitoring of heterogeneous deconstruction of a model elastomer with acid-cleavable diketoenamine bonds. In chaotropic aqueous HBr, polydiketoenamine (PDK) deconstruction is fast, enabled by macro- and micro-scale swelling in early stages, which facilitates acid penetration and protonation of reaction sites deep within the polymer sample. We observe a previously unrecognized hydrogen-bond stabilized protonated amine intermediate that is persistent throughout deconstruction, and found a strong correlation of its reactivity with swelling and chain kinetics. In kosmotropic aqueous H2SO4, PDK deconstruction is notably slower. Swelling occurred at a more gradual pace, creating a porous polymer matrix, yet polymer chain mobility remained low. Most notably, the kosmotropic character of aqueous H2SO4 resulted in a reaction site that was comparably less active in advancing hydrolysis and deconstruction to shorter oligomer chains, instead trapping acid in matrix pores and modifying the activity of the reaction medium under confinement in the process.", "date": "2024-06-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Electrochemical characterizations such as galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic performance, and rate capability studies show that the 0.1-NCM811 material can effectively tailor the electrochemical performance of the cathode in LIBs.

Electrochemical performance tests under industrial relevant conditions with 30 wt% KOH at 85 \u00b0C tested at 200-500 mA cm-2 for up to two weeks, showed a reduction in cell voltage up to 0.4 V for modified electrodes, corresponding to 18% higher efficiency for overall water splitting, as compared to pristine nickel foam.

Structural and compositional analyses of the modified nickel foam electrodes were conducted using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Rays (EDX) analysis and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analysis revealed the presence of Ni3S2 with a film thickness of 1-4 \u03bcm after H2S treatment. Extended reaction times showed continuous reaction and the emergence of NiS.

Herein, a series of bilayered V2O5 host materials pillared with alkyldiamine molecules of different lengths is systematically studied, resulting in tunable nanoconfinement geometry with  interlayer spacings in the range of 1.0-1.9 nm. The electrochemical Li+ intercalation capacity is increased from approx. 1 to 1.5 Li+ per V2O5 in expanded host materials, and the intercalation kinetics improve with larger expansion.

This enhancement can be attributed to improved efficiency of photogenerated charges transfer to the photocatalyst's surface where redox processes occur.

However, the spectral congestion of tandem mass spectra of large polypeptides dramatically complicates fragment ion assignment. Here, we report the development and benchmark of an MD MS strategy based on the combination of different ion fragmentation techniques with proton transfer charge reduction (PTCR) to simplify the gas-phase sequencing of mAb subunits. Applied on the liquid chromatography time scale using an Orbitrap Tribrid mass spectrometer, PTCR produces easy-to-interpret mass spectra with limited ion signal overlap. We demonstrate that the accurate estimation of the number of charges submitted to the Orbitrap mass analyzer after PTCR allows for the detection of charge-reduced product ions over a wide mass-over-charge (m/z) window with low parts per million m/z accuracy. Therefore, PTCR-based MD MS analysis increases not only sequence coverage, number of uniquely identified fragments and number of assigned complementary ion pairs, but also the general confidence in the assignment of subunit fragments. This data acquisition method can be readily applied to any class of mAbs without an apparent need for optimization, and benefits from the high resolving power of the Orbitrap mass analyzer to return sequence coverage of individual subunits exceeding 80% in a single run, and >90% when just two experiments are combined.

Payload attachment to cysteine or lysine residues can often result in product heterogeneity regarding both the number of attached drug molecules and their conjugation site, necessitating the use of state-of-the-art MS instrumentation to elucidate their complexity. In middle-down mass spectrometry (MD MS), the gas-phase sequencing of ~25 kDa ADC subunits with dif-ferent ion activation techniques generally produces rich fragmentation mass spectra; however, spectral congestion can cause some fragment ions to go undetected, includ-ing those that can pinpoint the exact location of payload conjugation sites. Proton transfer charge reduction (PTCR) can substantially simplify fragment ion spectra, thereby unveiling the presence of product ions whose signals were previously sup-pressed. Herein, we present an MD MS strategy relying on the use of PTCR to investi-gate a cysteine-based ADC mimic with a variable drug-to-antibody ratio, targeting the unambiguous localization of payload conjugation sites. Unlike traditional tandem MS experiments (MS2), which could not provide a full map of conjugation sites, a single PTCR-based experiment (MS3) proved to be sufficient to achieve this goal across all variably modified ADC subunits, including isomeric ones.

Here, we designed a microfluidic flow setup wherein a polyelectrolyte reaction network is maintained under out-of-equilibrium conditions using pH gradients. The network, comprises two weakly charged polyelectrolytes (polyallylamine, PAH, and polyacrylic acid, PAA) in solution and one immobilized on the surface (poly-L-lysine, PLL). We chose PAH and PAA as their complexation process is known to be history dependent (i.e., the preceding state of the system can determine the next state).

The role of the surface is further exploited to demonstrate that the network can enable event-driven processing. Overall, this work established that reversible switching between the assembled and disassembled state of polyelectrolytes can exploited to modulate signals encoded in the frequency and duration of pH pulses.

However, TERT also serves multiple enzyme-dependent and -independent functions to support cell growth and survival, including enhanced DNA damage response. Agents that inhibit TERT reverse transcriptase activity prevent telomere elongation but may fail to limit other TERT functions that mediate cancer therapy resistance. Thus, we applied structure-based design, modular synthesis, and biochemical assays toward developing a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) to drive proteasomal degradation of TERT in cancer cells. This yielded NU-PRO-1, a PROTAC linking the TERT active site-targeted covalent inhibitor NU-1 to the VHL E3-ligase ligand (S,R,S)-AHPC. Applied to cancer cells, NU-PRO-1 induced transient VHL- and proteasome-dependent TERT degradation. NU-PRO-1 did not induce DNA damage on its own but acted to further delay DNA repair after irradiation compared to NU-1.

We use vapor phase Hofmann elimination of tert-butylamine (TBA) to systematically investigate how solvents participate catalyzed reaction over Br\u00f8nsted acid sites of solid acid catalysts and affect a catalytic cycle. Twenty commonly used organic and inorganic solvents were tested to investigate the relationship between solvent identity and their influence on reaction kinetics. Kinetic measurements showed a significant and reversible inhibition in rates of Hofmann elimination in the presence of every tested solvent, with the degrees of reduction vary from less than 10% for non-polar solvents (carbon dioxide, benzene, hexane) to more than 90 % (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, acetonitrile), which was found to exhibit a roughly linear against the molecular dipole moment of solvents. Additionally, the degree of reduction is not affected by the size of molecule as the carbon chain length increases, but is negatively related to the degree of substitution by alkyl group on the \u03b1-carbon as well as halogen atom on the \u03b2-carbon. Despite the significant kinetic inhibition and a 30 kJ mol-1 increase in the measured apparent activation energies, the temperature programmed surface reaction profiles performed with pre-adsorbed TBA with feeding of acetonitrile and methanol showed no change in the peak temperature from the catalyst without solvent feed. Cooperative adsorption complex formed between the surface tert-butylammonium and solvent molecule adsorbed on a neighboring framework oxygen, which is far less reactive towards Hofmann elimination, is proposed to be responsible for the observed rate inhibition.

Conventional understanding considers deliquescence of nanosized hygroscopic aerosol particles a nearly instantaneous solid to liquid phase transition. However, the nanoscale dynamics of water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence remain obscure due to a lack of high spatial and temporal resolution single particle measurements. Here we use real time in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of individual sodium chloride (NaCl) nanoparticles to demonstrate that water adsorption and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence is a multistep dynamic process. Water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution was investigated for lab generated NaCl aerosols and found to occur in three distinct stages as a function of increasing RH. First, a < 100 nm water layer adsorbed on the NaCl cubes and caused sharp corners to dissolve and truncate. The water layer grew to several hundred nanometers with increasing RH and was rapidly saturated with solute, as evidenced by halting of particle dissolution. Adjacent cube corners displayed second-scale curvature fluctuations with no net particle dissolution or water layer thickness change. We propose that droplet solute concentration fluctuations drove NaCl transport from regions of high local curvature to regions of low curvature. Finally, we observed coexistence of a liquid water droplet and aerosol particle immediately prior to deliquescence.

Disulfide bonds exacerbate this issue because of the need to cleave both the S-S and backbone bonds to liberate sequence informative fragments. Although electron-based ion activation techniques such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD) have been proven to rupture disulfide bonds in whole protein ions, they still struggle to produce extensive sequencing when multiple, concatenated S-S bonds are present on the same large polypeptide chain. Here, we evaluate the increase in sequence coverage obtained by combining activated-ion ETD (AI-ETD) and proton transfer charge reduction (PTCR) in the analysis of 66 kDa human serum albumin, which holds 17 disulfide bridges. We also describe the combination of AI-ETD with supplemental post-activation of the ETD reaction products via higher-energy collisional dissociation \u2013 a hybrid fragmentation method termed AI-EThcD. AI-EThcD leads to a further improvement compared to AI-ETD in both the global number of cleaved backbone bonds and the number of ruptured backbone bonds from disulfide protected regions. Our results also demonstrate that the full potential of AI-ETD and AI-EThcD is unveiled only when combined with PTCR: reduction in overlap of ion signals leads to a sequence coverage as high as 39% in a single experiment, highlighting the relevance of spectral simplification in top-down mass spectrometry of large proteins.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain one of the most accurate methods to predict ensembles quantitatively, although the accuracy is governed by the underlying force field. In this work, we benchmark four different force fields for their application to macrocycles by performing replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) simulations of eleven macrocyclic compounds and comparing the obtained conformational ensembles to nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) upper distance bounds from NMR experiments. Especially, the modern force fields OpenFF 2.0 and XFF yield good results, outperforming force fields like GAFF2 and OPLS/AA.

Compared to other drug delivery systems, state-of-the-art MOFs can encapsulate up to 50 times higher quantities of drugs per unit of mass while showing very long release times. Nevertheless, for their translation into clinical applications, concerns regarding MOF biocompatibility necessitate comprehensive mitigation. Unfortunately, experiments are resource and time-intensive, while modeling approaches fail to capture the behavior of MOFs in intricate biological systems. Herein, we report a novel computational pipeline guided by machine learning (ML) for probing the biocompatibility of MOFs. The pipeline is designed to expedite the assessment of potential MOF toxicity based on the chemical properties of their precursors. Interpretable ML models were built on a database of over 35,000 organic molecules, predicting the potential toxicity of MOF linkers with 83% accuracy. Additionally, we established a comprehensive database cataloging the toxicity of MOF metallic centers. Leveraging these, we have screened the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) containing 86,000 non-disordered MOFs, identifying existing and future promising candidates with minimal toxicity profiles for drug delivery applications. Beyond high-throughput screening, the developed models shed light on the chemical landscape associated with high biocompatibility precursor molecules, enabling the derivation of guidelines for the rational design of biocompatible MOFs. This framework thus expedites the identification of biocompatible materials, while facilitating deeper insights into their underlying chemistry.

Costa", "abstract": "Halogenation is a commonly used strategy in drug design, not only due to the improvement of ADME properties of the compounds but also due to the ability of halogens to engage in halogen bonds (XBs) with biological targets such as proteins. The prediction of binding free energies (\\dGbind{}) is paramount in drug development, and, in this context, MM-PBSA calculations are a fast and commonly used method to achieve such a task. However, the usage of parameters to describe halogen anisotropy, such as extra-points of charge (EPs) that allow for the sampling of XBs, in MM-PBSA calculations is not common. Despite the recent development of optimized radii for halogens (r$_{opt}$), compatible with EP implementations, providing accurate hydration free energies at the PBSA level, the impact of these parameters in the calculation of binding free energies (\\dGbind{}) on protein-ligand complexes was yet to be tackled. In this work, we evaluated the performance of r$_{opt}$ in the estimation of \\dGbind{} values using MM-PBSA calculations for three sets of CK2 inhibitors. for which the experimental binding energies are available. We tested the performance of three EP models and standard RESP charges (i.e. when no EP is added), along with the effect of the internal dielectric constant ($\\epsilon$_{\\textnormal{in}}$) and sampling time. Our results indicate that, while directly using the X-ray structure does not typically lead to good results, relaxation through MM minimization, especially with $\\epsilon$_{\\textnormal{in}}$ = 4, leads to very decent correlations with the experimental values. Better correlations were achieved when adding configurational sampling via MD simulations, though, the Pearson coefficients varied substantially with sampling time and PBSA setup used, indicating that longer sampling times do not necessarily lead to higher correlations with experimental values.

This system has recently been experimentally investigated and shown to act as a highly efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis, if and only if it is alternately exposed first to N2 and then to H2 in a chemical looping process. Our simulations reveal that when first exposed to N2, BaH2 undergoes a profound change and it is transformed into a superionic mixed compound, BaH(2-2x)(NH)x, characterized by a high mobility of both hydrides and imides.

However, recent studies have identified these lamps as a source of ozone and other secondary pollutants such as secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and the health effects of these pollutants must be balanced against the benefits of pathogen inactivation. While ozone reactions are likely to account for much of this secondary indoor air pollution, 222 nm light may initiate additional non-ozone chemical processes, including the formation of other oxidants and direct photolytic reactions, which are not as well understood. This work examines the impacts of GUV222 light on SOA formation and composition by comparing limonene oxidation under GUV222 and O3-only control conditions in a laboratory chamber. Differences between these experiments enable us to distinguish patterns in aerosol formation driven by ozone chemistry from those driven by other photolytic processes. These experiments also examine the influence of the addition of NO2 and nitrous acid (HONO), and investigate SOA formation in sampled outdoor air. SOA composition and yield vary only slightly with respect to GUV222 vs ozone-only conditions; NO2 and HONO photolysis do not appreciably affect the observed chemistry. In contrast, we observe consistent new particle formation under high-fluence 222 nm light (45 \u00b5W cm-2) that differs dramatically from ozone-only experiments.

Inhibiting \u03b3-CAs presents a potential target for novel antituberculosis drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Objective: This study aimed to explore the biological connections underlying Mtb pathogenesis and investigate the mechanistic actions of antituberculosis compounds targeting the Cas9 protein. Methods: We employed homology modeling and virtual screening to identify compounds with high binding affinities for Cas9 protein. This study used the homology modeling approach employing high-quality AlphaFold DB models for \u03b3-CA. Furthermore, the systems biology approach was used for analyzing the mechanistic modeling of compounds, integrating data on genes, pathways, phenotypes, and molecular descriptors.

During an attempt to measure an X-ray crystal structure of a tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylated bicyclopentane synthesized in our laboratory, we discovered that the crystals jump and forcefully disintegrate upon cooling below ~193 K.  Accordingly, we investigated the origin of this cryogenic mechanical response (CMR) through NMR, SC-XRD, DSC, Raman, Brillouin, and microscopy experiments.  To our surprise, NMR, SC-XRD, and DSC experiments suggest the phenomenon can neither be attributed to a chemical transformation nor a crystalline-crystalline or crystalline-amorphous phase transition.  Rather, microscopy, Raman, and Brillouin experiments provide evidence that the built-up strain released from the crystal upon self-destruction may be associated with a phase transition that occurs in amorphous microstructure within the crystal.

Additionally, master plot analysis suggests that dissolution by microwave energy supply follows a contracting cylinder model, while ultrasonic energy supply aligns with a 2D diffusion or third-order kinetic model.

These foams demonstrate utility for capturing-sensing gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), as well as for detecting and quantifying various metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+).

Here, using the potentiodynamic technique of cyclic voltammetry, interfacial electrosynthesis involving ion-exchange, electron transfer, and proton adsorption charge transfer processes is shown to be mechanistically distinct from CP electropolymerisation at a solid electrode|electrolyte interface. The applied interfacial Galvani potential difference controls the interfacial concentration of the oxidant, EDOT monomers and oligomers, but not the CP redox state.

A recent study (Gensler, W.  {\\it Plant Signal. Behav.} {\\bf 2019}, {\\it 14}, e1548878), however, suggested that the enhancement of mechanical properties by callose might be partly due to its ability to order neighboring water molecules, resulting in the formation, up to room temperature and beyond, of solid-like water-callose domains. This hypothesis is tested by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, using ad-hoc models consisting of callose and cellulose chains forming networks (gels) in water, spanning a wide range of polysaccharide-water concentrations. The simulation results highlight systematic differences in the coordination and H-bonding of callose and cellulose by water. These structural differences are reflected in the different dynamical properties of water in samples made of callose or cellulose in water, to some extent validating the water-ordering hypothesis. However, mechanical properties, characterised by the computation of the Young's modulus of the polysaccharide / water gels, are nearly the same in the callose/water and in the cellulose/water samples, lending support to the view that callose's ability to link cellulose nanofibres into networks is the main mechanism underlying the strengthening of the plant cell wall.

Spectra are simulated using three exchange-correlation functionals, comprising the GGA functional PBE, the DFT-PBE + Hubbard U method and the meta-GGA functional rSCAN.

A widely adopted computational approach frames synthesis prediction as a sequence-to-sequence translation task, using the common SMILES representation for molecules. Current evaluation of machine learning methods for retrosynthesis assume perfect training data, overlooking imperfections in reaction equations in popular datasets, such as missing reactants, products, other physical and practical constraints such as temperature and cost, primarily driven by a focus on the target molecule. This limitation leads to an incomplete representation of viable synthetic routes, especially when multiple sets of reactants can yield a given desired product. In response to these shortcomings, this study examines the prevailing evaluation methods and introduces comprehensive metrics designed to address imperfections in the dataset. Our novel metrics not only assess absolute accuracy by comparing predicted outputs with ground truth but also introduce a nuanced evaluation approach. We provide scores for partial correctness and compute adjusted accuracy through graph matching, acknowledging the inherent complexities of retrosynthetic pathways.

Lewis", "abstract": "Organohalogen compounds are extensively used as building blocks, intermediates, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals due to their unique chemical and biological properties. Installing halogen substituents, however, frequently requires functionalized starting materials and multistep functional group interconversion. Several classes of halogenases evolved in nature to enable halogenation of a different classes of substrates; for example, site-selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic compounds is catalyzed by flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs). Mechanistic studies have shown that these enzymes use FADH2 to reduce O2 to water with concomitant oxidation of X- to HOX (X = Cl, Br, I). This species travels through a tunnel within the enzyme to access the FDH active site. Here, it is believed to interact with an active site lysine proximal to bound substrate, enabling electrophilic halogenation with selectivity imparted via molecular recognition, rather than directing groups or strong electronic activation.\n\nThe unique selectivity of FDHs led to several early biocatalysis efforts, preparative halogenation was rare, and the hallmark catalyst-controlled selectivity of FDHs did not translate to non-native substrates. FDH engineering was limited to site-directed mutagenesis, which resulted in modest changes in site-selectivity or substrate preference. To address these limitations, we optimized expression conditions for the FDH RebH and its cognate flavin reductase (FRed), RebF. We then showed that RebH could be used for preparative halogenation of non-native substrates with catalyst-controlled selectivity. We reported the first examples in which the stability, substrate scope, and site selectivity of an FDH were improved to synthetically useful levels via directed evolution. X-ray crystal structures of evolved FDHs and reversion mutations showed that random mutations throughout the RebH structure were critical to achieving high levels of activity and selectivity on diverse aromatic substrates, and these data were used in combination with molecular dynamics simulations to develop predictive model for FDH selectivity. Finally, we used family-wide genome mining to identify a diverse set of FDHs with novel substrate scope and complementary regioselectivity on large, three-dimensionally complex compounds.\n\nThe diversity of our evolved and mined FDHs allowed us to pursue synthetic applications beyond simple aromatic halogenation. For example, we established that FDHs catalyze enantioselective reactions involving desymmetrization, atroposelective halogenation, and halocyclization. These results highlight the ability of FDH active sites to tolerate different substrate topologies. This utility was further expanded by our recent studies on the single component FDH/FRed, AetF. While we were initially drawn to AetF because it does not require a separate FRed, we found that it halogenates substrates that are not halogenated efficiently or at all by other FDHs and provides high enantioselectivity for reactions that could only be achieved using RebH variants after extensive mutagenesis. Perhaps most notably, AetF catalyzes site-selective aromatic iodination and enantioselective iodoetherification. Together, these studies highlight the origins of FDH engineering, the utility and limitations of the enzymes developed to date, and the promise of FDHs for an ever-expanding range of biocatalytic halogenation reactions.", "date": "2024-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we present and analyze simulated absorption and fluorescence spectra generated with combined ensemble-Franck-Condon approaches for three chromophore-solvent systems and compare them to standard ensemble and Franck-Condon spectra, as well as to experiment. Employing configurations obtained from ground and excited state ab initio molecular dynamics, three combined ensemble-Franck-Condon approaches are directly compared to each other to assess the accuracy and relative computational time. We find that the approach employing an average finite-temperature Franck-Condon lineshape generates spectra nearly identical to the direct summation of an ensemble of Franck-Condon spectra at one-fourth of the computational cost.

When the stereoinformation needs to be assigned to a group of atoms, widely used identifiers cannot describe axial and planar chirality due to the atom-centered description of a molecule. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel chemical identifier called the Molecular Barcode (MolBar).

In this approach, the 3D structure of fragments are normalized using a specialized force field and characterized by physically inspired matrices derived solely from atomic positions.

To overcome these analytical limitations, we present the development of the first combined targeted/untargeted LC-MS method, merging MRM-HR and SWATH experiments in one analytical run, making use of the Zeno technology for improved sensitivity. MRM transitions were optimized for 135 highly diverse toxicants including mycotoxins, plasticizers, PFAS, personal care products ingredients and industrial side products as well as potentially beneficial xenobiotics such as phytohormones.

However, because of the complexity of chemical space, such models often have difficulty extrapolating beyond the chemistry contained in the training set. Augmented model with quantum mechanical (QM) descriptors is anticipated to improve its generalizability. However, obtaining QM descriptors often requires CPU-intensive computational chemistry calculations. To identify when QM descriptors help graph neural networks predict chemical properties, we conduct a systematic investigation of the impact of atom, bond, and molecular QM descriptors on the performance of directed message passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) for predicting 16 molecular properties. The analysis surveys computational and experimental targets, classification and regression tasks, and varied dataset sizes from several hundred to hundreds of thousands of datapoints. Our results indicate that QM descriptors are mostly beneficial for D-MPNN performance on small datasets, provided that the descriptors correlate well with the targets and can be readily computed with high accuracy. Otherwise, using QM descriptors can add cost without benefit or even introduce unwanted noise that can degrade model performance. Strategic integration of QM descriptors with D-MPNN unlocks potential for physics-informed, data-efficient modeling with some interpretability that can streamline de novo drug and material designs. To facilitate the use of QM descriptors in machine learning workflows for chemistry, we provide a set of guidelines regarding when and how to best leverage QM descriptors, a high-throughput workflow to compute them, and an enhancement to Chemprop, a widely adopted open-source D-MPNN implementation for chemical property prediction.", "date": "2024-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Kilgour; David Clarke", "abstract": "<div>Top-down mass spectrometry has become an important technique for the identification of proteins and characterisation of chemical and posttranslational modifications. However, as the molecular mass of proteins increases intact mass determination and top-down fragmentation efficiency become more challenging due to the partitioning of the mass spectral signal into many isotopic peaks. In large proteins, this results in reduced sensitivity and increased spectral complexity and signal overlap. This phenomenon is a consequence of the natural isotopic heterogeneity of the elements which comprise proteins (notably 13C).  Here we present a bacterial recombinant expression system for the production of proteins depleted in 13C and 15N and use this strategy to prepare a range of isotopically depleted proteins. High resolution MS of isotope depleted proteins reveal dramatically reduced isotope distributions, which results in increases in sensitivity and deceased spectral complexity. We demonstrate that the monoisotopic signal is observed in mass spectra of proteins up to ~50 kDa. This allows confident assignment of accurate molecular mass, and facile detection of low mass modifications (such as deamidation). We outline the benefits of this isotope depletion strategy for top-down fragmentation. The reduced spectral complexity alleviates problems of signal overlap; the presence of monoisotopic signals allow more accurate assignment of fragment ions; and the dramatic increase in single-to-noise ratio (up to 7-fold increases) permits vastly reduced data acquisition times. Together, these compounding benefits allow the assignment of ca. 3-fold more fragment ions than analysis of proteins with natural isotopic abundances. Thus, more comprehensive sequence coverage can be achieved; we demonstrate near single amino-acid resolution of the 29 kDa protein carbonic anhydrase from a single top-down MS experiment. Finally, we demonstrate that the ID-MS strategy allows far greater sequence coverage to be obtained in time limited top-down data acquisitions \u2013 highlighting potential advantages for top-down LC-MS/MS workflows and top-down proteomics. </div><div><br /></div>", "date": "2018-10-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Mass Spectrometry; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We present CANDOCK, a novel docking algorithm that utilizes a hierarchical approach to reconstruct ligands from an atomic grid using graph theory and generalized statistical potential functions to sample chemical relevant ligand conformations. Our algorithm accounts for protein flexibility, solvent, metal ions and cofactors interactions in the binding pocket that are traditionally ignored by current methods. We evaluate the algorithm on the PDBbind and Astex proteins to show its ability to reproduce the binding mode of the ligands that is independent of the initial ligand conformation in these benchmarks. Finally, we identify the best selector and ranker potential functions, such that, the statistical score of best selected docked pose correlates with the experimental binding affinities of the ligands for any given protein target.

Leading terms in these forces are\noften modeled using polarizabilities and C<sub>n</sub> (n=6, 8, 9, 10 \u2026)\ndispersion coefficients. Force fields for classical atomistic simulations can\nbe constructed using atom-in-material dispersion coefficients and\npolarizabilities. This article addresses the key question of how to efficiently\nassign these parameters to constituent atoms in a material so that properties\nof the whole material are better reproduced. We develop a new set of scaling\nlaws and computational algorithms (called MCLF) to do this in an accurate and\ncomputationally efficient manner across diverse material types. We introduce a\nconduction limit upper bound and m-scaling to describe the different behaviors\nof surface and buried atoms. We validate MCLF by comparing results to\nhigh-level benchmarks for isolated neutral and charged atoms, diverse diatomic\nmolecules, various polyatomic molecules (e.g., polyacenes, fullerenes, and\nsmall organic and inorganic molecules), and dense solids (including metallic,\ncovalent, and ionic). MCLF provides the non-directionally screened\npolarizabilities required to construct force fields, the directionally-screened\nstatic polarizability tensor components and eigenvalues, and environmentally\nscreened C<sub>6</sub> coefficients. Overall, MCLF has improved accuracy and\nlower computational cost than the TS-SCS method. For TS-SCS, we compared charge\npartitioning methods and show DDEC6 partitioning yields more accurate results\nthan Hirshfeld partitioning.

The mechanical properties of glasses in general are of importance given their application in protective coatings, display technologies and screens. Little, however, is known about the mechanical behavior of MOF-glasses, and experimental elucidation of key properties such as their scratch resistance has been limited by the lack of processing methodologies capable of producing bulk glass samples. Here, nanoindentation was used to investigate the Young\u2019s modulus and hardness of four melt-quenched glasses formed from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF): agZIF-4, agZIF-62, agZIF-76 and agZIF-76-mbIm. The creep resistance of the melt-quenched glasses was studied via strain-rate jump (SRJ) tests, and through constant load and hold (CLH) indentation creep experiments. Values for the strain-rate sensitivity were found to be close to those for other glassy polymers and Se-rich GeSe chalcogenide glasses. One glass, agZIF-62, was used to explore two strategies for the preparation of bulk glass samples, i.e. (i) vacuum hot-pressing and (ii) remelting and annealing. Vacuum hot-pressing resulted in an inhomogeneous bulk sample containing the glass and amorphous, non-melt quenched aZIF-62. Remelting and annealing however, resulted in the fabrication of a transparent, bubble-free, bulk specimen, which allowed the first scratch testing experiments to be performed on a MOF-glass.

Although numerous transition metal oxides have been explored as OER catalysts, the scaling relationship of the binding energies of various surface-bound intermediates imposes a limit on the maximum activity of these oxides. While previous computational studies have suggested bifunctional catalysts might be capable of overcoming this limit, stable and non-precious catalysts of this type remain elusive. Here, we describe a catalyst that exhibits activity significantly higher than current state-of-the-art catalysts that operate in alkaline solutions, including the benchmark nickel iron oxide.

Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopic data reveal that the catalyst is made of nanoclusters of gamma-FeOOH covalently linked to the edge sites of a gamma-NiOOH support. According to density functional theory computations, this structure allows a reaction path involving iron as the oxygen evolving center and a nearby terrace O site on the gamma-NiOOH support oxide as a hydrogen acceptor.

However, uncovering these dynamic interactions and its synergic network effects still remains challenging in both experimental techniques and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we present a rational strategy that combines MD simulations and frequency-energy spectroscopy to identify and quantify the role of non-covalent interactions in carrier transport through membrane protein channels, as encoded in traditional single channel recording or ionic current. We employed wild-type aerolysin transporting of methylcytosine and cytosine as a model to explore the dynamic ionic signatures with non-stationary and non-linear frequency analysis. Our data illuminate that methylcytosine experiences strong non-covalent interactions with the aerolysin nanopore at Region 1 around R220 than cytosine, which produces characteristic frequency-energy spectra. Furthermore, we experimentally validate the obtained hypothesis from frequency-energy spectra by designing single-site mutation of K238G which creates significantly enhanced non-covalent interactions for the recognition of methylcytosine. The frequency-energy spectrum of ions flowing inside membrane channels constitutes a single-molecule interaction spectrum, which bridges the gap between traditional ionic current recording and the MD simulations, facilitating the qualitative and quantitive description of the non-covalent interactions inside membrane channels.", "date": "2018-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The development of CIBs has been hindered by the failure of traditional graphite and calcium metal anodes due to the intercalation difficulty and lacking efficient electrolyte. Recently a high voltage (4.45 V) CIB cell using Sn as the anode was reported achieving a remarkable cyclability (> 300 cycles). The calciation of Sn was observed to end at Ca7Sn6, which is surprising, since higher Ca-content compounds are known (e.g. Ca2Sn). Here, we investigate computationally the Sn electrochemical calciation reaction process and explore the reaction driving force as a function of Ca content using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

This requires improving their capacitance. Unfortunately, predicting the capacitance of the carbon-based materials that typically make up supercapacitor electrodes is  difficult. For example, remarkably we lack a theoretical understanding of the capacitance of even the most basic example of a carbon electrode: highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. (HOPG) This material has a capacitance that is an order of magnitude lower than both standard metals and theoretical expectations. Here, we use new quantum mechanical calculations in combination with a critical analysis of the literature to demonstrate that the standard explanations of this unusually low capacitance are inadequate. We then demonstrate that a layer of hydrocarbon impurities which has recently been shown to form on graphite is the most plausible explanation. We develop a model of this effect which accounts for the penetration of solvent into the hydrocarbon layer as the voltage increases. This model explains the characteristic V shape of the capacitance as a function of voltage. Finally, we present evidence that this layer also forms and limits the capacitance in real supercapacitor materials such as activated carbon. Methods of modifying or removing this layer could therefore potentially lead to significant improvements in the capacitance of typical supercapacitors.", "date": "2018-10-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Carbon-based Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

They are  intriguing platforms for the design of porous skeletons with special functionality at the molecular level. However, despite their extraordinary properties, it is difficult to control their electronic properties, thus hindering the potential implementation in electronic devices. A new form of nanoporous material, COFs intercalated with first row transition metal is proposed to address this fundamental drawback - the lack of electronic tunability. Using first-principles calculations, we have designed 31 new COF materials <i>in-silico</i> by intercalating all of the first row transition metals (TMs) with boroxine-linked and triazine-linked COFs: COF-TM-x (where TM=Sc-Zn and x=3-5). This is a significant addition considering that only 187 experimentally COFs structures has been reported and characterized so far. We have investigated their structure and electronic properties. Specifically, we predict that COF's band gap and density of states (DOSs) can be controlled by intercalating first row transition metal atoms (TM: Sc - Zn) and fine tuned by the concentration of TMs. We also found that the $d$-subshell electron density of the TMs plays the main role in determining the electronic properties of the COFs. Thus intercalated-COFs provide a new strategy to control the electronic properties of materials within a porous network. This work opens up new avenues for the design of TM-intercalated materials with promising future applications in nanoporous electronic devices, where a high surface area coupled with fine-tuned electronic properties are desired.</div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Coordination polymers; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, systematic experimental studies of isotypic frameworks with different extra-framework content often face several challenges, such as limited quality of the diffraction data and non-ideal behavior of the pressure-transmitting medium. In order to provide an alternative computational perspective, the compressional behavior of four fluoroaluminophosphate zeolite analogues with a chabazite (CHA) topology was investigated using electronic structure calculations in the framework of dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT). The AlPO-CHA systems differ in the nature of the organic template molecule occupying the chabazite cage, with the template species being morpholinium (morph), pyridinium (pyr), dimethylimidazolium (DMI), and trimethylimidazolium (TMI), respectively. For the case of AlPO-CHA_morph, the evolution of the lattice parameters with pressure as obtained from the computations was found to be in agreement with experimental data from an earlier in-situ diffraction investigation. In particular, the occurrence of a structural transition at pressures above 3 GPa could be reproduced. An analysis of the DFT-optimized structures showed that a pronounced elongation of the chabazite cage occurs upon the transition, which is associated with a rearrangement of the morpholinium molecules residing in the cage. Moreover, the double six-ring building units are strongly deformed during the transition. Analogous computations for the other three AlPO-CHA systems showed no indications for the occurrence of a P-induced transition, with only minor discontinuities in the evolution of the structural parameters with pressure. The compressibility in the low-pressure range varied widely depending on the template, with bulk moduli ranging from 19 GPa for AlPO-CHA_pyr to 51 GPA for AlPO-CHA_TMI. Despite the identical composition of the framework, different deformations of the double six-ring units with pressure were observed. The present study highlights the important influence of the template on the compressional behavior of porous framework compounds. Firstly, the molecular volume of the template and the nature of the framework-template interactions impact upon the compressibility in the low-pressure regime. Secondly, the ability of the template to accommodate pressure through continuous rotation and shortening of template-template and framework-template distances determines whether a discontinuous structural transition occurs or not.", "date": "2018-10-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Solid State Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To illustrate the potentiality of this approach, which could bring substantial added value to the CO2 capture and utilization chain value, bimetallic separation was conducted directly from exhaust gas of an internal combustrion engine vehicle, and the three constituents of the alloys used to produce the cathodes of electric vehicles were separated and recovered by successive CO2-induced selective precipitations.

Despite progress toward automated force field parameterization, considerable human expertise is required to develop or extend force fields. </div><div>In particular, human input has long been required to define <i>atom types</i>, which encode chemically unique environments that determine which parameters must be assigned. However, relying on humans to establish atom types is suboptimal: the resulting atom types are often unjustified from a statistical perspective, leading to over- or under-fitting; they are difficult to extend in a systematic and consistent manner when new chemistries must be modeled or new data becomes available; and human effort is not scalable when force fields must be generated for new (bio)polymers or materials. We aim to replace human specification of atom types with an automated approach, based on solid statistics and driven by experimental and/or quantum chemical reference data. Here, we describe a novel technology for this purpose, termed <i>SMARTY</i>, which generalizes atom typing by using direct chemical perception with SMARTS strings, and adopting a hierarchical approach to type assignment. The SMARTY technology enables creation of a move set in atom-typing space that can be used in a Monte Carlo optimization approach to atom typing. We demonstrate the power of this approach with a fully automated procedure that is able to re-discover human-defined atom types in the traditional small molecule force field parm99/parm@Frosst. Furthermore, we show how an extension of this approach that makes use of SMIRKS strings to match multiple atoms, which we term <i>SMIRKY</i>, allows us to take full advantage of the advances in direct chemical perception for valence types (bonds, angles, and torsions) afforded by the recently-proposed SMIRNOFF direct chemical perception force field typing language.

However, water and co-ion transport (i.e., osmosis and salt diffusion / fuel crossover) also impact energy efficiency by allowing uncontrolled mixing of the electrolyte solutions to occur. For example, in RED with hypersaline water sources, uncontrolled mixing consumes 20-50% of the available mixing energy. Thus, in addition to high selectivity and high conductivity, it is desirable for IEMs to have low permeability to water and salt in order to minimize energy losses. Unfortunately, there is very little quantitative water and salt permeability information available for commercial IEMs, making it difficult to select the best membrane for a particular application. Accordingly, we measured the water and salt transport properties of 20 commercial IEMs and analyzed the relationships between permeability, diffusion and partitioning according to the solution-diffusion model. We found that water and salt permeance vary over several orders of magnitude among commercial IEMs, making some membranes better-suited than others to electrochemical processes that involve high salt concentrations and/or concentration gradients. Water and salt diffusion coefficients were found to be the principal factors contributing to the differences in permeance among commercial IEMs. We also observed that water and salt permeability were highly correlated to one another for all IEMs studied, regardless of polymer type or reinforcement. This finding suggests that transport of mobile salt in IEMs is governed by the microstructure of the membrane, and provides clear evidence that mobile salt does not interact strongly with polymer chains in highly-swollen IEMs. <br />", "date": "2018-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer chains; Electrochemical Analysis; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

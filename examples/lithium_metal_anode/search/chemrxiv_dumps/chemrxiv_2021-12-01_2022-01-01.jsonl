Excess electrons injected into liquid methanol are most likely trapped by methyl groups, but rapidly diffuse to more stable trapping sites with dangling OH bonds. After localization at the sites with one free OH bond (1OH trapping sites), reorientation of other methanol molecules increases the OH coordination number and the trap depth, and ultimately four OH bonds become coordinated with the excess electrons under thermal conditions. The simulation identified four distinct trapping states with different OH coordination numbers. The simulation results also revealed that electronic transitions of e\u2212met are primarily due to charge transfer between electron trapping sites (cavities) formed by OH and methyl groups and that these transitions differ from hydrogenic electronic transitions involving aqueous solvated electrons (e\u2212aq). Such charge transfer also explains the alkyl-chain-length dependence of the photoabsorption peak wavelength and the excited-state lifetime of solvated electrons in primary alcohols.\n", "date": "2021-12-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To improve the purity of the product and the activity and recyclability of the catalyst, we prepared a Pd/Fe magnetic bimetallic catalyst supported on N-doped carbon materials to reduce nitrobenzene to aniline under mild conditions.

In this work, we have developed a novel solution combustion technique for the synthesis of BaSnO3 nanoparticles. A peroxo/superoxo precursor to the nanoparticles is first synthesized by co-precipitation of the tin and barium salts via the H2O2 assisted or the `CSMC' route. The phase evolution, under different drying conditions of the wet precursor to crystalline BaSnO3 nanoparticles is then studied. We find that the crystallization temperature of BaSnO3 is significantly reduced by adding an organic solvent such as ethanol or propanol to the precursor; temperatures as low as 130 \u00b0C yield phase pure BaSnO3 nanoparticles. We establish that the organic solvent increases the reactive O2 ligand content, which plays a pivotal role in the synthesis. Due to this, an exothermic reaction occurs around 130 \u00b0C, thereby providing the heat of reaction for conversion of the precursor to phase-pure BaSnO3. Importantly, this method should also allow for the facile incorporation of dopants, paving the way for synthesis of high FOM TCs at low temperatures. Such low synthesis temperatures enable BaSnO3 to be used in devices having temperature limitations during device processing, such as heterojunction Si solar cells or perovskite-based solar cells in an n-i-p architecture.", "date": "2021-12-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Energy; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Photovoltaics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In cancerous cells, Hsp90 expression is elevated, thereby contributing in exerting anti-apoptotic effects, which is essential for the malignant transformation and progression of several tumor types. Most of the Hsp90 inhibitors (Hsp90i) under investigation target the ATP binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Hsp90. However, adverse effects, including induction of the pro-survival resistance mechanism (heat shock response or HSR) and associated dose-limiting toxicity, have so far precluded clinical approval of these Hsp90i. In contrast, modulators that interfere with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 do not inflict HSR and, thus, emerge as a promising alternative approach to target Hsp90. Since the CTD dimerization of Hsp90 is essential for its chaperone activity, interfering with this essential dimerization process by small-molecule protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors is a promising strategy for anticancer drug research. We have developed the first-in-class small molecule inhibitor (5b) targeting the Hsp90 CTD dimerization interface, based on a tripyrimidonamide scaffold through structure-based molecular design, chemical synthesis, binding mode model prediction, assessment of the biochemical affinity and efficacy against therapy-resistant leukemia cells. 5b reduces xenotransplantation of leukemia cells in zebrafish models and induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL1+ (T315I) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistant leukemia cells, without inducing HSR.", "date": "2021-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The particular structure of the Mo6S8 phase, with rather loosely connected cluster entities, points to the important role of dispersion forces in this material. However, so far this aspect has been completely neglected in the discussion of Mo6S8 as cathode material for mono- and multivalent-ion batteries. In this work we therefore have studied the impact of dispersion forces on stability and kinetics of Mo6S8 intercalation compounds. For this purpose, a series of charge carriers (Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Zn, Al) has been investigated. Interestingly, dispersion forces are observed to only slightly affect the lattice spacing of the chevrel phase, nevertheless having a significant impact on insertion voltage and in particular on the charge carrier mobility in the material. Moreover, upon varying the charge carriers in the chevrel phase, their diffusion barriers are observed to scale linearly with the ion size, almost independent of the charge of the considered ions. This indicates a rather unique and geometry dominated diffusion mechanism in the chevrel phase. The consequences of these findings for the ion mobility in the chevrel phase will be carefully discussed.", "date": "2021-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and Dynamic Light Scattering, we map out the pH-dependent binding affinity of the ligands towards hafnium oxide nanocrystals (an NMR compatible model system). Carboxylic acids easily desorb in water from the surface and only provide limited colloidal stability from pH 2 \u2013 6.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant attention as platforms for catalysis at site-isolated, interstitial catalyst sights. Unlike homogeneous catalysis, relatively few strategies have been advanced to evaluate the origin of catalytic activity in MOF-promoted reactions. Many of the MOFs that have been examined as potential catalysts are comprised of molecular constituents that represent viable catalysts in the absence of the extended MOF lattice, and thus interfacial sites and leached homogeneous species represent potential sources of catalyst activity. Here, we demonstrate that analysis of deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and olefin epoxidation diastereoselectivity provides direct probes of the origin of catalytic activity in MOF-promoted oxidation reactions.

Most of the recent research on electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction (CO2R) focuses on achieving maximum selectivity for desired products at the highest possible current density. This approach assumes that maximising current density leads to the lowest cost of CO2R (e.g. $\u00b7kg-1 CO2 converted) because it requires the lowest catalyst loadings and electrode area per kg of CO2 treated and thus minimising the electrolyser equipment cost. Using a techno-economic analysis (TEA) model with experimental data from a two-cell vapor fed electrolyser, we show this assumption is not valid for CO2 conversion to CO if the process model accounts for relationships between current density, selectivity, cell voltage, ohmic losses, and product separation costs. Instead, our model predicts the lowest CO production costs at current densities from 500 \u2013 700 A\u00b7m-2. At current densities above 1000 A\u00b7m-2, growing ohmic losses in the electrolyser lead to increasing power costs that become much larger than any capital savings related to reduced electrode area at the higher current density. Further, we investigate different opportunities that could bring down the CO production cost, however, in all the cases, the lowest CO production cost was found at current densities between 600 \u2013 1400 A\u00b7m-2. This work also provides insights that can help identify feasible design spaces for both catalysts and electrolysers to develop CO2 conversion technologies that could soon compete on a cost basis with the natural reforming technologies to produce CO (0.60 $\u00b7kg-1 market price).", "date": "2021-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Reaction Engineering; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To this end, we adapt a Co(II)-catalyzed sulfite-based protocol enabling effective in situ deoxidization without deactivation of the enzyme. In the absence of proteinase K, the anaerobic conditions facilitate luminescence of BSA-AuNC reflected by a moderate increase in the red luminescence intensity. However, in the presence of proteinase K, we have observed a steeper decrease of emission intensity irrespective of whether the digestion was carried out under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. In both cases, the diminishing fluorescence occurred in phase with shifting of the emission maximum to longer wavelengths. These results contradict the previous hypothesis that protease-induced quenching of BSA-AuNC luminescence is a consequence of enhanced diffusion of oxygen to bare AuNC. Instead, aggregation of unprotected AuNCs and separation of nanoclusters from albumin\u2019s side chains involved in energy transfers and luminescence-promoting electron donors may underlie the observed sensitivity of BSA-AuNC to protease treatment. Our findings are discussed in the context of mechanisms of formation and photophysics of BSA-AuNC conjugates.", "date": "2021-12-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Biocompatible Materials; Imaging; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Such a concept has been well explored in biochemical and more recently, organometallic catalysis to ensure high reaction turnovers with minimal side reactions. However, a scarcity of theoretical framework towards confined organometallic chemistry impedes a broader utility for the implementation of compartmentalization. Herein, we report a general kinetic model and offer design guidance for a compartmentalized organometallic catalytic cycle. In comparison to a non-compartmentalized catalysis, compartmentalization is quantitatively shown to prevent the unwanted intermediate deactivation, boost the corresponding reaction efficiency (\u03b3), and subsequently increase catalytic turnover frequency (TOF). The key parameter in the model is the volumetric diffusive conductance (F_V) that describes catalysts\u2019 diffusion propensity across a compartment\u2019s boundary. Optimal values of F_V for a specific organometallic chemistry are needed to achieve maximal values of \u03b3 and TOF.

Simple and extended benzenoid aromatic systems have been very well established in undergraduate textbooks, and there are also mentions of non-benzenoid aromatic structures such as cyclopropenium, cyclopentadienide and cycloheptatrienylium (tropylium) ions. However, the structural relationship and the comparison of stabilization energy of such aromatic ions to benzene ring have been rarely studied and remained an underexplored area of advanced organic chemistry research. To contribute some insights into this topic, we focused on the chemical transformation, namely a ring contraction reaction, of the tropylium ion to benzene ring in this work. With an approach combining computational studies with experimental reactions, we also aim to turn this transformation into a synthetically useful tool. Indeed, this work led to the development of a new synthetic protocol, which involved an oxidative ring-contraction of tropylium ion, to formally introduce the phenyl ring onto a range of organic structures. Furthermore, the homoaromatic cycloheptatrienyl precursors of tropylium salts used in these reactions can also be rearranged to valuable benzhydryl or benzyl halides, enriching the synthetic utility of this ring-contraction protocol.

A deepened understanding of this phenomenon is central to elucidating the remarkable efficiency of natural enzymes, and provides an essential benchmark for enzyme design and engineering. Here, we study the functional interconnectedness of the catalytic nucleophile (His18) in an acid phosphatase by analyzing the consequences of its replacement with aspartate. We present crystallographic, biochemical and computational evidence for a conserved mechanistic pathway via a phospho-enzyme intermediate on Asp18. Linear free-energy relationships for phosphoryl transfer from phosphomonoester substrates to His18/Asp18 provide evidence for cooperative interplay between the nucleophilic and general-acid catalytic groups in the wildtype enzyme, and its substantial loss in the H18D variant. As an isolated factor of phosphatase efficiency, the advantage of a histidine compared to an aspartate nucleophile is around 10^4-fold. Cooperativity with the catalytic acid adds \u226510^2-fold to that advantage. Empirical valence bond simulations of phosphoryl transfer from glucose 1-phosphate to His and Asp in the enzyme explain the loss of activity of the Asp18 enzyme through a combination of impaired substrate positioning in the Michaelis complex, as well as a shift from early to late protonation of the leaving group in the H18D variant. The evidence presented furthermore suggests that the cooperative nature of catalysis distinguishes the enzymatic reaction from the corresponding reaction in solution and is enabled by the electrostatic preorganization of the active site.

Hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1) are classical off-targets and it is well recognized that their ability to interfere with a wide range of chemically unrelated drugs, environmental chemicals, or food additives can lead to unwanted adverse effects like liver toxicity, drug-drug or drug-food interactions.\nTherefore, the identification of novel (tool) compounds for hepatic OATPs by virtual screening approaches and subsequent experimental validation is a major asset for elucidating structure-function relationships of (related) transporters: they enhance our understanding about molecular determinants and structural aspects of hepatic OATPs driving ligand binding and selectivity.\nIn the present study, we performed a consensus virtual screening approach by using different types of machine learning models (proteochemometric models, conformal prediction models, and XGBoost models for hepatic OATPs), followed by molecular docking of preselected hits using previously established structural models for hepatic OATPs. Screening the diverse REAL drug-like set (Enamine) shows a comparable hit rate for OATP1B1 (36% actives) and OATP1B3 (32% actives), while the hit rate for OATP2B1 was even higher (66% actives).

In particular, to deepen understanding of how different systems respond to flows, it is crucial to comprehend the influence played by swimming pattern. In recent studies, pusher-type Janus particles exhibited cross-stream migration in externally applied flows.

However, we frequently observed that there is an evident shortcoming of IGM map in graphically studying weak interactions, that is its isosurfaces are usually too bulgy; in these cases, not only the graphical effect is poor, but also the color on some areas on the isosurfaces is inappropriate and may lead to erroneous analysis conclusions. In addition, the IGM method was originally proposed based on promolecular density, which is quite crude and does not take actual electronic structure into account. In this article, we first present a detailed overview of the IGM analysis, and then propose our new variant of IGM, namely IGM based on Hirshfeld partition of molecular density (IGMH), which replaces the free-state atomic densities involved in the IGM method with the atomic densities derived by Hirshfeld partition of actual molecular electron density. This change makes IGM have more rigorous physical background. In addition, we describe some indices defined on the top of IGM or IGMH framework to quantify contributions from various atoms or atom pairs to interaction between specific fragments. A large number of application examples in this article, including molecular and periodic systems, weak and chemical bond interactions, fully demonstrate the important value of IGMH in intuitively understanding interactions in chemical systems.

In previous work, we proposed a method named DrugEx, which can be applied in polypharmacology based on multi-objective deep reinforcement learning. However, the previous version is trained under fixed objectives similar to other known methods and does not allow users to input any prior information (i.e. a desired scaffold). In order to improve the general applicability, we updated DrugEx to design drug molecules based on scaffolds which consist of multiple fragments provided by users. In this work, the Transformer model was employed to generate molecular structures. The Transformer is a multi-head self-attention deep learning model containing an encoder to receive scaffolds as input and a decoder to generate molecules as output. In order to deal with the graph representation of molecules we proposed a novel positional encoding for each atom and bond based on an adjacency matrix to extend the architecture of the Transformer. Each molecule was generated by growing and connecting procedures for the fragments in the given scaffold that were unified into one model. Moreover, we trained this generator under a reinforcement learning framework to increase the number of desired ligands. As a proof of concept, our proposed method was applied to design ligands for the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) and compared with SMILES-based methods.

The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) has emerged as one of the main methods for the analysis of EIS spectra. Gaussian processes can be used to regress EIS data, quantify uncertainty, and deconvolve the DRT, but current implementations do not constrain the DRT to be positive and can only use the imaginary part of EIS spectra. Herein, we overcome both issues by using a finite Gaussian process approximation to develop a new framework called the finite Gaussian process distribution of relaxation times (fGP-DRT). The analysis on artificial EIS data shows that the fGP-DRT method consistently recovers exact DRT from noise-corrupted EIS spectra while accurately regressing experimental data. Furthermore, the fGP-DRT framework is used as a machine learning tool to provide probabilistic estimates of the impedance at unmeasured frequencies. The method is further validated against experimental data from fuel cells and batteries. In short, this work develops a novel probabilistic approach for the analysis of EIS data based on Gaussian process, opening a new stream of research for the deconvolution of DRT.

Compared to the wild type (WT), there are 15 mutations in the Omicron receptor-binding domain (RBD), 10 of which are in the receptor-binding motif (RBM), where the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interacts directly with. As a comparison, the currently dominant variant Delta (B.1.617.2) only has 2 mutations (L452R and T478K) or an additional E484K mutation in the RBM. As many as 15 mutations in Omicron RBD make it very hard to predict whether the mutations would increase the binding affinity to ACE2, particularly considering that 10 mutations crowded in the RBM. To understand the combinatorial mutation effect on Omicron RBD binding to ACE2 and potential immune evasion, we calculated the binding affinities of the WT/Delta/Omicron RBDs to ACE2 and antibodies with 600 ns molecular dynamics simulations for each system. We found that Omicron RBD has slightly weaker ACE2 affinities than WT RBD (-29.39 \u00b1 2.96 Kcal/mol vs. -33.13 \u00b1 3.26 Kcal/mol), and much lower affinities than Delta RBD (-42.76 \u00b1 2.38 Kcal/mol).

To physically isolate Cz and Bd, we synthesized Cz and Bd in the lab, separately. According to experimental results, we draw several important points. The first important point is that Bd and its derivatives commonly possess two groups of intrinsic phosphorescence bands, of which short-lifetime band at ~450 nm is assigned to the molecular phosphorescence of their neutral molecules and of which typical ultralong phosphorescence bands at 560 nm, 610 nm and 660 nm are assigned to their radical cations. Amazingly, PMMA films (1wt.%) of CNCzBdBr and CN2BdBr both demonstrate photo-activated room-temperature ultralong organic phosphorescence while this doesn\u2019t happen to Bd and CN3Bd. The second important point is that activation of ultralong phosphorescence from Bd derivatives involves three factors: well dispersion with limited amount in matrix, generation of Bd derivatives\u2019 radical cations and stabilizing radical cations mediated by matrix. Cz derivative can function as a matrix to activate (room temperature) ultralong organic phosphorescence of Bd derivative but its activation function can be replaced by other methods such as photo-activation. The third important point is that the photo-activated ultralong organic phosphorescence is closely related to molecular structure of Bd derivative and stability of its radical cation. The fourth important point is that for double-carbazole system with trace isomer its room temperature ultralong organic phosphorescence originates at least from synergistic effect of monosubstituted product and disubstituted product of Bd. Furthermore, it is discovered that several other matrixes can also activate room-temperature ultralong organic phosphorescence of Bd derivatives, further verifying the second important point. To our best knowledge, this study is a big breakthrough in ultralong organic phosphorescence and will probably open a new era for its development.", "date": "2021-12-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Cell surface glycans are highly heterogenous in length and glycosylation density, which leads to variation in the distance and rigidity with which IAV is held away from the cell membrane. To gain mechanistic insight into how receptor length and rigidity impact the mechanism of IAV entry, we employed synthetic DNA-lipids as highly tunable surrogate receptors. We tethered IAV to target membranes with a panel of DNA-lipids to investigate the effects of the distance and tether flexibility between virions and target membranes on the kinetics of IAV binding and fusion. Tether length and the presence of a flexible linker led to higher rates of IAV binding, while the efficiencies of lipid and content mixing were typically lower for longer and more rigid DNA tethers. For all DNA tether modifications, we found that the rates of IAV lipid and content mixing were unchanged. These results suggest that variations in the interface between IAV and a target membrane do not significantly impact the rate-limiting step of fusion, or the low-pH triggered engagement of viral fusion peptides with the target membrane. However, our results imply that the flexibility of the viral receptor is important for ensuring that hemifusion events are able to successfully proceed to pore formation.", "date": "2021-12-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However there may be some benefit to the decision being guided by those executing the process: typically, chemists have a clear idea where the retrosynthetic change should happen, but not how such a transformation is to be realized. Using a data-driven model, the retrosynthesis task can be further explored by giving chemists the option to explore specific disconnections. In this work, we design an approach to provide this option by adapting a transformer-based model for single-step retrosynthesis.

That\u2019s why, in addition to vaccination campaigns, the design of a drug to help in the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 is being investigated. In relation to SARS-CoV-2, one of its most studied proteins is the spike protein (S protein), which mediates host-cell entry and is heavily glycosylated. Regarding the latter, several investigations have been carried out, since it plays an important role in the evasion of the host's immune system and contributes to protein folding and the thermostability of the viral particle. For that reason, our objective was to evaluate the impact of glycosylations on the drug recognition on two domains of the S protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) through molecular dynamics simulations and computational biophysics analysis. Our results show that glycosylations in the S protein induce structural stability and changes in rigidity/flexibility related to the number of glycosylations in the structure. These structural changes are important for its biological activity as well as the correct interaction of ligands in the RBD and NTD regions. Additionally, we evidenced a roto-translation phenomenon in the interaction of the ligand with RBD in the absence of glycosylation, which disappears due to the influence of glycosylation and the convergence of metastable states in RBM. Similarly, glycosylations in NTD promote an induced-fit phenomenon, which is not observed in the absence of glycosylations; this process is decisive for the activity of the ligand at the cryptic site. Altogether, these results provide an explanation of glycosylation relevance in biophysical properties and drug recognition to S protein of SARS-CoV-2 which must be considered in the rational drug development and virtual screening targeting S protein.", "date": "2021-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate at much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2 stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2- redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in a loss in CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohols additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions to the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2 binding constant, the two key properties for eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrate a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10% to 100%, or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinones/alcohol combinations for specific CO2 capture applications.

Established schemes for chemical damage through crosslinking in irradiated silicone polymers comprised of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) date to the 1950's and correlate small-molecule off-gassing with specific crosslink features. In this regard, we use a  somewhat reductionist model to develop a general conditional probability and correlation analysis approach that tests these types of causal connections between proposed experimental observables to reexamine this chemistry through quantum-based molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations. Analysis of the QMD simulations suggests that the established reaction schemes are qualitatively reasonable, but lack strong causal connections under a broad set of conditions that would enable making direct quantitative connections between off-gassing and crosslinking. Further assessment of the QMD data uncovers a strong (but nonideal) quantitative connection between exceptionally hard-to-measure chain scission events and the formation of silanol (Si-OH) groups. Our analysis indicates that conventional notions of radiation damage to PDMS should be further qualified and not necessarily used ad hoc.

Here, we apply size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to study the stability of a tetrahedron DNA nanostructure (TDN) and demonstrate the analytical capabilities of our method in characterizing degradation by enzymes and a diluted human serum matrix. We show that SEC analysis can reliably assay TDN degradation by a nuclease through direct injection and peak integration.

However, an even larger and less predictable disparity in the band gap prediction is present for MOFs with open-shell 3d transition metal cations.

The strong electron-withdrawing triflyl group on the nitrogen atom of ynamides plays a crucial role for controlling the chemo-, stereo- and regioselectivities of this protocol. Another substituent of the terminal ynamides offers a handle for functionality diversification. This Cys modification with ynamides proceeds efficiently in a slightly basic aqueous media (pH 8) to provide a series of Z-isomer of the corresponding conjugated products with excellent stereoselectivity (> 99%) and superior stability. All the reactive peptide side chain functional groups such as amino, carboxyl, primary amide, and hydroxyl groups, as well as the unprotected imidazole and indole rings are compatible.

After the addition of inorganic salts, in particular, Na+ and K+ ions, the catalytic effect of the macrocycle is suppressed. The kinetic and binding data collected by us evidence the formation of the ternary complexes between the cations, macrocycle, and substrate, which are less prone to H3O+ attack.

Experiments have shown that EOG activity and selectivity depend on the electrocatalyst, but also on the electrode potential, the pH, and the electrolyte. For broadly employed gold (Au) electrocatalysts, experiments have demonstrated high EOG activity under alkaline conditions with glyceric acid as a primary product, whereas under acidic and neutral conditions Au is almost inactive producing only small amounts of dihydroxyacetone. In the present computational work, we have performed an extensive mechanistic study to understand the pH- and potential- dependency of Au-catalyzed EOG. Our results show that activity and selectivity are controlled by the presence of surface-bound hydroxyl groups. Under alkaline conditions and close to the experimental onset potential, modest OH coverage is preferred accord- ing to our constant potential calculations. This indicates that both Au(OH)ads and Au can be active sites and they cooperatively facilitate the thermodynamically and kinetically feasible formation of glyceric acid thus explaining the experimentally observed high activity and selectivity. Under acidic conditions, hydroxide coverage is negligi- ble and the dihydroxyacetone emerges as the favored product. Calculations predict slow reaction kinetics, however, which explains the low activity and selectivity towards dihydroxyacetone reported in experiments. Overall, our findings highlight that com- putational studies should explicitly account for pH and coverage effects under alkaline conditions for electrocatalytic oxidation reactions to reliably predict electrocatalytic behaviour.", "date": "2021-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The two systems share a common trend in the phase stability, displaying a transition from an orthorhombic to a monoclinic phase around 2 GPa, followed by a phase separation in two monoclinic phases characterized by different c-axis. The optical properties show rather different behavior due to the presence of Pb or Ge. DA2PbI4 shows a progressive red shift of the band gap from 2.28 eV at ambient conditions, to 1.64 eV at 11.5 GPa, with a narrow PL emission composed by two components, with the second one appearing in concomitance with the phase separation and significantly shifted to lower energy. On the other hand, DA2GeI4, changes from a non-PL system at ambient pressure, to a clear broadband emitter centered around 730 nm (FWHM ~ 170 nm), with a large stoke shift, and an intensity maximum at about 3.7 GPa.

Stress-dependent dual-fluorescence properties of the chemically doped flapping force probe has been demonstrated even when the probe is solvated in the wet materials (Figure 1). The fluorescence ratiometric analysis is robust against the local concentration change induced by the macroscopic polymer deformation. While the force-responsive FRET dyads, widely used in mechanobiology, are sensitive to the distance and orientation of the two chromophores, the flapping fluorophore works as a single-component flexible force probe regardless of the FRET efficiency. Realtime and reversible spectral response to the mechanical stress is observed with a low threshold on the order of sub-MPa compression due to its conformational flexibility. The previously reported flapping probe only shows a negligible response in the solvated environments because the undesired spontaneous planarization occurs in the S1 excited state, even without mechanical force. The excited-state engineering by changing the flapping wings from the anthraceneimide units to the pyreneimide units endows this molecule with the force probe function in the wet conditions. The structurally modified force probe also has an advantage in terms of a wide dynamic range of the fluorescence response in solvent-free elastomers, which enabled the ratiometric fluorescence imaging of the molecular-level stress concentration during the crack growth in a stretched polyurethane film. The percentage of the stressed force probes has been experimentally estimated to be approximately 30\u201340% before the fracture of the elastomers.

Mpro is essential for the replication cycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, so inhibiting Mpro blocks a vital piece of the cell replication machinery of the virus. A promising strategy to disrupt the viral replication cycle is to design inhibitors that bind to the active site cysteine (Cys145) of the Mpro. Cysteine targeted covalent inhibitors are gaining traction in drug discovery owing to the benefits of improved potency and extended drug-target engagement. An interesting aspect of these inhibitors is that they can be chemically tuned to form a covalent, but reversible bond, with their targets of interest. Several small-molecule cysteine-targeting covalent inhibitors of the Mpro have been discovered\u2014some of which are currently undergoing evaluation in early phase human clinical trials. Understanding the binding energetics of these inhibitors could provide new insights to facilitate the design of potential drug candidates against COVID-19. Motivated by this, we employed rigorous absolute binding free energy calculations and hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to estimate the energetics of binding of some promising reversible covalent inhibitors of the Mpro. We find that the inclusion of enhanced sampling techniques such as replica-exchange algorithm in binding free energy calculations can improve the convergence of predicted non-covalent binding free energy estimates of inhibitors binding to the Mpro target. In addition, our results indicate that binding free energy calculations coupled with multiscale simulations can be a useful approach to employ in ranking covalent inhibitors to their targets. This approach may be valuable in prioritizing and refining covalent inhibitor compounds for lead discovery efforts against COVID-19 and future coronavirus infections.", "date": "2021-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The present study frames the technicalities of this biorefinery process and relates them to the features of the obtained product streams. Via the extensive characterization of the solid pulp (by acid hydrolysis-HPLC, ATR-FTIR, XRD, SEM and enzymatic hydrolysis-HPLC), of lignin derivatives (by GPC, GC-MS/FID, 1H-13C HSQC NMR, and ICP-AES) and of carbohydrate derivatives (by HPLC) we comprehensively identify and quantify the different products of interest. These results were used for inspecting the economic feasibility of DAOF. The adoption of a dithionite loading of 16.7% w/wbiomass and of an equivolumetric mixture of n-butanol and water, which led to a high yield of monophenolics (~20%, based on acid insoluble lignin, for the treatment of birch sawdust), was identified as the most profitable process configuration. Furthermore, the treatment of various lignocellulosic feedstocks was explored, which showed that DAOF is particularly effective for processing hardwood and herbaceous biomass.

In turn, these sugars were used as a feedstock for fast-growing and genetically modifiable Escherichia coli.

This study provides details on how Aurein 1.2 interacts with charged lipid membranes by using neutron membrane diffraction (NMD) and neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy on complex peptide-membrane systems. NMD provides higher resolution lipid bilayer structures than solution scattering. NMD revealed the peptide is mostly associated in the lipid headgroup region. Even at moderately high concentrations (e.g., peptide:lipid ratio of 1:30), aurein is located at the acyl chain-headgroup region without deep penetration into the hydrophobic acyl chain. However, it does reduce the elasticity of the membrane at that concentration, which was corroborated by the NSE results. Furthermore, NSE shows that aurein first softens the membrane, like other \u03b1-helical peptides at low concentration, but then makes the membrane much more rigid, even without membrane pore formation. The evidence shows that the action of aurein is quite strong for modifying charged lipid distribution without the need to form membrane pores or disintegrate membranes.", "date": "2021-12-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For the three substituents OH, MeO and Me at position 4 in the benzimidazole satisfy the correlation with \uf073I values.

Based on an all-atom model including explicit solvent, we first simulated the p53-DBD dissociation processes by 75 trials of dPaCS-MD, which required an average simulation time of 11.2 \u00b1 2.2 ns per trial. By setting the axis of the DNA duplex as the Z-axis and the binding side of p53-DBD on DNA as the + side of the X-axis, we found that dissociations took place along the +X and \u2212Y directions (\u2212Y directions) in 93% of the cases, while 7% of the cases moved along +X and +Y directions (+Y directions). Toward the \u2212Y directions, p53-DBD dissociated first from the major groove and then detached from the minor groove, while unbinding from the minor groove occurred first in dissociations along the +Y directions. Analysis of the free energy landscape by MSM showed that loss of the minor groove interaction with p53-DBD toward the +Y directions incurred a relatively high energy cost (1.1 kcal/mol) upon a critical transition, whereas major groove detachment more frequently occurred with lower free energy costs. The standard binding free energy calculated from the free energy landscape was \u221210.9 \u00b1 0.4 kcal/mol, which agrees with an experimental value of \u201311.1 kcal/mol.

Methods able to quickly predict the effects of such mutations are needed to complement the existing catalogues, thereby permitting the prescription of effective treatment for patients and preventing the further spread of resistant strains. Relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations can rapidly predict the effects of mutations, but this approach has not been tested on large, complex proteins. We use RBFE calculations to predict the effects of seven M. tuberculosis RNA polymerase mutations on rifampicin susceptibility and five M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase mutations on moxifloxacin susceptibility.

We find that moderate numbers (n=3-15) of short RBFE calculations can predict resistance in cases where the mutation results in a large change in the binding free energy, but that the method lacks discrimination in cases with either a small change in energy or that involve charged amino acids, due to the associated large magnitude of error. We investigate how this error may be decreased by analyzing the sources of error and the distributions of repeated measurements from the different components of the RBFE calculations.

To better understand the stability of SEs when in contact with alkali metals and the reactions that occur, here we consider the deposition of thin (~10 nm) alkali metal films onto SE surfaces, that are thin enough that X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy can probe the buried electrode-electrolyte interface. We highlight the importance of in situ alkali metal deposition, by assessing the contaminant species that are present after glovebox handling and the use of \u2018inert\u2019 transfer devices.

Circular Dichroism spectroscopy showed that PAD-S was able to maintain the native structure of insulin, thus acting as a chemical chaperone. Seeded aggregation kinetics suggest that PAD-S inhibited primary nucleation events during aggregation. This is consistent with molecular docking results which suggest that PAD-S binds strongly to native insulin monomers/dimers.

In the case of molecular magnetic materials, vibronic, or spin-phonon, coupling leads to magnetic relaxation, which equates to loss of magnetic memory and loss of phase coherence in molecular magnets and qubits, respectively. The study of vibronic coupling is challenging, and most experimental evidence is indirect. Here we employ far-infrared magnetospectroscopy to probe vibronic transitions in in [Yb(trensal)] (where H<sub>3</sub>trensal = 2,2,2-tris(salicylideneimino)trimethylamine). We find intense signals near electronic states, which we show arise due to an \u201cenvelope effect\u201d in the vibronic coupling Hamiltonian, and we calculate the vibronic coupling fully <i>ab initio</i> to simulate the spectra. We subsequently show that vibronic coupling is strongest for vibrational modes that simultaneously distort the first coordination sphere and break the C<sub>3</sub> symmetry of the molecule. With this knowledge, vibrational modes could be identified and engineered to shift their energy towards or away from particular electronic states to alter their impact. Hence, these findings provide new insights towards developing general guidelines for the control of vibronic coupling in molecules.</b></p>", "date": "2021-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Magnetism; Spectroscopy (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we report findings from large scale atomistically-resolved simulations of carbon condensation from C/O mixtures subjected to extreme pressures and temperatures, made possible by machine-learned reactive interatomic potentials. We find that liquid nanocarbon formation follows classical growth kinetics driven by Ostwald ripening (i.e. growth of large clusters at the expense of shrinking small ones) and obeys dynamical scaling in a process mediated by carbon chemistry in the surrounding reactive fluid. The results provide direct insight into carbon condensation in a representative system and pave the way for its exploration in higher complexity organic materials.

Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a class of copper-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the breakdown of recalcitrant polysaccharides via oxidative cleavage at the glycosidic bond. The activated copper-oxygen intermediates and their mechanism of formation remains to be established. Neutron protein crystallography which permits direct visualization of protonation states was used to investigate the initial steps of oxygen activation directly following active site copper reduction in Neurospora crassa LPMO9D. Herein, we cryo-trap an activated dioxygen intermediate in a mixture of superoxo and hydroperoxo states, and we identify the conserved second coordination shell residue His157 as the proton donor. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both active site states are stable. The hydroperoxo formed is potentially an intermediate in the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide formation in the absence of substrate. We establish that the N-terminal amino group of the copper coordinating His1 remains doubly protonated directly following molecular oxygen reduction by copper. Aided by mining minima free energy calculations we establish His157 conformational flexibility in solution that is abolished by steric hindrance in the crystal. A neutron crystal structure of NcLPMO9D at low pH supports occlusion of the active site which prevents protonation of His157 at acidic conditions.

Due to this growing demand, alternative AA production strategies must be explored to avoid the exacerbation of prevailing climate and global warming issues since current AA production strategies involve AA production using fossil resources. Investigations on alternative strategies for AA production therefore constitute an important research interest.  The present study therefore assesses waste apple pomace (WAP) as a feedstock for the sustainable AA produc-tion. To undertake this assessment, process models, based on two production pathways were designed, modelled and simulated in ASPEN plus\u00ae software. The two competing production pathways investigated include a process incorporating WAP conversion to lactic acid (LA), prior to LA dehydration to generate AA (denoted as the FD pathway) and another process involving WAP conversion to propylene, prior to propylene oxidation to generate AA (denoted as the TFO pathway). Economic and environmental performances of the FD and TFO pathways were assessed via the minimum selling price (MSP) and potential environmental impacts per h (PEI/h) metrics. The study was able to show that the FD pathway presented an improved economic performance (MSP of AA: US $1.17 per kg) performance compared to the economic performance (MSP of AA: US $1.56 per kg) of the TFO pathway. Crucially, the TFO process was shown to present an improved environmental performance (2.07 kPEI/h) compared to the environmental performance of the FD process (8.72 kPEI/h). These observations sug-gests that the selection of the preferred AA production will require a trade-off between the performance measures, and the integration of a multi-criteria decision assessment in future work.", "date": "2021-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Natural Resource Recovery", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a lipid grafting distance that yields a monolayer thickness consistent with atomistic simulations and experimental measurements of hair surfaces. Coarse-grained models for fully-functionalised, partially damaged, and fully damaged hair surfaces are created by randomly replacing neutral thioesters with anionic sulfonate groups. This mimics the progressive removal of fatty acids from the hair surface by bleaching. We study the structure of the lipid monolayer at different degrees of damage using molecular dynamics simulations in vacuum as well as in polar (water) and non-polar (n-hexadecane) solvents. We also compare the wetting behaviour of water and n-hexadecane on the hair surfaces through contact angle measurements conducted using molecular dynamics simulations and experiments. Our model captures the experimentally-observed transition of the hair surface from hydrophobic (and oleophilic) to hydrophilic (and oleophobic) as the level of bleaching damage increases. By using surfaces with different damage ratios, we obtain contact angles from the simulations that are in good agreement with experiments for both solvents on virgin and bleached human hairs. In both the molecular dynamics simulations and further experiments using biomimetic surfaces, the cosine of the water contact angle increases linearly with the sulfonate group surface coverage.

Developing selective inhibitors is challenging due to the highly conserved binding sites across the roughly 500 human kinases. Thus, detecting subtle similarities on a structural level can help to explain and predict off-targets among the kinase family.\n\nHere, we present the kinase-focused and subpocket-enhanced KiSSim fingerprint (Kinase Structural Similarity). The fingerprint builds on the KLIFS pocket definition, composed of 85 residues aligned across all available protein kinase structures, which enables residue-by-residue comparison without a computationally expensive alignment. The residues' physicochemical and spatial properties are encoded within their structural context including key subpockets at the hinge region, the DFG motif, and the front pocket. \n\nSince structure was found to contain information complementary to sequence, we used the fingerprint to calculate all-against-all similarities within the structurally covered kinome. Thereby, we could identify off-targets that are unexpected if solely considering the sequence-based kinome tree grouping; for example, Erlobinib\u2019s known kinase off-targets SLK and LOK show high similarities to the key target EGFR (TK group) though belonging to the STE group. KiSSim reflects profiling data better or at least as well as other approaches such as KLIFS pocket sequence identity, KLIFS interaction fingerprints (IFPs), or SiteAlign. To rationalize observed (dis)similarities, the fingerprint values can be visualized in 3D by coloring structures with residue and feature resolution.\n\nWe believe that the KiSSim fingerprint is a valuable addition to the kinase research toolbox to guide off-target and polypharmacology prediction.

In this work, we introduce a facile example of communication and cross-regulation among multiple DNA-based ERNs regulated by a concatenated RNA transcription regulator. For this purpose, we run two fuel-driven DNA-based ERNs by concurrent NAD+-fueled ligation and restriction via endo-nucleases (REases) in parallel.

The produced RNA regulator can repress or promote the second ERN via RNA-mediated strand displacement. Furthermore, adding RNase H to degrade the produced RNA can restart the reaction or tune the lag time of two ERNs, giving rise to a repression-recovery and promotion-stop processes.

We show that the concentration of Br- in the composition significantly alters the capacitance and resistive response of the PSC under external stimuli. For example, we observed that the low frequency capacitance does not increase proportionally with light intensity, instead it is highly dependent on the amount of Br- in the composition. We found that the recombination resistance (Rrec) has a linear inverse relationship with light intensity in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 whereas, the mixed compositions show deviation. Interestingly, the deviation of Rrec from linearity also scales with the increase in Br- concentration. Upon applying an electrical bias, a large deviation of Rrec from linearity was observed all mixed halide compositions exhibited a non-linear inverse trend.

However powerful, a common restriction of these studies to date has been the absolute requirement to surface tether or otherwise immobilize the chemical reagent/reaction of interest. This constraint arose from a fundamental limitation of conventional microscopy techniques, which could not track molecules or particles rapidly diffusing in three dimensions, as occurs in solution. However, much chemistry occurs in the solution phase, leaving single-particle/-molecule analysis of this critical area of science beyond the scope of available technology. Here we report the first solution-phase studies and measurements of any chemical reaction at single-particle/-molecule level in freely diffusing solution.  During chemical reaction, freely diffusing polymer particles (D ~ 10-12 m2/s) yielded single-particle 3D trajectories and real-time volumetric images that were analyzed to extract the growth rates of individual particles. These volumetric images show that the average growth rate is a poor representation of the true underlying variability in polymer-particle growth behavior. These data revealed statistically significant populations of faster- and slower-growing particles at different depths in the sample, showing emergent heterogeneity while particles are still in the solution phase. These results go against the prevailing premise that chemical processes freely diffusing in solution will exhibit uniform kinetics. These new understandings of mechanisms behind polymer growth variations bring about an exciting opportunity to control particle-size and plausibly molecular weight polydispersity by the rational design of conditions to dictate spatial growth gradients.

Adding divalent Ca2+ promotes alkali cation (Li+ or Na+) to form the contact ion pairs (CIPs) with the counter anions, which replaces the solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs) commonly existing in single-cation electrolytes. Such CIPs related to alkali cations would separate Ca2+ ions distantly to shield the strong coulomb interaction among the divalent cations. The stronger binding of the CIPs would retard the desolvation kinetics of alkali cations and, consequently, realizes a severely constrained alkali-metal electrodeposition in a reaction-limited process that is required for the dendrite-free morphology.

Toward this end, a bulky triphosphine with a central secondary phosphino group, bis(2 di-t-butyl-phosphinophenyl)phosphine (tBuPHPP), has been synthesized. When complexed to iridium it adopts a meridional (\u201cpincer\u201d) configuration. The secondary phosphino H atom can undergo migration to iridium to give an anionic phosphido-based-pincer (tBuPPP) complex. We describe novel metal-ligand cooperativity of the iridium-phosphido unit. Stoichiometric reactions of the (tBuPPP)Ir complexes reflect a distribution of steric bulk around the iridium center in which the coordination site trans to the phosphido group is quite crowded, one coordination site cis to the phosphido is even more crowded, while the remaining site is particularly open. The (tBuPPP)Ir precursors are the most active catalysts reported to date for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes, by about two orders of magnitude. The electronic properties of the iridium center are very similar to that of well-known analogous (RPCP)Ir catalysts. Accordingly, DFT calculations predict that (tBuPPP)Ir and (tBuPCP)Ir are, intrinsically, comparably active for alkane dehydrogenation. While dehydrogenation by (RPCP)Ir proceeds through an intermediate trans-(PCP)IrH2(alkene), (tBuPPP)Ir follows a pathway proceeding via cis-(PPP)IrH2(alkene), thereby circumventing unfavorable placement of the alkene at the bulky site trans to phosphorus. (tBuPPP)Ir and (tBuPCP)Ir, however, have analogous resting states: square planar (pincer)Ir(alkene). Alkene coordination at the crowded trans site is therefore unavoidable in the resting states. Thus the resting state of the (tBuPPP)Ir catalyst is destabilized by the unusual architecture of the ligand, and this is largely responsible for its unusually high catalytic activity.", "date": "2021-12-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We demonstrate that M-HAF-2 can serve as versatile porous materials for ionic separations, likely aided by one-dimensional channels lined by continuously \u03c0-stacked aromatic groups and H-bonding hydroxamate functionalities.  As a new addition to the small group of hydroxamate-based MOFs, M-HAF-2 represents a structural merger between MOFs and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).", "date": "2021-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Organometallic Compounds", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The applications of deep neural networks (DNNs) and artificial intelligence have increased significantly in the sciences, and recently, specifically, within the field of biomolecular NMR, where DNNs are now available for tasks such as the reconstruction of sparsely sampled spectra, peak picking, and virtual decoupling. Here we present a DNN for the analysis of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) data reporting on two- or three-site chemical exchange involving sparse state lifetimes of between approximately 3 - 60 ms, the range most frequently observed via experiment.  The work presented here focuses on the 1H CEST class of methods that are further complicated, in relation to applications to other nuclei, by anti-phase features. The developed DNNs accurately predict the chemical shifts of nuclei in the exchanging species directly from anti-phase 1HN CEST profiles, along with an uncertainty associated with the predictions. The performance of the DNN was quantitatively assessed using both synthetic and experimental anti-phase CEST profiles. The assessments show that the DNN accurately determines chemical shifts and their associated uncertainties.

Bioderived polymers are one of many current areas of research that show promise for a sustainable future. One bioderived polymer that has been in the spotlight for the past decade due to its unique properties is polydopamine (PDA). Its ability to adhere to virtually any surface showing high stability in a wide pH range from 2-10 and in several organic solvents makes it a suitable candidate for several applications ranging from medical devices, coatings to biosensing applications. However, its strong and broad light absorption limits many applications that rely on transparent material, moreover fluorescence applications are limited by the high quenching efficiency of PDA. Therefore, new bioderived polymers that share similar features as PDA without fluorescent quenching are highly desirable. In this study, the electropolymerization of a bioderived analogue of dopamine, 3-amino-L-tyrosine (ALT) is demonstrated. The properties of the resultant polymer, poly-amino-L-tyrosine (p-ALT), exhibit several characteristics complementary to or even exceeding those of PDA and of its analog, poly-norepinephrine (p-NorEp), rendering p-ALT attractive for the development of sensors and photoactive devices. Cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance have been applied to study the electrodeposition of this material and the resulting polymeric films have been compared to PDA and p-NorEp.

In this sense, pH- and thermo-sensitive (PHT) polymers have recently drawn the attention of researchers for their countless applications. However, binary mixtures of typical PHTs like polyacrylic acid (p-AAc) and poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (p-NIPAm) were unable to form films. In this sense, it was hypothesized that NIPAm copolymerized with AAc monomers can yield blends with virtually the same functional group composition of binary mixtures of p-NIPAm and p-AAc homopolymers but with different properties of film formation. For this, a copolymeric radical synthesis and the subsequent analytical studies were complemented to get a broad description of these materials. P-NIPAm and p-AAc homopolymers and different proportions of copolymers p-NIPAm-co-AAc were obtained and thoroughly characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), acid-basic titration, and rotational rheology. Among the samples, the solutions of p-AAc with p-NIPAm and p-NIPAm-co-AAc copolymers with a higher proportion of NIPAm units (0.8 and 0.6 NIPAm/AAc) precipitated as interpolymer complexes. Since it was expected, the combination with p-NIPAm-co-AAc 40/60 copolymer, which has a higher proportion of AAc groups and pH sensitivity, allowed obtaining blends suitable for the preparation of films. Furthermore, despite the fact that the combinations of p-NIPAm-co-AAc 40/60 with p-NIPAm-co-AAc 80/20 or p-NIPAm were successful, the mechanical properties of the films are worse compared to the other blends, leaving this issue open for subsequent studies.", "date": "2021-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymer blends", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ni-rich layered transition metal oxides exhibit higher interfacial reactivity than their lower Ni-content analogues, reacting via poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we study the role of the electrolyte solvent, specifically cyclic ethylene carbonate (EC) and linear ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), in determining the interfacial reactivity at LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC111) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811).

No difference between electrolytes are observed with NMC111. On-line gas analysis reveals this to be related to lattice oxygen release, and accompanying electrolyte decomposition, which increases substantially with greater Ni content, and for EC-containing electrolytes with NMC811. This is corroborated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of NMC811 after the voltage hold, which show a higher interfacial impedance and a thicker oxygen-deficient rock-salt surface reconstruction layer, respectively. Combined findings from solution NMR, ICP (of electrolytes) and XPS analysis (of electrodes) reveal that higher lattice oxygen release from NMC811 in EC-containing electrolytes is coupled with more electrolyte breakdown and higher amounts of transition metal dissolution compared to EC-free electrolyte.

However, poor loading capacity, premature drug release, non-uniformity and reproducibility still remain the major challenges. To create a stable polymeric micelle with high drug loading, a telodendrimer micelle was developed as a nanocarrier for fulvestrant, as an example of a drug that has extremely poor water solubility (sub nanomolar range). Telodendrimers were prepared by synthesis of a hydrophilic linear poly(sarcosine) and growing a lysine dendron from the chain terminal amine by a divergent synthesis. At the periphery of the dendritic block, 4, 8, and 16 fulvestrant molecules were conjugated to the lysine dendron creating a hydrophobic block. Having drug as part of the carrier not only reduces the usage of the inert carrier materials but also prevent the drugs from leakage and premature release by diffusion.  The self-assembled telodendrimer micelles demonstrated good colloidal stability (CMC < 2 \u00b5M) in buffer and were uniform in size. In addition, these telodendrimer micelles could solubilize additional fulvestrant yielding an excellent overall drug loading capacity of up to 77 wt.% total drug load (summation of conjugated and encapsulated). Importantly, the size of the micelles could be tuned between 25-150 nm by controlling (i) the ratio between hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks and (ii) the amount of encapsulated fulvestrant. The versatility of these telodendrimer-based micelle systems to both conjugate and encapsulate drug with high efficiency and stability, in addition to possessing other tuneable properties makes it a promising drug delivery system for a range of active pharmaceutical ingredients and therapeutic targets.", "date": "2021-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Drug delivery systems; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The singularity centered at about 313 K found in the trend of the simulated temperature-dependent viscosity and diffusion coefficient of liquid BZN goes alongside the reported experiment, and the phenomenon may root from a change in the internal frictional motion of the molecular cluster in stacking modes. Accordingly, we used vast efforts for analysis particularly based on the deconvolution of the corresponding complex correlation functions. Specific angle-dependent correlation functions led to the recognition of the stacking molecules and their strict orientational character by utilizing relative molecular twist angles. Recognition of the strict orientational character of the stacking molecules, as a clue to the singularity in the viscosity trend, will be discussed based on specific angle-dependent correlation functions.", "date": "2021-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.); Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Quantification of water vapor transport at elevated temperatures is fundamental to understanding polymer coating performance, especially when the coating is exposed to extreme operating conditions. As the water activity increases, the permeability/selectivity of polymers against other permeants changes. In this study, we examined the water permeation kinetics of two common epoxy-based powder coating systems for pipelines (fusion-bonded epoxy, FBE, and high-performance powder coating, HPPC) across a range of industrially-relevant temperatures (from room temperature to 80\u00b0C). Specifically, we utilized vapor permeation features of FBE and HPPC films with quantification of equilibrium flux as a function of temperature and pressure. In addition, we analyzed the nonlinear dependency of water transport on the vapor concentration at 65\u00b0C. The vapor transport analysis demonstrated that although data for FBE were indicative of a decrease in permeability around 65\u00b0C, perhaps due to self-association of water molecules, the coating was likely to experience a plasticization pressure around this temperature. We also examined microstructural changes of the epoxy network due to water transport. Our results revealed evidence of irreversible damage to epoxy coatings under wet-state conditions above 65\u00b0C. It appears that the combination of thermal exposure and internal stresses in the glassy epoxy lead to a phase separation of filler particles from the epoxy matrix, as well as to a distinctive cavity formation in the coating membrane. Yet, despite formation of percolating paths for water transport, our results indicate that vapor permeation is primarily restrained due to self-association of water molecules. The vapor transport flux and its permeance are lowered by one order of magnitude in the multilayered HPPC thanks to the moisture-resistant polyethylene topcoat, thus reducing the extent of damage to the underlying substrate. Since barrier protection against gas phase diffusion is controlled by the FBE primer, however, consequences of coating hydration are more pronounced in the overall selectivity toward gaseous transport. Hydrothermal exposure is likely to increase aggregate porosity of the coating and a conservative implementation of standard coating requirements is therefore reasonable to avoid early degradation issues.", "date": "2021-12-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Coating Materials; Polymer morphology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

We further monitor how the reaction mixture decomposes using solution NMR and gas chromatography, and we find that ZrCl4 is formed as a by-product of the reaction, limiting the reaction yield. The reaction proceeds via two competing mechanisms: E1 elimination (dominating) and SN1 substitution (minor). Using this new mechanistic insight, we adapted the synthesis to optimize the yield and gain control over nanocrystal size. These insights will allow the rational design and synthesis of complex oxide nanocrystals.", "date": "2021-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Ligands (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Cooperative structural transitions involve the simultaneous, concerted displacement of molecules in a crystalline material, in stark contrast to the more typical molecule-by-molecule nucleation and growth mechanism often breaking the single crystallinity. Cooperative transitions have acquired much attention in the research community for their low transition barriers, ultrafast kinetics, and structural reversibility. On the other hand, cooperative transitions are rarely observed in molecular crystals and the molecular origin is not well understood. Single crystals of 2-dimensional quinoidal terthiophene (2DQTT-o-B), a high-performance n-type organic semiconductor, demonstrate two thermally-activated, reversible phase transitions with one exhibiting a cooperative mechanism and the second exhibiting a nucleation and growth mechanism. In situ microscopy, single crystal and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), along with Raman spectroscopy suggest a reorientation of the alkyl side chains results in a cooperative transition behavior. On the other hand, the nucleation and growth transition is coincident with both side chain melting and the emergence of new spin-spin interactions between conjugated cores, confirmed through in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). This is the first observation of biradical interactions directly initiating a structural transition. Through studying these fundamental mechanisms, we establish alkyl chain conformation and disorder as integral to rationally controlling these polymorphic behaviors for novel electronic applications.", "date": "2021-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While subcutaneous (SC) administration has the potential to meet these criteria, it is extremely restrictive as it cannot be applied to most anticancer drugs, such as irritant or vesicant ones, for local toxicity reasons. Herein, we report a facile, general and scalable approach for the SC administration of anticancer drugs through the design of well-defined hydrophilic polymer prodrugs. This was applied to the anticancer drug paclitaxel (Ptx) as a worst-case scenario due to its high hydrophobicity and vesicant properties (two factors promoting necrosis at the injection site), whereas polyacrylamide (PAAm) was chosen as a hydrophilic polymer for its biocompatibility and stealth properties. A small library of Ptx-based polymer prodrugs was designed by adjusting the nature of the linker (ester, diglycolate and carbonate), and then evaluated in terms of rheological/viscosity properties in aqueous solutions, drug release kinetics in PBS and in murine plasma, cytotoxicity on two different cancer cell lines, acute local and systemic toxicity, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and finally their anticancer efficacy.

The structural and surface chemistry study of CuxO/TiO2 samples, along with first principles Density Functional Theory simulations, reveal the strong interaction of ALD deposited CuxO with TiO2, leading to the stabilization of CuxO clusters on the surface; it also demonstrated substantial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ on the surface of CuxO/TiO2 samples after CuxO ALD. The CuxO/TiO2 photocatalysts showed remarkable improvement in hydrogen productivity, with 11 times greater hydrogen production for the optimum sample compared to unmodified P25. With the combination of the hydrogen production data and characterization of CuxO/TiO2 photocatalysts, we inferred that ALD deposited CuxO clusters have a dual promotional effect: increased charge carrier separation and improved light absorption, consistent with known copper promoted TiO2 photocatalysts and generation of a substantial amount of surface Ti3+ which results in self-doping of TiO2 and improves its photo-activity for hydrogen production. The obtained data were also employed to modify the previously proposed expanding photocatalytic area and overlap model to describe the effect of cocatalyst size and weight loading on photocatalyst activity. Comparing the trend of surface Ti3+ content increase and the photocatalytically promoted area, calculated with our model, suggests that the depletion zone formed around the heterojunction of CuxO-TiO2 is the main active area for hydrogen production, and the hydrogen productivity of the photocatalyst depends on the surface coverage by this active area.

Here, by combining the desired features from both catalytic regimes we designed an artificial cyclodehy-dratase, a catalytic system for site-selective modification of peptides and natural products by engrafting heterocyclic into their scaffolds. The catalytic system features molybdenum(VI) center that was decorated with a sterically congest-ed tripod ligand. The optimized catalyst can introduce azolines into small molecules, natural products, and oligopeptides with high efficiency and minimal waste. We further demonstrate the utility of the new protocol in direct func-tionalization of a single amide group in the presence of up to seven other chemically similar positions, and direct conversion into amines and thioamides.

Among other factors, the reversible phase segregation under even low light intensities is still limiting their potential use. During this process, the material segregates locally into iodide-rich and bromide-rich phases, lowering the effective bandgap energy. While several studies have been done to illuminate the mechanism and suppression of phase segregation, fundamental aspects remain unclear. Phase compositions after segregation vary extensively between different studies and the exact amounts of phases often remain unmentioned. For iodide-rich phases, the end-point compositions at around x=0.2 are widely accepted but the proportion of the phase is difficult to measure. In this report, we observe the phase segregation using spectroscopic ellipsometry, a powerful, nondestructive technique that has been employed in the study of film degradation before. We obtained dynamic ellipsometric measurements from x=0.5 mixed halide lead perovskite thin films protected by a polystyrene layer under green laser light with a power density of ~11 W/cm2. Changes in the bandgap region can be correlated to the changes in composition caused by phase segregation, allowing for the kinetics to be observed.

An attempt is made for the first time from our laboratory to apply the Hammett and Taft equations to a five membered ring system with four nitrogens as heteroatoms viz. tetrazole to identify the aqueous medium 1H and 2H Tautomers. For this purpose experimentally determined aqueous medium pKa values of NH-acidities of a total of fifteen 5-X-1,2,3,4-tetrazoles and DFT/B3LYP method at the 6-31G* level calculated dipole moments of seven 1H and 2H tautomers of 5-X-1,2,3,4-tetrazoles are used to correlate with Hammett \uf073para and \uf073meta, and Taft \uf073_ortho^* values. Good correlations are obtained. The promising response of more abundant and more polar 1H tautomer with less susceptibility (\uf072* = -1.38 in pKa correlations and \uf072* = -0.55 in dipole moments correlation) to Taft equation and less abundant and less polar 2H tautomer with more susceptibility (\uf072para = 6.56, \uf072meta = 7.79 in pKa correlations, and \uf072para = 2.69, \uf072meta = 3.26 in dipole moments correlation) to Hammett equation of the tetrazole is well distinguished.

The design phase is usually carried out via traditional medicinal chemistry approaches and/or structure based drug design (SBDD) when suitable structural information is available. Two of the major limitations of this approach are (1) difficulty in rapidly designing potent molecules that adhere to myriad project criteria, or the multiparameter optimization (MPO) problem, and (2) the relatively small number of molecules explored compared to the vast size of chemical space. To address these limitations we have developed AutoDesigner, a de novo design algorithm. AutoDesigner employs a cloud-native, multi-stage search algorithm to carry out successive rounds of chemical space exploration and filtering. Millions to billions of virtual molecules are explored and optimized while adhering to a customizable set of project criteria such as physicochemical properties and potency. Additionally, the algorithm only requires a single ligand with measurable affinity and a putative binding model as a starting point, making it amenable to the early stages of a SBDD project where limited data is available. To assess the effectiveness of AutoDesigner, we applied it to the design of novel inhibitors of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), a target for the treatment of schizophrenia. AutoDesigner was able to generate and efficiently explore over 1 billion molecules to successfully address a variety of project goals. The compounds generated by AutoDesigner that were synthesized and assayed (1) simultaneously met not only physicochemical criteria, clearance and central nervous system (CNS) penetration (Kp,uu) cutoffs, but also potency thresholds; (2) fully utilize structural data to discover and explore novel interactions and a previously unexplored subpocket in the DAO active site. The reported data demonstrate that AutoDesigner can play a key role in accelerating the discovery of novel, potent chemical matter within the constraints of a given drug discovery lead optimization campaign.\n", "date": "2021-12-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Over the past 25 years, a lively debate about the reaction mechanism involved several research groups. Plasmon-mediated generation of energetic (hot) electrons and holes has been invoked as the main driving-force, although plasmonic heating has recently gained attention. However, either model and their combinations are not sufficient to explain some experimental observations and appear, in some cases, contradictory. No matter the differences, there is a general, firm consensus about the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles (Ag or Au), which has always been considered mandatory for triggering the photoconversion.\nHere I report the first observation of the PATP-to-DMAB photoreaction in the absence of any plasmonic mediators. In particular, neither plasmonic heating nor charge transfer from hot carriers were exploited. The reaction was observed to occur with different kinetics on plasmon-free TiO2 nanoparticles, as well as on self-standing droplets. Confocal microRaman spectroscopy enabled to investigate the reaction progress in different plasmon-free contexts, either aerobic or anaerobic, suggesting a new interpretation of the photodimerization process, based on direct laser-induced activation of singlet oxygen species.

A theory-experiment combined approach was introduced for the five ether molecules representing linear, branched, and cyclic ethers to derive rational design principles for low-emission and high-reactivity ethers.

At a high-temperature regime, ethers\u2019 high sooting tendency is related to increased C3 and C4 hydrocarbon formation compared to C1 and C2 products from oxidation reactions. On the other hand, the reactivity at the low-temperature regime is determined by the activation energies of reaction steps until ketohydroperoxide formation.

These factors were utilized to build a multivariate model to predict the cetane number (CN) and yield sooting index (YSI) of 50 different ethers. The model suggests building blocks with specific carbon types that maximize CN and minimize YSI, leading to the design principles of ethers toward low emissions and high reactivity fuels for transport applications.

However, the challenge that remains is the development of a method, experimental or computational, which can both determine the permeation rate and provide mechanistic insights into the transport process to help with the rational design for any given molecule. Typically, one of three methods are used to measure membrane permeability: (1) experimental permeation assays acting on either artificial or natural membranes; (2) quantitative structure-permeability relationship (QSPR) models that rely on experimental values of permeability or related pharmacokinetic properties of a range of molecules to infer those for new molecules; (3) estimates of permeability from the Smoluchowski equation, where free energy and diffusion profiles along the membrane normal are taken as input from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. While all these methods provide estimates of permeation coefficients, they provide very little information for guiding rational drug design.

To overcome these challenges, we used a computational framework relying on a series of potential-of-mean-force (PMF) calculations including a set of geometrical restraints on collective variables.

Rational design of PROTACs requires accurate knowledge of the native configuration of the PROTAC induced ternary complex. This study demonstrates that native and non-native ternary complex poses can be distinguished based on pose occupancy time in MD, where native poses exhibit longer occupancy times than non-native ones at both room and higher temperatures. Candidate poses are generated by MD sampling and pre-ranked by the classic MM/GBSA method. A specific heating scheme is then applied to induce ternary pose departure, generating an occupancy score and temperature score reflecting pose occupancy time and fraction. The scoring approach enables identification of the native pose in all the test systems. Beyond providing a relative rank of hypothetical poses of a given ternary system, the method could also provide empirical guidance to whether a given ternary pose is likely a native one or not. The success of the method is in part attributed to the dynamic nature of the pose departure analysis which accounts for solute entropic effects, typically neglected in the faster static pose scoring methods, while solute entropic contributions play a greater role in protein-protein interactions than in protein-ligand systems.", "date": "2021-12-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Gliding assays also serve as the foundation for protein-motor-based nanotechnological devices such as biosensing and sorting. However, the preparation of nitrocellulose-coated coverslips is time-consuming and produces rough surfaces.

We showed that the total preparation time to coat a coverslip with HMDS is <30 minutes, which is 1 order of magnitude faster than the >12-hour protocol for coating glass surfaces with nitrocellulose. In contrast to nitrocellulose film, HMDS vapor deposition is effortless and provides an atomically flat surface with low autofluorescence. In addition, HMDS does not interfere with myosin function, which is indicated by the similar actin gliding speed when compared with nitrocellulose.

M. Rupp; H. Martin R. Wilkening", "abstract": "Solid electrolytes with extraordinarily high Li-ionic conductivities are key for high performance all-solid-state batteries. So far, the thiophosphate Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) belongs to the best Li ion conductors with an ionic conductivity exceeding 10 mS cm\u20131 at ambient. Recent molecular dynamics simulations performed by Dawson and Islam predict that the ionic conductivity of LGPS can be further enhanced by a factor of three if the crystallite size is reduced to the nanometer regime. A change in local ion coordination, hence local disorder, has been assumed to facilitate Li diffusion in the ab-plane of LGPS. As yet, no experimental evidence exists supporting this fascinating prediction. Here, we synthesized nanocrystalline LGPS by high-energy ball milling, characterized the material structurally and probed the Li+ ion transport parameters. Whereas X-ray powder diffraction and high-resolution 31P and 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy helped us to determine morphological changes and local structures upon milling, broadband conductivity spectroscopy in combination with electric modulus measurements allowed us to precisely follow the changes in Li+ ion dynamics. Surprisingly and against the behavior of other electrolytes, ionic conductivity turned out to decrease with increasing milling time, finally leading to a reduction of \u03c320\u00b0C by almost a factor of 10. This decrease affects both, bulk ion dynamics and total conductivity, which also comprises Li+ transport across grain boundary regions in LGPS. As could be shown by NMR, ball-milling leads to a structurally heterogeneous sample with the nm-sized LGPS crystallites being embedded in an amorphous matrix. This amorphous phase is responsible for the reduced performance of the milled electrolyte. Importantly, careful separation of the amorphous and (nano)crystalline contributions to the overall ionic conductivity revealed that even in the nanocrystalline regions Li+ ion dynamics is slowed down compared to untreated, coarse-grained LGPS. We conclude that defects introduced into the LGPS bulk structure via ball milling have a negative impact on ionic transport. We postulate that such kind of structural disorder is detrimental to fast ion transport in materials whose transport properties rely on crystallographically well-defined diffusion pathways.", "date": "2021-12-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Physical and Chemical Properties; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Eccrine and sebaceous material within natural fingermark droplets were imaged on the micron scales at hourly intervals for the first 6 \u2013 12 hours after deposition, revealing that substantial dehydration occurred within the first 8 hours. Changes to lipid material was more varied, with samples exhibiting an increase or decrease in lipid concentration due to the degradation and redistribution of this material. Across 12 donors, it was noticeable that the initial chemical composition and morphology of the droplet varied greatly, which appeared to influence on the rate of change of the droplet over time. Further, this study attempted to quantify the total water content within fingermark samples. The wide-spread nature and strength of the absorption of Terahertz/Far-infrared (THz/Far-IR) radiation by water vapour molecules were exploited for this purpose, using THz/Far-IR spectroscopy.

A \u201cdata-poor\u201d framework was developed and tested using a small dataset on consumer products containing engineered nanomaterials to represent emerging substances. A second, more traditional framework was applied to a \u201cdata-rich\u201d product dataset comprised of bulk-scale organic chemicals for comparison purposes.

An ablation study revealed that functional use data improved predictive performance when included alongside chemical property data, suggesting the utility of functional use categories in evaluating the safety and sustainability of emerging chemicals.

Separating the time integration of fast modes associated with internal molecular motion, from slow modes associated with their density fields, we implement the first time-reversible hPF simulations.

This would only be possible, we argue, if prebiotic chemical reaction networks had autocatalytic features organized in a way that permitted the accretion of complexity even in the absence of genetic control. To evaluate this claim, we developed tools to analyze the autocatalytic organization of food-driven reaction networks and applied these tools to both abiotic and biotic networks. Both networks contained seed-dependent autocatalytic systems (SDASs), which are subnetworks that can use a flux of food chemicals to self-propagate if, and only if, they are first seeded by some non-food chemicals. Moreover, SDASs were organized such that the activation of a lower-tier SDAS could render new higher-tier SDASs accessible. The organization of SDASs is, thus, similar to trophic levels (producer, primary consumer, etc.) in a biological ecosystem. Furthermore, similar to ecological succession, we found that higher-tier SDASs may produce chemicals that enhance the ability of the entire chemical ecosystem to utilize food more efficiently. The SDAS concept explains how driven abiotic environments, namely ones receiving an ongoing flux of food chemicals, can incrementally complexify even without genetic polymers. This framework predicts that it ought to be possible to detect the spontaneous emergence of life-like features, such as self-propagation and adaptability, in driven chemical systems in the laboratory. Additionally, SDAS theory may be useful for exploring general properties of other complex systems.

Methods have been developed to estimate molecule synthesizability, but, so far, there is no consensus on whether or not a molecule is synthesizable. In this paper we introduce the Retro-Score (RScore), which computes a synthetic feasibility score of molecules by performing a full retrosynthetic analysis through our data-driven synthetic planning software Spaya, and its dedicated API: Spaya-API (https://spaya.ai). After a comparison of RScore with other synthetic scores from the literature, we describe a pipeline to generate molecules that validate a list of targets while still being easy to synthesize. We further this idea by performing experiments comparing molecular generator outputs across a range of constraints and conditions. We show that the RScore can be learned by a Neural Network, which leads to a new score: RSPred. We demonstrate that using the RScore or RSPred as a constraint during molecular generation enables to obtain more synthesizable solutions, with higher diversity.

In this work we build a model of a CCU system with no renewables involved, and evaluate its greenhouse (GHG) emissions based on the life cycle assessment with a cradle-to-gate boundary. To pursue the best system performance, an optimization framework is established to digitalize and optimize the CCU system regarding GHG emissions reduction.

Usually this is mitigated by adherence to a schedule of repeated regular sanitization, yet this approach is inherently limited by sanitization frequency; conventional disinfectants/methods are only germicidal during the period of application, and surfaces are easily re-contaminated in the interim between cleanings. One solution to this problem is to use agents/coatings that impart self-disinfecting properties onto the existing surfaces such that they display sustained virucidal/antimicrobial properties against pathogens that settle upon them. Quaternary-ammonium organosilicon compounds are ideal candidates to achieve this; cationic surfactants are safe and well-established surface disinfectants while organosilanes are used broadly to form durable coatings with altered surface properties on many different materials. Despite their potential to circumvent disadvantages of traditional disinfection methods, extant commercially available quaternary-ammonium silanes do not display comparable efficacy to standard surface disinfectants, nor have their respective coatings been demonstrated to meet the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s guidelines for residual/extended efficacy. Inspired by powerful surface activity of double-headed \u201cgemini\u201d surfactants, here we present gemini-diquaternary (GQ) silanes with robust residual germicidal efficacy on various surfaces by incorporating a second cationic \u201chead\u201d to the structure of an conventional mono-quaternary-ammonium silane. Aqueous solutions of GQs were tested in suspension- and surface-antimicrobial assays against an array of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). GQ performance was benchmarked against the common disinfectants, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite, as well as against a common antimicrobial mono-quaternary (MQ) silane. Solutions of GQ silanes were efficacious when used for immediate disinfection, showing comparable activity to common disinfectants (>106 fold reduction in 15 seconds). Additionally GQ solutions were demonstrated to impart durable self-disinfecting properties to a variety of porous and nonporous surfaces,  efficacious after repeated cycles of abrasion and repeated contaminations, and with superior coating ability and activity (>108 higher activity) than that of the popular MQ silane.

By confined synthesis of iron(II) SCO coordination polymers within the P4VP cores of polystyrene-block-poly-4-vinylpyridine (PS-b-P4VP) micelles in THF we are able to control the size and also the shape of the resulting SCO nanocomposite particles by the composition of the PS-b-P4VP diblock copolymers (dBCPs) and the amount of complex employed. For the nanocomposite samples with the highest P4VP content, a morphological transition from spherical nanoparticle to worm-like structures was observed with increasing coordination polymer content, which can be explained with the impact of complex coordination on the self-assembly of the dBCP.

Orange corn grits were packaged in paper pouch bags, and three types of low-oxygen and low-moisture permeable (LOMP) pouches. Grits were packaged in each type of LOMP pouch with (LOMP-oxy) and without (LOMP-noxy) an oxygen scavenger. For six months, all pouches were stored at semi-controlled environmental conditions (22.5 \u00b1 1.3\u00b0C, 32 \u00b1 18% RH). After the storage period, orange corn grits stored in paper pouch bags lost 55% of total xanthophylls, whereas grits packaged in LOMP pouches only lost 8% of total xanthophylls. Orange Corn grits packaged in LOMP-oxy pouches had slightly higher carotenoid content than in LOMP-noxy pouches. Relative humidity fluctuation in the storeroom could have caused fluctuation in moisture content in the orange corn grits packaged in paper pouches, which may affect the rate of carotenoid degradation in the orange corn grits.

Representative Ga3+ sites, including three- and four-coordinated geometries, are tested for multiple ethylene oligomerization pathways. We show that the three-coordinated Ga3+ site promotes oligomerization through a facile initiation process that generates a Ga-alkyl intermediate, followed by a Ga-alkyl-centered Cossee-Arlman mechanism. The strained geometry of a three-coordinated site enables a favorable free energy landscape with a kinetically accessible ethylene insertion transition state (1.7 eV) and a previously unreported \u03b2-hydride transfer step (1.0 eV) to terminate further C-C bond formation.  This result, in turn, suggests that Ga3+ does not favor polymerization chemistry, while microkinetic modeling confirms that ethylene insertion is the rate-determining step.

Seeman", "abstract": "The overwinding and underwinding of duplex segments between junctions have been used in designing both left-handed and right-handed DNA origami nanostructures. For a variety of DNA tubes obtained from self-assembled tiles, only a theoretical approach of the intrinsic curvature of the DNA tile (specified as the intrinsic tile curvature) has been previously used to explain their formation. Details regarding the quantitative and structural descriptions of the tile curvature and its evolution in DNA tubes by the coupling of the twist of the inter-tile arm (specified as the arm twist) have never been addressed. In this work, we designed three types of tile cores built around a circular 128 nucleotide scaffold by using longitudinal weaving (LW), bridged longitudinal weaving (bLW) and transverse weaving (TW). Joining the tiles with inter-tile arms having the length of an odd number of DNA half-turns (termed O-tiling) almost resulted into planar 2D lattices, whereas joining the tiles with the arms having the length of an even number of DNA half-turns (termed E-tiling) nearly generated tubes. Streptavidin bound to biotin was used as a labeling technique to characterize the inside and outside surfaces of the E-tiling tubes and thereby the conformations of their component tiles with addressable concave and convex curvatures. When the arms have the normal winding at the relaxed B-form of DNA, the intrinsic tile curvature deter-mines the chirality of the E-tiling tubes. By regulating the arm length and the sticky end length of the bLW-Ep/q (E-tiling of the bLW cores with the arm length of p-bp and the sticky end length of q-nt) assemblies, the arm can be overwound, resulting in a left-handed twist, and can also be underwound, resulting in a right-handed twist. Chiral bLW-Ep/q tubes with either a right-handed curvature or a left-handed curvature can also be formed by the coupling of the intrinsic tile curvature and the arm twist. We were able to assign the chiral indices (n,m) to each tube using high-resolution AFM images, and therefore were able to estimate the tile curvature using a regular polygon model that approximated the transverse section of the tube. A deeper understanding of the integrated actions of dif-ferent types of twisting forces on the DNA tubes will be extremely helpful in engineering more elaborate DNA nanostructures in the future.", "date": "2021-12-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The major role of lanthanides here is in the active sites of enzymes: methanol dehydrogenases. Additionally, lanthanide binding proteins have also been identified. One such protein is lanmodulin (LanM) and, with a remarkable selectivity for Lns over Ca(II) and affinities in the picomolar range, it makes an attractive target to address challenges in lanthanide separation. Why LanM has such a high selectivity is currently not entirely understood, both the specific amino acid sequences of the EF-hand loops, together with cooperativity effects have been suggested. Consequently, we decided to remove the effect of cooperativity by focusing on the amino acid level. Thus, we synthesized all four 12-amino acid EF-Hand loop peptides of LanM using solid phase peptide synthesis and investigated their affinity for Lns (Eu(III), Tb(III)), the actinide Cm(III) and Ca(II). Using isothermal titration calorimetry and time resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis, we show that in the absence of cooperativity the short EF-Hand loop peptides have all similar affinities for lanthanides and that these are all in the micromolar range. Furthermore, calcium was shown not to bind to the peptides which was verified with circular dichroism spectroscopy. This technique also revealed that the peptides undergo a change to a more ordered state when lanthanides are added. These experimental observations were further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Lastly, we put Eu(III) and Cm(III) in direct competition using TRLFS. Remarkably, a slightly higher affinity for the actinide, as was also observed for LanM, was found. Our results demonstrate that the picomolar affinities in LanM are largely an effect of pre-structuring in the full protein and therefore reduction of flexibility in combination with cooperative effects, and that all EF-Hand loops possess similar affinities when detached from the protein backbone, albeit still retaining the high selectivity for lanthanides and actinides over calcium.", "date": "2021-12-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Within this context, the symmetric tetrazines remain unexplored despite their unique structural properties that enable them to meet these challenges. Herein, we prepared s-tetrazines substituted with methyl, methoxy, and thiomethyl substituents and evaluated their electrochemical properties, solubility, and cycling stability.

In most cases, previous works dealing with nanoparticle-based catalysis in the TME, focus on the effects obtained (e.g. tumor cell death) and attribute the results to heterogeneous processes alone. The specific mechanisms are rarely substantiated and, furthermore, the possibility of a significant contribution of homogeneous processes by leached species \u2013and the complexes that they may form with biomolecules- is neither contemplated nor pursued. Herein, we have designed a bimetallic catalyst nanoparticle containing Cu and Fe species and we have been able to describe the whole picture in a more complex scenario where both homogeneous and heterogeneous processes are coupled and fostered under TME relevant chemical conditions. We investigate the preferential leaching of Cu ions in the presence of a TME overexpressed biomolecule such as glutathione (GSH). We demonstrate that these homogeneous processes initiated by the released by Cu-GSH interactions are in fact responsible for the greater part of the cell death effects found (GSH, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species is depleted and highly active superoxide anions are generated in the same catalytic cycle). The remaining solid CuFe nanoparticle becomes an active catalase-mimicking surrogate able to supply oxygen from oxygen reduced species, such as superoxide anions (by-product from GSH oxidation) and hydrogen peroxide, another species that is enriched in the TME. This enzyme-like activity is essential to sustain the homogeneous catalytic cycle in the oxygen-deprived tumor microenvironment.

We analyze the shape and size of a 5DOF fundamental zone (FZ), molecular statics energy uncertainty, property similarity of GBs that are crystallographically \\close\" (i.e. correlations), and energy pathways through 5DOF space. Considered together, these insights are important for managing tradeoffs between accuracy, complexity, and design considerations for electron backscatter diffraction/serial sectioning, high-energy diffraction microscopy, molecular statics, and density-functional theory. In terms of the shape and size of a 5DOF FZ, we discover that a FZ is smaller than expected at only \u223c65\u00b0 in the largest principal component. Thus, a 10\u00b0 difference between two GBs, which may have previously been considered small, is actually quite large. We represent a GB by five transformed Cartesian coordinates equipped with a Euclidean distance metric. Using this representation, we find that the FZ has a low aspect-ratio shape (i.e. width, length, height, etc. are similar) which is important for 5DOF numerical differentiation. Semivariogram and numerical optimization methods reveal that grain boundary energy (GBE) in Ni and Fe are globally correlated within \u223c6\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 in the grain boundary octonion (GBO) sense (multiply by 2 to convert to misorientation angle).

However, progress in drug discovery and development has been hindered by challenges in the determination of high-resolution RNA structures and a limited understanding of the parameters that drive RNA recognition by small molecules, including a lack of validated quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Herein, we developed QSAR models that quantitatively predict both thermodynamic and kinetic-based binding parameters of small molecules and the HIV-1 TAR model RNA system. A set of small molecules bearing diverse scaffolds was screened against the HIV-1-TAR construct using surface plasmon resonance, which provided the binding kinetics and affinities. The data was then analyzed using multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with feature selection to afford robust models for binding of diverse RNA-targeted scaffolds. The predictivity of the model was validated on untested small molecules. The QSAR models presented herein represent the first application of validated and predictive 2D-QSAR using multiple scaffolds against an RNA target. We expect the workflow to be generally applicable to other RNA structures, ultimately providing essential insight into the small molecule descriptors that drive selective binding interactions and, consequently, providing a platform that can exponentially increase the efficiency of ligand design and optimization without the need for high-resolution RNA structures.", "date": "2021-12-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A greater understanding of the role of the protein environment in determining the local properties of the FDH active site would enable rational bioinspired catalyst design. In this study, we investigate the impact of the greater protein environment on the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the active site. To model the enzyme environment, we used a combination of long-timescale classical molecular dynamics (MD) and multiscale quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) simulations. We leverage the charge shift analysis method to systematically construct QM regions and analyze the electronic environment of the active site by evaluating the degree of charge transfer between the core active site and the protein environment.

Our evaluation reveals that the orientation of the sidechains and ligand conformations will alter the relative trends in the ESP observed for a given metal center or terminal chalcogen, highlighting the importance of sampling dynamic fluctuations in the protein. Overall, our observations suggest that the terminal chalcogen ligand identity plays an important role in the enzymatic activity of FDH.

Transient acyl radicals are rapidly added to alkenes delivering alkyl radicals, which undergo subsequent radical-radical cross-coupling with ketyl-type radicals, affording 1,2-dicarbonylation products.

Therefore, breathing the freshest air possible it is of outmost importance. Still, due to reduced ventilation rates, indoor air quality can be considerably worse than outdoor.

For very classical probe reaction of catalytic hydride catalytic reduction of \u2013NO2 to NH2 (herein reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP as an example), three abnormal experimental phenomena cannot be elucidated as such: 1) the hydrogen source of final product of 4-AP is originated from water solvent, rather than NaBH4 reducer; 2) reverse electron transfer between bimetals was observed, which is resisted to the normal thermaldynamic law; 3) even in the absence of any metals, for example just using carbon nanodots as supports, the reaction occurs. These observations indicates that the reduction of \u2013NO2 groups did not follow the classical metal-centered electron and hydride transfer mechanism, i.e., Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. We herein provide strong evidence that, the catalytic hydride reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP is though a completely new surface hydrous hydroxyl specie mediated concerted electron and proton transfer process, wherein owing to the space overlapping of p orbitals in hydrous hydroxyl intermediate, an ensemble of interface states are dynamically formed, which could be alternative channels for concerted electron and proton transfer. The main role of second metal of Pt is to regulate the density of surface hydrous hydroxyl intermediate and its interactive strength with metals. This new mechanism not only answers all the abnormal experimental observations above mentioned, but also provide some new insights to water and/or hydroxyl group promoted reaction involved the activation of small molecules (CO2, CO, N2, H2O etc.) in areas of electrochemistry, energy storage and metalloenzyme catalysis.

Alkaline water electrolysis is the main route for the production of high-purity hydrogen, but further improvements of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts are still needed. Industrial alkaline electrolysis relies on Ni-based catalysts, and here we describe a drastic improvement of HER activity of Ni in alkaline media using several model catalysts for HER obtained upon nickel surface modification in aqueous solution of rhodium salts, when a spontaneous deposition of rhodium takes place based on the chemical displacement reaction 3Ni + 2Rh3+ = 3Ni2+ + 2Rh. In the case of smooth Ni-poly electrodes, HER activity surpasses the activity of Pt-poly already after 30 s of exchange with Rh. SEM analysis showed that Rh is uniformly distributed, while surface roughness changes within 10%, agreeing with electrochemical measurements. Furthermore, XPS analysis has shown effective incorporation of Rh in the surface, while DFT calculations suggest that hydrogen binding is significantly weakened on the Rh-modified Ni surfaces. Such tuning of the hydrogen binding energy is seen as the main factor governing HER activity improvements. The same galvanic displacement protocols were employed for nickel foam electrodes and electrodeposited Ni on Ti mesh. In both cases, somewhat longer Rh exchange times are needed to obtain superior activities than for the smooth Ni surface, but up to 10 min. HER overpotential corresponding to \u221210 mA cm\u22122 for nickel foam and electrodeposited Ni electrodes, after modification with Rh, amounted to only \u22120.07 and \u22120.09 V, respectively.

Molecular dynamics studies suggest that the enzymes bind substrates using non-canonical binding interactions, which may serve as a handle to further manipulate reactivity. This approach demonstrates the versatility of these enzymes for controlling the reactivity of high-energy radical intermediates and highlight the opportunity for synergistic catalyst strategies to unlock new enzymatic functions.\n", "date": "2021-12-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Industrially, CO2 is captured using a variety of aprotic solvents due to their high CO2 solubility. However, most research efforts on electrochemical CO2 conversion use aqueous media and are plagued by competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water breakdown. Fortunately, aprotic solvents can circumvent HER; making it important to develop strategies that enable integrated CO2 capture and conversion in an aprotic solvent. However, the influence of ion solvation and solvent selection within nonaqueous electrolytes for efficient and selective CO2 reduction is unclear. In this work, we show that bulk solvation behavior within the nonaqueous electrolyte can control the CO2 reduction reaction and product distribution occurring at the catalyst-electrolyte interface. We study different TBA (tetrabutylammonium) salts in two electrolyte systems with glyme-ethers (e.g., 1,2 dimethoxyethane or DME) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a low and high dielectric constant medium, respectively. Using spectroscopic tools, we quantify the fraction of ion pairs that form within the electrolyte and show how ion-pair formation is prevalent in DME electrolytes and is dependent on anion type. More importantly, we show as ion-pair formation decreases within the electrolyte, CO2 current densities increases, and a higher CO Faradaic efficiency is observed at low overpotentials. Meanwhile, in an electrolyte medium where ion-pair fraction does not change with anion type (such as in DMSO), a smaller influence of solvation was observed on CO2 current densities and product distribution. By directly coupling bulk solvation to interfacial reactions and product distribution, we showcase the importance and utility of controlling the reaction microenvironment in tuning electrocatalytic reaction pathways.

As a representative example of a catalytic process featuring such intricacies, we here present a meticulous study of the mechanism of a cobalt-organophotoredox catalysed allylation of aldehydes. Importantly, the commonly proposed elementary steps in reductive metallaphotoredox chemistry are more complex than previously assumed. After initial reductive quenching, a transient charge-transfer complex forms that interacts with both the transition-metal catalyst, as well as the catalytic base. Surprisingly, the former interaction leads to deactivation due to induced charge recombination, while the latter promotes deprotonation of the electron donor, which is a crucial step in order to promote productive catalysis, but is often neglected. Due to the low efficiency of this process, the overall catalytic reaction is photon-limited and the cobalt catalyst remains in a dual resting state awaiting photoinduced reduction.

While photolysis of phenacyl amines leads to a rapid charge transfer and elimination, we found that a simple protonation of the amine enables the formation of azetidinols as single diastereomers. We provide evidence, through ultrafast spectroscopy, for the electron transfer from free amines in the excited state. Further, we characterize aza-Yang re- action by establishing the dependence of initial reaction rates on rates of photon absorption. Unanticipated change in reactivity in morpholine analogs is explained through interactions with the tosylate anion. Buchner reaction proceeds with slight preference for one diastereomer over the other, and successful reaction requires electron-donating carbene-stabilizing substituents.

We demonstrate herein that the redox property of a monocoordinated aluminylene 1 featuring only four valence electrons for the shell of Al can be boosted by a Lewis base. The coordination of 1 with an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) effectively shrinks the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the ensuing acyclic mono-NHC-stabilized aluminylene 2, which is isoelectronic with singlet carbenes. Moreover, such base coordination completely reverses the predominant chemical reactivity (i.e. electrophilicity/nucleophilicity) of aluminylenes. In marked contrast to 1, 2 readily undergoes a [4+1] cycloaddition reaction with naphthalene and biphenylene at room temperature. Remarkably, the enhanced ambiphilic nature of Al in 2 also enables facile cleavage of aromatic C\u2212C bonds of inert arenes in both intra- and intermolecular fashion affording 3 and 5.

Therefore, quantifying the different crystal phases, and the amount of amorphous content of ZIFs is becoming increasingly important for a better understanding of the structure-property relationship. Typically, crystalline ZIF phases are qualitatively identified from diffraction patterns.  However, accurate phase examinations are time-consuming and require specialized expertise. Here, we propose a calibration procedure (internal standard ZrO2) for the rapid and quantitative analysis of crystalline and amorphous ZIF phases from diffraction patterns. We integrated the procedure into a user-friendly web application, named ZIF Phase Analysis, which facilitates ZIF-based data analysis. As a result, it is now possible to quantify i) the relative amount of various common crystal phases (sodalite, diamondoid, ZIF-CO3-1, ZIF-EC-1, U12 and ZIF-L) in biomacromolecule@ZIF biocomposites based on Zn2+ and 2-methylimidazole (HmlM) and ii) the crystalline-to-amorphous ratio.

Despite the development and administration of different vaccines, the situation is still worrisome as the virus is constantly mutating to produce newer variants some of which are highly infectious. This raises an urgent requirement to understand the infection mechanism and thereby design therapeutic-based treatment for COVID-19. The gateway of the virus to the host cell is mediated by the binding of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the virus spike protein to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the human cell. Therefore, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a target to design therapeutics. The \u03b11 helix of ACE2 which forms direct contact with the RBD surface has been used as a template in the current study to design stapled peptide therapeutics. Using computer simulation, the mechanism and thermodynamics of the binding of six stapled peptides with RBD have been estimated. Among these, the one with two lactam stapling agents has shown binding affinity, sufficient to overcome RBD-ACE2 binding. Analyses of the mechanistic detail reveal that a reorganization of amino acids at the RBD-ACE2 interface produces favorable enthalpy of binding whereas conformational restriction of the free peptide reduces the loss in entropy to result in higher binding affinity. The understanding of the relation of the nature of the stapling agent with their binding affinity opens up the avenue to explore stapled peptides as therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2.

Kummeth; Jenny Y. Yang; Anastassia N. Alexandrova", "abstract": "Aqueous direct air capture (DAC) is a key technology toward a carbon negative infrastructure. Developing sorbent molecules with water- and oxygen-tolerance and high CO2 binding capacity is therefore highly desired. In this work, we analyze the CO2 absorption chemistries on amines, alkoxides, and phenoxides with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and search for the optimal sorbent using an inverse molecular design strategy. The alkoxides and phenoxides are found to be more suitable for aqueous DAC than amines thanks to their water-tolerance and capture stoichiometry of 1:1 (2:1 for amines). All three molecular systems are found to obey the same linear scaling relationship (LSR) between pK_(CO_2 ) and pK_a, since both CO2 and proton are bonded to the nucleophilic binding site through a majorly \u03c3 bonding orbital. Several high-performance alkoxides are proposed from the computational screening. In contrast, phenoxides have relatively poor correlation between pK_(CO_2 ) and pK_a, showing promise for optimization. We apply genetic algorithm (GA) to search the chemical space of substituted phenoxides for the optimal sorbent. Several promising candidates that break the LSR are discovered. The most promising off-LSR candidate phenoxides feature bulky ortho substituents forcing the CO2 adduct into a perpendicular configuration with respect to the aromatic ring. In this configuration, CO2 utilizes a different molecular orbital for binding than does the proton, and the pK_(CO_2 ) and pK_a are thus decoupled. The pK_(CO_2 )-pK_a trend and off-LSR behaviors are then confirmed by experiments, validating the inverse molecular design framework. This work not only extensively studies the chemistry of the aqueous DAC, but also presents a transferrable computational workflow for understanding and optimization of other functional molecules.", "date": "2021-12-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This annealing allowed for a systematic FeNi alloying at a nanoparticle whose compositions and structure began as a alpha-Fe rich core, and a thin gamma-Ni rich shell, into mixed phases resembling gamma-FeNi3 and gamma-Fe3Ni2. This was possible in part by controlling surface diffusion via annealing temperature, and the enhanced diffusion at the many grain boundaries of the nanoparticle.  Lattice expansion and phase change was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and composition was monitored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  Of interest is that no phase precipitation was observed (i.e., heterostructure formation) in this system and the XRD results suggest that alloying composition or alloy gradient is uniform. This uniform alloying was considered using calculations of bulk diffusion and grain boundary diffusion for Fe and Ni self-diffusion, as well as Fe-Ni impurity diffusion is provided. In addition, alloying was further considered by calculations for Fe-Ni mixing enthalpy (Hmix) and phase segregation enthalpy (HSeg) using the Miedema model, which allowed for the consideration of alloying favorability or core-shell segregation in the alloying, respectively.

But, the elucidation and origin of optoelectronic properties remains elusive. In this report, using widely used Au(I)-alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)-SRs, R = -(CH2)12H) with AIE characteristics as a model system, by judiciously manipulating the delicate surface ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigations and an isotope diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we evidenced that the structural water molecules (SWs) confined in the nanoscale interface or space are real emitter centers for photoluminescence (PL) of metal NCs and the aggregate of Au(I)-SRs complexes, instead of well-organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Interestingly, the aggregation of Au(I)-SRs generated dual fluorescence-phosphorescence emission and the photoluminescence intensity was independent on the degree of aggregation but showed strong dependency on the content and state of structural water molecules (SWs) confined in the aggregates. SWs are different from traditional hydrogen bonded water molecules, wherein, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form a weak electron interaction through spatial overlapping, which concomitantly constructs a group of interfacial states with \u03c0 bond characteristics, consequently providing some alternative channels (or pathways) to the radiation and/or non-radiation relaxation of electrons.

Today, explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations are fast enough that we can begin to use them to look for explanations of such thermodynamic puzzles. Additionally, when such simulations generate results that do not agree well with experiment, this may motivate further development of computational methods and force fields.  Here, we apply near-millisecond duration simulations to compute and analyze the binding of four peptidic ligands with the Grb2 SH2 domain, focusing on relative binding enthalpies. The ligands fall into matched pairs, which differ only in the presence or absence of a conformationally constraining bond, which preorganizes two of the ligands for binding. Prior experimental work had revealed, unexpectedly, that binding of the constrained ligands is favored enthalpically, rather than entropically, relative to their flexible<br />analogs. However, the present calculations yield the  opposite trend. On further analysis, the computed relative binding enthalpies are found to be small balances of much larger underlying differences in the mean energies of structural components, such as the ligand and the binding site residues. As a consequence, the deviations from experiment in the relative binding enthalpies represent small differences between these large numbers. We also  computed first order estimates of changes in configurational  entropy on binding. These suggest that the more rigid constrained ligands reduce the entropy of binding site  residues more than their flexible analogs do. The implications of these calculations for the use of simulations to understand the thermodynamics of molecular recognition, and for the computational analysis of binding thermodynamics, are discussed.", "date": "2018-02-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The general use of chemical methods for the functionalisation of proteins remains limited however by the frequent requirement for complicated reaction partners to be present in large excess, and harsh reaction conditions which are incompatible with many protein scaffolds. Herein we describe a site-selective organocatalyst-mediated protein aldol ligation (OPAL) that affords stable carbon-carbon linked bioconjugates at neutral pH under biocompatible conditions. OPAL enables rapid chemical modification of proteins within an hour using simple aldehyde probes in minimal excess, and is utilised here in the selective affinity tagging of proteins in cell lysate. Furthermore we demonstrate that the b-hydroxy aldehyde product of the OPAL can be functionalised a second time at neutral pH in a subsequent organocatalyst-mediated oxime ligation. This tandem strategy is showcased in the \u2018chemical mimicry\u2019 of a previously inaccessible natural dual post-translationally modified protein integral to the pathogenesis of the neglected tropical disease Leishmaniasis. <br />", "date": "2018-02-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioorganic Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The\nleading photocatalyst is some form of TiO<sub>2</sub>. A significant amount of\nwork has been undertaken to modifying TiO<sub>2</sub> to induce visible light\nabsorption. The structure and composition of the catalyst should facilitate separation\nof electrons and holes and having active sites on the catalyst is important to promote\nthe initial adsorption and activation of molecules of interest. In this paper\nwe present a first principles density functional theory (DFT) study of the\nmodification of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> (110) with nanoclusters of the alkaline\nearth metal oxides (MgO, Ca, BaO) and we focus on the effect of surface\nmodification on the key catalyst properties. The modification of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>\nwith CaO and BaO induces a predicted red shift in light absorption. In all\ncases, photoexcited electrons and holes localise on oxygen in the nanocluster\nand surface Ti sites, thus enhancing charge separation. The presence of these\nnon-bulk alkaline earth oxide nanoclusters provides highly active sites for\nwater and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption. On MgO-rutile, water adsorbs molecularly\nand overcomes a barrier of only 0.36 eV for dissociation whereby hydroxyls are\nstabilised. On CaO- and BaO-modified rutile water adsorbs dissociatively. We\nattribute this to the high lying O 2p states in the alkaline earth oxide\nmodifiers which are available to interact with water, as well as the non-bulk\nlike geometry around the active site. Upon adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> the\npreferred binding mode is as a tridentate carbonate-like species, as\ncharacterised by geometry and vibrational modes. The carbonate is bound by up\nto 4 eV.

Small ions are known\nto be repelled from the air-water surface leading to an increase in the surface tension\nin accordance with the Gibbs adsorption isotherm. The Jones-Ray effect refers to\nthe observation that at extremely low salt concentration the surface tension decreases\nin apparent contradiction with thermodynamics. Determining the mechanism that\nis responsible for this Jones-Ray effect is important for theoretically predicting the\ndistribution of ions near surfaces. Here we show that this surface tension decrease\ncan be explained by surfactant impurities in water that create a substantial negative\nelectrostatic potential at the air-water interface. This potential strongly attracts positive cations in water to the interface lowering the surface tension and thus explaining\nthe signature of the Jones-Ray effect.

The\neffect of surface curvature on this behavior is also examined and the implications\nfor unexplained bubble phenomena is discussed.

This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sampling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfortunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncertain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation timescales, so proper sampling with current techniques can require prohibitively long simulations.

When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over two orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics simulation. This is a first step towards applying this methodology to pharmaceutically relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding Modes of Ligands using Enhanced Sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.</div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Satisfying safety requirements can slow the pace of research, make it cumbersome, or cost significant amounts of money. The logic of rules can seem unclear. Compliance can feel like a negative incentive. So besides the obvious benefit that safety keeps one safe, why do some scientists preach \"safe science is good science\"? Understanding the principles that underlie this maxim might help to create a strong positive incentive to incorporate safety into the pursuit of groundbreaking science.<div><br /></div><div>This essay explains how safety can enhance the quality of an experiment and promote innovation in one's research. Being safe induces a researcher to have <b>greater control</b> over an experiment, which reduces the <b>uncertainty</b> that characterizes the experiment. Less uncertainty increases both <b>safety</b> and the <b>quality</b> of the experiment, the latter including <b>statistical quality</b> (reproducibility, sensitivity, etc.) and <b>countless other properties</b> (yield, purity, cost, etc.). Like prototyping in design thinking and working under the constraint of creative limitation in the arts, <b>considering safety issues</b> is a hands-on activity that involves <b>decision-making</b>. Making decisions leads to new ideas, which spawns <b>innovation</b>.</div>", "date": "2018-02-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

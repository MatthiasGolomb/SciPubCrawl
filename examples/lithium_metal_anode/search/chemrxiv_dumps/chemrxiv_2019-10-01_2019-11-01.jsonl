In many cases, DFTB can provide comparable accuracy to DFT at a fraction of the cost, enabling simulations on length- and time-scales that are unfeasible with first principles DFT. At the same time (and in contrast to empirical interatomic potentials and force-fields), DFTB still offers direct access to electronic properties such as the band-structure. These advantages come at the cost of introducing empirical parameters to the method, leading to a reduced transferability compared to true first-principle approaches. Consequently, it would be very useful if the parameter-sets could be routinely adjusted for a given project. While fairly robust and transferable parameterization workflows exist for the electronic structure part of DFTB, the so-called repulsive potential Vrep poses a major challenge. In this paper we propose a machine-learning (ML) approach to fitting Vrep, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The use of GPR circumvents the need for non-linear or global parameter optimization, while at the same time offering arbitrary flexibility in terms of the functional form. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to multiple elements at once, by fitting repulsive potentials for organic molecules containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

Here, we apply our unique droplet-based\nmicrofluidic devices to culture, perfuse, and sample secretions from primary\nmurine epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and from predifferentiated\nclusters of 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  Through\nautomated control, oil-segmented aqueous droplets (~2.6 nL) were sampled from\ntissue or cells at 3.5-second temporal resolution, with integrated enzyme\nassays enabling real-time quantification of glycerol (down to 1.9 fmol droplet<sup>-1</sup>).  This high resolution revealed previously\nunreported oscillations in secreted glycerol at frequencies of 0.2 to 2.0 min<sup>-1</sup>\n(~30-300 s periods) present in the primary tissue but not in clustered cells.  Low-level bursts (~50 fmol) released in basal\nconditions were contrasted with larger bursts (~300 fmol) during stimulation.  Further, both fold changes and burst\nmagnitudes were decreased in eWAT of aged and obese mice.  These results, combined with immunostaining\nand photobleaching analyses, suggest that gap-junctional coupling or nerve cell\ninnervation within the intact ex-vivo tissue explants play important roles in\nthis apparent tissue-level, lipolytic synchronization.  High-resolution, quantitative sampling by\ndroplet microfluidics thus permitted unique biological information to be\nobserved, giving an analytical framework poised for future studies of dynamic oscillatory\nfunction of adipose and other tissues.", "date": "2019-10-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Analytical Apparatus; Biochemical Analysis; Imaging; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While quantum chemical methods can provide reliable interaction energies for small molecule-nucleobase interactions, these come at a steep computational cost.  As a first step toward refining available tools for predicting small molecule-nucleobase interactions, we assessed the convergence of DFT-computed interaction energies with increasing binding site model size. We find that while accurate intercalator interaction energies can be derived from binding site models featuring only the flanking nucleotides for uncharged intercalators that bind parallel to the DNA base pairs, errors remain significant even when including distant nucleotides for intercalators that are charged, exhibit groove-binding tails that engage in non-covalent interactions with distant nucleotides, or that bind perpendicular to the DNA base pairs. Consequently, binding site models that include at least three adjacent nucleotides are required to consistently predict converged binding energies.

First, approximate electronic structure descriptions of FeS reactions by density functional theory are validated against high-level wave-function CCSD(T) calculations.  Solvation contributions are evaluated by an all-atom model with hybrid quantum chemical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potentials and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations.

Then, 20 reaction channels leading to two consecutive Fe--S bond ruptures were explored with this calibrated model. For all protonation states, nucleophilic substitution with concerted bond breaking and forming to iron is the preferred mechanism, both kinetic and thermodynamically. In neutral solution, proton transfer from water to the sulfur leaving group is also concerted.  Dissociative reactions show higher barriers and will not be relevant for FeS reactivity when exposed to solvent.

Here, we describe a novel electroless deposition process in the presence of anionic additives that yields additive-specific, shape-controlled, single-crystal plasmonic Au nanostructures on Ag(100) and Au(100) substrates. Deposition of Au in the presence of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions results in the formation of smooth Au(111)-faceted square pyramids that show large surface enhanced Raman responses. The use of halide additives such as Cl<sup>-</sup> and Br<sup>- </sup>that interact strongly with (100) facets produces highly textured hillock-type structures characterized by edge and screw-type dislocations (Cl<sup>-</sup>), or flat platelet-like features characterized by large area Au(100) terraces with (110) step edges (Br<sup>-</sup>).

However, associated high-voltage interfacial degradation processes require strategies for effective electrode surface passivation. Here, we show that an acidic surface treatment of a Li-rich NMC layered oxide cathode material leads to a substantial suppression of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> evolution, ~90% and ~100% respectively, during the first charge up to 4.8 V vs. Li<sup>+/0</sup>.

This treatment does not result in any loss of discharge capacity and provides superior long-term cycling and rate performance compared to as-received, untreated materials. We also quantify the extent of lattice oxygen participation in charge compensation (\u201cO-redox\u201d) during Li<sup>+</sup> removal by a novel ex-situ acid titration. Our results indicate that the peroxo-like species resulting from O-redox originate on the surface at least 300 mV earlier than the activation plateau region around 4.5 V. X-ray photoelectron spectra and Mn<i>-L</i> X-ray absorption spectra of the cathode powders reveal a Li<sup>+</sup> deficiency and a partial reduction of Mn ions on the surface of the acid-treated material. More interestingly, although the irreversible oxygen evolution is greatly suppressed through the surface treatment, our O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering shows the lattice O-redox behavior largely sustained. The acidic treatment, therefore, only optimizes the surface of the Li-rich material and almost eliminates the irreversible gas evolution, leading to improved cycling and rate performance.

In particular, the replacement of Ce by Zr to form CeO2-ZrO2 solid solutions was found to facilitate the reducibility of the oxide as well as to increase the oxygen storage capacity and the system thermal stability, compared to pure CeO2. This theoretical work employing DFT+U calculations, is a systematic study of the effects of Zr doping on the stoichiometric and reduced CeO2(111) surfaces to determine the preferred location of the Zr dopants at various concentrations, as well as to pinpoint how Zr doping affects the stability of near-surface oxygen vacancies -including the position of the Ce3+ ions. We found that for a given Zr content, the more stable structures do not correspond to those configurations with Zr located in the topmost O-Ce-O trilayer (TL1), but in inner layers, and the stability decreases with increasing Zr concentration. Regarding the formation of oxygen vacancies, it was found that the most stable configuration corresponds to the Zr atom located in the surface layer (TL1) neighboring a subsurface oxygen vacancy with next-nearest neighbor Ce3+, being the formation energy equal to 1.16 eV. The corresponding surface oxygen vacancy is 0.16 eV less stable. These values are by 0.73 and 0.92 eV, respectively, smaller than the corresponding ones for the pure CeO2(111) surface. The results are explained in terms of Zr- and vacancy-induced lattice relaxation effects. This study provides microscopic insight into the interplay between Zr-doping, vacancy formation, lattice relaxations, and the localization of the excess charge that will be key to understanding surface chemistry and catalysis on Zr-doped ceria surface, as well as conductive ceria-based materials for advanced applications.<br />", "date": "2019-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Significant amount of effort has been dedicated to developing rapid and reliable in silico methods. However, robust assessment of their performance is still a complicated issue, as it requires a performance measure applicable in the prospective setting and more importantly a true null model that defines the expected performance of random in an objective manner. Although many performance metrics, such as correlation coefficient (r2), mean unsigned error (MUE), and room mean square error (RMSE), are frequently used in the literature, a true and non-trivial null model has yet been identified. To address this problem, here we introduce an interval estimate as an additional measure, namely prediction interval (PI), which can be estimated from the error distribution of the predictions. The benefits of using the interval estimate are 1) it provides the uncertainty range in the predicted  activities, which is important in prospective applications; 2) a true null model with well-defined PI can be established. We provide one such example termed Gaussian Random Affinity Model (GRAM), which is based on the empirical observation that the affinity change in a typical lead optimization effort has the tendency to distribute normally N (0, s). Having an analytically defined PI that only depends on the variation in the activities, GRAM should in principle allow us to compare the performance of relative binding affinity prediction methods in a standard way, ultimately critical to measuring the progress made in algorithm development.<br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we demonstrate through density functional calculations that helical oligopeptides, depending on sequence can exhibit both positive and surprisingly also negative piezoresponse. While the overall molecular dipole moment may favor positive piezoresponse, individual hydrogen bonding interactions along the backbone have the opposite direction, enabling tailored sequences to yield either net expansion or contraction in response to an electric field.

Modeling and generation of graphs with efficient sampling is a key challenge for graphs. In particular, the non-uniqueness, high dimensionality of the vertices and local dependencies of the edges may render the task challenging. We apply our recently introduced method, Generative Examination Networks (GENs) to create the first text-based generative graph models using one-line text formats as graph representation. In our GEN, a RNN-generative model for a one-line text format learns autonomously to predict the next available character. The training is stopped by an examination mechanism checking validating the percentage of valid graphs generated. We achieved moderate to high validity using dense g6 strings (random 67.8 +/- 0.6, canonical 99.1 +/- 0.2). Based on these results we have adapted the widely used SMILES representation for molecules to a new input format, which we call linear graph input (LGI). Apart from the benefits of a short compressible text-format, a major advantage include the possibility to randomize and augment the format.  The generative models are evaluated for overall performance and for reconstruction of the property space. The results show that LGI strings are very well suited for machine-learning and that augmentation is essential for the performance of the model in terms of validity, uniqueness and novelty. Lastly, the format can address smaller and larger dataset of graphs and the format can be easily adapted to define another meaning of the characters used in the LGI-string and can address sparse graph problems in used in other fields of science.", "date": "2019-10-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While molecular fluorophores that show bright emission in solution are potential sources of these materials, their emission is frequently lost in the solid state preventing their direct translation to optical applications. Unpredictable packing and coupling of dyes leads to uncontrolled spectral shifts and quenched emission. No universal solution has been found since Perkin made the first synthetic dye 150 years ago. We report the serendipitous discovery of a new type of material that we call <i>small-molecule ionic isolation lattices</i>(SMILES) tackling this long-standing problem. SMILES are easily prepared by adding two equivalents of the anion receptor cyanostar to cationic dyes binding the counter anions and inducing alternating packing of dyes and cyanostar-anion complexes. SMILES materials reinstate solution-like spectral properties and bright fluorescence to thin films and crystals. These positive outcomes derive from the cyanostar. Its wide 3.45-eV band gap allows the HOMO and LUMO levels of the dye to nest inside those of the complex as verified by electrochemistry. This feature simultaneously enables spatial and electronic isolation to decouple the fluorophores from each other and from the cyanostar-anion lattice. Representative dyes from major families of fluorophores, viz, xanthenes, oxazines, styryls, cyanines, and trianguleniums, all crystalize in the characteristic structure and regain their attractive fluorescence.

Knowledge of these binding modes is important for understanding the interactions stabilizing the ligand in the binding pocket, and also for calculating accurate binding affinities. In this work, we use a hybrid molecular dynamics (MD)/non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to sample the different binding modes of several flexible ligands and also to estimate the population distribution of the modes. The NCMC move proposal is divided into three parts. The flexible part of the ligand is alchemically turned off by decreasing the electrostatics and steric interactions gradually, followed by rotating the rotatable bond by a random angle and then slowly turning the ligand back on to its fully interacting state. The alchemical steps prior to and after the move proposal help the surrounding protein and water atoms in the binding pocket relax around the proposed ligand conformation and increase move acceptance rates. The protein-ligand system is propagated using classical MD in between the NCMC proposals. Using this MD/NCMC method, we were able to correctly reproduce the different binding modes of inhibitors binding to two kinase targets -- c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 and  cyclin-dependent kinase 2 -- at a much lower computational cost compared to conventional MD and umbrella sampling.

The Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the earliest SNPs to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, and the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we report on over 250 \u03bcs of fully-atomistic, explicit solvent, temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the 91 residue BDNF prodomain, for both the V66 and M66 sequence. The simulations were able to correctly reproduce the location of both local and non-local secondary changes due to the Val66Met mutation when compared with NMR spectroscopy. We find that the change in local structure is mediated via entropic and sequence specific effects. We developed a hierarchical sequence-based framework for analysis and conceptualization, which first identifies \u201cblobs\u201d of 5-15 residues representing local globular regions or linkers. We use this framework within a novel test for enrichment of higher-order (tertiary) structure in disordered proteins; the size and shape of each blob is extracted from MD simulation of the real protein (RP), and used to parameterize a self-avoiding heterogenous polymer (SAHP). The SAHP version of the BDNF prodomain suggested a protein segmented into three regions, with a central long, highly disordered polyampholyte linker separating two globular regions. This effective segmentation was also observed in full simulations of the RP, but the Val66Met substitution significantly increased interactions across the linker, as well as the number of participating residues. The Val66Met substitution replaces \u03b2-bridging between Val66 and Val94 (on either side of the linker) with specific side-chain interactions between Met66 and Met95.The protein backbone in the vicinity of Met95 is then free to form \u03b2-bridges with residues 31-41 near the N-terminus, which condenses the protein. A significant role for Met/Met interactions is consistent with previously-observed non-local effects of the Val66Met SNP, as well as established interactions between the Met66 sequence and a Met-rich receptor that initiates neuronal growth cone retraction.</p>", "date": "2019-10-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biopolymers; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It is well known that the positive charge of these compounds is crucial to their function in biofouling prevention and as antimicrobials, however, methods for quantifying the number of positive charges on surface-bound polycations and peptides are necessary in order to predict, control, and optimize the design and therefore, the utility of these compounds. This Spotlight on Applications reports on such an approach that combines second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and atomistic simulations to obtain mechanistic insight into polycation-membrane interactions using supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) as our model system. We find that at high surface coverage, the large polycations we surveyed feature a considerably smaller percentage of ionization when compared to the smaller polycations and peptides. At these high charge densities, we suspect a pKa shift of the charged groups to lower charge-charge repulsion as well as the formation of a loop-like conformation such that less monomeric units form contact-ion pairs with the bilayer. Our sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy results complement our understanding of the polycation-membrane interaction. At a high density of the polycation poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), second-order spectral line shapes are consistent with the expulsion of interfacial water molecules possibly due to contact-ion pair formation between PAH and the lipid bilayer. This finding could be essential for understanding the underlying first steps of cell lysis and penetration by polycations and should be explored further.<br />", "date": "2019-10-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysical Chemistry; Interfaces; Optics; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Structure; Surface; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

When selecting new potential drug targets, it is important to assess the likelihood of finding suitable starting points for lead generation before pursuing costly high-throughput screening campaigns. By exploiting available high-resolution crystal structures, an in silico druggability assessment can facilitate the decision of whether, and in cases where several protein family members exist, which of these to pursue experimentally. Many of the algorithms and software suites commonly applied for in silico druggability assessment are complex, technically challenging and not always user-friendly. Here we applied the intuitive open access servers of DoGSite, FTMap and CryptoSite to comprehensively predict ligand binding pockets, druggability scores and conformationally active regions of the NUDIX protein family. In parallel we analyzed potential ligand binding sites, their druggability and hydrophobic-hydrophilic ratio using Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s SiteMap.

Subsequently, this initial dual ranking of druggable sites within the NUDIX protein family was benchmarked against experimental hit rates obtained both in-house and by others from traditional biochemical and fragment screening campaigns. The observed correlation suggests that the presented user-friendly workflow of a dual parallel in silico druggability assessment is applicable as a standalone method for decision on target prioritization in future screening campaigns. \n<br />", "date": "2019-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the science behind this new phenomenon pertaining to various Li-rich materials is still debated. Thus, it is of paramount importance to develop a robust set of analytical techniques to address this issue. Herein, we use a suite of synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopies as well as diffraction techniques to thoroughly characterize the different redox processes taking place in a model Li-rich compound, the tridimentional hyperhoneycomb \u03b2-Li2IrO3. We clearly establish that the reversible removal of Li+ from this compound is associated to a previously described reductive coupling mechanism and the formation of the M-(O-O) and M-(O-O)* states. We further show that the respective contributions to these states determine the spectroscopic response for both Ir L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoemissions spectroscopy (XPS). Although the high covalency and the robust tridimentional structure of this compound enable a high degree of reversibile delithiation, we found that pushing the limits of this charge compensation mechanism has significant effects on the local as well as average structure, leading to electrochemical instability over cycling and voltage decay. Overall, this work highlights the practical limits to which anionic redox can be exploited and sheds some light on the nature of the oxidized species formed in certain lithium-rich compounds.<br />", "date": "2019-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To suppress the formation of this crystalline phase and improve the electrochemical performance of Sibased anodes, three approaches were amalgamated: addition of a nickel adhesion sublayer, alloying of the silicon with titanium, and the addition of either carbon or TiO2 as a capping layer. The silicon-based films were analyzed by a suite of methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a variety of electrochemical methods, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to provide insights into the composition of the resulting solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). A nickel adhesion layer decreased the extent of delamination of the silicon from the underlying copper substrate, compared to Si deposited directly on Cu, which resulted in less capacity loss. Alloying of silicon with titanium (85% silicon, 15% titanium) further increased the stability. Finally, capping these multilayer electrodes with either a thin 10 nm layer of carbon or TiO2 resulted in the best electrode behavior, and lowest cumulative relative irreversible capacity. TiO2 is slightly more effective in enhancing the capacity retention, most likely due to differences in the resulting solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The combination of an adhesion layer, alloying, and surface coatings shows a cumulative suppression of the formation of c-Li3.75Si and SEI, resulting in the greatest improvement of capacity retention when all three are incorporated together. However, these strategies appear to only delay the onset of the c-Li3.75Si phase; eventually, the c-Li3.75Si phase will form, and at that point, the rate of capacity degradation of all the electrodes becomes similar.</div>", "date": "2019-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced 1H\u219215N CPMAS spectrum of h-BNNS displayed four distinct 15N resonances while a 2D 1H{14N} dipolar-HMQC spectrum revealed three distinct 14N environments. Plane-wave DFT calculations were used to construct model edge structures and predict the corresponding 11B, 14N and 15N SSNMR spectra. Comparison of the experimental and predicted SSNMR spectra confirms that zigzag and armchair edges with both amine and boron hydroxide/oxide termination are present.

This is especially true for the lithium-sulfur chemistry, in which energy storage capability depends on the complex growth and dissolution kinetics of lithium sulfide (Li2S) and sulfur (S8) during discharge and charge, respectively. In this work, we present a novel development of this method through combining operando XRD with simultaneous and continuous resistance measurement using an Intermittent Current Interruption (ICI) method. We show that a coefficient of diffusion resistance, which reflects the transport properties in the sulfur/carbon composite electrode, can be determined from analysis of each current interruption. Its relationship to the established Warburg impedance model is validated theoretically and experimentally. We also demonstrate for an optimized electrode formulation and cell construction that the diffusion resistance increases sharply at the discharge end point, which is consistent with the blocking of pores in the carbon host matrix. The combination of XRD with ICI allows for a direct correlation of structural changes with not only electrochemical properties but also energy loss processes at a non-equilibrium state, and therefore is a valuable technique for the study of a wide range of energy storage chemistries.<br />", "date": "2019-10-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This means, increasing accuracy of LBVS approaches may have a huge impact on increasing  chances of success. Since the databases processed in drug discovery campaigns are enormously large, this pre-selection process requires the use of fast and precise methodologies. The similarity between compounds can be measured using different descriptors such as shape, pharmacophore or electrostatic similarity. The latter is the goal of this work, i.e., we want to improve the process of obtaining the compounds most similar  to a query in terms of electrostatic similarity. To do so, the current and widely proposed methodology in the literature is based on the use of ROCS to assess the similarity of compounds in terms of shape and then evaluate a small subset of them with ZAP for prioritization  regarding electrostatic similarity. This paper proposes an alternative methodology that consists of directly optimizing electrostatic similarity and works with the entire database of compounds without using shape cut-offs. For this purpose, a new and improved version of the OptiPharm software has been developed. OptiPharm implements a parameterizable metaheuristic algorithm able to solve any optimization problems directly related to the involved molecular conformations. We show that our new method  completely outperforms the classical proposal widely used in the literature. Accordingly, we are able to conclude that many  of the compounds proposed with our novel approach could not be discovered with the classical one.

One important route for the production of DHPS includes sulfoglycolytic catabolism of sulfoquinovose (SQ) through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (sulfo-EMP) pathway. SQ is a sulfonated carbohydrate present in plant and cyanobacterial sulfolipids (sulfoquinovosyl diacylglyceride and its metabolites) and is biosynthesised globally at a rate of around 10 billion tonnes per annum. The final step in the bacterial sulfo-EMP pathway involves reduction of sulfolactaldehyde (SLA) to DHPS, catalysed by an NADH-dependent SLA reductase. On the basis of conserved sequence motifs, we assign SLA reductase to the \u03b2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (\u03b2-HAD) family, making it the first example of a \u03b2-HAD enzyme that acts on a sulfonic acid, rather than a carboxylic acid substrate.

Wu; Jenife Shafer; Aurora Clark", "abstract": "Liquid/liquid phase transitions are inherent to multicomponent solutions, which often contain a diversity of intermolecular interactions between their molecular constituents. In one such example, a phase transition is observed in liquid/liquid extraction where the nonpolar organic phase separates into two phases under sufficiently high metal and acid extraction by the amphiphilic extractant molecule. This deleterious phenomenon, known as third phase formation, complicates processing and limits efficiency. While empirically well documented, the molecular origin of this phenomenon is not understood. The prevailing conceptualization of the organic phase treats it as a microemulsion where extractant molecules form reverse micelles that contain the extracted aqueous solutes in their polar cores. Yet recent studies indicate that a microemulsion paradigm is insufficient to describe molecular aggregation in some solvent extraction systems, implying that an alternative description of aggregation, and explanation for third phase formation, is needed. In this study, we demonstrate that the formation of a third phase is consistent with crossing the liquid-liquid miscibility gap for a molecular solution rather than a Winsor II to Winsor III transition as presumed in the microemulsion paradigm. This insight is provided by using a graph theoretic methodology, generalizable to other complex multicomponent molecular solutions, to identify the onset of phase splitting. This approach uses connectivity obtained from molecular dynamics simulation to correlate the molecular-scale association of extractants and extracted solutes to the solution phase behavior using percolation theory. The method is applied to investigate a solvent extraction system relevant to ore purification and used nuclear fuel recycling: tri-n-butyl phosphate/uranyl nitrate/water/nitric acid/n-dodecane. In analogy to a molecular solution, immediately preceding the liquid-liquid coexistence curve from the single phase region, the metal-ligand complexes percolate. This demonstrates that describing this solution with microemulsion chemistry is neither applicable nor broadly required to explain third phase formation. Additionally, the method developed herein can predict third phase formation phase boundaries from simulation for this and potentially other solvent extraction systems.", "date": "2019-10-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Classical molecular dynamics simulation is a prevalent method for studying microscopic and thermodynamic properties of such interfaces. However, the extent to which these features can be reliably predicted, and the variations in predicted behavior, depend upon the force field parameters employed. At present, the impact of force fields upon simulated properties is relatively understudied. Yet recent advances to sampling and analysis algorithms are increasing the interpretation of simulation data and therefore understanding force field dependence is increasingly relevant. In this study, the impact of the force field of the surfactant tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), as well as that of water, is investigated at a water/(n-hexane + surfactant) interface. Empirical charge scaling was employed to modulate the hydrophilicity of the surfactant. As anticipated, the relative hydrophilicity of TBP influences a number of properties, including the adsorbed concentrations of TBP at the interface, and macroscopic properties that result from hydrogen bonding interactions, such as interfacial tension and width. The dynamic properties of solvents at the interface are strongly modulated by the variation in hydrogen bond strength caused by different charge scaling of the TBP model. This includes the residence times of water at the interface, where stronger water-TBP hydrogen bonding causes long-lived residences. Interestingly, there are a number of features that are relatively insensitive to the TBP hydrophilicity. In one important case, the concentration of water-bridged TBP dimers was only impacted for the least hydrophilic model. As these dimeric species are the building block of surface protrusions that lead to water transport across the interface, this implies that collective organizational patterns and surface structures that derive from multiple driving forces (e.g. TBP hydrophilicity and organic solvent free energies of solvation) are less sensitive to individual force field parameters. Further, we note that competitive interactions can \"cancel\" the effects of changing TBP charge on interfacial properties. One example is the orientation and hydrogen bonding structure of interfacial water, where the direct TBP-water hydrogen bonding competes against the indirect TBP-induced interfacial roughness. In combination, these observations may assist future simulation studies in calibrating surfactant models to, or interpreting results of, a broad range of dynamic, structural and thermodynamic properties.", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Atorvastatin is a statin with potential to cross the blood-brain-barrier, however, the concentrations necessary for a cytotoxic effect against cancer cells exceeds the concentration achievable via oral administration, which made the development of a novel atorvastatin formulation necessary. We characterized the drug loading and basic physicochemical characteristics of micellar atorvastatin formulations and tested their cytotoxicity against a panel of different glioblastoma cell lines. In addition, activity against tumor spheroids formed from mouse glioma and mouse cancer stem cells, respectively, was evaluated. Our results show good activity of atorvastatin against all tested cell lines. Interestingly, in the 3D models, growth inhibition was more pronounced for the micellar formulation compared to free atorvastatin. Finally, atorvastatin penetration across a blood-brain-barrier model obtained from human induced-pluripotent stem cells was evaluated. Our results suggest that the presented micelles may enable much higher serum concentrations than possible by oral administration, however, if transport across the blood-brain-barrier is sufficient to reach therapeutic atorvastatin concentration for the treatment of glioblastoma via intravenous administration remains unclear.<br />", "date": "2019-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biocompatible Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Surfactants; Drug delivery systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The enrolled undergraduate students were not only taught chemistry concepts (general chemistry and supramolecular chemistry) but were also asked to present the chemical concepts using attention-grabbing demonstrations to public-school students in the New Orleans area. In addition, the course covered multiple non-science topics, including the pedagogy of service learning, background on the New Orleans public-school system, and how to work with the community.

The restrained\nelectrostatic potential (RESP) approach is a highly regarded and widely used\nmethod of assigning partial charges to varied organic compounds. RESP uses gas-phase\nHF/6-31G* as the underlying quantum chemical method, intending the resulting\noverpolarization of molecules to approximate the self-polarization that occurs\nin the condensed phase setting. However, it is far from clear that this\nfortuitous overpolarization is optimal or consistent across all compounds. In\norder to reach a higher level of accuracy, we propose a next generation of this\napproach, termed RESP2. In RESP2, the charges are derived from higher-level quantum\nchemical calculations carried out for both gas and aqueous phase, the latter\nusing a continuum solvent model. The polarity of the final charges is tuned by\na mixing parameter, \u03b4, which scales the relative contributions of the gas- and\naqueous-phase charges. We find that simply substituting RESP2 charges for RESP\ncharges in the context of regular LJ parameters does not lead to clear\nimprovement in liquid-state densities and heats of vaporization but does\nimprove the accuracy of observables expected to depend most strongly on the\naccuracy of the charge model, i.e., dielectric constants and molecular dipole\nmoments.

A challenge that underpins this task is the partitioning of the data into groups of similar instances, and the analysis of the group populations. In molecular data sets, different groups of molecules may be hard to identify. However, if the distribution of a given data set is ignored then some of these groups may remain under-represented and the sampling biased, even if the size of data is large. In this study, we use the example of the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) data set to assess the challenges posed by imbalanced data and the impact that accounting for different groups during the selection of training data has on the quality of the resulting machine learning models. We employ a partitioning criterion based on the underlying rules for the CEP molecular library generation to identify groups of structurally similar compounds. First, we evaluate the performance of regression models that are trained globally (i.e., by randomly sampling the entire data set for training data). This traditional approach serves as the benchmark reference. We compare its results with those of models that are trained locally, i.e., within each of the identified molecular domains. We demonstrate that local models outperform the best reported global models by considerable margins and are more efficient in their training data needs. We propose a strategy to redesign training sets for the development of improved global models. While the resulting uniform training sets can successfully yield robust global models, we identify the distribution mismatch between feature representations of different molecular domains as a critical limitation for any further improvement. We take advantage of the discovered distribution shift and propose an ensemble of classification and regression models to achieve a generalized and reliable model that outperforms the state-of-the-art model, trained on the CEP data set.

We conclude that this rate of electron transfer is extremely fast compared to the timescale of the nuclear degrees of freedom, that is, the adsorption process.</i><br />", "date": "2019-10-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Also, CISS-induced spin polarization has a considerable promise for new spintronic devices and the design of quantum materials. The CISS effect is attributed to spin\u2013orbit coupling, but a sound theoretical understanding of the surprising magnitude of this effect in molecules without heavy atoms is currently lacking. We are taking an essential step into this direction by analyzing the importance of imaginary terms in the Hamiltonian as a necessary condition for non-vanishing spin polarization in helical structures. Based on first-principles calculations and analytical considerations, we perform a symmetry analysis of the key quantities determining transport probabilities of electrons of different spin orientations. These imaginary terms originate from the spin\u2013orbit coupling, and they preserve the Hermitian nature of the Hamiltonian. Hence, they are not related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry resulting from the fact that molecules are open systems in a junction. Our symmetry analysis helps to identify essential constraints in the theoretical description of the CISS effect. We further draw an analogy with the appearance of imaginary terms in simple models of barrier scattering, which may help understanding the unusually effective long-range electron transfer in biological systems.<br />", "date": "2019-10-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanodevices; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The native defect chemistry of the Li-stuffed garnets, and their response to doping, however, are not well understood, and it is unknown to what degree a simple vacancy-compensation model is valid.

These approaches show an essentially non-bonding character of the \u03c3 central CC interaction in propellane.

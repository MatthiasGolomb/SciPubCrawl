For instance, adsorbing alcohols at the surface of \u03b3-Al2O3 can prevent its chemical weathering. To make sure that \u03b3-Al2O3 remains a stable catalyst support under operating conditions in liquid water, it is crucial to design alcohols that cannot desorb easily. Taking ethanol as a typical example, we here compare the adsorption/desorption mechanism for two distinct adsorption modes of ethanol at the water/alumina interface using various DFT-based approaches. Thermodynamic integration simulations unambiguously identify ethoxy as the more stable adsorption mode. The presence of liquid water yields to adsorption barriers fo adsorption barriers\nof at least 20 kJ\u00b7mol-1. To better assess the effect of water, we perform 3D well-tempered metadynamics simulations that include a bias accounting for solvation effects and proton transfers at the interface. Activating the proton shuffling allows to explore a variety of protonation and hydration configurations and yields to higher barriers (up to 40 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121) than the ones predicted by thermodynamic integration where the solvent reorganisation was assumed to be decoupled from the desorption. This study illustrates the importance of treating explicitly solvation effects when modelling reactions at the solid/liquid interface.", "date": "2022-02-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Platforms for LC-MS-based global profiling quantify hundreds or thousands of small molecule metabolites and/or lipids using combinations of distinct methods and analyses to develop broad coverage of the metabolome with high analytical sensitivity and specificity. However, the breadth of coverage provided by global profiling assays still outpaces efforts to characterise them by annotating profile signals with their respective metabolite identities. Fully realising the utility of metabolomics in biomedical research requires closing this gap by more accurately defining the finite metabolome coverage provided by common LC-MS-based global profiling methods. To date, method characterisation activities have progressed in the absence of broadly accepted standard LC methods as parallel efforts at building in-house libraries. While methodological diversity is a natural consequence of different design constraints and priorities observed across laboratories, it does tend to relegate in-house libraries to silos of information and investment that fail to advance the broader metabolomics community. Here, the National Phenome Centre\u2019s established platform for LC-MS-based global profiling of small molecule metabolites and lipids is made open in its entirety. Complete and detailed protocols for reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography LC-MS methods are offered alongside discussion of the rationale for their design specifics. In addition to the formal protocols used routinely within the Centre, the reader is provided with notes for replication and adaptation of the methodology, as well as guidance on the preparation of biofluid samples to ensure their suitability for the analytical platform. The Centre\u2019s accompanying open-source software for data extraction and pre-processing is also reviewed, and finally the method-specific identity of more than 700 small molecule and lipid species is disclosed. We hope that the substantial annotation information is useful to metabolomics practitioners of all experience levels and promotes the subsequent disclosure and constructive comparison (e.g. for validation and collective growth) of other in-house libraries and their associated methods. For interdisciplinary research teams looking to introduce LC-MS based metabolomics to their biomedical research programmes, we offer the open platform as a turnkey solution and welcome the growth in collective knowledge that may arise from its implementation in others\u2019 hands.", "date": "2022-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Our results suggest that acceleration of Diels-Alder reactions do not arise from an increased number of hydrogen bonds at the transition state and charge transfer plays a significant role.

Since biomolecular signaling pathways are complicated and not easily identified through traditional experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) has often been used to study these biological pathways\u2019 structural and dynamical responses. Here, we carried out MD simulations for full-length chicken and human STING (chSTING and hSTING) proteins.

Here, we take a multi-scale quantum mechanical (QM) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) approach to reveal residue-specific sources of these differences in stability. QM reveals that the two benenodin-1 conformers involve distinct hydrogen bonding networks, with the enthalpically-favored conformer having more intra-peptide hydrogen bonds between Gln15 sidechain and nearby residues.

For a wide variety of inter-particle interactions, temperatures, and substrate types within the range of typical organic semiconductors and their processing conditions, we find remarkable universal scaling of the orientation at the interface with the free energy calculated from pair interactions between close-packed nearest neighbours and an empirically derived universal relationship between the entropy and the shape anisotropy and bulk volume fraction of the fluid particles. The face-on orientation of fluid particles at the solid interface is generally predicted to be the equilibrium structure, although the alignment can be controlled by tuning the particle shape and substrate type, while changing the strength of fluid--fluid interactions is likely to play a less effective role. At the vapour interface, only the side-on structure is predicted, and conditions for which the face-on structure may be preferred, such as low temperature, low interaction anisotropy, or low shape anisotropy, are likely to result in little orientation preference (due to the low anisotropy) or be associated with a phase transition to an anisotropic bulk phase for systems with interactions in the range of typical organic semiconductors.

Despite its remarkable clinical as well as analytical specificity and sensitivity, qRT-PCR necessitates pure nucleic acid free of any polymerase inhibitors (from complex biological matrices) as its substrate.  Similarly, isothermal NAATs (iNAATs), despite their advantage over qRT-PCR in terms of thermal cycler independence, still require pure nucleic acid as a template. The requirement of pure nucleic acid in turn warrants the use of spin-column mediated extraction with centralized high-speed centrifuges. Additionally, utilization of centralized real-time fluorescence readout and use of sequence-specific molecular probes like TaqMan further prevent their deployment in decentralized locations. To circumvent these disadvantages, we have envisioned a sample-to-answer workflow comprising of indirect sequence-specific magneto-extraction (also referred to as magnetocapture, magneto-preconcentration, or magneto-enrichment in this manuscript) followed by in situ fluorescence or electrochemical LAMP. This study, using SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid as the analyte, compared the analytical effectiveness of indirect and direct sequence-specific magneto-extraction followed by LAMP. Since contamination carryover may affect the efficacy of sequence-specific indirect magnetocapture, its performance in presence of excess host nucleic acid or serum was probed. Through these experiments, we have established a comprehensive limited resource-adoptable and highly specific nucleic acid detection method with the limit of detection of 2.5 copies/\uf06dL. Its advantage lies in the flexibility of using either centralized real-time SYBR-based fluorescence LAMP or portable electrochemical LAMP as the readout. Simultaneously, the performance with magneto-capture aided fluorescence and electrochemical LAMP readouts were weighed against each other in terms of analytical sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time. Additionally, the analytical efficacy of the magnetocapture-LAMP workflow was also checked against that of LAMP using pure nucleic acid as a template. Besides being the first report utilizing electrochemical LAMP to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, this would probably be the first study to make the analytical comparative assessment of magnetic preconcentration combined with in situ fluorescence and electrochemical LAMP.

Spinel LiMn2O4 (LMO) is a state-of-the-art material, which, in principle, could satisfy such requirements. However, an undesired cubic-tetragonal phase transition favors Jahn-Teller (J-T) spinel distortion, leading to severe capacity reduction upon cycling below 3 V. \nHere, we propose a dual-doping strategy for LMO, based on the partial substitution of Mn(III) with Fe(III) and Ti(IV) to design new active materials for high-capacity cathodes, namely LiFexMn2-x-yTiyO4 (LFMT), with Li/Mn ratio ranging between 1 and 1.7. The substitution of Mn with Fe and Ti suppresses the J-T distortion, which is often still evident in the case of Ti-doped LMO. This allows cycling in a wider voltage range (4.8-1.5 V), thus resulting in higher capacity and significantly improved stability.\nThe lithiation mechanisms were investigated by combining ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS analyses). It demonstrated that the only redox-active metal is Mn, while Fe and Ti are electrochemically inactive. The extensive electrochemical lithiation/delithiation of the LFMT compositions brought to unprecedented results, which give evidence of stabilizing cation disorder through the formation of Mn-rich and Mn-poor domains, which leades to two spinel phases with different Mn:Ti ratios. \nThese insights into the lithiation mechanism pave the way for a better understanding of the doping chemistry and electrochemistry of Mn-based spinels as cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.\n", "date": "2022-02-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The stability of the coacervates can be rationalized by the molecular structure of the metabolites, and we show that three negative charges for carboxylates or two negative charges complemented with an unsaturated functional group for phosphates and sulfates is sufficient for phase separation. We show that these metabolites remain reactive in compartmentalized systems. Protometabolic reactions that lead to an increased interaction with the oligopeptide can be exploited to induce the formation of coacervate protocells. The resulting coacervates can localize other metabolites and enhance their conversion. Finally, reactions of compartmentalized metabolites can also alter the physicochemical properties of the coacervates and ultimately lead to protocell dissolution if the reaction products decrease the coacervate stability.

These Ru catalysts exhibit exquisite retention of the cis geometry and tolerate many polar functional groups, enabling the synthesis of all-cis polyesters, polycarbonates, polyethers, and polysulfites.

MST, CETSA and DARTS assays confirmed the direct binding of MAFF with Lathyrol or ZCY020, a natural product sharing the same core scaffold structure. Further mechanism studies showed that ZCY020 was capable of inhibiting the formation of a MAFF homodimer, promoting MAFF-Nrf2 heterodimerization, and thus regulating the transcription and expression of downstream protein HO-1, thereby exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activity and promoting protective mitophagy in LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages and acute lung injury in mice.

The accuracy of predictions by a PP-LFER depends on the composition of the respective calibration data set. Generally, extrapolation outside the model calibration domain is likely to be less accurate than interpolation. In this study, the applicability domain (AD) of PP-LFERs was systematically evaluated by calculating the leverage (h) and prediction interval (PI). Repeated simulations with experimental data showed that the root mean squared error of predictions increased with h. However, the analysis also showed that PP-LFERs calibrated with a large number (e.g., 100) of training data were highly robust against extrapolation error. For such well-calibrated PP-LFERs, the common definition of extrapolation (h > 3 hmean, where hmean is the mean h of all training compounds) may be excessively strict. Alternatively, the PI is proposed as a metric to define the AD of PP-LFERs, as it provides a concrete estimate of the error range that agrees well with the observed errors, even for extreme extrapolations. Additionally, published PP-LFERs were evaluated in terms of their AD using the new concept of AD probes, which indicated the varying predictive performance of PP-LFERs in existing literature for environmentally relevant compounds.", "date": "2022-02-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are an alternative approach, allowing for the \"virtual synthesis\" of molecules and a prediction of their \u201cfitness\u201d for some property, with new candidates suggested based on good characteristics of previously generated molecules.

The desmamides are decapeptides, featuring O-glycosylation of tyrosine (in 1 and 2) and an unusual 3,5-dihydroxy-2-methyldecanoic acid residue. The biosynthesis of the desmamides was studied by substrate feeding experiments and bioinformatics. We describe herein the dsm biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and propose it to be associated with desmamide production. The discovery of this class of very abundant (>1.5% d.w.) bacterial lipoglycopeptides paves the way for exploration of their potential role in root endosymbiosis.", "date": "2022-02-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The crucial role of surface termination for the emission process is evidenced by comparing hydrogenated, hydroxylated and carboxylated nanodiamonds.

Storage of the mine tailings not only encroaches upon large areas of cropland but also arouses additional ecological and environmental risks especially when the toxics (e.g., arsenic) are leached out during the stormy weather.  Herein we demonstrate that geopolymerization of a mixture of the toxic-bearing mine tailings and the coal fly ash (FA) with a blending of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate solution can effectively immobilize extra arsenic (As) species derived from arsenic-bearing wastes in the geopolymer specimens, which also possess high compressive strengths (e.g., > 25 MPa for specimens with 54 wt.% FA and activated with 10 M NaOH), allowing them to be further used as low-carbon, cement-free building materials.  The geopolymer strength was found to depend clearly upon the NaOH concentration, the fly ash content, the arsenic content, and the curing time, with the maximum being 37.07 MPa for a specimen with 54 wt.% FA, 0.03 wt.% As activated with 10 M NaOH and cured for 28 days.  Leaching tests showed that all specimens can achieve an immobilization efficiency as high as 95.4% toward As, and that the leachabilities of both As and other toxic heavy metals are far below the limits of the Chinese leaching standard for hazardous wastes (GB 5085.3 \u2212 2007).  Microstructural analyses using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopic (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) indicate that the As species was physically encapsulated along with the formation of geopolymer gels at first, and then chemically incorporated into the crystalline phases (e.g., calcium silicate, and calcium silicate hydroxide) derived from the geopolymer gels as a result of prolonging the curing time.  The developed FA/MT-based geopolymers represent a promising green material for both the remediation of As-bearing lands and the construction industry.", "date": "2022-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Environmental Science; Wastes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The key step in biohybrid materials preparation is to harness the relevant biological pathways to produce synthetic polymers with predictable molar masses and defined architectures under ambient conditions.

In particular, CK2 acts as an anti-apoptotic protein and is found to be overexpressed in multiple cancer types.  To this end, the inhibition of CK2 is of  great interest with regard to the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics. ATP-site inhibition of CK2 is possible; however, this typically results in poor selectivity due to the highly conserved nature of the catalytic site amongst kinases. An alternative methodology for the modulation of CK2 activity is to inhibit the formation of the holoenzyme complex. This is possible, with the most notable example being CAM7117. However, CAM7117 contains unnatural amino acids, residues not directly involved in the binding to CK2, and its size limits further optimisations.  In this work, an iterative cycle of enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, molecular modelling and cellular assays were used to develop a functionalisable chemical probe for the CK2\u03b1/\u03b2 PPI.

Furthermore, its cell-permeable analogues, TAT-P8C9 and R3-P8C9, successfully inhibit cell proliferation.

It has been recently shown that different anionic lipid types can affect the properties of Ras in terms of dimerization/clustering on the cell membrane. To understand the effects of anionic lipids on key spatiotemporal properties of dimeric K-Ras4B, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the dimer K-Ras4B in the presence and absence of Raf[RBD/CRD] effectors on two model anionic lipid membranes: one containing 78% mol DOPC, 20% mol DOPS, and 2% mol PIP2 and another one with enhanced concentration of anionic lipids containing 50% mol DOPC, 40% mol DOPS, and 10% mol PIP2. Analysis of our results unveils the orientational space of dimeric K-Ras4B and shows that the stability of the dimer is enhanced on the membrane containing a high concentration of anionic lipids in the absence of Raf effectors. This enhanced stability is also observed in the presence of Raf[RBD/CRD] effectors although it is not influenced by the concentration of anionic lipids in the membrane, but rather on the ability of Raf[CRD] to anchor to the membrane. We generate dominant K-Ras4B conformations by Markov state modeling and yield the population of states according to the K-Ras4B orientation on the membrane. For the membrane containing anionic lipids, we observe correlations between the diffusion of K-Ras4B and PIP2 and anchoring of anionic lipids to the Raf[CRD] domain. We conclude that the presence of effectors with the Raf[CRD] domain anchoring on the membrane as well as the membrane composition both influence the conformational stability of the K-Ras4B dimer, enabling the preservation of crucial interface interactions.", "date": "2022-02-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We aimed to evaluate potential inhibitory effects of select dietary phenolics and their relevant gut microbial metabolites on TMA production via a human ex vivo-in vitro fermentation model. Various phenolics inhibited choline use and TMA production.

Here, an ultrathin catalytic film of amorphous alumina (4 nm) was integrated into a catalytic condenser device that enabled tunable electron depletion from the alumina active layer and correspondingly stronger Lewis acidity. The catalytic condenser had the following structure: amorphous alumina/graphene/HfO2 dielectric (70 nm)/p-type Si. Application of positive voltages up to +3 V between graphene and the p-type Si resulted in electrons flowing out of the alumina; positive charge accumulated in the catalyst. Temperature programmed surface reaction of thermocatalytic isopropanol dehydration to propene on the charged alumina surface revealed a shift in the propene formation peak temperature of up to \u0394T(peak)~50 \u2070C relative to the uncharged film, consistent with a 16 kJ/mol (0.17 eV) reduction in the apparent activation energy. Electrical characterization of the thin amorphous alumina film by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) indicates the film is a defective semiconductor with an appreciable density of in-gap electronic states. Density functional theory calculations of isopropanol binding on the pentacoordinate aluminum active sites indicate significant binding energy changes (\u0394BE) up to 60 kJ/mol (0.62 eV) for 0.125 e- depletion per active site, supporting the experimental findings.

Non-invasive identification of drug-resistant tumours will enable modification of the patient treatment pathway through the selection of appropriate second-line treatments. Here, we have designed a pro-drug radiotracer for the non-invasive imaging of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) activity. Elevated ALDH1A1 activity is a marker of drug-resistant cancer cells, modelled here with matched cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. The aromatic aldehyde of our prodrug radiotracer was intracellularly liberated by esterase cleavage of the geminal diacetate and specifically trapped by ALDH through its conversion to the charged carboxylic acid. Through this mechanism of action, ALDH-specific retention of our pro-drug radiotracer in the drug-resistant tumour cells was twice as high as the drug-sensitive cells. Acylal masking of the aldehyde afforded a modest protection from oxidation in the blood, which was substantially improved in carrier-added experiments. In vivo positron emission tomography imaging of tumour-bearing mice produced high tumour-to-background images and radiotracer uptake in high ALDH-expressing organs but was unable to differentiate between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumours.

Their clinical potentialities reside in the wide range of mechanisms they can use for both killing microbes and modulating immune responses. However, the hugeness of the AMPs\u2019 chemical space (AMPCS), represented by more than 1065 unique sequences of 50 residues long or less, has represented a big challenge for the discovery of new promising sequences and for the identification of common structural motifs and even relevant biological functions. Here, we present a new approach based on network science and similarity searching to discover new promising AMPs, specifically antiparasitic peptides (APPs). We exploited the network-based representation of APPs\u2019 chemical space (APPCS) to retrieve valuable information by using three types of networks: chemical space (CSN), half-space proximal (HSPN), and metadata (METN). In the network analysis, some centrality measures were applied to identify in each network the most important and non-redundant nodes/peptides. Then, these central peptides were considered as queries (Qs) in group fusion similarity-based searches against an existing collection of known bioactive compounds, stored in the graph database starPepDB, to discover new potential APPs. The performance of the resulting multi-query similarity-based search models (mQSSMs) was evaluated in five benchmarking data sets of APP/non-APPs. The predictions performed by the best mQSSM showed a strong-to-very strong performance since their external Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values ranged from 0.834 to 0.965. Outstanding MCC values (> 0.85) were attained by the mQSSM with 219 Qs from both networks CSN and HSPN with 0.5 as similarity threshold in external datasets. Then, the performance of our best mQSSM was compared with the APPs prediction servers AMPDiscover and AMPFun. The proposed model showed its relevance by outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict APPs with statistically significant differences. After applying the best mQSSM and additional filters on the non-APP space, 95 AMPs were repurposed as potential antiparasitic leads. Due to the high sequence diversity of these peptides, different computational approaches were applied to identify relevant motifs for searching and designing new promising APPs. These results support that network-based similarity searches identify APPs with high effectivity and reliability.

The present go-to approach for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which despite being the most reliable method has few drawbacks including being lengthy and laborious. Approaching the diagnosis from an electrochemistry pathway is a relatively economical, decentralized and yet highly sensitive route. This work aims to construct an electrochemical (bio)sensor with 2-electrode geometry with a transition metal oxide (TMO) based sensing layer. We have fabricated a series of TiO2-V2O5 (TVO) nanocomposites to probe their electrochemical performance and attain a highly sensitive dual-electrode electrochemical sensor (DEES) compared to the pristine V2O5. The XRD analysis of the electrodes confirmed the formation of nanocomposite while the XPS analysis correlated the formation of oxygen vacancies with improved electrical conduction measured via EIS and I-V characterization.

However, the formation of such high-energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. Alternatively, oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three-electron bonds. In a three-electron bond, two electrons will occupy a bonding orbital and the third is forced into a high energy anti-bonding orbital (resulting in an \u201cupconverted\u201d highly-reducing species). The benefit of this \u201celectron upconversion\u201d process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.g., O2) and to avoid high-energy carbenium ion intermediates. To explore the scope of this approach, we directly compared two- and three-electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations. We observed that the absence of a strong oxidant can shut down two-electron pathways in favor of a three-electron path. Additionally, we investigated key factors involved in the three-electron C\u2212N bond formation by analyzing the cyclization of 42 radical anions. An interesting stereoelectronic feature for the reaction of highly stabilized diester anions is that only one of the ester groups is involved in the extra electron delocalization in the cyclized radical anion product.

At the heart of this sits the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory,[1] which has been a remarkably successful contribution to the field of materials science. The BET method was developed in the 1930s for open surfaces but is now the most widely used metric for the estimation of surface areas of micro- and mesoporous materials.[2] Since the BET method was first developed, there has been an explosion in the field of nanoporous materials with the discovery of synthetic zeolites,[3] nanostructured silicas,[4\u20136] metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),[7] and others. Despite its widespread use, the manual calculation of BET surface areas causes a significant spread in reported areas, resulting in reproducibility problems in both academia and industry. To prove this, we have brought together 60 labs with strong track records on the study of nanoporous materials. We provided eighteen already measured raw adsorption isotherms and asked these researchers to calculate the corresponding BET areas. This round-robin exercise resulted in a wide range of values for each isotherm. We demonstrate here that the reproducibility of BET area determination from identical isotherms is a largely ignored issue, raising critical concerns over the reliability of reported BET areas in micro- and mesoporous materials in the literature. To solve this major issue, we have developed a new computational approach to accurately and systematically determine the BET area of nanoporous materials.

The inclusion of exact exchange was shown to be essential for the correct description of the long-range asymptotics of electronic interactions and thus a well-balanced description of valence, Rydberg and charge-transfer excitations. Several approaches for an efficient treatment of exact exchange have been established for the ground state, while implementations for excited-state properties are rare. Furthermore, the high computational costs required for excited-state properties in comparison to ground-state computations often hinder large-scale applications on periodic systems with hybrid functional accuracy. We therefore propose two approximate schemes for improving computational efficiency for the treatment of exact exchange. Within the auxiliary density matrix method (ADMM), exact exchange is estimated using a relatively small auxiliary basis and the introduced basis-set incompleteness error is compensated by an exchange density functional correction term. Benchmark results for a test set of 35 molecules demonstrate that the mean absolute error introduced by ADMM is smaller than 0.2 pm for excited-state bond lengths and in the range of 0.02 - 0.06 eV for vertical excitation, adiabatic excitation and fluorescence energies. Computational timings for a series of covalent-organic frameworks demonstrate that a speed-up of at least one order of magnitude can be achieved for ES geometry optimizations in comparison to conventional hybrid functionals. The second method is to use a semi-empirical tight binding approximation for both Coulomb and exchange contributions to the excited-state kernel. This simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (sTDA) achieves an accuracy comparable to approximated hybrid density functional theory when referring to highly accurate coupled-cluster reference data. We find that excited-state bond lengths deviate by 1.1 pm on average and mean absolute errors in vertical excitation, adiabatic excitation and fluorescence energies are in the range of 0.2 - 0.5 eV. In comparison to ADMM-approximated hybrid functional theory, sTDA accelerates the computation of broad-band excitation spectra by one order of magnitude, suggesting its potential use for large-scale screening purposes.", "date": "2022-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In particular, their strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has raised much attention in recent years due to promising applications in the design of new optical materials. Whereas a number of important precedents report enantioselective syntheses of fused carbo- and heterohelicenes, a direct catalytic enantioselective method allowing the synthesis of lower, nonfused carbo[n]helicenes (n = 4-6) is still lacking. We report that Pd-catalysed enantioselective C\u2013H arylation in the presence of a unique bifunctional phosphine-carboxylate ligand provides a simple and general access to these simple carbo[n]helicenes. Computational mechanistic studies indicate that both the C\u2013H activation and reductive elimination steps contribute to the overall enantioselectivity. In addition, the observed enantio-induction seems to arise from a combination of noncovalent interactions and steric repulsion between the substrate and ligand during the two key reductive elimination steps. Moreover, the current method allows a comparative study of the CPL properties of lower carbo[n]helicenes, which led to the discovery that carbo[4]helicenes actually display CPL responses comparable to the higher carbo[6]helicene congeners.", "date": "2022-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

New regions of this chemical space can, nevertheless, be accessed by generating new ones which do not occur in Nature or, by modifying naturally-occurring polysaccharide structures. Collectively, we term these new polysaccharides (NPs). Two synthetic routes to NPs are described here; the de novo route, directly from monosaccharide starting materials and the functionalization route, involving glycosylation of existing polysaccharides. The reaction in both cases involves a simple condensation step under microwave heating, catalysed by benign organic acids. The approach is illustrated by the generation of structures with biological activities ranging from cell signalling and inhibition of bacterial growth to mimicking carbohydrate antigens from pathogenic microorganisms.

While significant progress has been made on flow battery materials and electrochemistry to improve energy density, conventional flow battery assemblies based on planar cell configuration exhibit low packing efficiencies and membrane surface area per volume of the cell, thus resulting in low volumetric power density. Here, we introduce a co-axial microtubular (CAMT) flow battery cell that significantly improves the volumetric power density. This cell design overcomes the intrinsic power limit of planar cell configuration and is suitable for all mainstream flow battery chemistries. Using zinc-iodide chemistry as a demonstration, our CAMT cell shows peak charge and discharge power densities of 1322 W/Lcell and 306.1 W/Lcell compared to average charge and discharge power densities of < 60 W/Lcell and 45 W/Lcell of conventional planar flow battery cells. In addition, the battery can cycle for more than 220 hours, corresponding to > 2,500 cycles at off-peak conditions. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that the CAMT cell is compatible with zinc-bromide, quinone-bromide, and all-vanadium chemistries. The CAMT flow cell represents a device-level innovation to enhance the volumetric power of flow batteries, and potentially reduce the size and cost of the cells and the entire flow battery.

To reach that goal, we decorate different numbers and types of electron-donors about a central MR-TADF core, DiKTa. Depending on the identity and number of donor groups, the excited state either remains short range charge transfer (SRCT) and thus characteristic of an MR-TADF emitter or becomes a long-range charge transfer (CT) that is typically observed in donor-acceptor TADF emitters. The impact is that in three examples, Cz-DiKTa, Cz-Ph-DiKTa and 3Cz -DiKTa, which emit from a SRCT state, the emission remains narrow, while in four examples, TMCz-DiKTa, DMAC-DiKTa, 3TMCz-DiKTa and 3DMAC-DiKTa, which emit via a CT state, the emission broadens significantly. Through this strategy, the organic light-emitting diodes fabricated with the three MR-TADF emitters show maximum electroluminescence emission wavelengths, \uf06cEL, of 511, 492 and 547 nm with moderate full-width at half maxima (FWHM) of 62, 61 and 54 nm, respectively. Importantly, each of these devices show high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 24.4%, 23.0% and 24.4%, which are amongst the highest reported with ketone-based MR-TADF emitters. OLEDs with D-A type emitters, DMAC-DiKTa and TMCz-DiKTa, also show high efficiencies, with EQEmax of 23.8% and 20.2%, but accompanied by broad emission at \uf06cEL of 549 and 527 nm, respectively. Noteworthy is that the DMAC-DiKTa-based OLED shows very small efficiency roll-off, and its EQE remains 18.5% at 1000 cd m-2. Therefore, this work demonstrates that manipulating the nature and numbers of donor groups decorating a central MR-TADF core is a promising strategy for both red-shifting the emission and improving the performance of the OLEDs.", "date": "2022-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Specifically, Pt-Ge alloy clusters supported on alumina undergo slow coking (carbon deposition) under conditions of thermal dehydrogenation, yet preserve strong binding sites.  For the case of Pt4Ge/alumina, theory shows a number of thermally populated isomers, one of which catalyzes carbon deposition.  Because the clusters are fluxional at high temperatures, this isomer acts as a gateway, slowly converting all the clusters to Pt4GeC2.  The surprising result is that Pt4GeC2 is highly catalytically active and selective against further coking, i.e., coking produces functional, stable catalytic clusters.  Ge and C2 have synergistic electronic effects, leading to efficient and highly selective catalytic dehydrogenation that stops at alkenes, and improving stability.

In recent years, Markov State Model (MSM) has become a powerful tool to investigate these functional conformational changes by predicting long time-scale dynamics from many short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  In MSM, dynamics are modelled by a first-order master equation, in which a biomolecule undergoes Markovian transitions among conformational states at discrete time intervals, called lag time.  The lag time has to be sufficiently long to build a Markovian model, but this parameter is often bound by the length of MD simulations available for estimating the frequency of interstate transitions. To address this challenge, we recently employed the generalized master equation (GME) formalism (e.g., the quasi-Markov State Model or qMSM) to encode the non-Markovian dynamics in a time-dependent memory kernel. When applied to study protein dynamics, our qMSM can be built from MD simulations that are an order-of-magnitude shorter than MSM would have required.  The construction of qMSM is more complicated than that of MSMs, as time-dependent memory kernels need to be properly extracted from the MD simulation trajectories. Here, we present a step-by-step guide on how to build qMSM from MD simulation datasets, and the materials accompanying this protocol are publicly available on Github: https://github.com/ykhdrew/qMSM_tutorial. We hope this protocol is useful for researchers who want to apply qMSM and study functional conformational changes in biomolecules.

The previous studies have extensively investigated the interaction of foreign objects with a moving solid-liquid interface in pure melts while in most real-life systems, solutes or surface active impurities are almost always present. Here we study experimentally the interaction of spherical oil droplets with a moving planar ice-water interface, while systematically increasing the surfactant concentration in the bulk liquid, using \\emph{in situ} cryo-confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that a small amount of surfactant in the bulk liquid can instigate long-range droplet repulsion, extending over a length scale of 40 to 100\u00b5m, in contrast to the short-range predicted previously (<1\u00b5m). We report on the droplet deformation, while they are in contact with the ice-water interface, as a function of the bulk surfactant concentration, the droplet size, and the crystal growth rate. We also depict the dynamic evolution of solute-enriched premelted films (~5\u00b5m). Our results demonstrate how an increasing concentration of surfactant in the bulk and its subsequent segregation during solidification can dramatically alter the solidification microstructures.

To counter this saline stress, cell often produces low molecular weight cosolutes, known as osmolytes, which have the ability to resuscitate homeostasis. Here we combine atomistic computer simulation, contact angle measurements and Raman spectroscopic analysis to identify the mechanistic role of multiple osmolytes (glycine, TMAO and betaine) in modulating the electrostatic interaction under salt stress, a slowly emerging aspect of osmoprotection. By utilising a pair of negatively charged silica surfaces in a ternary mixture of osmolyte and KCl solution as a proxy of charged surface of biomacromolecule, our investigation reveals that all three osmolytes are able to resurrect the electrostatic interaction between the two surfaces, which had been otherwise charge-screened by excess salt.   The joint venture of experiment and simulation discover dual and mutually exclusive mechanisms of recovering charge interaction by zwitter-ionic osmolytes. However, the relative ability and the underlying mechanism of revival of electrostatic interactions are found to be strongly dependent of chemical nature of osmolyte. Specifically, glycine was found to competitively desorb the salt-ions from the surface via its direct interaction with the surface. On the other hand, TMAO and betaine counter-act salt stress by retaining adsorbed cations but partially neutralising their charge-density via ion-mediated interaction. We believe that the access to dual and mutually alternative modes of osmolytic actions, as elucidated here, would provide the cell the required adaptability in combating salt-stress.", "date": "2022-02-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Proteochemometric modelling (PCM) is a promising approach for in-silico protein-ligand binding prediction that utilises both compound and target descriptors. However, in its original form PCM model cannot separate multiple assays associated with the same target. Therefore, a practitioner applying PCM approach to modelling experimental data has either to select only one assay for each target, and thus exclude potentially significant amount of data, or pull measurements from different assays together effectively mixing possibly very different functional dependencies between (protein, ligand) pairs and experimental measurements. Results: We describe two modifications of PCM models that increase its flexibility allowing to separate multiple assays associated with the same target. Evaluated on a subset of internal Bayer dose-response data and ChEMBL, these approaches result in improved performance compared to standard PCM models.

Multidisciplinary research was carried out to reduce the cost of manufacture and to revitalize an ancient technique. It involved several experimental phases of physicochemical, architectural and constructive analysis that resulted in the discovery of a key substance contained in the nopal mucilage. This substance not only enabled a good chemical interaction with lime, but also managed to function as a catalyst in the hydration and aging process of lime putties from its crystallographic modification. Moreover, it had a significant impact on the optimization of the mechanical and rheological properties of the mortars prepared with them, as well as on their behavior during the carbonation process and their ability to absorb moisture. The results that allowed to conclude this optimization were obtained from the characterization and comparison of the behavior of the new lime putties with pectin and the mortars prepared with them through analysis in SEM, XRD, as well as the adaptation of some established methods of analysis and many others proposed in the research for this binder and its by-products.

Further research\nalleviated the common genetic algorithm issue of evolutionary stagnation by enforcing molecular\ndiversity during optimisation [Van den Abeele, Chem. Sci., 2020, 42, 11485-11491]. The crucial\nlesson distilled from the simultaneous development of deep generative models and advanced genetic\nalgorithms has been the importance of chemical space exploration [Aspuru-Guzik, Chem. Sci., 2021,\n12, 7079-7090]. For single-objective optimisation problems, chemical space exploration had to be\ndiscovered as a usable resource but in multi-objective optimisation problems, an exploration of trade-\noffs between conflicting objectives is inherently present. In this paper we provide state-of-the-art\nand open-source implementations of two generations of graph-based non-dominated sorting genetic\nalgorithms (NSGA-II, NSGA-III) for molecular multi-objective optimisation. In addition, we provide\nthe results of a series of benchmarks for the inverse design of small molecule drugs for both the\nNSGA-II and NSGA-III algorithms.", "date": "2022-02-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, antibiotic resistant bacterial infections acquired during hospital stays have increased. Instead of designing and deploying new antibiotics which MRSA would quickly develop resistance to, adjuvants are a key strategy to combatting these bacteria. We have evaluated several small molecule antibiotic adjuvants that have strong potentiation with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and are likely inhibiting a master regulatory kinase, Stk1. Here, we investigated how the lead adjuvant exerts its effects in a more comprehensive manner. We hypothesized that the expression levels of key resistance genes would decrease once cotreated with a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (oxacillin) and the adjuvant (compound 8). Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses would reveal biochemical pathways enriched in differentially expressed genes. RNA-seq analysis showed 176 and 233 genes significantly up and downregulated, respectively, in response to cotreatment with compound 8 and oxacillin compared to oxacillin alone. Gene ontology categories that were significantly enriched among downregulated genes involved phosphotransferase systems. Most of the biochemical pathways enriched with significantly downregulated genes involved carbohydrate utilization, such as the citrate cycle and the phosphotransferase system. One of the most populated pathways was S. aureus infection. Results from an interaction network constructed with affected gene products supported the hypothesis that Stk1 is a target of compound 8. This study revealed a dramatic impact of our lead adjuvant on the transcriptome that is consistent with a pleiotropic effect due to Stk1 inhibition. These results point to this antibiotic adjuvant having potential broad therapeutic use in combatting MRSA.

Among novel synthetic opioids (NSOs), they dominate the recreational drug market and are the main culprits for the opioid crisis, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. By taking advantage of the crystal structures of the MOR, several groups have investigated the binding mechanism of fentanyl, but have not reached a consensus, in terms of both the binding orientation and the fentanyl conformation. Thus, the binding mechanism of fentanyl at the MOR remains an unsolved and challenging question. Here, we carried out a systematic computational study to investigate the preferred fentanyl conformations, and how these conformations are being accommodated in the MOR binding pocket. We characterized the free energy landscape of fentanyl conformations with metadynamics simulations, as well as performed long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations to compare and evaluate several possible fentanyl binding conditions. Our results indicate that the most preferred binding pose in the MOR binding pocket corresponds well with the minima on the energy landscape of fentanyl in the absence of the receptor, while the energy landscape can be reconfigured by modifying the fentanyl scaffold. The interactions with the receptor may stabilize a slightly unfavored fentanyl conformation in an alternative binding pose. By extending similar investigations to fentanyl analogs, our findings establish a structure-activity relationship of fentanyl binding at the MOR.

The dynamically harmonized ICR cell (ParaCell\u00a9) was recently introduced to achieve extreme spectral resolution capable to provide the isotopic fine structure of ions detected in complex samples. The latest improvement in ICR technology also includes 2\u03c9 detection which significantly reduces the transient time while preserving the nominal mass resolving power of the ICR cell. High-resolution MS images acquired on FT-ICR instruments equipped with 7T and 9.4T superconducting magnets and the dynamically harmonized ICR cell operating at suboptimal parameters, suffered severely from the pixel-to-pixel shifting of m/z peaks due to space-charge effects. The resulting profile average mass spectra have depreciated mass measurement accuracy and mass resolving power under the instrument specifications that affect the confidence level of the identified ions. Here we propose an analytical workflow based on the monitoring of the Total Ion Current to restrain the pixel-to-pixel m/z shift. Adjustment of the laser parameters is proposed to maintain high spectral resolution and mass accuracy measurement within the instrument specifications during MSI analyses.

AAP monolayers were deposited on alpha-Al2O3(0001) and showed reversible E/Z photo-switching that can trigger contact angle changes of up to ~10\u00b0. We monitored these changes on the macroscopic level by recording the contact angle while the monolayer was switched in situ. On the molecular level, time-dependent vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy provided information on the kinetic changes within the AAP monolayer and the characteristic times for E/Z switching. In addition, vibrational SFG at different relative humidity indicates that the thermal stability of the Z configuration is largely influenced by the presence of water which can stabilize the Z state and hinder E to Z switching of the AAP monolayer when it is wetted with H2O. Having established the switching times on the molecular scale, we additionally measured the dynamic contact angle and show that the time scales of the substrate and droplet dynamics can be extracted individually. For that, we report on a relaxation model, that is solved analytically and is verified via a comparison with simulations of a Lennard Jones system and with experimental data.

The permutational invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) method is used for fitting and the resulting total root mean squared error (RMSE) is extremely small, 0.026 kcal mol-1. Extensive dynamical and kinetic calculations are carried out on this new PIP-NN PES by the quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method. The calculated rate coefficients for H2 / D2 + NH2- agree well with the experimental results, which show an inverse temperature dependence from 50 to 300 K, consistent with the capture nature of this barrierless reaction. The significant kinetic isotope effect observed by experiment is well reproduced by the QCT computations as well. In addition, we report a unique phenomenon of significant reactivity suppression by exciting the rotational mode of H2, supported by both QCT and quantum dynamics (QD) calculations. Further analysis uncovers that exciting the H2 rotational mode would prevent the formation of the reactant complex and thus suppress reactivity.

How the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) of these two enzyme systems differentiate and determine their reactivity is not understood. In this work, we show that tyrosine placement in the SCS of non-heme iron halogenases have a huge impact on their structure, function, and reactivity. We discover that a tyrosine mutant (F121Y) in SyrB2 halogenase undergoes post-translational oxidation to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) physiologically. A combination of spectroscopic, mass-spectrometric, and biochemical studies show that the DOPA modification in SyrB2 renders the enzyme non-functional. Further bioinformatics analysis suggests that halogenases, unlike hydroxylases, have a conserved placement of phenylalanine at position 121 to preclude such unproductive oxidation. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of the SCS in controlling the structure and enzymatic activity of non-heme iron halogenases.

We demonstrate an inner-sphere route, opening a large phase space of heterogeneous electrocatalysts that can direct selectivity and drive the reaction. In our system, imine hydrogenation proceeds on a silver electrocatalyst at ambient conditions in methanol with an initial Faradaic efficiency toward the primary amine product of ~80% and partial current greater than 4 mA/cm2 at -1.96 V vs. Fc/Fc+ (-1.36 V vs. NHE). Silver was selected after evaluating diverse transition metal electrocatalysts, and with density functional theory, we found that the reaction rate on various metals is best described by the charge density distribution above the metal surface, independent of molecular adsorption energies. On silver, the catalyst that promotes amination with the highest Faradaic efficiency and one of the highest partial currents, the rate-determining step was found to be the initial electron transfer to the imine.

Four different concentrations of peptide, reducing agent (HEPES), and precursor (\\ce{HAuCl4}) were used to synthesize 64 different reagent combinations for each of the seven peptides.

Whereas many studies have evaluated long-range dispersion effects inside organic molecules and organometallics, less is known about their role in solvation.  Here, we have analysed the components within solute-solvent interactions of one of the most central iron-based photoswitch model systems, in two spin states. We find that long-range dispersion effects modulate the coordination significantly, and that this is accurately captured by density functional theory models including dispersion corrections. We furthermore correlate gas-phase relaxed complex-water clusters to thermally averaged molecular densities. This shows how the gas-phase interactions translate to solution structure as sampled by radial distribution functions, and we show that finite-size simulation cells can cause the radial distribution functions to have artificially enlarged amplitudes. Finally, we quantify the effects of many-body interactions within the solvent shells, and found that almost a fifth of the total interaction energy of the solute-shell system in the high-spin state comes from many-body contributions, which cannot be described by pair-wise additive force field methods.", "date": "2022-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Coordination Chemistry (Organomet.); Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

One important factor to be accounted for is the choice of the catalyst, which is required not only to accelerate nitrate reduction but also to direct the product selectivity of the electrolysis toward ammonia production. To this end, herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of novel Ni foam catalysts produced by means of a dynamic hydrogen bubble template and additive assisted electrodeposition process. The resulting 3D foam morphology of the catalyst is demonstrated to crucially govern its overall catalytic performance. Post-electrolysis cross-sectional SEM-EDX analysis (K mapping) demonstrated complete wetting of the 3D foam structure by the electrolyte. Ni foams deposited within 20 s exhibited outstanding selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction: more than 95% of the Faradaic efficiency of ammonia production was achieved in the particularly low potential range from -0.1 to -0.3 V vs. RHE. Hydrogen was found to be the only minor by-product of the nitrate reduction. Intriguingly, no other nitrogen containing products (e.g., NO, N2O, and N2) formed during electrolysis, thus indicating a highly efficient nitrate-to-ammonia conversion process. This significant improvement over the use of a planar Ni foil reference (33% FE at -0.3 V vs. RHE) is attributable to (i) the effective suppression of the HER in this potential regime and (ii) a high surface density of active sites for the nitrate reduction formed during Ni foam electrodeposition under extreme experimental conditions, e.g., at an applied geometric current density of -3 A cm-2. Trapping intermediates inside the primary macroporosity contributed to the excellent catalytic performance of the Ni foams. Identical location (IL) SEM analyses demonstrated the excellent structural stability of the novel Ni foam during extended catalyst stressing. These superior characteristics have not previously been reported for Ni and Ni rich catalysts, thus making the novel foam type of catalyst a highly promising candidate for truly selective and energy efficient nitrate-to-ammonia electroreduction and a promising alternative to mature copper-based catalysts.", "date": "2022-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We tracked its localisation in live cells by relying on its self-reporting fluorescence, observing accumulation of E-StyBtz2 into mitochondria; after several minutes of illumination it was then released into the cytosol concomitant with blebbing and cell death.

Their performance often relies on their unique optical properties that emerge from localized surface plasmon resonances in the ultraviolet. In order to tailor the nanowire geometry for a specific application, a correct understanding of the relationship between the wire\u2019s structure and its optical properties is therefore necessary. However, while the colloidal synthesis of silver nanowires typically leads to structures with pentagonally-twinned geometries, their optical properties are often modeled assuming a cylindrical cross section. Here, we highlight the strengths and limitations of such an approximation by numerically calculating the optical and electrical response of pentagonally-twinned silver nanowires and nanowire networks. We find that our accurate modeling is crucial to deduce structural information from experimentally measured extinction spectra of colloidally-synthesized nanowire suspensions and to predict the performance of nanowire-based near-field sensors. On the contrary, the cylindrical approximation is fully capable of capturing the optical and electrical performance of nanowire networks used as transparent electrodes.

The method (termed NE-RBFE) relies on the enhanced sampling of the end-states in bulk and in the bound state via Hamiltonian Replica Exchange, alchemically connected by a series of independent and fast nonequilibrium (NE) simulations. The technique has been implemented in a bi-directional fashion, applying the Crooks theorem to the NE work distributions for RBFE predictions. The dissipation of the NE process, negatively affecting accuracy, has been minimized by introducing a smooth regularization based on shifted electrostatic and Lennard-Jones non bonded potentials. As a challenging testbed, we have applied our method to the calculation of the RBFE\u2019s in the recent host-guest SAMPL international contest, featuring a macrocyclic host with guests varying in the net charge, volume, and chemical fingerprints. Closure validation has been successfully verified in cycles involving compounds with disparate Tanimoto coefficient, volume, and net charge. NE-RBFE is specifically tailored for massively parallel facilities and can be used with little or no code modification on most of the popular software packages supporting nonequilibrium alchemical simulations such as Gromacs, Amber, NAMD, or OpenMM. The proposed methodology bypasses most of the entanglements and limitations of the standard single topology RBFE approach for strictly congeneric series based on free energy perturbation, such as slowly relaxing cavity water, sampling issues along the alchemical stratification, and the need for highly overlapping molecular fingerprints.\n", "date": "2022-02-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Known enzymatic pathways for endoperoxide installation require multiple hydrogen-atom transfers (HATs). For example, iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent verruculogen synthase (FtmOx1; EC 1.14.11.38) mediates HAT from aliphatic C21 of fumitremorgin B, capture of O2 by the C21 radical (C21\u2022), addition of the peroxyl radical (C21-O-O\u2022) to olefinic C27, and HAT to the resultant C26\u2022. Recent studies proposed conflicting roles for FtmOx1 tyrosine residues, Tyr224 and Tyr68, in the HATs from C21 and to C26\u2022. Here, analysis of variant proteins bearing a ring-halogenated tyrosine or (amino)phenylalanine in place of either residue establishes that Tyr68 is the hydrogen donor to C26\u2022, while Tyr224 has no essential role. The radicals that accumulate rapidly in FtmOx1 variants bearing a HAT-competent tyrosine analog at position 68 exhibit hypsochromically shifted absorption and, in cases of fluorine substitution, 19F-coupled electron-paramagnetic-resonance (EPR) spectra. By contrast, functional Tyr224-substituted variants generate radicals with unaltered light-absorption and EPR signatures as they produce verruculogen. The previously reported alternative product of the Tyr68Phe variant, which is also produced in competition with verruculogen by wild-type FtmOx1 in 2H2O or with 2,3-F2Tyr, a poorer hydrogen donor than tyrosine, at position 68, is identified as the 26-hydroxy-21,27-endoperoxide product, likely formed via the C26-O-O\u2022 adduct of the longer-lived C26\u2022 with another O2 equivalent.

Despite their importance, methodologies to cross-couple strained rings have been underdeveloped. The most abundant source of strained carbocycles and heterocycles is the corresponding carboxylic acid, making methods that employ this substrate pool attractive. Coupling of these carboxylic acids with halides, a second source of abundant building blocks, would allow for rapid access to a diverse set of functionalized carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks containing all-carbon quaternary centers.

In this work, by utilizing a machine-learning regression technique, we have developed new low-cost quantum mechanical approaches to model large molecular systems. The developed approaches rely on using one-electron Gaussian-type functions called atom-centered potentials (ACPs) to correct for the basis set incompleteness and the lack of correlation effects in the underlying minimal or small basis set Hartree-Fock (HF) methods. In particular, ACPs are proposed for ten elements common in organic and bio-organic chemistry (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Cl) and four different base methods: two minimal basis sets (MINIs and MINIX) plus a double-\u03b6 basis set (6-31G*) in combination with dispersion-corrected HF (HF-D3/MINIs, HF-D3/MINIX, HF-D3/6-31G*), and the HF-3c method. The new ACPs are trained on a very large set (73832 data points) of non-covalent properties (interaction and conformational energies) and validated additionally on a set of 32048 data points. All reference data is of complete basis set coupled-cluster quality, mostly CCSD(T)/CBS. The proposed ACP-corrected methods are shown to give errors in the tenths of a kcal/mol range for non-covalent interaction energies and up to 2 kcal/mol for molecular conformational energies. More importantly, the average errors are similar in the training and validation sets, confirming the robustness and applicability of these methods outside the boundaries of the training set. In addition, the performance of the new ACP-corrected methods is similar to complete basis set DFT but at a cost that is orders of magnitude lower, and the proposed ACPs can be used in any computational chemistry program that supports effective-core potentials without modification. It is also shown that ACPs improve the description of covalent and non-covalent bond geometries of the underlying methods and that the improvement brought about by the application of the ACPs is directly related to the number of atoms to which they are applied, allowing the treatment of systems containing some atoms for which ACPs are not available. Overall, the ACP-corrected methods proposed in this work constitute an alternative accurate, economical, and reliable quantum mechanical approach to describe the geometries, interaction energies, and conformational energies of systems with hundreds to thousands of atoms.", "date": "2022-02-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The accurate calculation of non-covalent interaction energies, reaction\nenergies, and barrier heights requires choosing an appropriate functional and, typically, a relatively large\nbasis set. Deficiencies of the density-functional approximation and the use of a limited basis set are the\nleading sources of error in the calculation of non-covalent and thermochemical properties in molecular\nsystems. In this article, we present three new DFT methods based on the BLYP, M062X and CAM-B3LYP\nfunctionals in combination with the 6-31G* basis set and corrected with atom-centered potentials (ACPs).\nACPs are one-electron potentials that have the same form as effective-core potentials, except they do not\nreplace any electrons. The ACPs developed in this work are used to generate energy corrections to the\nunderlying DFT/basis-set method such that the errors in predicted chemical properties are minimized while\nmaintaining the low computational cost of the parent methods. ACPs were developed for the elements H,\nB, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Cl.

This necessitates the investigation of concurrent inhibition of multiple SARS-CoV-2 targets. We show that fortunellin (acacetin 7-O-neohesperidoside), a phytochemical, is a promising candidate for preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS by targeting multiple key viral target proteins, supporting protective immunity while inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis pathways, and protecting against tissue damage. Fortunellin is a phytochemical found in Gojihwadi Kwath, an Indian traditional Ayurvedic formulation with antiviral activity that has been shown to be effective in COVID-19 patients. The mechanistic action of its antiviral activity, however, is unknown. The current study comprehensively evaluates the potential therapeutic mechanisms of fortunellin in preventing and treating COVID-19 using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, free-energy calculations, host target mining of fortunellin, gene ontology enrichment, pathway analyses, and protein-protein interaction analysis. Using computational approaches, we show that fortunellin reliably binds to key targets that are necessary for viral replication, growth, invasion, and infectivity, including Nucleocapsid (N-CTD) (-51.30 kcal/mol) and Replicase-dimer ( -45.91 kcal/mol), Replicase-monomer-NSP-8 binding site (-29.9 kcal/mol), Papain-like-protease (-29.60 kcal/mol), Nucleocapsid-NTD (28.46 kcal/mol), 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase (-24.33 kcal/mol), Main-protease (-23.48 kcal/mol), Spike-RBD (-23.3 kcal/mol), Replicase-monomer at dimer interface (-23.27) kcal/mol, RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (-14.24 kcal/mol). Furthermore, we identify and evaluate the potential human targets of fortunellin and its effect on the SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues, including normal-human-bronchial-epithelium and lung cells, and organoids such as pancreatic, colon, liver, and cornea, using a computational network pharmacology approach. Thus, our findings indicate that fortunellin has a dual role: multi-target antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2, as well as immunomodulatory capabilities against the host.

Herein, two tetraphenylethenes (TPE) derivatives TPE-Py and TPE-MePy were synthesized and their effect on Hp-GQ equilibrium was explored. The FRET, CD and molecular docking experiments suggested that cationic TPE-MePy shifts the Hp-GQ equilibrium significantly towards the GQ conformer mainly through \uf070-\uf070  stacking and van der waals interaction. In presence of TPE-MePy the observed rate constant values for first and second folding step was increased up to 14.6 and 2.6-fold respectively. The FRET melting assay showed a strong stabilizing ability of TPE-MePy (\uf044Tm = 4.36 \uf0b0C). Notably, the unmethylated derivative TPE-Py did not alter the Hp-GQ equilibrium. Subsequently, the luciferase assay demonstrated that the TPE-MePy derivatives suppressed the translation efficiency by 5.7-fold by shifting the Hp-GQ equilibrium toward GQ conformers in 5\u2019 UTR of TRF2.

Among the diverse possibilities, H2 can be stored as a pressurized gas, cryogenic liquid, or solid fuel via adsorption onto porous materials. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as the adsorbent materials with the theoretical highest H2 storage densities on both a volumetric and gravimetric basis. However, a critical bottleneck for the use of H2 as a transportation fuel has been the lack of densification methods capable of shaping MOFs into practical formulations whilst maintaining their adsorptive performance. Here, we report a high-throughput screening and deep analysis of a database of MOFs to find optimal materials, followed by the synthesis, characterisation, and performance evaluation of an optimal monolithic MOF (monoMOF) for H2 storage. After densification, this monoMOF stores 46 g L-1 H2 at 50 bar, 77 K, and delivers 41 and 42 g L-1 H2 at operating pressures of 25 and 50 bar, respectively, when deployed in a combined temperature\u2013pressure (25-50 bar/77 K \u2192 5 bar/160 K) swing gas delivery system.

The band gap (Eg) and optical spectrum of 1 are calculated using both GW-BSE with zero-gap renormalization (ZGR) and hybrid TD-DFT, with the former method predicting a value (2.41 eV) in excellent agreement with our diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements (2.39 eV).

Especially their narrow photoluminescence paired with a high quantum yield are promising for light emission applications with high color purity. However, retaining these features in solid-state thin films together with an efficient encapsulation of the NPLs is a challenge, especially when trying to achieve high quality films with defined optical density and low surface roughness. Here we show photoluminescent polymer-encapsulated inorganic-organic nanocomposite coatings of 2D CdSe/CdS NPLs in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), which are prepared by sequential layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition. The electrostatic interaction between the positively charged polyelectrolytes and aqueous phase transferred NPLs with negatively charged surface ligands is used as driving force to achieve self-assembled nanocomposite coatings with well-controlled layer thickness and surface roughness. Increasing the repulsive forces between the NPLs by increasing the pH value of the dispersion leads to the formation of nanocomposites with all NPLs arranging flat on the substrate, while the surface roughness of the 165 nm (50 bilayers) thick coating decreases to Ra = 14 nm. The photoluminescence properties of the nanocomposites are determined by the atomic layer thickness of the NPLs and the 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid ligand used for their phase transfer. Both, the FWHM (20.5 nm) as well as the position (548 nm) of the nanocomposite photoluminescence are retained in comparison to the colloidal CdSe/CdS NPLs in aqueous dispersion, while the measured photoluminescence quantum yield of 5 % is competitive to state-of-the-art nanomaterial coatings.

This study introduces a novel application of magnetic hyperthermia to induce amorphization of a poorly aqueous soluble drug, celecoxib, in situ in tablets for oral administration. In situ amorphization can overcome the drug development hurdle of poor aqueous solubility by molecularly dispersing the drug in a polymeric network inside a tablet. However, current shortcomings of this approach include low drug loading in the tablets, toxicity of enabling excipients, and drug degradation. Here, SPIONs produced by flame spray pyrolysis are compacted with polyvinylpyrolidone and celecoxib, and exposed to an AMF. The degree of amorphization is strongly linked to the maximum tablet temperature achieved during AMF exposure, which depends on SPION composition and content in the tablets. Manganese ferrites exhibit no toxicity in human intestinal Caco-2 cell lines and are more effective than zinc ferrites in inducing complete amorphization of celecoxib. The resulting rapid dissolution and high solubility of in situ amorphized celecoxib in biorelevant intestinal fluid demonstrates the promising capability of SPIONs as enabling excipients to magnetically induce amorphization in situ in oral dosage forms.", "date": "2022-02-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Magnetic Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, despite their versatile properties, little is known about the assembling mechanism of Pl-Por conjugates and their molecular organization inside these assemblies. To gain a better understanding on their assembling properties, we synthesized two new series of Pl-Por conjugates with different alkyl sn2-chain lengths linked via an amide bond to either pheophorbide-a (PhxLPC) or pyropheophorbide-a (PyrxLPC). By combining a variety of experimental techniques with molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated both the assembling and optical properties of the Pl-Por either self-assembled or when incorporated into lipid bilayers. We demonstrated that Pl-Por conjugates can form assemblies that mimic lipid bilayer structures. Moreover, our results highlight that the non-covalent interactions between porphyrin cores play a central role in controlling both the structure of the lipid bilayer membranes and their subsequent optical properties. The fluidity of the phospholipid bilayer in which the Pl-Por conjugates were incorporated, was shown to play an important role in driving their interaction within the lipid matrix. Altogether, this work could be used as guidelines for the design of new Pl-Por conjugates that self-assemble into bilayer-like supramolecular structures with tunable morphology and optical properties.", "date": "2022-02-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Plasma membrane voltage is the most widely studied; however, the bilayers of organelles like mitochondria, lysosomes, nuclei, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also provide opportunities for ionic compartmentalization and the generation of transmembrane potentials. Unlike plasma membranes, organellar bilayers, cloistered within the cell, remain recalcitrant to traditional approaches like patch-clamp electrophysiology. To address the challenge of monitoring changes in organelle membrane potential, we describe the design, synthesis, and application of LUnAR RhoVR (Ligation Unquenched for Activation and Redistribution Rhodamine based Voltage Reporter) for optically monitoring membrane potential changes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of living cells. We pair a tetrazine-quenched RhoVR for voltage sensing with a transcyclooctene (TCO)-conjugated ceramide (Cer-TCO) for targeting to the ER. Bright fluorescence is observed only at the coincidence of LUnAR RhoVR and TCO in the ER, minimizing non-specific, off-target fluorescence. We show that the product of LUnAR RhoVR and Cer-TCO is voltage sensitive and that LUnAR RhoVR can be targeted to intact ER in living cells. Using LUnAR RhoVR, we use two-color, ER-localized, fast voltage imaging coupled with cytosolic Ca2+ imaging to validate the electroneutrality of Ca2+ release from internal stores. Finally, we use LUnAR RhoVR to directly visualize functional coupling between plasma-ER membrane in patch clamped cell lines, providing the first direct evidence of the sign of the ER potential response to plasma membrane potential changes. We envision that LUnAR RhoVR, along with other existing organelle-targeting TCO probes, could be applied widely for exploring organelle physiology.\n\n", "date": "2022-02-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Imaging; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We exploit active learning to simultaneously optimize methane activation and methanol release calculated with machine learning (ML)-accelerated density functional theory (DFT) in a space of 16M candidate catalysts with novel macrocycles. By constructing these macrocycles from fragments inspired by synthesized compounds, we ensure synthetic realism in our computational search. Our large-scale search reveals that low spin Fe(II) compounds paired with strong field (e.g. P or S-coordinating) ligands have the best energetic tradeoff between hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and methanol release. This observation is distinct from prior efforts that have focused on high spin Fe(II) with weak field ligands. By decoupling equatorial and axial ligand effects, we determine that negatively charged axial ligands are critical for more rapid release of methanol and, higher valency metals (i.e., M(III) vs M(II)) are unlikely to be suitable for methanol release. With full characterization of barrier heights, we confirmed that optimizing for HAT did not lead to large oxo formation barriers. Energetic span analysis revealed designs for an intermediate spin Mn(II) catalyst and a low spin Fe(II) catalyst that would lead to good turnover frequencies. This active learning approach is expected to be beneficial for search of large catalyst spaces where no prior designs have been identified and where linear scaling relationships between reaction energies or barriers may be limited or unknown.

The proposed approach focuses on learning the underlying governing partial differential equations in the form of a physics-constrained loss function to simulate adsorption processes accurately. The methodology developed herein does not require any system-specific inputs such as isotherm parameters. Accordingly, unique neural network models were built to fully predict the column dynamics of different constituent steps based on unique boundary conditions that are typically encountered in adsorption processes. The trained neural network model for each constituent step aims to predict the entire spatiotemporal solutions of different state variables by obeying the underlying physical laws. The proposed approach is tested by constructing and simulating four different vacuum swing adsorption cycles for post-combustion CO2 capture without retraining the neural network models. For each cycle, 50 simulations, each corresponding to a unique set of operating conditions, are carried out until the cyclic-steady state. The results demonstrated that the purity and recovery calculated from the neural network-based simulations are within 2.5% of the detailed model's predictions.

Typically, a CE model is built by fitting a few tens or hundreds of target quantities calculated by first-principles approaches. To validate the reliability of the model, a convergence test of cross-validation (CV) score to the training set size is commonly conducted to verify the sufficiency of training data. However, such test only confirms the convergence of the predictive capability of the CE model within the training set and it is unknown whether the convergence of the CV score would lead to robust thermodynamic simulation results such as order-disorder phase transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$. In this work, using carbon defective MoC$_{1-x}$ as a model system and aided by the machine-learning force field technique, a training data pool with about 13000 configurations has been efficiently obtained and used to generate different training sets of the same size randomly. By conducting parallel Monte Carlo simulations with the CE models trained with different randomly selected training set, the uncertainty in calculated $T_{\\rm c}$ can be evaluated at different training set size. It is found that the training set size that is sufficient for the CV score to converge still leads to a significant uncertainty in the predicted $T_{\\rm c}$, and that the latter can be considerably reduced by enlarging the training set to that of a few thousand configurations.

The H-cluster carries two cyanide and three carbon monoxide ligands, making it an excellent target for IR spectroscopy. In previous work, we identified an oxidized and protonated H-cluster species, whose IR signature differs from the oxidized resting state (Hox) by a small but distinct shift to higher frequencies. This \u2018blue shift\u2019 was explained by a protonation at the [4Fe-4S] sub-complex of the H-cluster. The novel species, denoted HoxH, was preferentially accumulated at low pH and in the presence of the exogenous reductant sodium dithionite (NaDT). When HoxH was reacted with H2, the hydride state (Hhyd) was formed, a key intermediate of [FeFe]-hydrogenase turnover. A recent publication revisited our protocol for the accumulation of HoxH in wild-type [FeFe]-hydrogenase, concluding that inhibition by NaDT decay products rather than cofactor protonation causes the spectroscopic \u2018blue shift\u2019. Here, we demonstrate that HoxH formation does not require the presence of NaDT (or its decay products), but accumulates also with the milder reductants tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, dithiothreitol, or ascorbic acid, in particular at low pH. Our data consistently suggest that HoxH is accumulated when deprotonation of the H-cluster is impaired, thereby preventing the regain of the oxidized resting state Hox in the catalytic cycle.", "date": "2022-02-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Facile synthetic substitution of a configurationally stable 1,14-dimethyl-[5]helicene with radical stabilizing groups at the 4,11-positions afforded two spin state switches as 4,11-dioxo or 4,11-bis(dicyanomethylidenyl) derivatives in a closed diamagnetic form.

Our analysis accounts for the spatial and temporal variability in cost and emissions attributes of electricity supply from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources and the grid, and its implications on plant design, operations, cost and emissions.

To gain further insight into bond breaking in mechanically stressed proteins, the mechanical strength of bonds in the polypeptide backbone are estimated using bond dissociation energies from model compounds for individual amino acids. This analysis shows that the N-C\u03b1 bond in proline has a bond dissociation energy that is ~60 kJ/mol less than the next weakest bond in a polypeptide backbone.

It is found that DFPN is inferior to both MCTS and Retro* and cannot be recommended in its current implementation. MCTS and Retro* are on a par with regard to search speed and the ability to find routes in which all starting material is in stock. However, MCTS outperforms Retro* when it comes to route quality and route diversity. MCTS more easily recovers the reference routes and tends to find a diverse set of solutions for a greater portion of the targets. We encourage practitioners and developers to benchmark their algorithms using PaRoutes and we envisage that the framework will become the community standard to compare retrosynthesis route predictions.

PISA produces nano-objects of different morphologies (e.g., spheres, vesicles and worms), with high solids content (~10\u201350 wt.%) and without additional surfactant. CDSA can finely control the self-assembly of block copolymers and readily forms non-spherical crystalline nano-objects and more complex, hierarchical assemblies, with spatial and dimensional control over particle length or surface area, which is typically difficult to achieve by PISA. Considering the importance of these two polymerization processes in the current scientific landscape of block copolymer self-assembly and the craze for their use in the biomedical field, this review will focus on the advances in PISA and CDSA to produce nano-objects suitable for biomedical applications in terms of (bio)degradability and biocompatibility. This review will therefore discuss these two aspects in order to guide the future design of block copolymer nanoparticles for future translation towards clinical applications.", "date": "2022-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Biocompatible Materials; Biodegradable Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The diversity of the features in the training data is an important factor for the generation of deep learning systems that generalise well and are not overfit to a specific type of input. In the case of chemical structure depictions, these features are defined by the depiction parameters such as bond length, line thickness, label font style and many others.\n\nHere we present RanDepict, a toolkit for the creation of diverse sets of chemical structure depictions. The diversity of the image features is generated by making use of all available depiction parameters in the depiction functionalities of the CDK, RDKit, and Indigo. Furthermore, there is the option to enhance and augment the image with features such as curved arrows, chemical labels around the structure, or other kinds of distortions. \n\nUsing depiction feature fingerprints, RanDepict ensures diversely picked image features. Here, the depiction and augmentation features are summarised in binary vectors and the MaxMin algorithm is used to pick diverse samples out of all valid options.\n\nBy making all resources described herein publicly available, we hope to contribute to the development of deep learning-based OCSR systems.\n", "date": "2022-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Quantifying the turnover of the key players in redox homeostasis is crucial for understanding their physiological dynamics and for targeting them in pathologies. However, suitably selective probes for assessing specific redox enzyme activities in cells are lacking. We rationally developed the first chemical probes targeting the mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) while fully resisting other cellular thiols and oxidoreductases. We used a cyclic selenenylsulfide as a thermodynamically stable and kinetically reversible trigger, oriented to harness the chemistry of TrxR's unique selenolthiol active site, and integrated it into modular probes releasing arbitrary cargos upon reduction. The probes showed remarkable selenocysteine-dependent sensitivity to cytosolic TrxR1, against a panel of oxidoreductases. Lead probe RX1 also had excellent TrxR1-selective performance in cells, as cross-validated by TrxR1 knockout, selenium starvation, TrxR1 knock-in, and TrxRselective chemical inhibitors. Its background-free fluorogenicity enabled us to perform the first quantitative high-throughput live cell screen for TrxR1 inhibitors. This indicated that tempered SNAr electrophiles may be a more favorable drug class than classically-used electrophiles. The RX1 design is thus a robust, cellularly validated, high-performance modular system for mammalian TrxR1. This sets the stage for in vivo imaging TrxR1 activity in health and disease, and can also drive and reorient TrxR1-inhibitor drug design. The thermodynamic and kinetic considerations behind RX1's selectivity also outline paths towards rationally-designed probes for other key players in redox biology.", "date": "2022-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Scanlon; Aron Walsh", "abstract": "Understanding the excited state properties of molecules provides insights into how they interact with light. These interactions can be exploited to design compounds for photochemical applications, including enhanced spectral conversion of light to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. While chemical discovery is time- and resource-intensive experimentally, computational chemistry can be used to screen large-scale databases for molecules of interest in a procedure known as high-throughput virtual screening. The first step usually involves a high-speed but low-accuracy method to screen large numbers of molecules (potentially millions) so only the best candidates are evaluated with expensive methods. However, use of a coarse first-pass screening method can potentially result in high false positive or false negative rates. Therefore, this study uses machine learning to calibrate a high-throughput technique (xTB-sTDA) against a higher accuracy one (TD-DFT). Testing the calibration model shows a ~6-fold decrease in error in-domain and a ~3-fold decrease out-of-domain. The resulting mean absolute error of ~0.14 eV is in line with previous work in machine learning calibrations and out-performs previous work in linear calibration of xTB-sTDA. We then apply the calibration model to screen a 250k molecule database and map inaccuracies of xTB-sTDA in chemical space. We also show generalizability of the workflow by calibrating against a higher-level technique (CC2), yielding a similarly low error. Overall, this work demonstrates machine learning can be used to develop a both cheap and accurate method for large-scale excited state screening, enabling accelerated molecular discovery across a variety of disciplines.", "date": "2022-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Dyes and Chromophores; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

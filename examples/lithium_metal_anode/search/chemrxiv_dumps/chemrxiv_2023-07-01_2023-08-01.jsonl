Thus, the overarching goal of this work is to provide a fast and accurate offline size and shape characterization tool. To this aim, we have designed and experimentally validated a combined imaging and chromatic confocal microscopy technique. We propose two modes of operation: one that facilitates the 3D reconstruction of particles at the expense of characterization time; and the other that facilitates rapid characterization without the need to 3D reconstruct the particles. We evaluate and validate the performance of our technique, using a commercial technique as a reference, by characterizing particles that exhibit differences in size and shape characteristics and optical properties.

This often requires assay modification or translation to a fluorescence version, which can be impractical. To address this issue, our group has developed the \u00b5Chopper device, which uses microfluidic droplet formation as a surrogate for an optical beam chopper, allowing for lock-in analysis and improved limits of detection with both absorbance and fluorescence optics without modifying the optical path length. Here, we have adapted the \u00b5Chopper to low-cost optics using a light-emitting diode (LED) source and photodiode detector, and we have fabricated the pnuematically valved devices entirely by 3D printing instead of traditional photolithography. Using a hybrid device structure, fluidic channels were made in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by moulding onto a 3D-printed master then bonding to a prefabricated thin layer, and the pneumatic layer was directly made of 3D-printed resin. This hybrid structure allowed an optical slit to be fabricated directly under fluidic channels, with the LED interfaced closely above the channel. Vacuum-operated, normally closed valves provided precise temporal control of droplet formation from 0.6 to 2.0 Hz. The system was validated against the standard plate reader format using a colorimetric fructosamine assay and by quantifying fructosamine in human serum from normal and diabetic patients, where strong correlation was shown. Showing a standard benefit of microfluidics in analysis, the device required 6.4-fold less serum volume for each assay. This \u00b5Chopper device and lower cost optical system should be applicable to various absorbance based assays in low volumes, and the reliance on inexpensive 3D printers makes it more accessible to users without cleanroom facilities.

Recently, the carbanion formation free energies as well as other ground-state electronic properties from the den- sity functional theory (DFT) calculations have been proposed as predictors of glutathione reactivities of Michael acceptors; however, no clear consensus exists. By profiling the thiol-Michael reactions of a diverse set of singly- and doubly-activated olefins including several model warheads related to afatinib, here we reexamined the question of whether low-cost electronic properties can be used as predictors of reaction barriers. The electronic properties related to the carbanion intermediate were found to be strong predictors, e.g., the change in the C\u03b2 charge accompanying carbanion formation. The least expensive reactant-only properties, the electrophilicity index and the C\u03b2 charge also show strong rank correlations, suggesting their utility as quantum descriptors. A second objective of the work is to clarify the effect of the \u03b2-dimethylaminomethyl (DMAM) substitution which is incorporated in the warheads of several FDA-approved covalent drugs. Our data suggests that the beta-DMAM substitution is cationic at neutral pH in solution and it promotes acrylamide\u2019s intrinsic reactivity by enhancing the charge accumulation at Calpha upon carbanion formation. In contrast, the inductive effect of the beta-trimethylaminomethyl substitution is diminished due to steric hindrance. Together, these results reconcile the current views of the intrinsic reactivities of acrylamides and contribute to large-scale predictive modeling and understanding of the structure-activity relationships of Michael acceptors for rational TCI design.", "date": "2023-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In the work presented here, we used classical dynamics simulation to understand energy transfer in formaldehyde-surface collisions and to probe the mechanism of interconversion of translational energy to rotational energy. Our simulations capture the trend of the experiments for the formaldehyde-Au scattering, both in terms of rotational energy distribution and trapping probabilities, and provide an atomic-level mechanism for the energy transfer process during the scattering process.", "date": "2023-07-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

To this end, the catalytic activity of nanoparticles, enzymes and homogeneous catalysts is recruited to induce reactions that are damaging to cancer cells. Thus, the pro-drug activation approach uses chemical constructs that become toxic species inside the tumor, typically following removal of a protecting group. In contrast, TME-based catalytic strategies do not rely on the introduction of foreign species and instead use molecules that are already present in the TME. So far, only four processes have been explored in relation to cancer therapy, two oxidation reactions (glucose and glutathione), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and production of oxygen to alleviate tumor hypoxia. This is surprising, since the rich chemical environment in tumor cells could in principle provide many other therapeutic opportunities. In particular, amino groups seem a suitable target, given the abundance of proteins and peptides in biological environments. Here we show that catalytic CuFe nanoparticles are able to foster transamination reactions between different amino acids and pyruvate, another key molecule that abounds in the TME. Transamination would then reduce the available aminoacid pool, which is likely to affect cell homeostasis and to effectively hinder tumor proliferation. After internalization of Cu-containing nanoparticles in U251-MG cells, we observed a significant decrease in glutamine and alanine levels up to 48 hours after treatment. In addition, we have found that not only simple amino acids, but also di- and tri-peptides undergo catalytic transamination when exposed to the Cu cations released by our nanoparticles, thus extending the range of the effects to other molecules such as GSSG. Mechanistic calculations for GSSG transamination revealed the formation of an imine between the oxo-group of pyruvate and the free -NH2 group of GSSG, followed by the coordination of the imine to Cu(II). Our results demonstrate that transamination reactions can be catalyzed in cellulo by Cu-releasing nanoparticles, adding a new reaction to the existing toolbox of catalytic therapies.", "date": "2023-07-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Nanoscience; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Most macroscopic experiments suggest that the air-water interface is basic based on the detection of negative charges at the interface that indicates the enrichment of hydroxides (OH\u2013), whereas microscopic studies mostly support the acidic air-water interface with the observation of the hydronium (H3O+) accumulation in the top layer of the interface. It is crucial to clarify the interfacial preference of OH\u2013 and H3O+ ions for rationalizing the debate. In this work, we perform deep potential molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the preferential distribution of OH\u2013 and H3O+ ions at aqueous interfaces. The neural network potential energy surface is trained based on density functional theory calculations with the SCAN functional, which can accurately describe the diffusion of these two ions both in the interface and in the bulk water. In contrast to the previously reported single ion enrichment, we show that both OH\u2013 and H3O+ surprisingly prefer to accumulate in interfaces, but at different interfacial depths, rendering a double-layer ionic distribution within ~1 nm below the Gibbs dividing surface. The H3O+ is preferentially adsorbed in the topmost layer of the interface, but the OH\u2013, which is enriched in the deeper interfacial layer, has a higher equilibrium concentration due to the more negative free energy of interfacial stabilization (\u20130.90 (OH\u2013) vs. \u20130.56 (H3O+) kcal/mol). The air-water interface is therefore negatively charged, in agreement with the macroscopic charge detection and not in contradiction with the microscopic studies.

Production and use of a few PFAS are restricted. Many alternatives have been introduced to the market, but some are as problematic as the original PFAS (i.e., regrettable substitution). This has led to discussions about regulation of PFAS as a chemical class, but a lack of PFAS-specific scientific knowledge on their physical properties prevents a detailed discussion on PFAS regulation. The Stratified Dipole-Arrays (SDA) theory provides fluorine-specific science to understand the unique properties of PFAS. It decisively reveals that the material properties of a single molecule and molecular aggregates are intrinsically different and therefore must be strictly discriminated. In addition, PFAS with longer fluoroalkyl chains containing seven or more carbon\u2013fluorine (CF2) groups can self-aggregate due to the combinatorial effect of the dipole moment along the carbon\u2013fluorine bond and the helical conformation around the molecular axis, which determines the properties of PFAS. The SDA theory also shows that shorter PFAS do not self-aggregate and act as single molecules with dipoles on their surfaces, which can interact with biological molecules. Expanding the SDA theory to incorporate the interaction between PFAS and biomolecules will improve understanding of the biological effects of PFAS.

In this study, we evaluated phenotypes associated with irreversible protein engagement of twenty-three electrophilic phytochemicals. This revealed a novel antiplatelet selectivity profile of the isothiocyanate-containing natural product sulforaphane (SFN), whereby the response of platelets to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist was impaired without affecting thrombin and collagen-related peptide (CRP) activation.

Mechanistic profiling studies revealed how SFN fine-tunes the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of PDIA6. In an electrolytic injury model of thrombosis, SFN enhanced the thrombolytic activity of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) without increasing blood loss.

Interfacing diamond in general, and nanoscale diamond (ND) in particular with silica is a potential route to integrate the quantum bit into a photonic device, fiber optic, cells or tissues with flexible functionalization chemistry. While silica growth on ND cores has been used successfully for quantum sensing and biolabeling, the surface mechanism to initiate growth was unknown. This report describes the surface chemistry responsible for silica bond formation on diamond and uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe the diamond surface chemistry and its electronic structure with increasing silica thickness. A modified St\u00f6ber (Cigler) method was used to synthesize 2\u201335 nm thick shells of SiO2 onto carboxylic acid rich ND cores and the diamond features and surface structure were characterized by overlapping techniques including electron microscopy.   Importantly, we discovered that SiO2 growth on carboxylated NDs eliminates the presence of carboxylic acids and that basic ethanolic solutions converts the ND surface to an alcohol-rich surface prior to silica growth. The data supports a mechanism that alcohols on the ND surface generate silyl-ether (ND-O-Si-(OH)3) bonds due to rehydroxylation by ammonium hydroxide in ethanol. Additionally, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) maps produced by the transition edge sensor supports the chemical analysis provided by XAS. The suppression of the diamond electronic structure as a function of SiO2 thickness was observed, and the Auger electron escape depth was modeled using the NIST database for the Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SESSA) to support our experimental results.

Herein we report an ionophore-based colorimetric sensor for electrolyte measurements in a small drop of blood. The sensor is a pipette microtip preloaded with a segment of oil (plasticizer) containing a pH-sensitive chromoionophore, a cation exchanger, and an ionophore. The analyte is extracted from the sample into the oil via a mixing protocol controlled by a stepper motor. The oil with an optimized ratio of sensing chemicals shows an unprecedentedly large color response for elec-trolytes in the very narrow concentration range of clinical relevance. This ultrahigh sensitivity is based on an exhaustive re-sponse mode with a novel mechanism of defining lower and higher limits of detection. Compared to previous optodes and molecular probes for ions, the proposed platform is especially suitable for at-home blood electrolyte measurements because 1) the oil sensor is interrogated independently from the sample and, therefore, works for whole blood without requiring plasma separation; 2) the liquid sensor does not need individual calibration as the consistency between sensors from the same solution or different batches of solution is high compared to solid sensors such as ion-selective electrodes and optodes; 3) the sensing system consisting of a disposable oil sensor, a programmed stepper motor, and a smartphone is portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly. The accuracy and precision of Ca2+ sensors are validated in 51 blood samples with varying con-centrations of total plasma Ca2+. Oil sensors with an ultrasensitive response can also be obtained for other ions such as K+.

Combined, these three imaging modalities produce images of biological length scales spanning meters to angstroms but are difficult to correlate. The cSeNP is comprised of an NADPH dependent enzyme that reduces selenodiglutathione to zerovalent Se precipitates. SeNP binding peptides fused to the enzyme ligate the Se precipitates, retain them at the enzyme, and regulate SeNP size to ~5 nm inside cells. The cSeNP-protein can be genetically fused to any protein-of-interest, creating a chimeric protein-of-interest-cSeNP. The cSeNPs endow the protein-of-interest with distinguishable contrast in X-ray and EM images, due to the contrast of SeNPs in these imaging modalities relative to biological background. The cSeNPs can react spontaneously with transition metals such as Znn+ or Cun+, forming fluorescent metal-selenides, imageable in florescence microscopy.

This timescale deficit of roughly 9 orders of magnitude presents a major challenge in the design of computer simulation methods for studying protein aggregation events. Thus, coarse-grained molecular simulations of amyloid fibril formation are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism behind the formation of these structures, which are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Type II diabetes. Network Hamiltonian simulations of aggregation are centered around a Hamiltonian function that returns the total energy of a system of aggregating proteins, given the graph structure of the system as input. In the graph, or network, representation of the system, each protein molecule is represented as a node, and non-covalent bonds between proteins are represented as edges. The parameter, i.e. a set of coefficients that determine the degree to which each topological degree of freedom is favored or disfavored, must be determined for each network Hamiltonian model, and is a well-known technical challenge. \n Here, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) called a genetic algorithm is introduced for autonomously parameterizing network Hamiltonian models, whereby an initial set of randomly parameterized models, typically of low fibril yield (e.g. < 5 %), is used to initiate the evolution of subsequent model generations, ultimately leading to high fibril yield models (e.g. > 70 %). The methodology is also demonstrated by applying it to optimizing previously published network Hamiltonian models for the 5 key amyloid fibril topologies that have been reported in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and showing that the models generated by the AI produce fibril yields that surpass or match previously published fibril yields in all cases. The authors also aim to encourage more widespread use of the  network Hamiltonian methodology by introducing a free open-source implementation of the genetic algorithm for fitting network Hamiltonian models to other self-assembling systems.", "date": "2023-07-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

There is a current need in the industry to develop alternatives to the current production process due to an increased demand for natural products, environmental safety and sustainability. This paper for the first time demonstrates a kinetic study for the simultaneous transesterification of geraniol and citronellol using Pseudomonas Fluorescens lipase to produce geranyl and citronellyl esters. The study initially screened the influence of the molar ratio of alcohol to vinyl acetate for individual alcohol transesterification, revealing that increasing the molar ratio led to higher ester yields. The optimised conditions were determined as follows: a molar ratio of 1:4, temperature of 40 \u00b0C, agitation speed of 250 RPM, and an enzyme loading of 10 wt.% of alcohol. After 24 hours, the conversion rates reached 95% and 87% for geraniol and citronellol, respectively. These conditions were then applied to the simultaneous transesterification of citronellol and geraniol, with the best experimental condition being a molar ratio of 1:8. The kinetic study demonstrated that the simultaneous transesterification followed a ternary complex mechanism with vinyl acetate inhibition, which was consistent with the experimental data. A preliminary experiment involving the transesterification of rose oil resulted in a conversion rate of 32% for citronellol and 50% for geraniol after 30 hours of reaction time. Overall, this study showcases the potential of enzyme catalysts to selectively produce terpene esters from heterogeneous terpene alcohol mixtures and can be extended to terpene alcohols present in natural essential oils.  \n\n", "date": "2023-07-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Biocatalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is another crucial nuclear receptor that regulates hepatic lipid, glucose, and steroid metabolism and is involved in endocrine disruption mechanism. The nonylphenol mixture has been described as an extremely potent activator of both human and rodent CAR.

Crossed molecular beams experiments were performed at an average center-of-mass (c.m.) collision energy of Ecoll = 77.5 kcal mol-1, with velocity- and angle-resolved product detection by a rotatable mass spectrometer detector. Non-reactive (N + O2) and reactive (NO + O) product channels were identified. In the c.m. reference frame, the non-reactively scattered N atoms and reactively-scattered NO molecules were both directed into the forward direction with respect to the initial direction of the reagent N atoms. On average, more than 90% of the available energy (Eavl = 77.5 kcal mol-1) was retained in translation of the non-reactive products (N + O2), whereas a much smaller fraction of the available energy for the reactive pathway (Eavl = 109.5 kcal mol-1) went into translation of the NO + O products, and the distribution of translational energies for this channel was broad, indicating extensive internal excitation in the nascent NO molecules. The experimentally derived c.m. translational energy and angular distributions of the reactive products suggested at least two dynamical pathways to the formation of NO + O. Quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations were performed with a collision energy of Ecoll = 77 kcal mol-1 using two sets of potential energy surfaces, denoted as PES-I and PES-II, and these theoretical results were compared to each other and to the experimental results. PES-I is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representation of multi-reference configurational interaction (MRCI) energies, while PES-II is a many-body permutation invariant polynomial (MB-PIP) fit of complete active space second order perturbation (CASPT2) points. The theoretical investigations were both consistent with the experimental suggestion of two dynamical pathways to produce NO + O, where reactive collisions may proceed on the doublet (12A) and quartet (14A) surfaces. When analyzed with this theoretical insight, the experimental c.m. translational energy and angular distributions were in reasonably good agreement with those predicted by the QCT calculations, although minor differences were observed which are discussed. Theoretical translational energy and angular distributions for the non-reactive N + O2 products matched the experimental translational energy and angular distributions almost quantitatively. Finally, relative yields for the non-reactive and reactive scattering channels were determined from the experiment and from both theoretical methods, and all results are in reasonable agreement.", "date": "2023-07-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein we report on the impact of RH on NPF from dark ozonolysis of cis-3-hexenyl acetate (CHA), a green-leaf volatile (GLV) emitted by vegetation. We \nshow that RH inhibits NPF by this BVOC, essentially shutting it down at RH levels > 1 %.

This difficulty arises because the contacts to these nanomaterials must be precisely fabricated with angstrom-level resolution to make reliable connections, and at manufacturing scales this cannot be achieved with even the highest-resolution lithographic tools. Here we introduce an approach that circumvents this issue by precisely synthesizing nanometer-scale gaps between metallic electrodes using a self-aligning, solution-phase process, which allows facile integration with conventional electronic systems with yields approaching 50%. The electrode separation is controlled by covalently binding metallic single-walled carbon nanotube (mCNT) electrodes to individual DNA duplexes to synthesize hybrid mCNT-DNA-mCNT nanojunctions, where the gap is precisely matched to the DNA length. Upon integration, the resulting single-molecule circuits have electronic properties dominated by the DNA in the junction, have reproducible conductance values with low dispersion, and are stable and robust enough to be utilized as active, high-specificity electronic biosensors for dynamic single-molecule detection of specific oligonucleotides, such as those related to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This scalable approach for high-yield integration of nanometer-scale materials will create new opportunities for manufacturing hybrid electronic systems for a wide range of applications.

In this study, we present a fluctuating charge model for zinc-containing metalloproteins based on the charge equilibration (Qeq) scheme.

During our study, we found that adding the Pauling-bond-order-like term (referred to as the \"+C term\" in a previous study) between the zinc ion and ligating atoms significantly improves the model's performance. Although our model was trained for four-coordinated zinc sites only, our tests indicated it can well describe the atomic charges in five- and six-coordinated zinc sites as well. Finally, we adapted our model to generate partial charges for the metal site in a zinc finger domain.

These strategies have been extended to enable multiple dehydrogenations that had led to aromatization depending on the substrate class. On a contrary, dehydrogenative transformations of aliphatic carboxylic acids offers substantial challenges. Engineered ligands in conjunction with metal catalysis can effectuate the dehydrogenation in carboxylic acids initiated by C-H activation with subsequent functionalization or vice versa; however, the reactivity and product formation vary with the substrate structure. Herein, we have developed a catalytic system that enables cyclohexane carboxylic acid to undergo multifold C-H activation to furnish olefinated arenes implying 3D to 2D conversion and thus, completely bypassing the lactone formation, showcasing a display of the change in reactivity of aliphatic carboxylic acids. The reaction occurs via a tandem dehydrogenation-olefination-decarboxylation-aromatization sequence which has been proved by various control experiments and isolation of key intermediates. For cyclopentane carboxylic acid which are reluctant to aromatization, the same catalytic system allows controlled dehydrogenation to provide difunctionalized cyclopentene derivatives via a tandem dehydrogenation-olefination-decarboxylation-allylic acyloxylation reaction sequence.

Upon elongation, short oligomers are prevalent in solution, while in the aggregated phase, longer oligomers are selected based on their aggregation propensity.

Such a challenge is shown in a myriad of facets, among them: difficulties in defining ground states multiplicities; disagreement in the results from methods considered highly accurate; and convergence problems in calculations for excited states.  These problems cause a scarcity of reliable theoretical data for transition metal containing systems.  In this work we explore the double d-shell effect, that plagues and makes difficult the application of multireference methods to this type of systems.  We propose an alternative definition for this effect based on the mixing among d-occupancy configurations, or the multi-d-occupancy character of the wave function.  Moreover, we present a protocol able to include this effect in multireference calculations using an active space smaller than the one usually used in the literature.  A molybdenum-copper model system and its copper subsystem are used as example study cases,  in particular, the molybdenum-copper charge transfer of the former and the electronic affinity of the latter.  We have shown that our alternative definition can be used to analyze their reference wave functions qualitatively.  Based on this qualitative description it is possible to optimize an active space without a second d-shell, able to obtain relative energies accurately. Seeing the double d-shell effect through the lens of a multi-d-occupancy character it is possible to correctly describe the wave function, improve the accuracy of the relative energies, and cheapen the multireference calculations.

In this review, we provide an update on recent experimental and theoretical developments in photo-induced PFAS degradation techniques over the past 2 - 5 years. We conclude with a perspective of promising research directions in this vibrant area and give recommendations on future experimental and computational approaches needed to further advance these photo-induced remediation capabilities.", "date": "2023-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Beyond signal transduction, the hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet and soft biological environment with the dry and hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of such hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials (graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes), fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid-crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys-PEDOT_X) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm^-1, and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys-PEDOT_X particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (< 150 \u03bcm) were printed with up to 10% loading of conductive particles. The ncrys-PEDOT_X particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug-and-play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.", "date": "2023-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Composites; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

PDMS samplers were deployed before and after the chlorination unit at a coastal treatment plant, and their extracts were analyzed using GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS. A multi-tiered stepwise screening procedure successfully screened out thousands of peaks, resulting in a final list of 22 candidate DBPs. The NMF spectral deconvolution improved the match factor score of unknown mass spectra to the reference mass spectra available in the NIST library by 17% and facilitated the identification of 7 additional DBPs. Brominated DBPs were prevalent, possibly due to seawater intrusion. The fate, behavior, persistence, and toxicity of the tentatively identified DBPs were evaluated using EPI SuiteTM and CompTox Chemicals Dashboard. The assessment of DBP toxicity unveiled significant toxicity levels to aquatic organisms and the potential for developmental toxicity, mutagenicity, and endocrine disruption in certain DBPs.  Furthermore, specific DBPs were found to be active in numerous bioassays within the CompTox databases, highlighting their roles in diverse molecular initiating events that contribute to adverse outcome pathways. Additionally, 11 DBPs exhibited recalcitrance to biodegradation and high persistence in the environment. This combined approach offers a powerful tool for future research and environmental monitoring, enabling accurate identification and assessment of DBPs and their potential risks.", "date": "2023-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Numerous studies have demonstrated that in diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), tau undergoes extensive remodeling. The attachment of post-translational modifications distributed throughout the entire sequence of the protein cor-relates with the clinical presentation. A systematic examination of these protein alterations can shed light on their roles in both healthy and diseased states. However, the ability to access these modifications in the entire protein chain is limited as tau can only be produced recombinantly or through semi-synthesis. In this paper, we describe the first chemical synthesis of the longest 2N4R isoform of tau, consisting of 441 amino acids. The 2N4R tau was divided into three major segments and a total of eleven fragments, all of which were prepared via solid-phase peptide synthesis. The successful chemical strategy re-lied on the strategic use of two cysteine sites (C291 and C322) for native chemical ligations (NCL). This was combined with modern preparative protein chemistries, such as threonine ligation (T205), diselenide-selenoester ligation (D358), and mutations of mercaptoamino acids into native residues via homogeneous radical desulfurization (A40, A77, A119, A157, A246, A390). The successful completion of the synthesis established a robust and scalable route to the native protein in multimilligram quantities and high purity. In broader terms, the presented strategy can be applied to the preparation of other shorter isoforms of tau, as well as to introduce all post-translational modifications that are characteristic of tauopathies such as AD, progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia.

When the perovskite electrode is screened for methanol electrooxidation reaction in 0.5 M KOH + 0.5 M methanol electrolyte, it delivers a two times higher current density.

In recent works, the assessment of EI has been revealed to be a very useful practical tool to select the most relevant spectral information before MCR analysis, key features being speed and compression ability. However, the canonical approach relies on principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the convex hull that encapsulates the data structure in the normalized scores space. This implies that the evaluation of the essentiality of each spectrum can only be achieved after all the spectra have been acquired by the instrument. This paper proposes a new approach to extract EI in the Fourier domain (EIFD). Spectral information is transformed into Fourier coefficients and EI is assessed from a convex hull analysis of the data point cloud in the 2D phasor plots of a few selected harmonics. Because the coordinate system of a phasor plot does not depend on the data themselves, the evaluation of the essentiality of the information carried by each spectrum can be achieved individually and independently from the others. As a result, time-consuming operations like Raman spectral imaging can be significantly accelerated exploiting a chemometric-driven (i.e., based on the EI content of a spectral pixel) procedure for data acquisition and targeted sampling. The usefulness of EIFD is shown by analyzing Raman hyperspectral microimaging data, demonstrating a potential 50-fold acceleration of Raman acquisition.", "date": "2023-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Microscopy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Glycosylation reaction mechanisms are difficult to control because in many cases the exact reactive species driving product formation cannot be detected and the product outcome cannot be explained by the primary reaction intermediate observed. In these cases, reactions are expected to take place via other low-abundance reaction intermediates that are in rapid equilibrium with the primary reaction intermediate via a Curtin-Hammett scenario. Despite this principle being well-known in organic synthesis, mechanistic studies investigating this model in glycosylation reactions are complicated by the challenge of detecting the extremely short-lived reactive species responsible for product formation.

Point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests have shown great promise in addressing this challenge. However, their dependence on complex traditional sample preparation methods remains a major challenge. To address this limitation, we present a paper-based sample preparation module that integrates bacterial cell lysis, DNA purification, and concentration using an electrokinetic technique called isotachophoresis (ITP). This is the first device that i) integrates electrochemical bacterial lysis with ITP, and ii) demonstrates the focusing of whole bacterial genomic DNA (gDNA) in paper. Characterization with buffers showed that the paper-based ITP sample preparation module (p-ITPrep) concentrated bacterial gDNA with an average concentration factor of 12X, and DNA could be extracted from a sample containing as few as 10^2 CFU/mL Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm).

Single vibronic level fluorescence spectroscopy (SVLF) was performed to determine the ground state vibrations of the molecule, which depicted a large Franck-Condon activity of the bands beyond 2600 cm-1. For the excited state, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and resonant two-colour two-photon ionization spectroscopy (R2PI) were performed. The band origin \u3016(0\u3017_0^0) for S1\u2190S0 transition appeared at 33910\u00b11 cm-1 . The Frank-Condon active vibrational modes in the spectra were seen till \u3016(0\u3017_0^0)+ 1600 cm-1 region, which suggested the similar ground and excited state geometries. The lower energy asymmetric vibrational modes at 207, 252 and 358 cm-1, observed in the excited state were absent in the SVLF spectrum. IR-UV double Hole Burning spectroscopy confirmed the absence of any other isomeric species in the molecular beam. Ionization potential (I.P) of the molecule was found to be 8.9310.001 eV, recorded using photoionization efficiency spectroscopy. The above value is significantly higher than the related azaindole derivatives. The ground and excited state N-H stretching frequencies of the molecule were determined using fluorescence-dip infrared spectra (FDIR) and resonant ion-dip infrared spectroscopy (IDIR), obtained at 3523 and 3467 cm-1, respectively. The lower value of NH in the electronic excited state implies the higher acidity of the group compared to the ground state.  Moreover, to understand the excited state properties of the molecule, a comparative analysis of the experimental LIF/2C-R2PI spectra was done against Franck-Condon simulated spectra at three different levels of theories. The vibrational frequencies calculated at B3LYP-D4/def2-TZVPP showed the most accurate prediction on comparison with the experimentally detected symmetric modes in the ground state. However, in the excited state, the low energy asymmetric modes were correctly determined at B3LYP/def-SVP level of theory. This is most probably due to the distortion observed at the pyrazolyl ring leading to the appearance of asymmetric vibrational modes. However, all the three methods have shown nearly similar correlation with the experimental frequencies in the excited state, which was evident from their similar scaling factors.", "date": "2023-07-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among the most promising new battery types are sodium-based battery systems. However, like its lithium predecessor, sodium batteries suffer from various issues like parasitic side reactions, which lead to a loss of active sodium inventory, thus reducing the capacity over time.  Some problems in sodium batteries arise from an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) reducing its protective power e.g., due to increased solubility of SEI components in sodium battery systems. While it is known that the electrolyte affects the SEI structure, the exact formation mechanism of the SEI is not yet fully understood. In this study, we follow the initial SEI formation on a piece  of sodium metal submerged in propylene carbonate with and without the electrolyte salt sodium perchlorate. We combine X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and density functional theory to unravel the sudden emergence of propylene oxide after adding sodium perchlorate to the electrolyte solvent.

For mixed organic carbonates (ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl-methyl carbonate (EMC) mixtures)-based electrolytes with LiPF6 as salt, we have compared a polarizable force field with the standard non-polarizable force field with and without charge rescaling to model the structural and dynamic properties. The result of our molecular dynamics simulations shows that both polarizable and non-polarizable force fields have similar structural factors, which are also in agreement with with X-ray diffraction experimental results. In contrast, structural differences are observed for the lithium neighborhood, while the lithium-anion neighbourhood is much more pronounced for the polarizable force field.  Comparison of EC/EMC coordination statistics with Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) shows the best agreement for the polarizable force field. Also for transport quantities such as ionic conductivities, transference numbers, and viscosities, the agreement with the polarizable force field is by far better for a large range of salt concentrations and EC:EMC ratios. In contrast, for the non-polarizable variants,  the dynamics are largely underestimated. The excellent performance of the polarizable force field is explored in different ways to pave the way to a realistic description of the structure-dynamics relationships for a wide range of salt and solvent compositions for this standard electrolyte.

However, ultrasmall NPs are typically prone to aggregation, which often leads to performance losses, such as severe deactivation in catalysis. Conventional stabilization strategies (e.g., immobilization, embedding, or surface modification by capping agents) are typically only partly effective and often lead to loss of catalytic activity. Herein, a novel type of stabilizers based on water-soluble ionic (K+ and Na+ containing) polymeric carbon nitride (i.e., K, Na-poly(heptazine imide) = K,Na-PHI) is reported that enables effective stabilization of highly catalytically active ultrafine (size of ~2-3 nm) gold NPs. Experimental and theoretical comparative studies using different structural units of K,Na-PHI (i.e., cyanurate, melonate, cyamelurate) indicate that the presence of functionalized heptazine moieties is crucial for the synthesis and stabilization of small Au NPs. The K,Na-PHI-stabilized Au NPs exhibit remarkable dispersibility and outstanding stability even in solutions of high ionic strength, which is ascribed to more effective charge delocalization in the large heptazine units, resulting in more effective electrostatic stabilization of Au NPs. The outstanding catalytic performance of Au NPs stabilized by K,Na-PHI is demonstrated using the selective reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol by NaBH4 as a model reaction, in which they outperform even the benchmark \u201cnaked\u201d Au NPs electrostatically stabilized by excess NaBH4. This work thus establishes ionic carbon nitrides (PHI) as alternative capping agents enabling effective stabilization without compromising surface catalysis, and opens up a route for further developments in utilizing PHI-based stabilizers for the synthesis of high-performance nanocatalysts.", "date": "2023-07-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Nanoscience; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Herein, we show that with judicious molecular engineering, the resulting structurally similar compounds emit via distinct photophysical mechanisms, which has a direct consequence on the OLED efficiency. When the pyrazine core is substituted with four carbazoles, the molecule 4CzPyz shows TADF in doped PPT film, with \u03a6PL of 75%, \u0394EST of 0.23 eV and \u03c4d of 1.8 \u00b5s.

However, a RISC process between higher-lying triplet excited states and the S1 state is hypothesized to be operational, supported by a combined photophysical and DFT study, to rationalize how the device with 3CzBPz shows an EQEmax of 9.6% (\u03bbEL = 464 nm), reflecting that greater than 86% of the excitons are converted into light in the OLED.

The DFT and photophysical studies indicate that 2CzBPz should act as a traditional blue fluorescence emitter. The OLED devices with 2CzBPz bear this out and exhibit an EQEmax 3.2% at a \u03bbEL of 446 nm.

Force fields have been extensively utilized to explore cooperativity in the formation of protein secondary structures and self-assembled systems. Multiple studies have demonstrated that polarizable force fields provide more accurate descriptions of this phenomenon compared to fixed-charge pairwise non-polarizable force fields, thanks to the incorporation of polarization effects. In this study, we assess the performance of the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the AMBER and OPLS non-polarizable pairwise force fields in capturing positive and negative cooperativity recently explored in neutral and charged molecular clusters using Density Functional Theory. Our findings show that polarizable and non-polarizable force fields qualitatively reproduce the relative cooperativity observed in electron structure calculations. However, AMBER and OPLS fail in describing absolute cooperativity. In contrast, AMOEBA accounts for absolute cooperativity by considering interactions beyond pairwise interactions. According to the energy decomposition analysis, it is observed that the electrostatic interactions calculated with the AMBER and OPLS force fields seems to play an important and counter-intuitive role in reproducing the adiabatic interaction energies calculated with Density Functional Theory. However, it is important to note that these force fields, due to their nature, do not explicitely incorporate many-body effects, which limits their ability to accurately describe cooperativity. On the other hand, frustration in polarizable and non-polarizable force fields is caused by changes in bond stretching and angle bending terms of the building blocks when they are forming a complex.", "date": "2023-07-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, complications arising from spatially-distributed disorder, the occurrence of multiple substrate binding modes, and the influence of hydration dynamics on solvent-exposed active sites still confound many experimental studies. Here we use ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy and covalently-tethered substrate analogs to examine dynamical properties of the promiscuous Pyrococcus horikoshii ene-reductase (PhENR) active site in two binding configurations mimicking proposed \u2018inactive\u2019 and \u2018reactive\u2019 Michaelis complexes.

Fermi resonant aryl-azide analogs that sense interactions of coupled oscillators are described. Lineshape and quantum beat analyses of these probes reveal characteristics that correlate with aryl-nitrile FFCF parameters, demonstrating that dynamical anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the water-exposed active site, where countervailing gradients of fast dynamics and disorder in the reactant ground state are maintained near the hydration interface. Our results suggest several plausible factors leading to state-selective rate enhancement and promiscuity in PhENR.

Here, we developed an orthogonal chemical strategy to prepare a heterodimeric peptide conjugate assembled on a protein-based nanoplatform.

Therefore, we used a recently developed reactive neural network-based potential for aluminosilicate zeolites in the protonic form including their interaction with the aqueous solution that has a capacity to accelerate simulation by orders of magnitude while retaining the reference level of accuracy.

Nanodroplets covered with negatively charged lipids induce the strongest water ordering, while droplets covered with positively charged lipids induce the weakest water ordering.

Towards this end, here we investigate naturally occurring osmolytes' scope as biocompatible cryoprotectant under cold-stress condition in high saline medium. Via a combination of simulation and experiment on charged silica nano-structures, we render first-hand evidence that  a pair of archetypal osmolytes glycine and betaine would act as cryoprotectant by restoring indigenous inter-surface electrostatic interaction, which had been a priori screened due to cold-effect under salt stress. While these osmolytes' individual modes of action are sensitive to the subtle chemical variation, a uniform augmentation in the extent of osmolytic activity is observed with increase in temperature to counter the proportionately enhanced salt screening. The trend as noted in inorganic nano-structures is found to be recurrent and robustly transferrable in a charged protein interface.

Inspired by biology, synthetic analogs of such chemical reaction cycles have been devised, and a widely used catalytic reaction cycle uses carboxylates as catalysts to accelerate the hydration of carbodiimides. The cycle is versatile and easy to use, so it is widely applied to regulate motors, pumps, self-assembly, and phase separation.  However, the cycle suffers from side reactions, especially the formation of N-acylurea. In catalytic reaction cycles, side reactions are disastrous as they decrease the fuel\u2019s efficiency and, more importantly, destroy the molecular machinery or assembling molecules. To put that in perspective, a side reaction that irreversibly converts as little as 1% of the fuel into a side product would mean less than 5% of the molecular machine left after 100 cycles. Therefore, this work tested how to suppress N-acylurea by screening precursor concentration, its structure, carbodiimide structure, additives, temperature, and pH. It turned out that the combination of low temperature, low pH, and 10% pyridine as a fraction of the fuel could significantly suppress the N-acylurea side product and keep the reaction cycle highly effective to regulate successful assembly.

In-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that the alloy layers return to the interface and mitigate contact loss at the end of stripping, avoiding a critical vulnerability of anode-free cells.

The present study investigates the redox mechanisms, with particular focus on the role of oxygen in commercial NCA electrodes, both fresh and aged under various conditions (aged cells have performed > 900 cycles until cathode capacity retention \u223c80%). Our findings reveal that oxygen participates in charge compensation during NCA delithiation, both through changes in transition metal (TM) - O bond hybridization and formation of partially reversible O2, the latter occurs already below 3.8 V vs Li/Li+. Aged NCA material undergoes more significant changes in TM - O bond hybridization when cycling above 50% SoC while reversible O2> formation is maintained. Nickel is found to be redox active throughout the entire delithiation, and shows a more classical oxidation state change during cycling with smaller changes in the Ni-O hybridization. By contrast, Co redox activity relies on a stronger change in Co-O hybridization, with only smaller Co oxidation state changes. The Ni-O bond displays an almost twice as large change in its bond length on cycling as the Co-O bond. The Ni-O6 octahedra are similar in size as the Co-O6 octahedra in the delithiated state, but are larger in the lithiated state, a size difference that increases with battery ageing. These contrasting redox activities are reflected directly in structural changes. The NCA material exhibits the formation of nanopores upon ageing, and a possible connection to oxygen redox activity is discussed. The difference in interaction of Ni and Co with oxygen provides a key understanding of the mechanism and the electrochemical instability of Ni-rich layered transition metal oxide electrodes.

One of the most recent concerns is related to the pollution that comes from various pharmaceuticals, in particular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) since they have been industrially produced at large scale and can be easily purchased as an over-the-counter medicine. Diclofenac is one of the most popular NSAIDs because of its high-effectiveness, which leads to its excessive consumption. Consequently, its presence in the water bodies is also continuously increasing. Adsorption process could then be employed as a highly effective method to address this issue. In comparison to other conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon, the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as an alternative adsorbent is very attractive since it can offer various advantages such as tailorability and high adsorption capacity. In this study, the performance of three water-stable, free-base porphyrin MOFs assembled using zirconia-based nodes, namely MOF-525, MOF-545, and NU-902, for diclofenac adsorption was thoroughly investigated. Interestingly, although all the three free-base porphyrin MOFs are assembled using the same building block and have a similar specific surface area (based on the experimental argon physisorption and calculation based on non-localized density functional theory), their diclofenac adsorption capacity is substantially different from one another. It is found that the highest diclofenac adsorption capacity is shown by MOF-525, which has maximum capacity around 792 mg g-1. This is then followed by MOF-545 and NU-902 that has adsorption capacity around 591 and 486 mg g-1, respectively. Some possible adsorption mechanisms are then thoroughly discussed that might contribute to this phenomenon. Lastly, their performance is also compared with other MOFs that are also studied for this purpose to show their performance superiority not only in terms of adsorption capacity but also their affinity towards diclofenac molecule.

Recently, we introduced sulfonium cations into the list of available strongly \u03c0-acidic ancillary ligands, by embedding them in a robust pincer-type framework. However, the M-S bond in the so-formed sulfonium complexes was still easy to dissociate, precluding their application as \u03c0-acid catalysts.

This allows the formation of a unique tris-cationic Pt(II) complex which, despite the strong electrostatic repulsion between its two constituents, features a remarkably short S-Pt bond. With its highly electrophilic Pt(II) center coordinated by a labile ligand this complex is ideally suited for \u03c0-acid catalysis. Indeed, in representative cycloisomerization reactions, it exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity compared to an analogous complex of a neutral thioether-based pincer ligand.

In this contribution, we expand the theoretical framework of ITA by introducing a new representation.

Driven to further explore indium coordination as a synthetic handle in InP QD synthesis, we have examined the effect of a strongly chelating anion on the nucleation and growth of InP QDs. Increasing the equivalents of metal-chelating aminopolycarboxylic acid EDTA ([CH2N(CH2CO2H)2]2) (0 to 0.75 equivalents per indium) is found to decrease the final diameter of InP QDs from 4.5 to 2.3 nm by lowering the initial InP growth rate. This size trend is rationalized by invoking a continuous nucleation model. Control experiments carried out with substoichiometric equivalents of indium do not exhibit a drastic size decrease, pointing to complex effects of EDTA on indium precursor reactivity. By 1H NMR spectroscopy, EDTA is identified to form an octahedral complex with indium that is less reactive.

Low-energy computing, including compute-in-memory architectures, has the potential to address these energy and environmental challenges and, in particular, tetrahedral (wurtzite-type) ferroelectrics are promising options for both performance and integration with existing semiconductor processes. The AlScN alloy is among the few tetrahedral materials that exhibit ferroelectric switching, but the electric field required to switch the polarization i.e., the coercive field, E_c, is on the order of MV/cm, which is about 1\u20132 orders of magnitude higher than more traditional oxide perovskite ferroelectrics (E_c < 100 kV/cm). Instead of further engineering AlScN and related alloys, we explore the alternative route of computationally identifying new materials with switching barriers lower than AlN while still possessing high enough intrinsic breakdown fields. Going beyond binary compounds, we explore the search space of multinary compounds with wurtzite-type structures. Through this large-scale search, we identify four promising ternary nitrides and oxides, including Mg2PN3, MgSiN2, Li2SiO3, and Li2GeO3, for future experimental realization and engineering.

Among those, Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework 8 (ZIF-8) is a well-known MOF that has been applied in various and diverse fields, from drug-delivery platforms to microelectronics. However, the complex role played by the reaction parameters in controlling the size and morphology of ZIF-8 particles is still not fully understood. Even further, many individual reports propose different nucleation and growth mechanisms for ZIF-8, thus creating a fragmented view of the system's behavior. To provide a unified view, we have generated a comprehensive dataset of synthetic conditions and their final outputs and applied Machine Learning techniques to analyze the data. Our approach has enabled us to identify the nucleation and growth mechanisms operating for ZIF-8 in a given portion of the chemical space and to reveal the underlying impact of synthetic variables on the final particle size and morphology. By doing so, we draw connections between the role of each synthetic variable over ZIF-8 synthesis and provided with a rule of thumb to control the final particle size. Our results provide a unified roadmap for the nucleation and growth mechanisms of ZIF-8 in agreement with mainstream trends, which can guide the rational design of ZIF-8 particles with specific sizes and morphology, determining their suitability for any targeted application.

This study examined the potential for transforming coal-fired power plants into negative CO2 emission technologies via retrofit of calcium looping with biomass co-firing in the calciner. The results confirmed that co-firing 30% biomass with coal in the calciner was sufficient for the retrofitted process to achieve negative CO2 emissions (-3.9 gCO2/kWh). Such a retrofit scenario had a net efficiency of 29.9% and a levelised cost of electricity of 81.1\u201381.4 \u20ac/MWh. Alternative approaches to calcium looping design were also explored to maximise the techno-economic viability of the retrofitted process. It was shown that by reducing the CO2 capture rate in the carbonator to 70%, the retrofitted process maintained the same net efficiency as the reference retrofit scenario. This modification resulted in a 1.8\u20135.0% reduction in the levelized cost of electricity. Moreover, reducing the fraction of flue gas fed to the carbonator to 80% resulted in a 0.6%-point reduction in efficiency penalty compared to the reference retrofit scenario. Although this adjustment led to specific CO2 emissions of 109.0 gCO2/kWh (4.0% higher than the reference retrofit), the emissions remained 86.2% lower than those of the unabated host plant. Notably, the levelized cost of electricity in this scenario was 6.2\u20137.5% lower than that for the reference retrofit scenario. Overall, this study demonstrated that by incorporating biomass co-firing, the calcium looping retrofits can transform the existing coal-fired power plants into negative CO2 emission technologies or, at the very least, improve the techno-economic viability of CO2 capture.

It can help filter out molecules with a high probability of failing in the early stages of de novo drug design. Thus, several machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict the toxicity of molecules by combining classical ML techniques or deep neural networks with well-known molecular representations such as fingerprints or 2D graphs. But the more natural, accurate representation of molecules is expected to be defined in physical 3D space like in ab initio methods. Recent studies successfully used equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) for representation learning based on 3D structures to predict quantum mechanical properties of molecules. Inspired by this, we investigate the performance of EGNNs to construct reliable ML models for toxicity prediction. We use the equivariant transformer (ET) model in TorchMD-NET for this. Eleven toxicity datasets taken from MoleculeNet, TDCommons, and ToxBenchmark have been considered to evaluate the capability of ET for toxicity prediction. Our results show that ET adequately learns 3D representations of molecules that can successfully correlate with toxicity activity, achieving good accuracies on most datasets comparable to state-of-the-art models. We also test a physicochemical property, namely the total energy of a molecule, to inform the toxicity prediction with a physical prior. However, our work suggests these two properties can not be related. We also provide an attention weight analysis for helping to understand the toxicity prediction in 3D space and, thus, increase the explainability of the ML model. In summary, our findings offer promising insights considering 3D geometry information via EGNNs and provide a straightforward way to integrate molecular conformers into ML-based pipelines for predicting and investigating toxicity prediction in physical space.

Due to the increased synthetic complexity of these heterobifunctional degraders and the difficulty of computational modelling to aid PROTAC design, the exploration of structure-activity-relationship (SAR) remains mostly empirical, which requires a significant time and resource investment. To facilitate rapid hit finding we developed capabilities for PROTAC parallel synthesis and purification by harnessing an array of pre-formed E3-ligand linker intermediates. In the next iteration of this approach, we developed a rapid, nanomole-scale PROTAC synthesis methodology using amide coupling that enables direct screening of non-purified reaction mixtures in cell-based degradation assays, as well as logD and EPSA measurements. This approach greatly expands and accelerates PROTAC SAR exploration (5 days instead of several weeks) while using nanomole amounts of reagents. Lastly, it avoids laborious and solvent-demanding purification of the reaction mixtures, thus making it an economical and more sustainable methodology for PROTAC hit finding.", "date": "2023-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The vast chemical space provides a plethora of anticancer discovery opportunities, however, limited by the boundaries of synthetic feasibility. This study aims at expanding the established pharmacological space of tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases by exploring the synthetically feasible chemical space of 3-substituted coumarins. A series of 52 novel 3-substituted coumarins were randomly sketched by our team of synthetic chemists with priority given to synthetic feasibility. The pharmacological potentials of the novel coumarin series were computationally estimated using a machine-learning approach exploiting both chemical and statistical inference. 17 members of the novel series were predicted to possess cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells by interfering with the tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases IX and XII. Those 17 compounds were synthesized and biologically tested against HeLa cells, subsequently; the 3 most potent compounds were assayed against carbonic anhydrases I, II, IX, and XII employing Acetazolamide as a reference. The molecular binding mechanism of those 3 chosen compounds with the four enzyme isoforms was studied using molecular docking simulation. Most of the compounds exhibited competent inhibitory activity against HeLa cells. The carbonic anhydrase inhibition results unveiled the powerful but non-selective nature of those suicide inhibitors.

The maximum pressure (nucleation pressure, $\\sigma_{min}$) sustained by the system is used a as measure of the system's propensity to nucleate a vapor bubble. In the presence of a planar gold substrate, nucleation pressure is essentially the same as homogeneous values when strong interaction exists between the gold atoms and water molecules; at weaker interactions, a significant lowering of nucleation pressure is observed, signifying that nucleation from such surfaces is easier. Reduction in nucleation pressure with decreasing gold-water surface interaction strength obtained from our simulations shows a good qualitative agreement with classical heterogeneous nucleation theory. As compared to planar surfaces, surfaces with grooves show a further reduction in nucleation barrier only for weak interfacial interactions. Furthermore, the groove dimensions also influence $\\sigma_{min}$ -- an optimal groove geometry exists for which $\\sigma_{min}$ is minimized; our results indicate that this occurs when the length scale of the defect is comparable to that of the critical  (homogeneous) bubble nucleation radius. Moreover, in the presence of defects, multiple barriers to nucleation exist.

This descriptor strongly influences the absorption, distribution, permeability, bioaccumulation, protein-binding, and biological activity of bioorganic compounds. Lipophilicity is commonly expressed as the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (PN) for neutral molecules, whereas for molecules with ionizable groups, the distribution coefficient (D) at a given pH is used. The logDpH is usually predicted using a pH correction over the logPN using the pKa of ionizable molecules, while often ignoring the apparent ionic partition (PIapp) because of the challenge of predicting the partitioning of the charged species and/or related species (e.g., ion-pairs, counterions, molecular aggregates). In this work, we studied the impact of \"P\" _\"I\" ^\"app\"  on the prediction of both the experimental lipophilicity of small molecules and experimental lipophilicity-based applications and metrics such as lipophilic efficiency (LipE), distribution of spiked drugs in milk products, and pH-dependent partition of water contaminants in synthetic passive samples such as silicones. Our findings show that better predictions are obtained by considering the apparent ionic partition, whereas ignoring its contribution can lead to inadequate experimental simplifications and/or computational predictions. In this context, we developed machine learning algorithms to determine the cases that \"PIapp\"  should be considered. The results indicate that small, rigid, and unsaturated molecules with logPN close to zero, which present a significant proportion of ionic species in the aqueous phase, were better modeled using the apparent ionic partition (PIapp). In addition, we validated our findings using a test and two external sets, which included small molecules and amino acid analogs, where the logistic regressions, random forest classifications, and support vector machine models predicted better formalism to determine the logDpH for each molecule with high accuracies, sensitivities, and specificities. Finally, our findings can serve as guidance to the scientific community working in early-stage drug design, food, and environmental chemistry who deal with ionizable molecules, to determine a priori which pH-dependent lipophilicity profile should be used in their research and applications depending on the structure of a substance.", "date": "2023-07-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Na2ZrO3 is renowned for its high capture capacity and cyclic stability. It can effectively capture CO2 at temperatures that are found in industrial processes such as the manufacture of steel or cement. Na2ZrO3 is reported to adopt monoclinic, hexagonal, and cubic structures since it was first discussed in the 1960s. Researchers relied on the differences in the relative intensities between two peaks (2\u03b8 ~ 16.2 and 38.7 \u00b0) in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern to determine the phase of this compound. It is also widely believed that the CO2 capture performance of Na2ZrO3 is related to the crystal structure, yet the crystal structure of hexagonal Na2ZrO3 has remained elusive. With the use of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and PXRD, we show that the hexagonal Na2ZrO3 does not exist. The so-called hexagonal Na2ZrO3 is Na2ZrO3 with three different types of disorder. Furthermore, the two PXRD peaks (2\u03b8 ~ 16.2 and 38.7 \u00b0) cannot be used to distinguish the different phases of Na2ZrO3, as the changes in the PXRD pattern are related to the extent of structure disorder. Finally, we also show that the CO2 capture properties of Na2ZrO3 are related to the Na+ site occupancy between different Na2ZrO3 samples, and not differences in crystal structures. The findings from our work shows that the current literature discussion on the structure of Na2ZrO3 is misleading.

We consider solutions and blends of polymers of types A and B with many associating groups per chain, and consider only A\u2013B association between the groups. The structural correlations of the reversibly-bonded polymers are accounted for by considering the Gaussian 4-arm star-like chain conformations between cross-links, which is analogous to an affine-network assumption. Future extensions of this theory could further incorporate strand stretching from swelling or strong segregation. We show that the chemical incompatibility between A and B polymers drives a competition between associative and segregative phase separation. The addition of reversible A\u2013B cross-links between incompatible A and B chains compatibilizes the mixture, minimizing the propensity for macroscopic phase separation into A- and B-rich phases. Under strong binding and segregation conditions, this results in eutectic-like behavior and local microphase segregation. The crossovers from macroscopic to microscopic phase separation occur at isotropic Lifshitz points, resulting in the potential for bicontinuous microemulsions. The reactive blending of such multifunctional polymers presents the opportunity to envision novel properties, processing conditions, and applications accessible by the tunable production of supramolecular complexes, mesophases, and multicomponent polymer networks.", "date": "2023-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

TMDs such as MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 have shown promise in detecting NO2. However, it remains uncertain which one is best suited for this purpose. Consequently, this study employs computational methods to investigate NO2 adsorption on monolayers of MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2. The results show that MoTe2 exhibits the strongest interaction with the highest charge transfer, suggesting its potential for superior NO2 detection compared to MoSe2 and MoS2. The sheets share the same type of outward projecting orbitals and thus the principle model for charge projections. However, the bonding within the sheet influences the accumulation of charge within it, which in turn impacts the availability of electrons on its surface. Subsequently, the mechanism of charge transfer between the TMDs and NO2 remains the same, but more available charge results in an enhanced adsorption interaction. The described mechanism is likely to affect the adsorption of other acceptor-type molecules (e.g., CO2, SO2, H2S, or BF3) and also be behind differences in charge transfer observed among group VI compounds (e.g., MoS2 and WS2).", "date": "2023-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Ganguly; Michael B. Elbaum; Neal J.

These interactions would be expected to result in tryptophan, as the most electron-rich aromatic residue, exhibiting the highest frequency of cis-proline. However, prior results from bioinformatics studies on proteins and experiments on proline-aromatic sequences in peptides have not revealed a clear correlation between the properties of the aromatic ring and the population of cis-proline. An investigation of the effects of aromatic residue (aromatic ring properties) on the conformation of proline-aromatic sequences was conducted using three distinct approaches: (1) NMR spectroscopy in model peptides of the sequence Ac-TGPAr-NH2 (Ar = encoded and unnatural aromatic amino acids); (2) bioinformatics analysis of structures in proline-aromatic sequences in the PDB; and (3) computational investigation using DFT and MP2 methods on models of proline-aromatic sequences and interactions. C\u2013H/\u03c0 and hydrophobic interactions were observed to stabilize local structures in both the trans-proline and cis-proline conformations, with both proline amide conformations exhibiting C\u2013H/\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic ring and H\u03b1 of the residue prior to proline (H\u03b1-trans-Pro-aromatic and H\u03b1-cis-Pro-aromatic interactions) and/or with the proline ring (trans-ProH-aromatic and cis-ProH-aromatic interactions). These C\u2013H/\u03c0 interactions were strongest with tryptophan (Trp) and weakest with cationic histidine (HisH+). Aromatic interactions with histidine were modulated in strength by His ionization state. Proline-aromatic sequences were associated with specific conformational poses, including type I and type VI \u03b2-turns. C\u2013H/\u03c0 interactions at the pre-proline H\u03b1, which were stronger than interactions at Pro, stabilize normally less favorable conformations, including the \u03b6 or \u03b1L conformations at the pre-proline residue, cis-proline, and/or the g+ \u03c71 rotamer or \u03b1L conformation at the aromatic residue. These results indicate that proline-aromatic sequences, especially Pro-Trp sequences, are loci to nucleate turns, helices, loops, and other local structures in proteins. These results also suggest that mutations that introduce proline-aromatic sequences, such as the R406W mutation that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation in the microtubule-binding protein tau, might result in substantial induced structure, particularly in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins.", "date": "2023-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The results showed that the anthracene cluster showed no apparent difference in the shape dependence, however, benzene clusters differed significantly due to its nearest neighbors orient in a T-shape conformation compared to anthracene which is more stacked along its conjugated rings. Additionally, lower total energies of the \u2018full\u2019 model as well as less stable neutral energies for the surface molecules in the \u2018intra+inter\u2019 model suggest that the surface molecules interact repulsively. Due to the fact that the cube structure has a larger surface area to volume ratio and more benzene molecules are needed to take up said surface area more repulsive force may be experienced by molecules in the benzene cubes. Apparent polarization energy of each system increases as number of close by neighbors increases. Therefore molecules located centrally have larger induced dipole polarization as well as larger apparent polarization. Apparent polarization energy depends more sensitively on the location of the excitation than the shape of the cluster.

Electrofuels, or fuels synthesized from excess electricity, are an emerging medium poised to meet long-duration energy storage requirements. Ammonia as an electrofuel is potentially ideal because ammonia has a relatively low liquefaction pressure, indicating that ammonia can be easily stored and transported. Here, we develop a framework to optimize the electrochemical production of ammonia powered by intermittent photovoltaic power. We also explore various buyback policies to understand the impact that policy has on the cost of intermittent ammonia and optimal sizing ratios. The optimal ratio of the photovoltaic to the electrolyzer is ~3.7 MW$_{PV}$/MW$_{ELEC}$ for an system that is completely powered by renewable photovoltaic power and operates intermittently. The optimal ratio of the photovoltaic to the electrolyzer is ~3.3 MW _PV/MW_Elec  for a system that uses photovoltaics in conjunction with grid electricity and operates continuously. For the purchase price at the avoided cost of electricity, the optimal ratio of the solar panel to the electrolyzer increases to ~4 MW\n_PV/MW_Elec for a system that can only sell to the grid and ~5 MW_PV/MW_Elect for a system that can buy and sell electricity to the grid at the avoided cost. Optimizing energy management by setting auxiliary battery size limits is essential to reduce ammonia cost, and the optimal battery size decreases as the buyback price of electricity increases. Finally, we find that systems connected to the grid and operating continuously have emissions comparable to the Haber-Bosch process because of the current emissions tied to the United States electricity generation. Thus, unless the grid is completely decarbonized, it is essential to create electro-fuels that rely minimally on grid electricity.", "date": "2023-07-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

The results reveal that the cavity mode acts like a ``rate-promoting vibrational (RPV) mode\" that enhances the ground state chemical reaction rate constant when the cavity mode frequency matches the vibrational transition frequency. The exact simulation predicts that the VSC-modified rate constant will change quadratically as the light-matter coupling strength increases. When changing the cavity lifetime from the lossy limit to the lossless limit, the numerically exact results predict there will be a turnover of the rate constant. Based on the numerical observations, we present an analytic rate theory to explain the observed sharp resonance peak of the rate profile when tuning the cavity frequency to match the quantum transition frequency of the vibrational ground state to excited states. This rate theory further explains the origin of the broadening of the rate profile. The analytic rate theory agrees with the numerical results under the golden rule limit and the short cavity lifetime limit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytic theory that is able to explain the sharp resonance behavior of the VSC-modified rate profile when coupling an adiabatic ground state chemical reaction to the cavity.

Darwinian evolution of self-replicators requires that these (i) have structural space accessible to them; (ii) occupy only part of this space at any one time, and (iii) navigate this space through a process of mutation and selection. We now report a system of self-replicating hexameric macrocycles that emerges upon mixing two building blocks. It occupies a subset of possible building block sequences. Specific interactions between the building blocks, most likely through steric zipper formation involving the interdigitation of a phenylalanine residue of one building block between two leucine residues of the other building block, results in the preferential formation of a hexamer with a sequence in which the two building blocks alternate. When this system was exposed to two different replication-destruction regimes, different replicator mutant distributions were selected for. When the destruction process was non-selective (mediated by outflow in an open system) the fastest replicating sequences dominated, overriding the preference for zipper formation observed in a closed vial.  However, when destruction was mediated chemically (and therefore potentially selective) the replicator mutant that combined adequate resistance to reduction with adequate replication speed and was capable of steric zipper formation, became dominant. These results constitute a rudimentary form of Darwinian evolution where replicators adapt to a changing selection pressure through mutation and selection.

Eleveld; Jasper Bos; Kirill Mikhailov; Armin Kiani; Jim Ottel\u00e9; Sijbren Otto", "abstract": "Recently, the first self-replicating molecules have been described that are capable of catalyzing different reactions in addition to their own formation. These findings raise the question whether such catalytic promiscuity is a widespread characteristic, or whether it is feature restricted to a special subset of replicators. Another related issue is whether catalytic activity of these systems is sensitive to alterations in the peptide structure. Both of these questions are relevant in the context of evolution. Widespread catalytic promiscuity would be beneficial if replicators are to acquire a metabolism that involves catalysis of different chemical reactions. Furthermore, in order to enable adaptation and acquisition of new traits through mutation and selection, it is desirable that self-replicating molecules can mutate and explore structure space while retaining their catalytic activity. Here we demonstrate that catalytic promiscuity of a class of peptide based self-replicators is indeed a recurrent trait in a significant fraction of the probed structure space. Specifically, we investigated eighteen self-assembly driven self-replicators, each made from a different single building block, and six replicators that emerged from a binary building block mixture. Most of these were found to catalyze both the retro-aldol reaction of methodol, as well as the cleavage of fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) groups. No obvious correlation exists between the efficiencies with which replicators catalyze these two reactions, indicating that the reactions have different requirements with respect to catalyst structure. The degree of catalytic activity varied with replicator structure spanning up to three orders of magnitude.  Of the binary mixtures, most gave replicators with activities in between those of the replicators made of the corresponding individual building blocks. However, in one instance, where specific interactions promote the formation of a specific two-building-block replicator mutant, this species had an activity that exceeded that of the corresponding single-building-block replicators. These observations imply that evolutionary enhancement of a specific catalytic activity of self-replicating molecules should be possible also in a regime where mutation rates are relatively high.

However, selectivity optimization of these small, disulfide rich peptides is difficult not only because of an absence of \u03b1-CTX/nAChR co-structures, but also because it is challenging to predict how a mutation to an \u03b1-CTX will alter its potency and selectivity. As a prototypical system to investigate selectivity, we employed the \u03b1-CTX LvIA that is 18-fold selective for the \u03b13\u03b22 nAChR over the closely related \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR subtype that is a target for nicotine addiction. Using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology, we identified LvIA[D11R] that is 2-fold selective for the \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR, reversing its subtype preference. This effect is specific to the charge and not shape of LvIA[D11R], as substitution with citrulline retains selectivity for the \u03b13\u03b22 nAChR. Furthermore, LvIA[D11K] shows a stronger reversal, with 4-fold selectivity for the \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR.

Finally, to understand the structural basis of this effect we used AlphaFold2 to generate models of LvIA in complex with both nAChR subtypes.

Zondlo", "abstract": "Tau misfolding, oligomerization, and aggregation are central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), frontotemporal dementia, and other tauopathies. Increased phosphorylation of tau is associated with conformational changes that are not fully understood. Moreover, tau oligomerization and aggregation are associated with proline cis-trans isomerism, with the phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerase Pin1 reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. The FTDP-17 tau mutation R406W is frequently used in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, due to earlier onset of the AD phenotype. Despite its extensive application, the mechanisms by which tau-R406W leads to enhanced aggregation and neurotoxicity are poorly understood. Peptides derived from the tau C-terminal domain were examined by NMR spectroscopy as a function of residue 406 identity (Arg versus Trp) and Ser404 phosphorylation state. The R406W modification led to an increased population of Pro405 cis amide bond, which is stabilized by cis-proline-aromatic C\u2013H/\u03c0 interactions. Ser404 phosphorylation also resulted in an increase in cis amide bond, via a proposed C\u2013H/O interaction between the Pro H\u03b1 and the phosphate that stabilizes the cis conformation. An analogous C\u2013H/O interaction was observed in Glu-cis-Pro sequences in the PDB, and is proposed to be the basis of the increased propensity for cis amide bonds in Glu-Pro sequences. The higher activation barriers for proline cis-trans isomerization observed at pSer-Pro and pThr-Pro sequences are proposed to be due to both (a) an intraresidue phosphate-amide bond that stabilizes the trans-proline conformation and (b) the cis-stabilizing proline-phosphate C\u2013H/O interaction identified herein. The combination of both pSer404 and R406W resulted in a further increase in the population of cis amide bond. In contrast to expectations, the R406W modification led to increased dephosphorylation of either pSer404 or pSer409 by PP2A, and had no effect on phosphorylation of Ser404 by cdk5, suggesting that R406W does not inherently increase Ser404 phosphorylation via changes in the actions of these enzymes. Modestly increased phosphorylation of Ser404 was observed by GSK-3\u03b2 in tau R406W. Collectively, these data suggest a potential role for conformational change to a cis amide bond at Pro405, via Ser404 phosphorylation and/or R406W modification, as a possible mechanism involved in protein misfolding in AD, CTE, and FTDP-17. Alternatively, both Ser404 phosphorylation and the R406W modification lead to increased order, including induced turn formation, in both the trans-proline and cis-proline conformations.", "date": "2023-07-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

All the three electrolytes showed improved solvation strength and ionic conductivities compared with previous highly fluorinated DEE elec-trolytes, while retaining good oxidative stability. Full cell test using Li-metal anode and nickel-rich cathode revealed that a higher degree of fluorination is beneficial to the cycling performance, and the cycling stability follows F1F0 < F1F1 < F1F2. Specifically, F1F0 exhibited poor cycling stability due to its instability against both anode and cathode. While F1F1 and F1F2 both showed good stability against Li-metal anode, their relative long-term oxidative stability was responsive for the distinct performance, in which the cycle numbers at 80% capacity retention for F1F1 and F1F2 were ~20 and ~80, respectively. This work shows the importance to modulate the fluorination degree of elec-trolyte solvents, and this approach is suitable for various cathode materials.", "date": "2023-07-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We prepared 1:1 decanoic acid : decylamine vesicles in water or a mixture of organic compounds as might have been present on early Earth (EPS: enriched prebiotic soup). In some samples we added a detergent Triton X-100, which tends to increase vesicle size heterogeneity and promote vesicle remodeling. All four vesicle-containing mixtures were subjected to transfer-with-dilution: after a 24-hour incubation (one generation) we transferred 10% of the mix into 9X volume of a fresh, vesicle-containing mixtures. Sample with a history of transfer were compared to no-transfer controls (NTCs), which were initiated each generation using the same fresh vesicle-containing mixture but did not receive 10% of the prior generation. We compared transfer samples to NTCs for Nile Red fluorescence, vesicle size, and overall chemical composition, as measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). In samples with Triton, but not those without, we observe oscillation-like changes in Nile Red fluorescence, with significant temporal autocorrelation. In all samples, we observe non-linear changes in vesicle size over the course of 30 generations. Overall chemical composition did not change significantly due to transfers. These findings, while not definitive, suggest the possible presence of heritability in vesicles composed of short-chain amphiphiles.", "date": "2023-07-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The biocatalytic system consists of the protease thrombin and its inhibitor, hirudin, which were genetically engineered and covalently coupled to the hydrogel networks. The catalytic activity of thrombin was reversibly switched on by stretching of the hydrogels, which disrupts the noncovalent inhibitory interaction between both entities.

Gastrointestinal unified theoretical framework (GUTFW) and machine learning (ML) are commonly used to predict the percentage of Fa. In GUTFW, the Fa of a drug is estimated using an equation based on the mechanism of human intestinal absorption, dose, solubility, membrane permeability, and dispersion of the drug. The experimental values of these in vitro parameters are required to accurately predict Fa. However, most of these values are unavailable at early stages of development. ML uses a dataset of the observed Fa values of many drugs in humans. In most previously published ML approaches, the dose information for each drug has been ignored. However, Fa can vary in a dose-dependent manner through changes in solubility, membrane permeability, and dispersion. To overcome these problems, we combined GUTFW and ML to compensate for each defect. We collected published data on the chemical structures of 460 drugs, including Fa and dose amounts. The key parameters of the GUTFW (Do, dose number; Dn, dispersion number; Pn, permeation number), solubility, membrane permeability, and structural descriptors were calculated and used as explanatory variables for ML. ML algorithms, namely, the random forest (RF) and message-passing neural network (MPNN; Chemprop), were investigated. The GUTFW model was compared to the conventional ML method, which uses only structural descriptors, and combined ML method, which uses both structural descriptors and GUTFW parameters. In addition, using the Chemprop framework, we investigated important substructures of Fa. Our result suggested that combinational ML produced higher predictivity than the GUTFW model and conventional ML model in the test dataset (20% of the dataset) [R2 value and RMSE in combinational ML method: 0.611 and 19.7 (RF), 0.520 and 21.6 (Chemprop); in conventional ML: 0.339 and 25.4 (RF), 0.497 and 22.1 (Chemprop); in GUTFW: 0.353 and 31.9]. Additionally, most of the substructures indicated by the Chemprop framework were consistent with the common knowledge of medicinal chemistry. We developed an accurate prediction method for human Fa using a combination of data-driven ML and mechanism-based GUTFW, where the parameters could be calculated without experimental data, enabling the model to efficiently promote early drug discovery. Furthermore, some of the important substructures identified here were previously unknown and require further investigation.

Two optimization techniques, namely block-localized excitation (BLE) and target state optimization (TSO), are examined along with two ways of estimating the transition density functional (TDF) for the correlation energy of the Hamiltonian matrix density functional. The results from the two optimization methods are similar. It was found that MSDFT-NOSI using the spin-multiplet degeneracy (SMD) constraint for the TDF of spin-coupling interaction, along with the M06-2X functional, yields a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.22 eV, better than CIS(D_\u221e), CC2, and ADC(3) all of which have an RMSE of 0.28 eV, but somewhat less than STEOM-CCSD (RMSE of 0.14 eV) and CCSD (RMSE of 0.11 eV) wave function methods. Interestingly, MSDFT-NOSI performs noticeably better than TDDFT at an RMSE of 0.43 eV using the same functional and basis set on the Loos2018 database. In comparison with the ground state and the lowest triplet energies from KS-DFT calculations, it was found that the multistate DFT approach has little double counting of correlation. Importantly, there is no noticeable difference in the performance of MSDFT-NOSI on valence, Rydberg, singlet, triplet, and double-excitation states. Although the use of another hybrid functional PBE0 leads to a greater RMSE of 0.36 eV, the deviation is systematic with a linear regression slope of 0.994 against the results with M06-2X. The present benchmark reveals that density functional approximations developed for KS-DFT for the ground state with a non-interacting reference may be adopted in MSDFT calculations in which state interaction is key.", "date": "2023-07-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Specifically, indirect  evidence suggests the involvement of an amorphous precursor and the occurrence of multi-step processes in struvite formation, which would indicate non-classical paths of nucleation and crystallization.  In this study, we use synchrotron-based in situ X-ray scattering complemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy to obtain new insights  from the earliest stages of struvite formation. The holistic scattering data captured the structure of an entire assembly in a time-resolved manner. The structural features comprise the aqueous medium, the growing struvite crystals, and any potential heterogeneities or complex entities. By analysing the scattering data, we found that the onset of crystallization causes a perturbation in the structure of the surrounding aqueous medium. This perturbation is characterized by the occurrence and evolution of Ornstein-Zernike fluctuations on a scale of about 1 nm, suggesting a non-classical nature of the system. We interpret this phenomenon as a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which gives rise to the formation of the amorphous precursor phase preceding actual crystal growth of struvite. Our microscopy results confirm that the formation of Mg-struvite includes a short-lived amorphous phase, lasting >10 seconds.

Currently, gold-standard methods for Vv detection are all PCR-based, requiring expensive equipment and skilled personnel, which hinders their use on a global scale. The aim of this work was to design and test a more affordable method that could be used worldwide for both vibriosis diagnosis and pathogen monitoring in water. To this end, we functionalized thin film microelectrodes with thiolated single-stranded DNA sequences complementary to the species-specific genetic marker, the gene vvha, and monitored the impedance changes upon hybridization. We tested the biosensor specificity with synthetic and natural DNA samples (from cultures of Vv and V. cholerae, a closely related species) and determined the detectable concentration range. The results obtained showed that this biosensor was specific for Vv, achieving detection down to 1 pM DNA, which corresponds approximately to 3x102 bacteria/mL.

Here, we investigate excitonic couplings using ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to examine the different types of electronic interaction in ion pairs of the prototype F4TCNQ doped P3HT polymer system in precursor solution mixture for spin-casting. Off-diagonal peaks in 2D spectra clearly establish the excitonic coupling between P3HT+ and F4TCNQ\u2212 ions in solution. The observed excitonic coupling is the direct manifestation of Coulombic interaction amongst the ion-pair. The excited state lifetime of F4TCNQ\u2212 in ion-pairs shows biexponential decay: 30 fs and 200 fs, which hints towards the presence of heterogeneous population with different interaction strengths. To examine the nature of these different types of interactions in solution mixture, we study the system using molecular dynamics simulations on a fully solvated model employing the generalized Amber force field. We retrieve three dominant interaction modes of F4TCNQ anions with P3HT: side-chain, \u03c0-stack and slipped stack.

Apart from being inefficient and inconvenient, these methods can cause a degradation of the desirable properties and introduce unwanted defects.

In this review, we provide a survey of various zeolite confined catalysts used for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene highlighting their performance, defined by ethylene selectivity at full acetylene conversion, in relationship to the synthesis technique employed. Synthesis methods that ensure confinement with catalyst transition metal location in the extra-framework positions are observed to have the report the highest selectivity to ethylene.

These results pave the way for the development of synthetic enzyme-driven nanoswimmers that can self-propel in fluids and have the potential to provide new insights into biological motion dynamics at the micro-nanoscale.

Immobilizing complexes on substrates creates single-molecule catalysts (SMCs) with functional similarities to single-atom catalysts (SACs).

Spectroscopic investigations reveal an in-situ geometrical transformation of the complex and the formation of a paramagnetic Ni center, which under a magnetic field, enables spin-selective electron transfer, resulting in enhanced OER performance.

For the four docking poses selected by scoring using FMO energy, 100 structures each from the MD trajectory were sampled, and FMO calculations were performed and ranked based on binding energy. Besides the interaction between NLF and each Mpro residue, the desolvation effect of the pocket affected the ranking order.

DET-type reactions offer several benefits in biomimetics (e.g., biofuel cells, bioreactors, and biosensors) owing to their mediator-less configuration. FDH provides an intense DET-type catalytic signal; therefore, extensive research has been conducted on the fundamental principles and applications of biosensors.

The ammonium ion attached to the amyloid-binding motif was activated by its proximity to the amyloid catalyst, formed by Ac-Asn-Phe-Gly-Ala-Ile-Leu-NH2 (NL6) derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), thereby promoting amine modifications in the acidic buffer. Consistent with the mode of action of CASL, the affinity of the substrates with amyloid catalysts correlated with the reaction yields. In addition, the direction of the amine extension from the amyloid-binding site markedly influenced the reaction progress. Crystallographic analysis and amide-to-ester substitution of the amyloid catalysts indicated that the carbonyl oxygen of the Phe\u2013Gly amide bond of NL6 played a key role in activating the substrate amine via forming a hydrogen bond.

Activation of the glmS riboswitch by GlcN6P mimics interferes with the bacterial ability to synthesize its cell wall. Accordingly, GlcN6P mimics acting as glmS activators are promising candidates for future antibiotic drugs that may overcome emerging bacterial resistance against established antibiotics. We describe the synthesis of a series of phosphonate mimics of GlcN6P as well as the thia-sugar analogue of GlcN6P. The phosphonate mimics differ in their pKa value to answer the question whether derivatives with a pKa matching that of GlcN6P would be efficient glmS activators. We found that all derivatives activate the riboswitch, however, less efficiently than GlcN6P. This observation can be explained by missing hydrogen bonds in the case of phosphonates and is a valuable information for the design of future GlcN6P mimics. The thia-sugar analogue of GlcN6P on the other hand turned out to be a glmS riboswitch activator with the same activity as the natural metabolite GlcN6P.

However, they suffer from photo-structural-chemical instabilities whose intricacy requires state-of-the-art tools to investigate their properties and behavior under various conditions. In most cases, those tools strongly interact with the materials leading to undesirable transformations. This study addresses the damage caused by highly intense focused X-ray beams on hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites through a correlative multi-technique approach. Our results reveal that the damage after irradiation in the ((Cs, FAMA)Pb(Br, I)3) compound is prominent on iodine and organic components at the film surface, reducing their relative quantity. The sample morphology modifies with the formation of an excavated area, whose altered local optical properties indicate the formation of an optically inactive metal layer covering the surface. Interestingly, the bulk remains unaltered with the initial ion proportion demonstrated by the stable photoluminescence emission energy. Controlling the X-ray beam dose and environment - air, nitrogen, and cryogenic conditions - serves as a strategy to mitigate the dose harm. Hence, we combined a controlled X-ray dose with an inert N2 atmosphere to certify the conditions to probe metal halide perovskite properties while mitigating damage efficiently. Finally, we applied optimized conditions to investigate a perovskite compound using X-ray ptychography, reaching a 14-nm spatial resolution, an outcome that has never been attained so far.

Dopants such as Al and Ga are typically used to enable stabilisation of the high Li+ ion-conductive cubic phase at room temperature. Although numerous studies exist that have characterized the electrochemical properties, structure, and lithium diffusion in Al- and Ga-LLZO, the local structure and site occupancy of dopants in these compounds are not well understood. Two broad 27Al or 69,71Ga resonances are often observed with chemical shifts consistent with tetrahedrally coordinated Al/Ga in the magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectra of both Al- and Ga-LLZO, which have been assigned to either Al and/or Ga occupying 24d and 96h/48g sites in the LLZO lattice or to the different Al/Ga configurations that arise from different arrangements of Li around these dopants. In this work, we unambiguously show that the side products \u03b3-LiAlO2 and LiGaO2 lead to the high frequency resonance observed by NMR spectroscopy and that both Al and Ga only occupy the 24d site in the LLZO lattice. Furthermore, it was observed that the excess Li often used during synthesis leads to the formation of these side-products by consuming the Al/Ga dopants. In addition, the consumption of Al/Ga dopants lead to the tetragonal phase formation commonly observed in the literature even after careful mixing of precursors. The side-products can exist even after sintering, thus controlling the Al/Ga content in the LLZO lattice, substantially influencing the lithium-ion conductivity in LLZO as measured here by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.", "date": "2023-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Ceramics; Solid State Chemistry; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The ignition process of ionic liquids with an oxidizer, such as nitric acid, is a complex process and, to date, there are no theoretical methods for predicting the ignition delay.  The present work examines two correlation methods, Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for their ability to predict this quantity.  A set of five descriptors were chosen from a pool of more than 160 to establish these correlations.  A good QSPR correlation was obtained using these descriptors.  We then trained an artificial neural network and examined the predictive ability of the network using an extensive 5-fold cross validation process with the same set of descriptors.

The aim was to avoid hydrogen evolution from a carbon fiber current collector, considering its application in lead-acid batteries. In a 5 M H2SO4 solution, the onset potential was as high as \n-0.75 V vs Ag/ AgCl. The study revealed that the Pb2+ ions strongly interact with nitrogen present in the PAni structure. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman Spectroscopy gave an insight of how the interaction between lead ions and the nitrogen takes place which is described schematically. This composite is stable and keeps the high onset potential while Pb2+ is associated with nitrogen, as evaluated in various potentials through chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry conditions. The Pb2+ desorb for potentials higher than -0.65 V vs Ag/AgCl and degrades the composite onset potential. The desorption was reversible, as long as the PbSO4 particles formed were nanometric and immersed in the PAni. Desorption for long periods forms large PbSO4 particles consequently, the reduction of these particles becomes difficult. Without Pb2+ ions, it is not possible to restore the interaction between Pb2+ and PAni. Besides XPS and Raman spectroscopy, the material characterization was performed by Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The electrochemical characterization involved cyclic voltammetry, Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), galvanostatic charge - discharge cycles and chronoamperometry.", "date": "2023-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Carbon-based Materials; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The assessment of persistence in the environment is particularly affected due to a multitude of influencing environmental factors, including the taxonomic composition and physiological state of the microbial community present. Biotransformation experiments may therefore result in half-lives spanning several orders of magnitude for the same substance tested with different environmental samples. Due to experimental limitations, values may further be beyond the limits of reliable half-life quantification (i.e., censored data points), and the number of data points per substance may vary considerably. However, reliable data describing average half-lives and their natural variability are an important foundation for building predictive models for environmental hazard endpoints, which are urgently needed by regulatory authorities to manage existing chemicals and by industry for the design of benign, non-persistent chemicals. Here, we propose the application of Bayesian inference to characterize the uncertainty of reported half-lives and to include censored data points to maximize the information extracted from experimental data. Our model estimates the true mean and standard deviation from a set of reported half-lives experimentally obtained for a single substance. Including censored data increases the available data volume, and reporting uncertainties helps estimating the reliability of the half-life data.  We apply the inference model to 893 substances with experimental soil half-lives of varying data quantity and quality, and we estimate the true half-life distribution for each compound. Our approach can be easily adapted and applied to other environmental hazard endpoints to estimate uncertainty and to improve data quality for model development.

Based on spin-orbit density functional theory and screened configuration interaction calculations, we show that highly symmetric and defect-free CdSe QDs with diameters of 1.7 nm and 2.0 nm possess a multiexponential PL at the single-dot level. This is a consequence of a ligand-induced symmetry breaking with a subsequent rearrangement of the lowest eight excitonic states in two sets of four singly degenerate excitonic states.

They are a rich source of oleuropein, the most abundant polyphenol in olive leaves, whose bioactive properties are widely documented. If olive leaves are to be seriously considered as a readily-available source of oleuropein, simple analytical methods are needed to identify varieties and growing conditions conducive to its formation. HPLC-fluorescence detection and UPLC-UV-MS methods on different instruments were developed and cross-validated using blank (oleuropein-free) leaves produced in-house to establish matrix standards in the concentration range 0.4 to 4.8 mg/g. For the HPLC-FLD method, mean repeatability and intermediate precision were respectively 3.64% and 4.76% relative standard deviation; the coefficient of determination was generally >0.9999 and linearity was demonstrated by the Fischer test. There was a close linear relationship (R2 > 0.999) between back-calculated concentrations of both spiked placebos and authentic standards.  Analysis of the same spiked placebos by the three chromatographic methods showed no significant differences in the validation results as confirmed by ANOVA. Cross-validation of the three methods indicate that selective quantification can equally be carried out on standard HPLC equipment available to most laboratories or by more sophisticated UPLC-MS techniques in larger structures.

There is evidence that these HLPs have roles in virulence. To test the precise role of this tyrosine ligand, a Y54F HLP variant of Mycobacterium kansasii (Mka) was generated. There are substantial spectroscopic differences for the Y54F and the wild-type HLPs. First, the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of Y54F HLP lacked a 500-nm absorbance feature prevalent in the spectra of wild-type HLP and other Tyr-ligated diiron proteins. In addition, EPR spectroscopy showed that the Y54F HLP was isolated in a mixed-valent (FeII-FeIII) state, whereas wild-type HLP was isolated in the diferric state. In addition, the mixed-valent state of Y54F HLP exhibited a narrow, nearly axial EPR signal with g-values of 1.97, 1.93, and 1.89, a signal that is consistent with a \u00b5-oxo bridged mixed-valent diiron site. Meanwhile, the wild-type counterpart exhibited a broad rhombic signal with simulated g-values of 1.99, 1.83, and 1.62, which is consistent with a \u00b5-hydroxo bridged mixed-valent diiron site. Our results are consistent with Y54 coordination to the diiron site and indicate this ligand lowers the diiron [FeIII]2/FeIIFeIII redox couple and increases the basicity of the diiron solvent bridge. With regards to substrate reactivity, the Y54F mutation had no discernable effect on reductive nitrosylation reactivity, however, it precluded formation of the 520-nm intermediate observed when NO is reacted with wild-type Mka HLP. In addition, the Y54F mutation nearly eliminated catalase activity and greatly perturbed NO peroxidase activity. These results suggest that the Y54 ligand is critical for scavenging of H2O2 and NO, both of which are encountered during infection due to the host defense response.

Consequently, new approaches to enhance target validation are valuable tools to improve the drug discovery process. Here we report the combination of site-directed mutagenesis and electrophilic fragments to enable the rapid identification of small molecules that selectively inhibit the mutant protein. Using the bromodomain- containing protein BRD4 as an example, we employed a structure-based approach to identify the L94C mutation in the first bromodomain of BRD4 [BRD4(1)] as having minimal effect on BRD4(1) function. We then screen a focused, KAc mimic-containing fragment set, and a diverse fragment library against the mutant and wild-type proteins, and identified a series of fragments that showed high selectivity for the mutant protein. These compounds were elaborated to include an alkyne click tag to enable the attachment of a fluorescent dye. These clickable compounds were then assessed in HEK293T cells, transiently expressing BRD4(1)WT or BRD4(1)L94C, to determine their selectivity for BRD4(1)L94C over other possible cellular targets. One compound was identified that shows very high selectivity for BRD4(1)L94C over all other proteins. This work provides proof-of-concept that the combination of site-directed mutagenesis and electrophilic fragments, in a mutant and conjugate approach, can enable rapid identification of small molecule inhibitors for an appropriately mutated protein of interest. This technology can be used to assess the cellular phenotype of inhibiting the protein of interest, and the electrophilic ligand provides a starting point for non-covalent ligand development.", "date": "2023-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Dielectric elastomers are classified under electroactive polymers that are capable of producing very large deformations and this is due to their elastomeric nature. The fabrication of a dielectric elastomeric actuator based on a polymer nanocomposite with ceramic fillers is reported here. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was the choice of dielectric elastomer and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was used as dielectric fillers, which was added in weight percentages to the polymer. An amorphous carbon-filled polyvinyl acetate composite was used as the compliant electrode. Altering the stiffness of the polymer gives the ability to bring about small actuations, achieved by adding nanofillers to the polymer matrix. The incorporation of hBN into the matrix increased the tensile modulus of the pure PDMS from 0.297 MPa to a maximum of 0.535 MPa with a marginal rise in tensile strength. Scanning electron microscopy and elemental mapping were carried out to understand the morphology and filler distribution in the nanocomposites. From the experiments, the actual voltage (in kV) which was necessary to induce visible actuations in the nanocomposites was determined. Data from the experiments were used in the simulation studies. Finite element analysis was performed on the diaphragm model to predict the behavior of the material and active area displacement of the diaphragm was 1 mm at 8 kV, and deformation of 78 % was achieved. The simulation studies showed that the nanocomposite was perfectly suitable to be used as a pumping mechanism in micropumps.", "date": "2023-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Composites; Elastic Materials; Inorganic Polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, the electrochemistry at the one-dimensional edge of a graphene sheet, which is sandwiched between two hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) multilayer flakes, is reported. When such an hBN/graphene/hBN heterostructure is immersed in a solution, the basal plane of graphene is protected and isolated by the hBN stack, and the edge of the graphene sheet is exclusively available in the solution. This forms an electrochemical nanoelectrode, which enabled the investigation of electron transfer using several redox probes, e.g., ferrocene(di)methanol, hexaammineruthenium, methylene blue, dopamine and ferrocyanide. The relatively low capacitance of the van der Waals edge electrode facilitates cyclic voltammetry at very high scan rates (up to 1000 V/s). Using fast scan cyclic voltammetry imaging, redox species could be detected voltammetrically down to micromolar concentrations with sub-second time resolution at the sandwiched graphene edge, promoted by the rapid equilibration of analyte species in the diffusion layer. Furthermore, the nanoband nature of the edge electrode allows its operation directly in water in the absence of added electrolyte. Finally, two adjacent edge electrodes could be realized in a redox-cycling format. In all, the van der Waals edge electrode is unique among nanoelectrodes as it enables investigations of all the above-mentioned phenomena in the same device. Due to its versatility, it constitutes a new avenue for nanoscale electrochemistry, which will be useful for studying electron transfer mechanisms as well as for the detection of analyte species in ultralow sample volumes.", "date": "2023-07-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Carbon-based Materials; Electrochemical Analysis; Nanofabrication", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Characterization of AAV capsid proteins (VPs) and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) has become a critical attribute monitored to evaluate product quality. To accommodate the growing use of AAV delivery systems, rapid analytical methods that comply with good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards are needed. As shown in previous studies, mass protein liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of full-length AAV VPs provides both quick and reliable serotype identification as well as proteoform information of each VP. However, for AAV2, separation of VP2 and VP1 has proven difficult to obtain, with successful separation only achieved when using mobile phase modifiers incompatible with MS. This incompatibility hinders in-depth AAV VP characterization by suppressing ion signal, thus reducing VP proteoform identifications through the generation of low intensity MS spectra. Using AAV2 as a test case, we demonstrate how coupling hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with MS compatible difluoroacetic acid (DFA) as a mobile phase modifier, achieves complete separation of the three AAV VPs while also generating high quality MS spectra. Employing increased MS resolving power enabled improved identification of VP proteoforms whose PTMs were confirmed using peptide mapping. The LC-MS workflow was further transformed to develop an assay using GMP compliant software capable of rapid AAV serotype profiling. Incorporated into this method is the ability to perform serotype PTM characterization if desired.

What is missing, however, are experimental methods to directly probe these interactions in order to reveal what determines reactivity of intermediates and the rate of the reaction. Here, we propose metal specific and time-resolved valence-to-core resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (VtC-RIXS) at the transition metal L-edge as a method to provide a full account of the evolution of metal-alkane interactions during transition-metal mediated C-H activation reactions. For the model system cyclopentadienyl rhodium dicarbonyl (CpRh(CO)2), we demonstrate with a combination of experiment and quantum chemical simulation how the Rh-centered valence-excited final states probed with VtC-RIXS directly reflect changes in donation and back-donation between the alkane C-H group and the transition metal as the reaction proceeds via its intermediates. Following the initial photo-triggered CO dissociation, we find substantial reduction in charge donation onto the metal and the resulting stabilization of metal-centered states as the alkane coordinates to the Rh center in a \u03c3-complex intermediate. C-H bond cleavage in the final oxidative addition step is instead characterized by a substantial increase in back-donation as the new Rh-hydrogen and Rh-carbon bonds are formed. We benchmark and validate our simulations against experimental steady-state measurements.

A key factor influencing the performance of HF-OLEDs is F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Here, we investigate the FRET mechanism in blue HF-OLEDs using contrasting TADF sensitisers. We demonstrate that the molecular structure of the sensitiser significantly impacts FRET efficiency, exemplified by the spiro-linked TADF molecule ACRSA. The presence of the rigid spiro-bond minimizes dihedral angle inhomogeneity, suppresses lower energy conformers that exhibit minimal FRET to the terminal emitter. Consequently, FRET efficiency can be optimized to nearly 100%. The photophysical properties of the sensitisers also play a crucial role in HF-OLED performance, and we demonstrate how the properties of a near-ideal sensitiser diverge from an ideal TADF emitters. The sensitiser quantum yield need not be a limiting factor as rapid FRET can effectively outcompete non-radiative processes in HF systems. As a result, blue HF-OLEDs utilizing a greenish sensitiser exhibit a remarkable tripling of external quantum efficiency (~30%) compared to the non-HF devices. This new understanding opens avenues for sensitiser design, indicating that green sensitisers can efficiently pump blue terminal emitters, thus reducing device exciton energies and improving blue OLED stability.

We showed that the in situ generation of GNPs occurs with higher efficiency in cancerous pancreatic cells than in non-cancerous cells and that these GNPs have high nuclear localization, resulting in the specific radiosensitization of cancer cells. Our studies in a xenograft murine model of pancreatic cancer revealed a uniform distribution of GNPs in the tumor, with insignificant gold content and low toxicity in normal organs. Radiosensitization by biosynthesized GNPs halted tumor growth for more than 30 days and was associated with a significantly higher median survival versus radiation alone (235 vs 102 days, respectively).", "date": "2023-07-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We find that these shifts can cause performance to drop by up to 60% and uncertainty calibration by up to 40%. This leads us to propose a splitting protocol that aims to close the gap between deployment and testing. Then, using this protocol, a thorough investigation is conducted to assess the impact of model design, model selection and dataset characteristics on MOOD performance and uncertainty calibration. We find that appropriate representations and algorithms with built-in uncertainty estimation are crucial to improve performance and uncertainty calibration.

Highly efficient photosensitization was observed for dyads bearing pyrene and anthracene substituents, which exhibited singlet oxygen generation with quantum yield of up to 94%. Notably, charge transfer and ISC were observed in non-polar solvent (toluene) due to the increased electron accepting ability of the diethoxycarbonyl-BODIPY as compared to alkyl-substituted BODIPY scaffold. Studied dyads were used as photosensitizers for creation of volume phase transmission gratings in a photopolymerizable material based on cellulose acetate - polyethylene glycol (CA-PEG) matrix.

Herein, we demonstrate that adoption of two-electron detection systems can circumvent these limitations and allow the development of low-cost, paper-based devices. We showcase the power of this approach by developing a continuous flow assay for urinary creatinine, enabled by an embedded graphenic two-electrode detector. The detection system not only simplifies sensor fabrication and readout hardware but also provides robust sensing performance with high detection efficiencies. In addition to enabling high-throughput analysis of clinical urine samples, our two-electrode sensors provide unprecedented insights into the fundamental mechanism of the ferricyanide-mediated creatinine reaction.

Powder X-ray diffraction and modulated differential scanning calorimetry were used to characterize the samples after each milling time on their path to amorphization. Our results show that forms \u2160 and III directly converted into an amorphous phase, while form \u2161 first undergoes a polymorphic transition to form \u2160, and then gradually loses its crystallinity, finally reaching full amorphousness. During ball milling of forms \u2160 and \u2161, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the amorphous fraction of the milled material remains almost unchanged at 75\u2103 and 74\u2103, respectively (whilst the amorphous content increases).

The amorphous fraction of milled forms I and II samples presented a longer structural relaxation (i.e., lower molecular mobility) than the amorphous fraction of milled form III samples. Moreover, the structural relaxation time remained the same for the increasing amorphous fraction during milling of forms I and II. In contrast, the structural relaxation times were always shorter for the amorphous fraction of form III, but increased with increasing amorphous content during milling, confirming amorphous-to-amorphous transformation.

In van der Waals (vdW) solids comprised of 1D or quasi-1D (q-1D) chains, anisotropy in both intra- and inter-chain directions results in an abundance of packing motifs and altered physical states. Q-1D vdW solids with topologically protected states are most sought after due to their potential as building blocks for quantum and spintronic devices. Yet, access to such facet- and edge-specific states is limited by the stochastic nature of micromechanical exfoliation. Here, we demonstrate that Bi4I4, a q-1D vdW topological insulator, can be crystallized from the vapor phase either into nanowires or quasi-2D nanosheets. We find that gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) on the growth substrate, in conjunction with the anisotropic structure of Bi4I4, direct the dimensionality of Bi4I4 nanostructures. Systematic variation of Au NP diameters, Bi:I precursor ratios, and growth-deposition temperatures reveal that Au NPs generally act as nucleation sites for vapor-solid growth of nanowires. Post-synthesis analyses of 20 nm Au NPs show that the 1:1 ratio of Bi to I within the Au NPs uniquely triggers the vapor-liquid-solid growth of [001]-oriented nanosheets from laterally-ordered [Bi4I4]n chains along the [100] direction. We rationalize the bimodal growth pathways and the morphologically distinct nanostructures based on crystallization habits of the nanostructures, Bi:I ratios in the Au NPs post-synthesis, and orientation of stereochemically active Bi lone pairs between adjacent chains.

Permeation is involved not only in the maintenance of homeostasis at the cell level but also in the absorption and biodistribution of pharmacologically active substances throughout the human body. Membranes are formed by phospholipid bilayers that represent an energy barrier for the permeating molecules. Crossing this energy barrier is assumed to be a singular event, and permeation has traditionally been described as a 1st order kinetic process, proportional only to the concentration gradient of the permeating substance. For a given membrane composition, permeability was believed to be a unary property dependent only on the permeating molecule itself. We provide experimental evidence that this long-held view might not be entirely correct. Liposomes were used in co-permeation experiments with a fluorescent probe, where simultaneous permeation of two substances occurred over a single phospholipid bilayer. Using an assay of six commonly prescribed drugs, we have found that the presence of a co-permeant can either enhance or suppress the permeation rate of the probe molecule, often more than two-fold in each direction. This can have significant consequences for the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of commonly prescribed drugs when used in combination and provide new insight into so-far unexplained drug-drug interactions, as well as changing the perspective on how new drug candidates are evaluated and tested.", "date": "2023-07-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Biophysical Chemistry; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, we developed computational models of the hair surface and two polymers with different architectures. The first polymer studied was a semi-flexible, linear polysaccharide of natural origin, which offers potential for sustainable formulations. The second, and more complex model, was a stiff, comb-like cationic polyelectrolyte similar to petroleum-based polymers traditionally used in hair care cosmetics. We conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the adsorption of the polymers onto the substrate and we found that increasing polymer concentration enhanced adsorption. The branched copolymer led to a thicker coating and exhibited a more random coverage pattern compared to the linear polymer. Furthermore, we analyzed the stability of the polymer coating by running Brownian dynamics simulations of the adsorbed polymers under a linear shear flow. These simulations revealed a correlation between flow strength and polymer desorption, thereby highlighting the importance of low desorption time for performing coatings in cosmetic applications.

Therefore, we present herein a comprehensive analysis of fluid dynamics and solid transport in split-and-recombine oscillatory flow reactors. The research aims to improve the understanding of the mechanisms behind the resuspension capacity of solids in flow driven by the proven efficacy of such reactors in processing of reactions involving multiple phases. On the basis of its importance as a sustainable reaction medium, water was utilized as liquid phase during our comprehensive analysis. Experiments in a commercially available flow reactor (HANU 2X 5) verified a six-fold reduction of particle deposition in case of oscillatory flow compared to constant flow conditions using SiO2 slurries. Further investigations with a full factorial Design of Experiment approach revealed that the tuning of oscillation parameters enables the system to reach an optimal homogeneous suspension instead of incipient clogging. The net slurry flow rate was also found to significantly influence solids suspension capabilities. Under optimized conditions, quantitative transport of up to 10 wt% SiO2 slurries was achieved. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed to give insight into the multiphase fluid flow within the reactor geometry. It was found that oscillatory flow creates large recirculation regions and remarkable positive vertical velocities near the static mixers within the reactor plate that generate upward forces facilitating particle resuspension. By employing oscillations, suspension capabilities improved up to 5 times compared to stationary flow conditions. It was also observed that strategic asymmetries within the reactor could enhance resuspension, while the cross flow section aspect ratio exhibited only minimal influence. By utilizing a novel calculation method for Lagrangian particle tracing simulations, computational times for acquiring particle positions under oscillatory flow conditions were reduced by 82%. The simulation validated the benefits of oscillations in sustaining particle suspension. Oscillatory flow demonstrated a significant reduction in particle deposition at the reactor bottom compared to constant flow. The combination of experimental and computational approaches provides valuable insights for optimizing oscillatory flow reactor design, further advancing their utilization in chemical reaction technology and also potentially in manufacturing.", "date": "2023-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Reaction Engineering; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

A powerful operando method to analyze such side reactions and their onset potentials is differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). While the method provides valuable information, the correct assignment of the DEMS signals and deriving quantitative information on the amounts and types of gases released can be challenging. A frequent limitation is that gas concentrations are often calculated from single m/z ratios only. This has the drawback of overlooking unexpected gases which can moreover cause misinterpretation of the signal intensities, or even the attribution to gases which are not actually formed. Here, we describe a multiple concentration determination (MCD) algorithm, that uses the full MS spectra as a basis. The approach allows a more reliable determination of the gas release and is, to our knowledge, for the first time applied to DEMS for batteries.

In case of 2G, dimethyl ether is found as decomposition product. Pressure change measurements in a closed cell are used as a second, independent method to validate the gas quantification of the MCD algorithm.

Greenlee", "abstract": "Valorization of lignin is gaining popularity due to its ability to make industrial processes more sustainable. However, the currently prevalent catalytic technologies use large amounts of energy and harsh reaction conditions.  As a result, bonds between lignin precursors are cleaved unselectively, and the selectivity of aromatic products is reduced. An electrocatalytic approach may allow improved control, and few studies have assessed electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction of lignin in organic solvents. Organic solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF) are of interest for lignin electrocatalysis due to their use in the cosolvent enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation (CELF) process. The CELF process has the ability to overcome biomass recalcitrance by breaking \u03b2-O-4 aryl ether interunit linkages. Using electrocatalytic conversion processes, additional \u03b2-O-4 interunit linkages can be broken down selectively. As a result, if these two processes are integrated, a high amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups with low content aryl ether linkages will be produced, making the product suitable for development of biofuels and other chemicals. This study shows that by using controlled electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction in THF/aqueous acidic electrolytes in the ratio of 2:1, nonpolar  \u03b2-O-4 linkages can be cleaved. This ratio was chosen to mimic the electrolyte composition environment of the CELF pretreatment. The results from both ATR-IR and NMR characterization are consistent and show that \u03b2-O-4 interlinkage bonds were broken. Quantitative calculations from NMR show that during oxidative potential holds, the presence of aromatic compounds increased by 28.67% and aliphatic compounds decreased by 32.73%. On the other hand, during reductive potential holds, the presence of aromatic compounds decreased by 33.50% and aliphatic compounds decreased by 78.43%. These results indicate that electrooxidation and electroreduction may be used strategically to cleave interunit linkages. Thus, if electrochemical degradation of lignin is used as a secondary treatment in conjunction with the CELF process, it will greatly increase the possibility of transforming lignin into value-added products.", "date": "2023-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Biopolymers; Cellulosic materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We calculated molecular features related to 2D and 3D structure information, as well as physical and electronic properties. These descriptors were paired with 4 categories of machine learning methods (linear, kernel, ensemble, and neural network), yielding valuable benchmarks about feature and model performance. Despite the excellent performance on a high-throughput experiment (HTE) dataset (R2 around 0.9), no method gave satisfying results on the literature data. The best performance was an R2 of 0.395 \u00b1 0.020 using stack technique. Error analysis revealed that reactivity cliff and yield uncertainty are the main reasons for incorrect predictions. Removing reactivity cliffs and uncertain reactions boosted the R2 to 0.457 \u00b1 0.006.

However, ranking the discovered ligands for their affinity and specificity to the target is obscured by genetic amplification bias and amplification of target-unrelated phage, resulting in inefficient experimental validation and potentially intractable discovery. Here, we describe the use of indirect machine learning (ML) to improve the efficient discovery of target-specific peptide ligands from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. We combine peptide sequence information (input) with experimental fitness scores (output) of the individual peptide performance across the rounds of bio-panning in a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) architecture. Because the fitness scores contain bias, we use regularization to facilitate limited indirect learning and effectively process the peptide sequence information, while still using the predicted fitness scores to rank the peptides. Peptides containing high-affinity binding motifs to our target were ranked by the regularized model more than threefold higher, compared to any combination of experimental fitness scores. Baseline models of random forest (RF) and -nearest neighbor (KNN) demonstrated slightly lower performance but also demonstrated the importance of regularization. However, the BiLSTM model emerged as the most robust, as it was less sensitive to the peptide representation and the specific fitness score used. Shapley residue analysis generated interpretable structure-activity-relationship (SAR) by providing insight into predicted affinity-driving residues and physicochemical properties across the entire peptide and as well as at motif-specific positions. We expect that this approach will elucidate high-affinity ligands against a multitude of targets, vastly improving the discovery capability of phage display.", "date": "2023-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Tetra-substituted DOTA derivatives with phenyl and benzoate substituents in the alpha-position were prepared.

Single-pass conversion is becoming increasingly common as a performance benchmark for CO2 electrolyzers because it suggests concentrated products and reduced separation energy for many catalytic processes. However, our analysis shows that CO2R reactor configurations that maximize single-pass conversion currently suffer from low product concentration in the outlet stream. This is because they restrict CO2 flow or operate in acidic cathode environments, which promote considerable hydrogen evolution as a side reaction. For any gas products besides syngas, high single-pass conversion does not signify that separation energy losses have been eliminated, or that product streams are directly suitable as feedstocks for downstream processes.

UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dimers are computed with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and compared to experimental UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Both Npe:TCNB and Npe:TCNQ are found to exhibit neutral character in the S0 state and ionic character in the S1 state. The degree of CT in the S0 state of Npe:TCNB is found to be slightly smaller than that of Npe:TCNQ, as predicted from differences in electron affinities of the acceptors.  Furthermore, the degree of CT in the S1 state of Npe:TCNB is found to be slightly higher than that of Npe:TCNQ, aligning with predictions employing a recently developed orbital similarity metric.", "date": "2023-07-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Optical Materials; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This, associated with the high chemical stability of the MOF enables a very slow replacement of NO by water molecules in biological media, achieving an extraordinarily extended NO delivery over at least 72 hours, exceeding by far the NO kinetics release reported by others porous materials, paving the way for the development of safe and successful gas therapies.

Several studies indicate that the cavity-mediated changes in the nature of vibrational energy flow within a molecule may play a significant role. Here we study a model polaritonic system, proposed and analyzed earlier by Fischer, Anders, and Saalfrank[1], comprising of a one dimensional isomerization mode coupled to a single photon mode in a lossless cavity. We show that the isomerization probability in presence of virtual photons, for specific cavity-system coupling strengths and cavity frequencies, can exhibit suppression or enhancement for different choices of the initial reactant vibropolariton wavepacket. We observe qualitative agreement between the classical and quantum average isomerization probabilities in the virtual photon case. A significant part of the effects due to coupling to the cavity can be rationalized in terms of a \u201cchaos-order-chaos\u201d transition of the classical phase space and the phase space localization nature of the polariton states that dominantly participate in the quantum isomerization dynamics. On the other hand, for initial states with zero photons (i.e., a \u201cdark cavity\u201d) the isomerization probability is suppressed when the cavity frequency is tuned near to the fundamental frequency of the reactive mode. The classical-quantum correspondence in the zero photon case is unsatisfactory.

Previous studies have suggested that the levels of iodine in water provided by authorities may not accurately reflect the levels reaching end-users.\nMaterials and Methods. We analyzed 21 tap water samples collected from different localities across Israel, 13 post-treated desalinated water samples from three of the largest Israeli desalination plants, and several natural water samples. An improved method of ICP-MS developed in our laboratory was used to analyze the content of iodine and other macro-elements, and determination of iodine was performed in alkaline media.\nResults: Our results showed that it is possible to distinguish between sample groups based on iodine concentration, water hardness, and Ca/Mg ratio. The median iodine concentrations for four groups of tap water samples ranged from 0.3 to 12.3 \u00b5g/L, which is lower than the concentrations previously reported by other researchers in Israel. Based on typical consumption, the water samples can provide no more than 3.39% of the recommended dietary allowance level for iodine. The analysis of post-treated desalinated water samples indicated that these waters comply with industrial specifications but contain only trace concentrations of iodine and much less magnesium than recommended by different public health authorities for public consumption of drinking water.\nConclusion: The total iodine concentrations found were lower than several observations reported in previous years in the literature. There are currently no strict regulations regarding iodine and magnesium levels in drinking and/or softened (desalinated) water, but the intensive desalination plant application is already exhibiting a negative impact on public health. Further investigations are needed, but the present study provides useful insights for developing an effective policy to ensure adequate iodine supply for the population of Israel through drinking water.\n", "date": "2023-07-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Our analysis reveals that the primary decay pathway for photo-excited bis-phosphanyl-bridged stil- bene is the intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state and nonradiative.

Research in this field has seen rapid growth in recent years. Therefore, consistent reporting practices must be implemented to enable reliable comparison of device performance. Although several studies have highlighted the best practices for analysing and reporting data from such energy storage devices, there is yet to be an empirical study investigating whether researchers in the field are correctly implementing these recommendations, and which assesses the variation in reporting between different laboratories. Here, we address this deficit by carrying out the first interlaboratory study of the analysis of supercapacitor electrochemistry data. We find that the use of incorrect formulae and researchers having different interpretations of key terminologies are the primary causes of variability in data reporting. Furthermore, we highlight the more significant variation in reported results for electrochemical profiles showing non-ideal capacitive behaviour.

Streaming data-driven process control systems can be valuable in lowering the cost of production or discovering novel reaction pathways. Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) is an inexpensive spectroscopy technique that has characteristics that make it appropriate for on-line, high-throughput measurement of metabolic changes in a bioreactor vessel. Future quantitative NMR (qNMR) advancements for processing this type of streaming data could grant a unique possibility for in-situ bioprocessing applications. One significant challenge for 1D 1H qNMR is that the spectrum of a compound can deviate from its spectrum in a reference setting, especially across the various spectrometer frequency and concentration profile of metabolite mixture in the biofluid sample. A robust predictive or constraint model on the generative mechanism of the measured NMR signal can help guide future qNMR developments. We present an approximated 1D 1H NMR signal model that shows promise in fitting chemical shifts and other interpretable parameters for small mixtures of compounds. Our model use reference chemistry parameters of compounds to derive patterns between its nuclei via spin Hamiltonian simulations and hierarchical convex clustering on a spin angular momentum feature between the nuclei, which are quantum subsystems. These patterns are used to construct a surrogate model of the compound mixture with a lower degrees-of-freedom. Our approach does not require any phase or baseline correction techniques to pre-process the data, making it a generative model that fully accounts for the relative phase information, which is usually attenuated in a heuristic manner and ignored in conventional NMR data processing.

Due to the dynamic and structurally complex properties of RNA, both experimental and traditional computational methods have difficulty in determining RNA\u2019s 3D structure. Herein, we introduce TAPERSS (Theoretical Analyses, Prediction, and Evaluation of RNA Structures from Sequence), a physics-based fragment assembly method for predicting 3D RNA structures from sequence. Using a fragment library created using discrete path sampling calculations of RNA dinucleoside monophosphates, TAPERSS can sample the physics-based energy landscapes of any RNA sequence with relatively low computational complexity. We have benchmarked TAPERSS on 21 RNA tetraloops, using a combinatorial algorithm as a proof-of-concept. We show that TAPERSS was successfully able to predict the apo-state structures of all 21 RNA hairpins, with 16 of those structures also having low predicted energies as well. We demonstrate that TAPERSS performs most accurately on GNRA-like tetraloops with mostly stacked loop-nucleotides, while having limited success with more dynamic UNCG and CUYG tetraloops, most likely due to the influence of the RNA force field used to create the fragment library. Moreover, we show that TAPERSS can successfully predict the majority of the experimental non-apo states, highlighting its potential in anticipating biologically significant yet unobserved states. This holds great promise for future applications in drug design and related studies. With discussed improvements and implementation of more efficient sampling algorithms, we believe TAPERSS may serve as a useful tool for a physics-based conformational sampling of large RNA structures.", "date": "2023-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We also examined the performance subject to the presence of a neodymium magnet, with and without faba bean, Vicia faba, as a copper bio-trap. Additionally, on a limited scale, we plasma-sputtered ZSM-5 pellets with zinc and tested their copper extraction under the magnet effect. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP) revealed that the reinforced zeolite led to the fastest copper extraction, outperforming the raw zeolite and the bio-trap, especially as time advanced. Accompanying the reinforced zeolite with the bio-trap was the most effective over time, followed by having both the magnet and the bio-trap to accompany the reinforced zeolite. However, interestingly, having the magnet as a sole companion of the reinforced zeolite was always better than using raw zeolite, but slightly of a lesser yield than having the reinforced companionless. The bio-trap was a better companion than the magnet, but after 20min having both companions was more beneficial than having the magnet alone and less yielding than having the bio-trap solo in the long term, indicating a synergistic effect between the reinforced zeolite and the bio-trap. Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX), and X-ray diffraction analyses, provided supportive information that underscored the stability yet the differential performance of ZSM-5. Although the extraction efficacy deteriorated sharply over time, the zinc-sputtered zeolite showed promising early results, exceeding those of the raw and the reinforced zeolites when the magnet was absent and almost identical to the outcome when the magnet accompanied the reinforced zeolite.

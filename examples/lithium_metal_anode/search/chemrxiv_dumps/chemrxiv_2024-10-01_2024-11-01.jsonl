Can machine learning be leveraged to overcome this hurdle? Utilizing different fingerprints may indeed lead to improved results. However, is there a single machine-learning approach that can effectively address selectivity across all kinases. In this study, the author collect kinase activity data from PubChem database (January 2023) using Uniprot IDs for each kinase. Each Uniprot ID is associated with its unique dataset, and duplicate points were removed to ensure accuracy. The data was then appended together, and any datasets containing fewer than 120 points were discarded. Each data point was categorized as either Active (1) or Inactive (0) based on the activity data. Two fingerprinting approaches were employed for predictions: MACCS fingerprints and Morgan2 (ECFP2) with a 2048-bit representation. The combined dataset was then divided into two subsets, one featuring imbalance data and another with balanced data. Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network models were applied to both datasets. To evaluate the performance of these models, various metrics were employed, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). The results showed that Morgan fingerprinting performed slightly better than MACCS fingerprinting. A total of 480 target IDs was produced, with 452 unique IDs identified. On each dataset(balance and imbalance), two models were developed for both fingerprints, resulting in a combined total of 1920 predictions. Interestingly, the imbalance data yielded higher specificity compared to the balanced data. Each model has been deployed and made publicly available at (github.com/phalem/minKLIFSAI). However, the current data on all kinases is not yet sufficient to enable machine learning to reliably discover selective inhibitors", "date": "2024-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To facilitate triaged sampling of chemical libraries and other collections of molecules, we have developed Dedenser, a tool for the downsampling of chemical clusters. Dedenser functions by reducing the membership of clusters within chemical point clouds while maintaining the initial topology, or distribution, in chemical space. Dedenser is a Python package that utilizes Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise to first identify clusters present in 3D chemical point clouds, and then downsamples by applying Poisson disk sampling to clusters based on either their volume or density in chemical space. A command line interface tool is available with Dedenser, which allows for generation of chemical point clouds, using Mordred for QSAR descriptor calculations and uniform manifold approximation and projection for 3D embedding, as well as visualization. We hope that Dedenser will serve the community by enabling quick access to reduced collections of molecules that are representative of larger sets, selecting even distributions of molecules within clusters rather than single representative molecules.", "date": "2024-10-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To overcome the inherent chemical inertness of 2D materials, we utilized direct femtosecond laser two-photon oxidation to activate predefined regions on single-layer graphene, enabling area-selective deposition of europium-organic thin films. By optimizing the deposition parameters and carefully choosing a transfer polymer, we achieved over 90% selectivity and high film homogeneity in the activated areas.

Therefore, a versatile strategy for surface functionalization that is compatible with a variety of particle compositions would empower nanotechnology research. Silica coating offers a promising approach, but the ease with which silica shells can be synthesized is determined by the initial solution state of the nanoparticle, since the silica sol-gel chemistry typically occurs in an aqueous phase. While protocols for coating water-soluble particles are well-established, protocols for nanomaterials suspended in organic solvents require phase-transfer during the coating process, often leading to inconsistent reproducibility, non-uniform thicknesses, difficulty in producing thin coatings, and particle aggregation during functionalization. Here, we demonstrate that these challenges stem from insufficient stabilization of the organic-phase particles during the phase transfer, and can be overcome by adding excess surface ligands during the silica growth process. The inclusion of these excess ligands sufficiently alters the nanoparticles\u2019 surface chemistry to suppress particle aggregation, allowing deposition of shells as thin as 0.7 nm on a wide range of nanoparticle compositions, sizes, and shapes. The versatility and reproducibility of this approach is illustrated through its application to isotropic magnetite nanoparticles with diameters between 20-28 nm, anisotropic magnetite nanodiscs >200 nm in diameter, and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots.

While many red-light absorbing/emitting fluorophores have been developed recently, functional red-light absorbing photoredox catalysts are scarce. Many photoredox catalysts rely on long-lived triplet excited states (triplets), which can efficiently engage in single electron transfer (SET) reactions with substrates. However, triplets of \u03c0-conjugated molecules are often significantly lower in energy than photogenerated singlet excited states (singlets). Combined with the inherent low energy of red light, this could limit the reductive/oxidative powers. Here, we introduce a series of sustainable heavy atom\u2013free photoredox catalysts based on red-light absorbing dibenzo-fused BODIPY. The catalysts consist of two covalently linked units: a dibenzo-fused BODIPY fluorophore and an electron donor, arranged orthogonally. Excitation of the dibenzoBODIPY unit induces charge separation (CS) from the donor to the dibenzoBODIPY unit, forming a radical pair (RP) state. Unlike the regular BODIPY counterparts, these catalysts do not form triplets. Instead, SET occurs from the high-energy singlet-born RP states, preventing energy loss and effectively utilizing the low-energy red light. The proximity of donor molecules allows efficient charge separation despite the CS being uphill in energy. The molecules demonstrate efficient catalysis of Atom Transfer Radical Addition (ATRA) reaction, yielding products with high yields ranging from 70% to 90%, while the molecule without a donor group does not exhibit catalytic activity. The mechanistic studies by transient absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy methods support the proposed mechanism.

In this work, using operando electrochemical atomic force microscopy, we track the growth of SEI on copper in a carbonate electrolyte. From operando measurements of SEI thickness and irreversible electrochemical capacity, we directly visualize the dual growth regimes of the SEI, observing an early-stage primary SEI approximately 10 times more \u201celectrochemically compact\u201d than later-stage secondary SEI, as quantified via the incremental thickness per charge passed. While primary SEI is responsible for about half of the irreversible capacity loss (in a 24 h period), it accounts for only a tenth of thickness.

Nanotherapeutics capable of detecting distinctive chemical signals within the disparate metabolic states of invasive cancer phenotypes represents a promising avenue for eliciting a favourable anti-tumor response, thereby enhancing drug efficacy and safety through microenvironment-selective cellular uptake and intracellular release. For instance, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is notoriously difficult to treat, typically features extracellular acidification and elevated intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. By leveraging these distinctive metabolic characteristics, we have developed a surface-modified translational human serum albumin (HSA) nanocarrier, termed His-aHSA, which features anionic carboxylic acid and pH-inducible positively charged imidazole groups. This modification endows the nanocarrier with the ability to perceive the acidic TME, responding to a pH change typical for glycolytic, lactate producing tumors, which enables selective uptake into TNBC cells and spheroids.

Elementary building blocks converge, seemingly adhering to an intricate blueprint, orchestrating order from chaos. While classical theories have long described crystallization as a monomer-by-monomer addition (whether involving atoms, ions, molecules or colloids), non-classical crystallization pathways introduce complexity. Using microscopic charged particles as monomers, we reveal the precise mechanisms underpinning the formation of ionic colloidal crystals. Our findings indicate that these crystals primarily crystallize through a two-step process, wherein metastable amorphous `blobs' condense from the gas phase, subsequently evolving into small binary crystals. Once formed, these small crystals grow to form large faceted structures through three main processes that occur simultaneously: addition of free monomers from bulk, capture and absorption of surrounding blobs, and oriented attachment of other crystals. These complex crystallization pathways occur both in bulk and on surfaces across a range of particle sizes and interaction strengths, resulting in a diverse array of crystal types and morphologies. Harnessing our ability to tune the interaction potential through small changes in salt concentration, we developed a continuous dialysis approach that allows fine control over the interaction strength in both time and space. This method enables us to discover and characterize a wide variety of crystal structures in a single experiment, including a previously unreported low-density hollow structure and the heteroepitaxial formation of composite crystal structures.", "date": "2024-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for viral replication, making it one of the prime and promising antiviral target. Mpro features several druggable sites, including active site and allosteric sites near the dimerization interface that regulate its catalytic activity. This study has identified six highly efficacious antiviral SARS-CoV-2 compounds (WIN-62577, KT185, bexarotene, ledipasvir, diacerein, and simepervir) using structure-based virtual screening of compound libraries against Mpro. Using SPR and ITC, the binding of selected inhibitory compounds to target Mpro was validated. FRET-based protease assay demonstrated that the identified molecules effectively inhibit Mpro with IC50 values in the range from 0.08 to 7.31 \u03bcM. Additionally, in-vitro cell-based antiviral assays showed high efficacy with EC50 values in the range of 1.8 to 18.92 \u03bcM. Crystal structure of Mpro-minocycline complex detailed the possible inhibition mechanism of minocycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic. Minocycline binds to an allosteric site, revealing residues critical for the loss of protease activity due to destabilization of molecular interactions at the dimeric interface, which are crucial for Mpro proteolytic activity. The study suggests that the binding of minocycline to the allosteric site may play a role in Mpro dimer destabilization and directs the rational design of minocycline derivatives as antiviral drugs.", "date": "2024-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the present work, rigid macrocycle K-1 with nonplanar conformation and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property was selected as an energy donor in ALHS, while the non-cyclic AIEgen K-2 was used for comparative study. In aqueous solution, an efficient one-step energy-transfer process was readily established between blue-emitting K-1 and an acceptor (namely PBTB) with orange fluorescence to afford a high energy-transfer efficiency (\u03a6ET) of up to 82.6% at the optimal donor/acceptor (K-1/PBTB) ratio of 1000:40, while the K-2/PBTB assemblies gave a \u03a6ET of 77.9% under the same conditions. Notably, bright white light emission can be successfully realized with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.34) at the ratio of K-1/PBTB = 200:1 and the ratio of K-2/PBTB = 500:3, respectively. Moreover, the triad FRET system was fabricated through energy transfer from the AIEgens to PBTB, then further transferring the captured energy to the final red-emitting receptor (namely as Z1), achieving an efficient two-step sequential energy transfer. When the ratio of K-1/PBTB/Z1 assemblies reached 1000:40:14, the optimal \u03a6ET was 66.4%, which is higher than that of K-2/PBTB/Z1 assemblies under the same ratio. More importantly, it was found that the ALHS based on macrocycle K-1 showed much higher photocatalytic activity for the cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction with an 87% yield under white-light illumination in water than that of the non-cyclic AIEgen K-2 (35% yield). Therefore, the flexibility of this novel supramolecular strategy renders the macrocyclic AIEgen a promising candidate to construct efficient ALHSs for photocatalysis.", "date": "2024-10-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The phonon transport properties of two-dimensional carbon-based allotropes are poorly understood in terms of their NTE properties. This work with a specific focus on carbon-based allotropes, explores the underlying mechanisms of the thermal conductivity (TC) and NTE of graphene, haeckelite, pentahexoctite, s-graphene, 6.6.12 and delta Graphynes (Gys). High TC is imperative for efficiently dissipating heat in electronic devices, whereas thermoelectric devices need to be thermally resistive with low TC. Delta-Gy shows highest NTE as well as lowest TC and vice versa is true for graphene. Graphene displays a lower degree of anisotropic TC, while s-graphene exhibits the highest level of anisotropic TC. The behaviour of their TC are understood on the basis of soft-phonon modes, phonon group velocity (vg), phonon lifetime (\u03c4) and mean free path (MFP). The acoustic and optical phonon branches play a key role in determining both TC and NTE of the materials. Out-of-plane buckling of a two-dimensional materials can suppress heat conductivity by increasing the phonon scattering. Buckling is also shown to increase the NTE.

ScF3, a well-known NTE material has been reported to show NTE coefficients up-to 1000K. At ambient conditions, ScF3 crystallizes in a cubic symmetry (Pm-3m space group) same as that in the ReO3-type structures. Crystal-structure predictions (CSP) show that at P=1 GPa, a phase transition occurs in cubic ScF3 to form the rhombohedral phase (R-3C space-group). Quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) calculations show that this new phase can show NTE coefficients for temperatures as high as 4500 K due to soft rigid-unit modes (RUM). The stability of this phase persists until 4 GPa. Beyond 4 GPa, the rhombohedral phase further undergoes a phase-transition into an orthorhombic-phase (Immm space group) having a non-corner-shared polyhedron network. This phase shows very poor NTE. On further increasing the pressure to 6 GPa, a trigonal-prismatic arrangement of ScF3 is obtained (R32 space group) which shows a reasonably good NTE phase due to the corner shared framework and remains stable till 9 GPa. Amongst the various pressure generated phases in ScF3, the rhombohedral phase shows the highest NTE behaviour. Ab-inito molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations show that maximum volume contraction occurs for this R-3C phase due to facile bending of the \u2220Sc-F-Sc causing framework softening.

Herein, we introduce the concept of supramolecular gated self-immolative chemistry, allowing for the control of covalent bond scission through noncovalent host-guest interactions. Supramolecular regulation of self-immolation is exemplified using a newly designed ethylenediamine-based, bis-benzylated self-immolative entity (SIE) SIE2 in combination with the bioorthogonal cucurbituril-meditated host-guest system. The SIE2 engages in supramolecular complexation with cucurbit[7]uril (CB) host molecules, which effectively masks its reactivity and prevents premature initiation of the self-immolative cyclization\u2013elimination cascade. The introduction of a com-petitive guest molecule 1-adamantylamine triggers the removal of the supramolecular CB capping group from the CB-SIE2 complex, revealing the nascent self-immolative structure. This decomplexation initiates a rapid cyclization-elimination cascade that releases the loaded cargo molecules from SIE2. As a proof-of-concept, we capped a self-immolative methylene blue pro-drug SIE5 with CB. The subsequent addition of 1-adamantylamine reactivated the self-immolation, initiating the controlled release of the therapeutic photosensitizer and on-demand activating photodynamic therapy for cell killing.

Additionally, there has been a significant advancement of the force fields used for simulations associated with the explicit treatment of electronic polarizability. In this study, we apply oscillating chemical potential grand canonical Monte Carlo and machine learning methods to determine reaction coordinates combined with metadynamics simulations to explore the role of Mg2+ distribution and electronic polarizability in the context of the classical Drude oscillator polarizable force field on the stability of the Twister ribozyme. The introduction of electronic polarizability along with details of the distribution of Mg2+ significantly stabilize the simulations with respect to sampling the crystallographic conformation.  The introduction of electronic polarizability leads to increased stability over that obtained with the additive CHARMM36 FF reported in a previous study, allowing for a wider range of ions distribution to stabilize Twister. Specific interactions contributing to stabilization are identified included both those observed in the crystal structures and additional experimentally unobserved interactions. Interactions of Mg2+ with the bases are indicated to make important contributions to stabilization. Notably, the presence of specific interactions between the Mg2+ ions and bases or the non-bridging phosphate oxygens (NBPO), lead to enhanced dipole moments of all three moieties. Mg2+-NPBO interactions led to enhanced dipoles of the phosphates but, interestingly, not in all of the participating ions.

Studies of ALD conformality in high-aspect-ratio (HAR) features typically assume free molecular flow conditions with Knudsen diffusion. However, the free molecular flow assumption might not be valid for real ALD processes. This work maps the evolution of the saturation profile characteristics in lateral high-aspect-ratio (LHAR) channels through simulations using a diffusion-reaction model for various diffusion regimes with a wide range of Knudsen numbers (10^6 to 10^{-6}), from free molecular flow (Knudsen diffusion) through the transition regime to continuum flow conditions (molecular diffusion). Simulations are run for ALD reactant partial pressures spanning several orders of magnitude with the exposure time kept constant (by varying the total exposure) and with the total exposure kept constant (by varying the exposure time). In a free molecular flow, for a constant total exposure, the saturation profile characteristics are identical regardless of the LHAR channel height and the partial pressure of the reactant. Under transition regime and continuum conditions, the penetration depth decreases and the steepness of the adsorption front increases with decreasing Knudsen number. The effect of varying individual parameters on the saturation profile characteristics in some cases depends on the diffusion regime. An empirical \"extended slope method\" is proposed to relate the sticking coefficient to the saturation profile's characteristic slope for any Knudsen number.", "date": "2024-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Thin Films", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite the recognized role of nutrition in modulating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying aging, there is a lack of comprehensive exploration into potential interventions that can effectively mitigate these effects. In this study, we investigated the potential anti-aging properties of vitamin D by examining its interactions with key molecular targets involved in aging-related pathways. By using molecular docking and dynamics techniques, we evaluate the interactions and stability of vitamin D2 and D3 with key proteins involved in aging pathways, such as SIRT1, mTOR, AMPK, Klotho, AhR, and MAPK. Our results reveal promising binding affinities between vitamin D and SIRT1 forms, with energy values of -48.33 kJ/mol and -45.94 kJ/mol for vitamin D2 and D3, respectively, in aqueous environments. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the vitamin D3-SIRT1 complex exhibits greater stability compared to the vitamin D2-SIRT1 complex. The study calculated the solvation-free energy to compare the solubility of vitamins D2 and D3 in water and various organic solvents. Despite their strong interactions with water, both vitamins exhibit low solubility, primarily due to the high energy cost associated with cavity formation in the aqueous environment. Compared to other solvents, water demonstrated particularly low solubility for both vitamins. This suggests that vitamins D2 and D3 prefer binding to aging receptors over dissolving in bulk aqueous environments, supporting their strong therapeutic interactions with these receptors.

Therefore, the precise quantification of ROS is of paramount importance to assess sleep deprivation-induced oxidative stress induced by sleep deprivation and elucidate the associated cerebral pathophysiology. In this work, we have applied previously synthesized water-soluble quantum dots Mn-SiQDs to specifically and accurately quantify hydroxyl radicals in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after one week of sleep deprivation. The results suggested that in the cerebrospinal fluid of brain, sleep deprivation triggered mainly the accumulation of hydroxyl radicals, while there was negligible change in the serum hydroxyl radicals of sleep-deprived mice. However, the serum ROS detection data revealed that sleep deprivation led to an increase in serum ROS of non-hydroxyl radicals in serum (e.g. 1O2, H2O2, O2\u2212, ONOO\u2212 and HOCl). Further haematological analysis confirmed that the dysregulation of redox balance led to the abnormalities in blood haematological parameters.

Initial rotating disc electrode (RDE) benchmarking of the Fe-N-C catalyst\u2019s oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity using Nafion\u2122 in alkaline electrolyte seems to neglect the restricted oxygen diffusion in the AEIs, and is recommended to be complemented by measurements with the same AEI as used in the AEMFC testing. Evaluation of the catalyst layer in a Gas-Diffusion-Electrode (GDE) setup offers a way to assess the performance in realistic operating conditions, without the additional complications of device-level water management.

Lateral flow immunoassay-based xylazine test strips (XTS) have emerged as a potential harm reduction tool for quick, easy, and field-based drug checking but their effectiveness remains underexplored. Although commercial XTS from multiple vendors are available, the absence of regulatory standards raises concerns regarding their accuracy and effectiveness.\nMethod This study evaluated the performance of commonly used commercially available XTS from different vendors to investigate the inter-product comparison of sensitivity, precision (reproducibility and robustness), cross-reactivity, and stability over changes in pH and extended storage under ambient and extreme temperature conditions. \nResults All test strips demonstrated effective sensitivity, and reproducibility and maintained their efficacy despite changes in urinary pH and storage temperatures over six weeks. Interfering compounds including lidocaine, levamisole, ketamine, methamphetamine, diphenhydramine, promethazine, and cetirizine displayed varying degrees of cross-reactivity with different XTS.  \nConclusion This study highlights the variability in performance among commercially available XTS, with implications for their use in harm reduction and forensic settings. While XTS can detect xylazine in low concentrations, the potential for false positives due to cross-reactivity with other drugs necessitates caution in their interpretation. Hence, xylazine test strips may serve as a viable harm reduction tool, provided that their cross-reactivity limitations are thoroughly documented and they are incorporated as part of a broader harm reduction strategy.\n", "date": "2024-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Education; Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, MAFLD often goes undiagnosed due to the lack of reliable clinical indicators and effective screening methods. The current gold standard for diagnosing and assessing MAFLD is through invasive liver biopsy, which is impractical for widespread screening or frequent monitoring. MASLD typically manifests as \u201cmacrovesicular steatosis,\u201d characterized by a single large fat vacuole (30-50 \u00b5m) in each hepatocyte, representing a more benign and indolent form. However, approximately 20% of MASLD cases exhibit hepatocytes with numerous smaller fat vacuoles (1-15 \u00b5m), known as \u201cmicrovesicular steatosis,\u201d which is linked to a higher risk of steatohepatitis and progression to cirrhosis and cancer. Although ultrasound (US) imaging shows promise as a non-invasive method to assess liver fat content, traditional grayscale features are not sensitive enough to detect mild liver fat or small changes over time. Novel quantitative US-liver fat quantification (QUS-LFQ) tools that analyze acoustic attenuation and backscatter are emerging, with several techniques now available on the market. However, the sensitivity of current QUS-LFQ methods to variations in fat vacuole size remains unknown. While imaging phantoms can help validate these quantitative tools, there is currently no phantom model available that can link US measurements to the severity of steatosis. Existing techniques for modifying material properties such as attenuation, backscatter, and speed of sound do not account for the macro-structure of steatosis, where the size and distribution of scatterers (such as lipid vacuoles) likely influence acoustic wave interactions and thus affect quantitative US liver fat quantification (QUS-LFQ). We developed agar-based phantoms to simulate the excessive fat accumulation and presence of lipid droplets seen in steatotic hepatocytes, using stable micron-sized peanut oil droplets as stand-ins for these lipid vacuoles. Oil microparticles in the 5-20 \u00b5m and 20-60 \u00b5m size ranges were successfully produced and their stability confirmed. Microscopy and US imaging revealed a uniform distribution of phantom constituents, including oil microparticles, throughout the agar. US-LFQ measurements were accurate, with fat content closely matching theoretical values and those obtained by MRI. Spectral CT measurements demonstrated the expected linear decrease in X-ray attenuation as the lipid content in the phantoms increased.

Sorption capacities between 30 and 37 mmol/kg have been measured which is about six times smaller compared to benchmark experiments with a 15%CO2/85%N2 gas mixture. The weak dependency of the sorption capacity from CO2 partial pressure can be explained by the ionic liquid-solid mechanism which is based on strong electrostatic forces between the electrodes and ions formed from CO2 hydrolysis. The adsorption rates are about an order of magnitude smaller for 400 ppm CO2 compared to 15% CO2 due to the higher impact of gas flow rates and greater CO2 dilution. The energy consumption varies between 492 and 697 kJ/mol which is an increase of a factor of 9-12 compared to the 15% CO2/85% N2 gas mixture.

According to our results, both reactions proceed with the formation of bound intermediates that, for the isolated systems, decompose into products because of the large energy content with which they are formed. The SO(a 1\u0394) + H2 channel is the only open for the S(1D) + H2O reaction, while many channels are open for the S(1D) + CH3OH reaction. For the latter case, statistical estimates of the product branching fractions indicate that the main channels are those leading to CH2OH + SH, H2CO + H2S, H2CS + H2O, and CH3 + HSO.

Thereby, the mass-transport capabilities of the catalyst is usually neglected at early stages of catalyst development. In this work, the reverse approach is taken: A carbon film support with an interconnected macropore network is designed for improved mass transport. Carbon precursors mesophase pitch and polyvinylalcohol (PVA) are combined with the macropore template polystyrene (PS) spheres in a ball-milling process to form a slurry for casting the film which is subsequently carbonized in different atmospheres to tune the micropore volume and combined with a model FeN4 active site.  The macroporous films are thoroughly characterized by means of SEM, N2 sorption, XPS and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) and tested as ORR catalyst support for a model FeN4 active site in a Gas-Diffusion-Electrode (GDE) half-cell, which can operate at high current density conditions. The mass transport properties of film supports with thickness of 30 \u00b5m and 70 \u00b5m are analysed and compared to a conventional powder catalyst layer based on Vulcan XC 72 powder support.

Here, we intro-duce a novel design of cofacial (ZnII)bisporphyrin cages based on dynamic imine bonding, which is synthetically simple, but at the same time highly robust and versatile, affording receptors composed of only sp2-hybridized C and N atoms. The high structural rigidity of these cages renders them ideal hosts for ditopic molecules that can fit into the cavity and bind to both metal centers, leading to association constants as high as 109 M-1 in chloroform. These strong binding affinities are a consequence of the remarkable chelate cooperativities attained, with effective molarity (EM) values reaching record values of up to 103 M. However, we discovered that the cages can still adapt their structure to a more compact version, able to host slightly smaller guests. Such conformational transition has an energy cost, which can be very different depending on the direction of the imine linkages in the cage skeleton, and which results in EM values 2 to 4 orders of magnitude lower. This interplay between cooperativity and conformational adaptability leads to strong and unusual selectivities. Not only these metalloporphyrin receptors can choose to bind preferably a particular guest, as a function of its size, but also the guest can select which host to bind, as a function now of the host conformational rigidity.

In heterogeneous catalysis, they can be further used for the rapid development and screening of new catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) is often used to calculate the parameters used in MKMs with relatively high fidelity. However, given the high cost of DFT calculations for adsorbates in heterogeneous catalysis, linear scaling relations (LSRs) and machine learning (ML) models were developed to give rapid estimates of the parameters in MKM. Regardless of the method, few studies have attempted to quantify the uncertainty in catalytic MKMs, as the uncertainties are often orders of magnitude larger than those for gas phase models. This study explores uncertainty quantification and Bayesian Parameter Estimation (BPE) for thermodynamic parameters calculated by DFT, LSRs, and GemNet-OC, a ML model developed under the Open Catalyst Project. A model for catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPOX) on Rhodium was chosen as a case study, in which the model's thermodynamic parameters and their associated uncertainties were determined using DFT, LSR, and GemNet-OC. Markov Chain Monte Carlo coupled with Ensemble Slice Sampling was used to sample the highest probability density (HPD) region of the posterior and determine the maximum of the a posteriori (MAP) for each thermodynamic parameter included. The optimized microkinetic models for each of the three estimation methods had quite similar mechanisms and agreed well with the experimental data for gas phase mole fractions. Exploration of the HPD region of the posterior further revealed that adsorbed hydroxide and oxygen likely bind on facets other than Rhodium 111.

In bloodstain pattern analysis research, whole blood treated with anticoagulant is often used to prolong the usability of the blood and allow for transport and experimentation to simulate pattern formation using \u201cfresh\u201d clot-free blood.  Anticoagulants bind to components of this cascade making them unavailable to participate in coagulation, preventing the formation of clots. In this work, we investigate the spectral implications of anticoagulant addition for time since deposition (TSD) estimation methods, particularly of larger volume blood pools. We characterized the differences in spectral profiles of blood pools with and without a citrate-based anticoagulant using visible absorbance spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Across all methods, notable spectral differences were observed, namely the red-shift in the Soret peak maxima (visible), delayed increase in the 1532 cm-1 peak (ATR-FTIR), and increased accessibility of iron (XPS) in pools treated with ACD-A. Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used to further assess the variation in the visible absorbance and ATR-FTIR spectra over time.

Recent advancements in high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning have notably improved experimental procedures. While Bayesian optimization (BO) has undeniably revolutionized the landscape of optimization in experimental design, especially in the chemical domain, it is important to recognize the role of other surrogate-based approaches in conventional chemistry optimization problems. This is particularly relevant for chemical problems involving mixed-variable design space with mixed-variable physical constraints, where conventional BO approaches struggle to obtain feasible samples during the acquisition step while maintaining exploration capability. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating mixed-integer optimization strategies is one way to address these challenges effectively.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in optimizing experimental planning through three case studies. By benchmarking PWAS against state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms and BO variants, we offer insights into the practical applicability of mixed-integer surrogates, with emphasis on problems subject to known discrete/mixed-variable linear constraints.

Recently, integrating high-throughput experimentation (HTE) with machine learning (ML) aims to achieve a more systematic catalyst design without relying on specific knowledge or assumptions about the target catalysis. As a first step, this study constructs an unbiased HTE dataset for dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 500 \u00b0C on 256 \u03b3-Al2O3-supported multi-element catalysts, prepared by randomly combining 17 elements selected from the periodic table without any preconceptions.

It is found that the inclusion of Ni or platinum group elements does not necessarily lead to DRM activity; rather, careful combinations of elements are crucial. Specifically, the catalysts that exhibit the highest activities are not only based on Ni as the main active element but also frequently contain Li, Al, and Nb, which are hardly regarded as promoters in the literature. Data scientific analyses also reveal that the coexistence of specific elements such as Al, Nb, and Hf with Ni or Rh promotes catalysis.

However, many challenges remain, including the validation of non-thermal contributions with accurate temperature measurement, strategies to enhance the non-thermal contribution, and its microscopic understanding. Here we propose using metallic nanostructures instead of metal oxide powder as catalyst support to eliminate the challenge in temperature measurement and further enhance the non-thermal contribution. We choose CO2 methanation using Ru on Ti nanostructures to demonstrate this idea. Ru-decorated Ti nanostructures are fabricated using two-step pulsed laser irradiation on Ti foil. Several-fold enhancements in CH4 production rate are observed under 1 sun illumination in the 150-350 \u2103 temperature range. More than a 100-fold enhancement in reaction rate is achieved with white light alone as both the thermal and photon sources. The non-thermal contribution is further confirmed by the observations that only blue light (445 nm) accelerates the reaction rate while green (525 nm) and red (665 nm) light have no effect. The wavelength-dependent enhancement and atomic-scale Ru catalysts lead us to conclude that the non-thermal contribution is due to the direct photo-excitation of CO2 adsorbed on the Ru catalysts, and this excitation is further enhanced by the near-filed of Ti nanostructures.

Microcontact bioprinting (\u03bcCP), which utilizes elastomeric stamps to transfer biorecognition molecules (bioinks) onto substrates, offers advantages such as customizability, cost-effectiveness, and versatility in handling bioinks with high viscosities. Despite its prevalent use in laboratory settings, \u03bcCP faces challenges in achieving the repeatability and reproducibility required for industrial manufacturing. In this study, we address these limitations by developing and optimizing a \u03bcCP protocol using industrial techniques. A key innovation in our approach is the combination of microcontact printing with fluorosilanization, enabling the use of lubricant-infused surfaces to prevent non-specific attachment. Additionally, we enhance biomolecule immobilization through covalent attachment using a modified bioink formulation. We identify and mitigate high-risk failure modes including bioink formulation, application and removal, environmental conditions, and force application during stamping. Furthermore, we integrate an automated syringe pump and a standardized force application system, taking critical steps toward industrial scalability. Using lubricant-infused substrates, our optimized \u03bcCP protocol demonstrates significant improvements in repeatability and reproducibility, achieving intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variance below 10% and signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 15.

Incorporation of small and degraded DNA into these materials has implications for research and training across many areas of forensic science. Large fragments of highly concentrated genomic and phage DNA in solution have been characterized using rheology; however, this amount and size of DNA are atypical in DNA extracted from forensic evidence. In this work, we investigated how adding synthetic DNA oligos and genomic DNA extracted from bloodstains deposited for up to 19 months influenced the rheological properties of polymer systems intended for forensic biomaterial synthesis. We found that encapsulating DNA within an alginate-based, ionically crosslinked hydrogel produced the greatest differentiation in rheological profiles among DNA with varying physical properties. The different conformations and sizes of encapsulated DNA oligos exhibited significantly different responses during strain amplitude sweeps (p<0.05). We also observed moderate correlations between the rheological responses and the time since deposition of bloodstains used for DNA extraction (r = -0.57 to r = 0.62). This indicates that dilute, polydisperse and degraded genomic DNA extracts can effectively modulate the rheological properties of the encapsulating hydrogel.

Both root-mean-square (RMS) and deuterated internal standards (I.S.) normalization were evaluated, with I.S. normalization providing improved pixel to pixel variation and more uniform distribution in specific brain regions, especially for 2-AG and PEA. Furthermore, high lateral resolution up to 5 \u00b5m pixel size was evaluated, resulting in the detection of all eCBs and confirming the MALDI-2 potential even reducing the ablated tissue amount. Lastly the method was applied as proof of concept in a mouse model of mild traumatic brain injury demonstrating the ability to reveal valuable biological insights for neuropharmacology.", "date": "2024-10-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the lack of coordinatively unsaturated surface sites makes TMDs' basal plane chemically inert, leading to technological limitations. One promising approach to increase the activity is single-atom doping. Nevertheless, the optimal doping strategies remain unclear, due to the limited understanding of the extent, selectivity, and underlying mechanisms driving this modulation. Consequently, this study aims to explore the upper limits of TMD reactivity and the underlying mechanisms by investigating boron-doped MoTe2 (B-MoTe2), which was identified as the most active candidate following systematic testing of 22 p-block dopants in our previous work. We employed density functional theory (DFT) methods to simulate the adsorption of 9 molecules: N2O, NO2, NO, N2, CO2, CO, O2, H2O, and H2, chosen to probe the available modes of interaction and their availability. Four distinctive behaviors were observed: (i) dissociation of NO2, O2, and H2, (ii) substitution of B with N atom for NO, (iii) chemisorption of CO, and H2O, and (iv) physisorption of N2 and CO2. This selectivity arises from the molecule's intrinsic bonding affinity with the dopant and the geometric constraints imposed by the sheet. When the potential of doping is effectively harnessed, the enhanced reactivity results from boron adopting more favorable orbital hybridization during molecule adsorption. Thus, B-MoTe2 becomes significantly more reactive than pristine MoTe2, exhibiting adsorption strengths several tens of times greater, which profoundly impacts the structure of the adsorbates. The presented picture is completely different from interactions on pristine MoTe2, governed by van der Waals forces. The demonstrated novel physicochemical properties underscore the potential of MoTe2 to be finely tuned for applications in catalysis and gas sensing. Moreover, the new insights offer a foundation for developing more effective doping strategies.", "date": "2024-10-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Catalysts; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been demonstrated to be effective materials to run a wide range of photoredox reactions mediated by solar light. Herein, we develop an innovative heterojunction based on the vacancy-ordered double perovskite Cs2SnBr6 and carbon nitride nanosheets and demonstrate its ability in running the nitrogen photofixation reaction to produce ammonia. We explore the full compositional range for the Cs2SnBr6/g-C3N4 system and identify an optimal range providing an ammonia evolution rate up to 260 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1, the highest value reported to date for a MHP-containing catalyst. Mechanistic insight into the photofixation reaction promoted by the heterojunction was obtained through a combination of advanced spectroscopy and computational modelling. Efficient ammonia production stems from an effective charge transfer from the perovskite to the nitrogen vacancies on the carbon nitride enabled by the absence of self-trapped excitons in Cs2SnBr6 which also provides additional reactive sites through bromide vacancies. This work, reporting an efficient MHP-based heterojunction for nitrogen photofixation and a clear definition of the underlying reaction mechanism, provides a catalyst design strategy that may pave the way for sustainable ammonia production.", "date": "2024-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we devise a design principle for distributed chemical computing and construct a library of transcription circuit elements, termed tethered genelets (TGs), that implement this design principle within networks of 50-micron hydrogel nodes (HNs).

Computational studies show that this property allows HN networks to reliably propagate information without attenuation and to program specific spatiotemporal patterns such as pulses and oscillations with tunable frequencies. In experiments, we verify that TGs send and receive signals as designed and validate the function and modularity of a library of 15 TGs circuit elements.

Our findings reveal distinct conduction mechanisms for Na+ and K+, primarily driven by differences in their hydration states when they diffuse close to the channel\u2019s selective filter (DEKA) and extracellular ring (EEDD). The Na+ ions undergo partial dehydration in the EEDD region, followed by a rehydration step in the DEKA ring, resulting in longer retention times and a deeper free energy minimum compared to K+. Conversely, the K+ ions exhibit a continuous dehydration process, facilitating a smoother passage through these key regions. These results indicate that ion selectivity and conductance are primarily governed by solvation dynamics, which in turn depends on the interactions with key charged residues within the channel. Addi- tionally, we show that the delicate energetic balance between the interactions of the ions with the protein residues and with their solvation shells during the dehydration and re-hydration processes is not properly captured by the force field. As a consequence, the selectivity of the channel is not well described, indicating that more accurate com- putational models must be applied to simulate ion conduction through eukaryotic NaV channels.", "date": "2024-10-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To study binding kinetics computationally, it is necessary to identify all possible ligand dissociation pathways. The site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method involves the pre-computation of a set of maps (FragMaps), which describe the free energy landscapes of typical chemical functionalities in and around a target protein or RNA. In the current work, we present and implement a method to use SILCS to identify ligand dissociation pathways. The A* pathfinding algorithm is utilized to enumerate ligand dissociation pathways between the ligand binding site and the surrounding bulk solvent environment defined on evenly spaced points around the protein based on a Fibonacci lattice. The cost function for the A* algorithm is calculated using the SILCS exclusion maps and the SILCS grid free energy scores thereby identifying paths that account for local protein flexibility and potential favorable interactions with the ligand. By traversing all evenly distributed bulk solvent points around the protein, all possible dissociation pathways are located and clustered to identify general ligand unbinding pathways. The procedure is verified using proteins studied previously with enhanced sampling MD techniques and is shown to be capable of capturing important ligand dissociation routes in a highly computationally efficient manner. The identified pathways will act as the foundation for determining ligand dissociation kinetics using SILCS free energy profiles, which will be described in a subsequent manuscript.

Sequence-designed DNA nanostructures enable the investigation of the effects of structural design on condensate formation and construction of functional artificial condensates. Despite the high designability of DNA-based condensates, the presence of free nanostructures that do not assemble into condensates remains a challenge. Herein, we report the effects of cationic oligolysines on DNA condensate formation assembled from Y-shaped DNA nanostructures. Experimental results showed that DNA condensate formation was enhanced by adding oligolysines at an appropriate N/P ratio, the ratio of positively-charged amine groups (N) to negatively-charged nucleic acid phosphate groups (P), maintaining the sequence specificity of DNA. On the other hand, surprisingly, oligolysines significantly inhibited condensate formation depending on the N/P ratio and residue number, which was likely attributed to the deformation of the nanostructures induced by oligolysines. These results suggested that the amount and length of cationic peptides significantly affected the self-assembly of branched DNA nanostructures.

Achieving this latitude in excited state paradigms remains a frontier, and efforts to identify privileged chiral photocatalysts are currently a core area of research. Aluminum salen complexes are emergent contenders on account of their well-defined photophysical properties and competence in photo-induced single electron transfer processes: this has recently been leveraged in the deracemization of cyclopropyl ketones. To expand the activation repertoire of Al-salen photocatalysts, an unprecedented enantioselective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis-enabled photocyclization of acrylanilides has been developed. This operationally simple strategy allows reactivity and enantioselectivity to be simultaneously regulated by an inexpensive, commercial chiral Al-salen complex upon irradiation at \u03bb = 400 nm: this allows diverse cyclic products to be forged with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 96:4 e.r.). Establishing this dichotomy in excited state activation modes serves to consolidate the privileged status of chiral Al-salen complexes in enantioselective photocatalysts and to complement their ubiquity in ground-state regimes.

Majorana modes could be utilized for fault tolerant topological qubits. However, their realization is hindered by materials challenges. The coupling between the superconductor and the semiconductor may be too strong for Majorana modes to emerge, due to effective doping of the semiconductor by the metallic contact. This could be mediated by adding a tunnel barrier of controlled thickness. We use density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U corrections, whose values are machine-learned via Bayesian optimization (BO) to assess ZnTe and CdSe as prospective tunnel barriers for the InAs/Al interface. The results of DFT+U(BO) for ZnTe are validated by comparison to angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We then study bilayer interfaces of the three semiconductors with each other and with Al, as well as tri-layer interfaces with a varying number of ZnTe or CdSe layers inserted between InAs and Al. We find that 16 atomic layers of either material completely insulate the InAs from metal induced gap states (MIGS). However, ZnTe and CdSe differ significantly in their band alignment, such that ZnTe forms an effective barrier for electrons, whereas CdSe forms a barrier for holes. Because of Fermi level pinning in the conduction band at the surface, only electron transport is possible in InAs-based devices. Therefore, ZnTe is the better choice. Based on the results of our simulations, we suggest conducting experiments with ZnTe barriers in the thickness range of 6-18 atomic layers.

Herein, we report new routes for the synthesis of CDA4b and its analogues, explore the structure-activity relationships at its lipid tail and at positions 3, 9, & 11 and determine the CDAs lipid target. A CDA4b analogue in which the epoxide group in CDA\u2019s 6-carbon lipid was replaced with a cyclopropyl group was 4-fold more active than CDA4b which suggests that the epoxide group is not acting as an electrophile to form a covalent bond with CDA4b\u2019s target. The activity of this cyclopropyl analogue was significantly increased by extending the length of the lipid to 10 carbons. Studies with analogues in which D-HOAsn9 is replaced with D-Asn9 or D-Ser9 reveal that the hydroxy group of the D-HOAsn9 residue is not crucial for CDAs activity while the amide moiety is important for activity. The L-Trp residue at position 11 could be replaced with L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) without significant loss of activity while replacing the D-Trp residue at position 3 with D-Kyn resulted in significant loss of activity.

However, most highly conducting solid electrolytes decompose at the low operating voltages of next-generation anodes leading to irreversible lithium loss and increased cell resistance. Such performance losses may be prevented by designing electrolytes which are thermodynamically stable at low operating voltages (anolytes). Here, we report on the discovery a new family of irreducible (i.e. fully reduced) electrolytes by mechanochemically dissolving lithium nitride into the Li2S antifluorite structure, yielding highly conducting crystalline Li2+xS1-xNx  phases reaching > 0.2 mS cm-1 at ambient temperatures.

This advance is achieved through a novel theoretical framework, leveraging percolation analysis with local-environment-specific activation energies and is widely applicable to disordered ion conductors. The same methodology allows us to rationalize how increasing nitrogen content in Li2+xS1-xNx antifluorite-like samples leads to both increased ionic conductivity and lower conductivity-activation energy.

While we observe similar phase behavior (incorporating solid, smectic, and liquid phases) to that seen in experiments, we also observe significantly more mobility in the cationic species compared to the anionic species before the system reaches an arrest transition. We further discuss how the general results within this paper can guide further studies and target the design of new highly conductive solid electrolytes with the potential to enable the use of multivalent ionic species as ion conductors.

Fabrication, however, of ceramic-polymer composites, particularly polymer-in-ceramic matrix composites, is a long-standing challenge due to the substantial processing temperature disparity between polymers and ceramics. Cold sintering is an emerging technology that applies uniaxial pressure and a transient solvent to reduce the ceramic sintering temperature by approximately an order magnitude, down to about 100-200 oC from 1000 to 1500 oC that is typical with traditional sintering methods. As such, cold sintering provides new opportunities for combining ceramics and polymers.

However, the intrinsic properties of the nanostructured interface may be expected to play important additional functions that are not yet well understood. Here we study single-molecule junctions formed from components having the same molecular backbone functionalized with 12 different sulfur-based linker groups to determine the influence of sulfur-substituent on junction conductance and stability. Remarkably, we find evidence for in situ S\u2013C(sp3) bond breaking, and C(sp2)\u2013C(sp3) bond forming, reactions that are consistent with the ex situ transformations expected for those systems in the presence of a Lewis acid. We also find we approach the limits of substituent influence on the conductance of physisorbed sulfur-bound junctions. As an illustrative example, we show that a tert-butylthio-functionalized 4,4\u2019-biphenyl precursor can form both chemisorbed (Au\u2212S) junctions, consistent with heterolytic S\u2212C(sp3) bond cleavage to generate the stable tert-butyl carbocation, as well as physisorbed junctions that are >1 order of magnitude lower than analogous junctions comprising cyclic \u201clocked\u201d thioether contacts. Our findings are supported by a systematic analysis of model thioether components comprising different simple hydrocarbon substituents of intermediate size, which do not form chemisorbed contacts and further clarify the inverse relationship between conductance and substituent steric bulk. First-principles calculations based on density-functional theory also confirm that bulky sulfur-substituents increase the probability of forming junction geometries with reduced electronic coupling between the electrode and \u03c0-conjugated molecular backbone.

In our model system, which mimics a part of the structure of chromatin, non-acetylated H3 peptide and DNA undergo LLPS, driven primarily by electrostatic interactions. Acetylation of the H3 peptide significantly inhibits LLPS, with the inhibitory effects varying markedly depending on the acetylation site. Specifically, acetylation near the ends of the 20-residue H3 peptide (i.e., H3K4ac and H3K18ac) results in stronger inhibition of LLPS compared to acetylation near the center (i.e., H3K9ac and H3K14ac).

Here, we present probe CL-ENPP-1, the first nucleic acid-based chemiluminescent probe designed for rapid and highly sensitive detection of ENPP-1 activity. The design of probe CL-ENPP-1 features a phenoxy-adamantyl-1,2-dioxetane luminophore linked to thymidine via a phosphodiesteric bond. Upon cleavage of the enzymatic substrate by ENPP-1, the probe undergoes an efficient chemiexcitation process to emit a green photon. Probe CL-ENPP-1 demonstrates an exceptional signal-to-noise ratio of 15000 and a limit of detection value approximately 4500-fold lower than the widely used colorimetric probe TMP-pNP. A comparison of TMP-pNP activation by ENPP-1 versus alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reveals a complete lack of selectivity. Removal of the self-immolative spacer from probe CL-ENPP-1 resulted in a new chemiluminescent probe, CL-ENPP-2, with an 18.4-fold increase in selectivity for ENPP-1 over ALP. As far as we know, to date, CL-ENPP-1 and CL-ENPP-2 are the most sensitive probes for the detection of ENPP-1 catalytic activity.

Despite their extensive exploration for treating many cancer types, the limited therapeutic efficiency of bacterial-mediated biotherapies, mainly because they do not accumulate tumor-specifically after delivery, has hindered their widespread application. However, this work brings hope by exploring the potential of aptamers in cancer-targeted therapy. Aptamers, nucleotides with the ability to bind targets similarly to antibodies, were the focus of our study. We used computational modeling to understand the interaction mechanism between aptamers and the nucleolin protein, which is overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. We hypothesize that the aptamers used in this research will show specific binding interactions with the nucleolin protein. The aptamer PDB files were obtained using Vfold2D and Vfold3D programs, and these structures were then docked onto the nucleolin protein. Our studies revealed that the ULF aptamer formed strong interactions with the nucleolin binding site, further validating our results. This will enhance our understanding of the binding mechanism of aptamer to the nucleolin protein. The predicted aptamers can manipulate bacterial behaviors by changing the bacterial surface and can be an effective tumor imaging tool or therapeutic agent against the disease.

Currently, nearly one million people in the USA are living with PD. After Alzheimer\u2019s disease, PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the USA. The disease is characterized by the aggregation of the alpha-synuclein protein, which forms fibril-like structures called Lewy bodies. The current work aims to develop therapeutic strategies against the disease by inhibiting this fibril formation. We hypothesize that chemical compounds that can bind at the interface can block the binding and prevent fibril formation. We have utilized molecular docking techniques to screen 3450 chemical compounds against the alpha-synuclein protein, to bind to and prevent alpha-synuclein clumping, thereby inhibiting fibril formation. Based on our docking simulations, we have selected the top five compounds that bind strongly to the protein. All these ligands bind to the hydrophobic region of the protein, suggesting that hydrophobic drugs (capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier) will be more effective in treating this disease. We validated our hypothesis by docking inhibitor-bound fibrils and free fibrils together and found that the inhibitor blocks the fibril interface interaction. In addition, we have also used machine learning and graph neural network tools to propose the druggable site on the fibril surface which will help in designing inhibitors against the fibrils. The work opens new avenues for novel treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease and offers hope for improved therapeutic options in the future.\n", "date": "2024-10-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The challenging preparation of these derivatives, especially in a divergent manner, has severely limited the combination of oxetanes with other medicinally and biologically important groups. Consequently, there is a substantial demand for mild and effective synthetic strategies to access new oxetane and azetidine derivatives and molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report the development and use of oxetane sulfonyl fluorides (OSF) and azetidine sulfonyl fluorides (ASF), which behave as precursors to carbocations in an unusual defluorosulfonylation reaction pathway (deFS). The small-ring sulfonyl fluorides are activated under mild thermal conditions (60 \u00baC), and the generated reactive intermediates couple with a broad range of nucleophiles. This reactivity enables the generation of new chemical motifs that make attractive design elements for drug discovery. Notably, oxetane and azetidine-heterocyclic, -sulfoximine and -phosphonate derivatives are prepared, several of which do not have comparable carbonyl analogues. Alternatively, a SuFEx pathway under anionic conditions accesses oxetane-sulfur (VI) derivatives.

We have demonstrated, through interfacial energy calculations and classical nucleation theory, that the phase transition necessitates a crystal-amorphous-crystal two-step pathway, rather than the conventional crystal-crystal mechanism. Simulations for CsPbI3 nanowires show that water molecules in the air can enter the amorphous interface between the black and yellow regions.

In this study, we explore the tunability of graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide/titania nanocrystal (GO/rGO/TNC) hybrid films via photocatalytic reduction for resistive humidity sensing. First, we introduce a facile layer-by-layer spin-coating (LbL-SC) technique for the efficient fabrication of thin GO/TNC films (15-150 nm) on various substrates, using titania nanorods (TNRs) or nanoplates (TNPs). Second, we study the tunability of the films' electrical, optical, and structural properties set by the photocatalytic activity of the TNCs upon UV exposure (254 nm), by varying the illumination time, TNC type, and film thickness. We show that the electrical conductance of the films dramatically increases in presence of TNCs, and that the GO/rGO and (GO/rGO)/TNC ratio can be adjusted, with prolonged UV treatment resulting in the degradation of GO/rGO with rates depending on the films' composition and thickness. Third, we employ this method to tune the resistive sensing behavior of (GO/rGO)/TNC films on flexible substrates towards r.h. changes (ranges 35 \u2013 85% and 1 \u2013 80%). TNP-based films show superior humidity sensing performance to (GO/rGO)/TNR- and pristine GO/rGO films, with a sensitivity of up to 2.2 and response times down to 1 s. Depending on the film composition and the r.h. level, positive and negative responses are obtained. Gravimetric measurements reveal a similar mass uptake of water in all tested hybrid films, indicating that distinct resistive responses arise from differences in their chemical and electrical properties. Further, we demonstrate the use of these sensors for the detection of fluctuations in body-related humidity.

Existing fast conformer prediction algorithms often rely on approximate empirical energy functions, resulting in low accuracy. More accurate methods like ab initio molecular dynamics and Markov chain Monte Carlo can be computationally expensive due to the need for evaluating quantum mechanical energy functions. To address this, we introduce AGDIFF, a novel machine learning framework that utilizes diffusion models for efficient and accurate molecular structure prediction. AGDIFF extends previous models (such as GeoDiff) by enhancing the global, local, and edge encoders with attention mechanisms, an improved SchNet architecture, batch normalization, and feature expansion techniques. AGDIFF outperforms GeoDiff on both the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets. For GEOM-QM9, with a threshold (\u03b4) of 0.5 \u00c5, AGDIFF achieves a mean COV-R of 93.08% and a mean MAT-R of 0.1965 \u00c5.

The key feature enabling the unidirectional rotation and controlling its direction is the motor chirality, an inherently chemical factor, hard to modify postsynthetically. Here we propose a new molecular rotary motor architecture, E-motor, in which the motor operation direction can be switched in situ, without the need for chemical modification of the system structure. This effect is achieved by application of an external electric-field pulse, and is intended to provide means for chirality control in motors deposited on a surface. Our study relies on quantum-chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations performed for a specifically-tailored system, PFCN, designed to provide illustration for the proposed new motor type. We show that the model system\u2019s chirality and, hence, its operation direction, depends on orientation of a covalently bound polar switching unit, which can be controlled with an external electric field. At the same time, the proposed system manifests all characteristic photophysical properties of a unidirectional molecular motor, and its set chirality is preserved, i.e., it is thermally and optically stable during the regular motor operation in the absence of the electric field.", "date": "2024-10-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanodevices", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In fact, changes of 18O/16 O and 17O/16 O ratios of O2 have been successfully implemented as measures for quantifying photosynthetic O2 production and biological O2 respiration. Despite evidence for light-dependent O2 consumption in sunlit surface waters, however, photochemical O2 loss processes have so far been neglected in the stable isotope-based evaluation of oxygen cycling. Here, we established the magnitude of O isotope fractionation for abiotic photochemical O2 elimination through formation of singlet O2, 1O2, and the ensuing oxygenation and oxidation reactions with organic compounds through experiments with rose bengal as 1O2 sensitizer and three different amino acids and furfuryl alcohol as chemical quenchers. Based on the kinetic analysis of lightdependent O2 removal in the presence of different quenchers, we rationalize the observable O isotope fractionation of O2 and the corresponding, apparent 18O kinetic isotope effects (18O-AKIE) with a pre-equilibrium model for the reversible formation of 1O2 and its irreversible oxygenation reactions with organic compounds. While 18O-AKIEs of oxygenation reactions amount to 1.03, the O isotope fractionation of O2 vanishes systematically with increasing ratio of the rates of oxygenation reaction of 1O2 vs. 1O2 decay to ground state oxygen, 3O2 . Our findings imply that O isotope fractionation through photochemical O2 consumption can match contributions from biological respiration at typical dissolved organic matter concentrations of lakes, rivers, and oceans and should therefore be included in future evaluations of biogeochemical O2 cycling.", "date": "2024-10-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Hydrology and Water Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While the scaling relations have been rationalized based on a separation of sp and d electron contributions to adsorption energies, a full understanding of such a separation would require one to further break the adsorp- tion energy into distinct energy components such as electrostatics, polarization, charge transfer, and van der Waals components, and examine the sp and d contributions to each of them. As a first step in this direction, we analyze the interaction energy between CHx adsorbates and fcc(100) transition metal surfaces (M = Cu, Ag, Au, Rh, and Pt), with the surfaces represented both as slabs in plane-wave density functional theory (pw-DFT) calculations and as atomic clusters in atomic-orbital basis density functional theory (ao-DFT) calculations. Through an absolutely-localized molecular orbital (ALMO) based energy decomposition analysis of the ao- DFT adsorption energy, each of the interaction energy components (electrostatics, polarization, van der Waals, and charge transfer) was found to follow its own scaling relations, with an intricate in- terplay among these energy components yielding the overall scaling relations for the total adsorption energies. Using the recently in- troduced ALMO-based polarization and charge-transfer analysis schemes, we further dissected polarization into metal surface and adsorbate contributions, and charge transfer into metal\u2192adsorbate and adsorbate\u2192metal contributions.

In this work, we perform a first-principles analysis to investigate the initial step of nitride formation considering 30 different proton donors (PD). As a baseline, modeling nitrogen on a lithium surface without a PD, we observe that N2 does not spontaneously dissociate on the lithium surface. However, explicitly introducing a PD into the system results in five unique recurring nitrogen config- urations on the lithium slab: (1) embedded, (2) adsorbed, (3) standing, (4) buried, and (5) transferred states. We show that these PD-induced states possess an elongated N-N bond and adsorb more strongly on lithium. Using charge analysis, we show that the charge transferred onto these states strongly correlates with the change in their bond length, a crucial parameter for nitrogen dissociation. These results suggest a more involved role of the PD in the initial stages of nitride formation, and motivate greater consideration for their impact on the LiMEAS pathway.", "date": "2024-10-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Lattice strain plays a key role in this and is induced by the mismatch between the crystal structure of the core and the shell met-al. However, investigating the impact of lattice strain has been challenging due to the lack of a material system in which lattice strain can be controlled systematically, hampering further progress in the field of core-shell catalysis. In this work, we achieve such a core-shell nanoparticle system through the colloidal synthesis of trimetallic Pt-shell Au1-xCux-core nanoparticles. Our seed-mediated growth methodology yields well-defined Au1-xCux-cores, tunable in composition from 0 at-% Cu to 77 at-% Cu, and monodisperse in size. Subsequent overgrowth results in uniform, epitaxially grown Pt-shells with a controlled thickness of ~3 atomic layers. By employing a multi-technique characterization strategy combining X-ray diffraction,  electron diffraction and aberration corrected electron microscopy, we unravel the atomic structure of the trimetallic system on a single nanoparticle-, ensemble- and bulk scale level, and we unambiguously demonstrate the controlled variation of strain in the Pt-shell from -3.62 % compressive-, to +3.79 % tensile strain, while retaining full control over all other structural characteristics of the system.

From a comprehensive literature survey, we identified several key parameters that control the flammability of materials. This toolkit concept includes several analytical techniques to quantitatively measure these parameters.\nThe primary parameters influencing the flammability of polymer materials are found to be the surface ignition temperature, thermal degradation kinetics, total amount of volatiles produced during combustion, chemical composition of the volatiles, and the presence of flame retardants, particularly phosphorus and phosphorus-nitrogen-based derivatives (PFR), in the gas phase, condensed phase, or in both.\nThis paper presents our findings on surface ignition temperature (Tign) and kinetic degradation parameters such as Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (A) from Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)/SDTA) measurements. Additionally, we report the Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) produced during combustion, determined using Thermal Desorption (TD)/Gas Chromatography (GC)/Mass Spectrometry (MS) techniques, and the chemical composition of the volatiles identified through MS analysis of GC chromatograms for several model HFFR polypropylene (PP) formulations containing phosphorus (P) or phosphorus-nitrogen (P-N) based derivatives (PFR). The presence of flame retardants in the gas or condensed phase, and their activity in either phase or both, was determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and Surface Focussed Mass Spectrometer (SFMS). \n\nIn this report, the validity of the analytical results from this toolkit concept is also presented for several model formulations by comparing the analytical results with fire retarding properties of these model formulations with standard UL-94V fire tests.

Morphological characterization of CPE/Fe2O3 developed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), shows a relatively uniform distribution of Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the CP surface. The optimization of variables of pH and the amount of modifying agent were relevant to maximize the efficiency of the modified electrode. The evaluation of the pH effect shows that the maximum current response occurs at pH 11.5 in Britton-Robinson buffer, and the optimum amount of Fe2O3 was 1 mg/mL, giving the best response, standing out for an optimum active surface for the detection of atropine. Electrostatic calculations show that at pH 11 the surfaces become negatively charged, having better affinity with protonated atropine, compared the deprotonated state. This pH is beyond atropine pKa, hence, the peak in current at pH 11.5 indicates that the surface induces a shift in pKa, allowing the prevalence of protonated atropine at this high pH. The limit of detection and quantification (LD and LQ) recorded using the CP/Fe2O3 electrode were 0.075 and 0.250 mM, respectively.

However, like graphene, its use as a functional nanofiller requires exfoliation. Here, we present a method for exfoliating and dispersing hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets within a polymer matrix. This is achieved by a solvent interface trapping method (SITM), where hBN exfoliates and spreads at a high-energy oil/water interface, separating the two phases and lowering the system's free energy. hBN thus acts as a surfactant, allowing us to form stable water-in-oil emulsions stabilized by films of overlapping hBN sheets. Polymerizing the continuous oil phase results in polymerized high internal phase emulsions (polyHIPE) with the foam cells lined with hBN. In the investigation presented here, we use acoustic spectroscopy, optical and electron microscopy, and image analysis to study emulsion and polyHIPE formation mechanisms. We find that the amount of hBN used, the flake size of the hBN, the mixing time, the type of initiator used, and the oil-to-water ratio all play a role in the morphology of the final polyHIPE. Lastly, we demonstrate the flame-retardant properties of the hBN polyHIPEs and show that at 1 % loadings, the presence of hBN prevents dripping and relighting of the composites, even when the material is heated to a red glow.", "date": "2024-10-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Composites; Fire-Resistant Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Use of a 13CF3 isotopologue of 4-TFMP allowed for the tracking of TFA formation, which formed via multiple oxidative additions prior to oxidative ring cleavage. The oxidation is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated through self-sensitized photolysis, with singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals as the key ROS.

We develop a detailed analysis of the linear and nonlinear optical selection rules by means of group and representation theory, showing strong connection to crystal symmetry and orbital characters of the bands and providing a method to predict the strength of linear and nonlinear response of new materials. We observe the general trend that the lowest-energy excitons are dark in 2D ML TMCs whereas they are bright or mixed bright-dark in 3D bulk TMCs, which we attribute to the difference between spatially dependent screening in 2D and constant screening in 3D. In particular, we derive general formulas for the nonlinear optical response based on exciton states in semiconductor materials. We find anti-bound excitons in ML GaS, which we attribute to dominant exciton exchange interaction. We show that by choosing elements with larger mass and by reducing the detuning energy it is possible to increase the nonlinear response not only for \u03c7^(2) and \u03c7^(3), responsible for SHG and third harmonic generation (THG), but also in general for \u03c7^(n) nonlinear response with n > 3, giving rise to high harmonic generation (HHG) in 2D semiconductor materials. We achieve good to excellent agreement with experimental measurements of linear exciton spectra and nonlinear coefficients for ML and bulk GaS, GaSe, and GaTe for \u03c7^(n) , n = 2 and n = 3. We predict the nonlinear response of InTe and AlTe for 2 < n < 7. The HHG regime has so far been rarely considered, both theoretically and experimentally. We predict high values of SHG, THG, and HHG for the TMC family of materials for 2 \u2264n \u22647, which is in agreement with similar trends in transition metal dichalcogenides.", "date": "2024-10-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Optical Materials; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This approach aligns with the core concept of QM/MM, which focuses on the QM subsystem. Thus, using the partial Hessian approximation implies that the main interest is in the local vibrational modes of the QM subsystem. Here, we investigate the accuracy and applicability of the partial Hessian vibrational analysis (PHVA) approach as it is typically used within QM/MM, i.e., only the Hessian belonging to the QM subsystem is computed. We focus on solute\u2013solvent systems with small, rigid solutes. To separate two of the major sources of errors, we perform two separate analyses. First, we study the effects of the partial Hessian approximation on local normal modes, harmonic frequencies, and harmonic IR and Raman intensities by comparing them to those obtained using full Hessians, where both partial and full Hessians are calculated at the QM level. Then, we quantify the errors introduced by QM/MM used with the PHVA by comparing normal modes, frequencies, and intensities obtained using partial Hessians calculated using a QM/MM-type embedding approach to those obtained using partial Hessians calculated at the QM level. Another aspect of the PHVA is the appearance of normal modes resembling the translation and rotation of the QM subsystem. These pseudo-translational and pseudo-rotational modes should be removed as they are collective vibrations of the atoms in the QM subsystem relative to a frozen MM subsystem and, thus, not well-described. We show that projecting out translation and rotation, usually done for systems in isolation, can adversely affect other normal modes. Instead, the pseudo-translational and pseudo-rotational modes can be identified and removed.", "date": "2024-10-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We attribute these oscillations to self-interaction error in the density-functional approximation.  The effect is minor or negligible in small water clusters, explaining why it has not been noticed previously, but grows to catastrophic proportion in clusters that are only moderately larger.  This behavior can be counteracted with hybrid functionals but only if the fraction of exact exchange is >= 50%, whereas modern meta-generalized gradient approximations including wB97X-V, SCAN, and SCAN0 are insufficient to eliminate divergent behavior. \tOther mitigation strategies including counterpoise correction, density correction (i.e., exchange-correlation functionals evaluated atop Hartree-Fock densities), and dielectric continuum boundary conditions do little to curtail the problematic oscillations.  In contrast, energy-based screening to cull unimportant subsystems can successfully forestall divergent behavior.  These results suggest that extreme caution is required when the many-body expansion is combined with density functional theory.

This is achieved by combining enhanced sampling methods first with Gaussian processes to discover transition paths and then with graph neural networks to obtain a uniformly accurate description.

QHA can predict thermodynamic phase diagrams, elastic properties and temperature- and pressure-dependent equilibrium geometries, all of which are important in various fields of knowledge. The main drawbacks of QHA are that it makes spurious predictions for the volume and other properties in the high temperature limit due to its approximate treatment of anharmonicity, and that it is unable to model dynamically stabilized structures. In this work, we propose an extension to QHA that fixes these problems. Our approach is based on four ingredients: i) the calculation of the n-th order force constants using randomly displaced configurations and regularized regression, ii) the calculation of temperature-dependent effective harmonic frequencies omega(V,T) within the self-consistent harmonic approximation (SCHA), iii) Allen's quasiparticle (QP) theory, which allows the calculation of the anharmonic entropy from the effective frequencies, and iv) a simple Debye-like numerical model that enables the calculation of all other thermodynamic properties from the QP entropies. The proposed method is conceptually simple, with a computational complexity similar to QHA but requiring more supercell calculations. It allows incorporating anharmonic effects to any order. The predictions of the new method coincide with QHA in the low-temperature limit and eliminate the QHA blowout at high temperature, recovering the experimentally observed behavior of all thermodynamic properties tested. The performance of the new method is demonstrated by calculating the thermodynamic properties of geologically relevant minerals MgO and CaO. In addition, using cubic SrTiO3 as an example, we show that, unlike QHA, our method can also predict thermodynamic properties of dynamically stabilized phases.

Air quality regulations generally categorize particulate matter (PM) size into PM10, PM2.5, and ultrafine particles (UFPs) with aerodynamic diameters < 10, 2.5, and 0.1 \u00b5m, respectively. We examined the differential impact of particle size per se on selected organ systems using a custom whole-body mouse exposure system using synthetic PM (SPM). The micrometer-sized SPM accumulated in the lungs as the primary entry organ, while ultrafine SPM showed less accumulation, implying a transition into circulation. Micro SPM-exposed mice exhibited inflammation and NADPH oxidase-derived oxidative stress in the lungs. Ultrafine SPM-exposed mice did not show oxidative stress in the lungs but rather at the brain, heart, and vasculature levels. Endothelial dysfunction and blood pressure increase were more pronounced in ultrafine SPM exposed mice, supported by increased endothelin-1 and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, enhancing constriction and reducing vasodilation. To derive a preliminary estimate of the cardiovascular disease burden of UFPs in humans, we used new high-resolution exposure data at a global scale, and applied hazard ratios from an epidemiological cohort study.

Here we describe a novel and robust method to control the spatial position of lipid domains of liquid-ordered (Lo) / liquid-disordered (Ld) phase in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs).

We show that this process is governed by the respective fraction of the two phases, and not by the chemical nature of the lipids involved.

To resolve the conundrum  between atomic and reactor scales, we devise a percolation-theory model to reconcile nanoscale porosity with macroscopic properties relevant to reactor design models. Using synchrotron nano X-ray computed-tomography, we quantify the evolution of pores in iron oxide pellets, and demonstrate how nano-scale pore networks influence micro and macro-scale flow properties such as permeability, diffusivity and tortuosity. Our new modeling framework bridges the gap between scales and offers the criteria to accelerate HyDR by at least 5x via feedstock-reactor synergies based on percolation.", "date": "2024-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

CO IR spectroscopy is a powerful technique to probe catalyst surfaces, and is used to identify single atom catalysts, estimate metal surface availability to the gas phase, and measure catalyst Lewis acidity. However, the interpretation of CO IR spectra on metal surfaces is not trivial, and influenced by dipole-dipole interactions among CO molecules at medium to high coverage. Such phenomenon results in spectral distortions, such as intensity transfer among IR bands, appearance of spurious bands, and shifts in band position. Dipole-dipole interactions have been widely investigated and understood in the 1950s\u201390s, but the implications for operando spectroscopy have been seemingly overlooked in literature, with a few exceptions. Inspired by seminal studies in the field, I propose here the use of mixed isotopic streams, such as diluted 13CO in 12CO, to reduce dipole coupling effects and retrieve more information from operando IR spectra in reactions involving CO, such as CO oxidation or hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, mixed 13CO2/12CO2 streams may be applied in CO2 hydrogenation, where adsorbed CO is commonly observed. The proposed name of the technique is Mixed Isotope Operando IR Spectroscopy, MIOIRS. In this perspective, I will first summarize the nature of dipole-dipole interactions in adsorbed CO layers, and their effects on CO IR spectra. Then, I will briefly describe how diluted isotopic mixtures of CO can partially break the coupling among adsorbates and reduce spectral distortion. In both sections, I will give a few showcases of the implications of vibrational coupling in heterogeneous catalysts characterization. Finally, I will discuss the possible implications of MIOIRS for the detection and quantification of defect and surface sites on metal nanoparticles, the characterization of bimetallic nanoparticles surfaces, and the kinetics of CO intermediates adsorbed on different active sites. Notably, MIOIRS may be expanded to other reactions in which adsorbates have strong permanent dipoles, such as in self-catalytic reduction for NOx abatement.", "date": "2024-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Current models employed in retrosynthesis to generate a synthesis route from a target molecule to purchasable compounds are prohibitively slow. The model operates in single-step fashion in a tree search algorithm by predicting reactant molecules given a product molecule as input. In this study, we investigate the ability of alternative transformer architectures, knowledge distillation (KD) and simple hyper-parameter optimization to decrease inference times of the Chemformer model. Initially, we assess the ability of closely related transformer architectures and conclude that these models under-performed when using KD. Additionally, we investigate the effects of feature-based and response-based KD together with hyper-parameters optimized based on inference sample time and model accuracy. We find that although reducing model size and improving single-step speed are important, our results indicate that multi-step search efficiency is more significantly influenced by the diversity and confidence of single-step models. Based on this work, further research should use KD in combination with other techniques, as multi-step speed continues to prevent proper integration of synthesis planning.

In this process, the electrochemical oxidation of pyrrole derivatives produces a radical cation intermediate, which then undergoes nucleophilic attack by diazo compounds to yield polysubstituted pyridine derivatives. Notably, the insertion position is influenced by the electronic properties of N-protecting groups, allowing for unprecedented para-selective insertion through the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups.

Understanding the decomposition process is crucial for gaining insights into how to stabilize HP-NCs. Here, we investigate the radical-driven decomposition process and dynamics of the 0D C4PbBr6 and 3D CsPbBr3 NCs under the influence of visible light and a polar solvent by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Our findings indicate that light accelerates radical formation over time, making the decomposition of HP-NCs a self-sustaining process. Upon illumination of the NCs, hydroperoxyl radicals are formed first, followed by unconventional Br, Cs, and Pb-related radicals, indicating the initiation of NC decomposition. The decomposition of CsPbBr\u00ac3 NCs starts after 3 min of light exposure, while C4PbBr6 NCs take 18 min, indicating the greater stability of the latter. Additionally, we evaluated the photocatalytic activity of the HPs toward degrading organic dyes.

In this paper, we systematically investigate challenging proton transfer modes in a series of shared-proton systems with the CNEO framework, focusing on evaluating existing electron-proton correlation functionals. Our results show that CNEO accurately describes proton transfer vibrational modes and significantly outperforms conventional DFT. The inclusion of the epc17-2 electron-proton correlation functional in CNEO produces similar performance to CNEO without electron-proton correlations, while the epc17-1 functional yields less accurate results, comparable to conventional DFT.

The detailed study presented here showcases the properties of two different PBS elastomers and the effect of blending a well-known organic semiconducting polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).

Cousins", "abstract": "Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a persistent and mobile substance that has been increasing in concentrations within diverse environmental media, including rain, soils, human serum, plants, plant-based foods, and drinking water. Currently, TFA concentrations are orders of magnitude higher than those of other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This accumulation is due to many PFAS having TFA as a transformation product, including several fluorinated gases (F-gases), pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, in addition to direct release of industrially produced TFA. Due to TFA\u2019s extreme persistence and ongoing emissions, concentrations are increasing irreversibly. What remains less clear is the thresholds where irreversible effects on local or global scales occur. There are indications from mammalian toxicity studies that TFA is toxic to reproduction and that it exhibits liver toxicity. Ecotoxicity data are scarce, with most data for aquatic systems; fewer data are available for terrestrial plants, where TFA bioaccumulates most readily. Collectively, these trends imply that TFA meets the criteria of a planetary boundary threat for novel entities because of increasing planetary-scale exposure, where potential, irreversible disruptive impacts on vital earth system processes could occur. The rational response to this is to instigate binding actions to reduce emissions of TFA and its many precursors.", "date": "2024-10-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This search is motivated by several factors, such as environmental hazards caused by petroleum derivatives, price fluctuations, and primarily because fossil fuels are less sustainable when compared to other energy sources. For instance, in the Brazilian energy matrix, biodiesel and bioethanol are established renewable fuels. In addition, other biofuels, such as butanol, have shown potential as alternative energy resources, driving a growing demand for research into their safety and efficiency. To characterize the flammability of liquid fuels, the Flash Point (FP) is an important property and its assessment plays a relevant role in safety and combustion process design. However, its experimental measurement takes time, and resources, making the development of mathematical models for predicting this property a compelling approach. The usage of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting thermodynamic properties has been explored in recent years, posing them as feasible data-driven alternatives to estimate FP values for a range of physical conditions. In this context, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the ANN predictive capacity of FP for biofuels and their respective blends. For this purpose, 456 experimental points from the literature were used for different systems involving esters, alcohols, and hydrocarbons, along with 34 newly acquired experimental points. Accordingly, a robust model was developed using an 80/20 train-test splitting strategy during a cross-validation loop. The model relied exclusively on three crucial input features: the mixture's average molar mass, the vapor pressure natural logarithm and the experimental method. The final architecture featured three hidden layers, with 16, 32 and 16 neurons, in which the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is employed. This model resulted in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 4.22 K and 3.09 K, respectively, for 98 unknown values, i.e., those not used during model training. Despite the simplicity, the model achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy, with the best and worst MAE values of 1.51 K and 3.63 K. The model also performed decently when compared to thermodynamical models that utilizes UNIFAC activity coefficient model. This fact demonstrates the approach's potential, considering that with almost 500 experimental points, the ANN algorithm obtained a generalized model for most of the analyzed data.", "date": "2024-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

Among them, Anc3, a reconstructed ancestral \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) dependent NHI dioxygenase, catalyzes a ring-expansion in the tropolone biosynthesis from cyclohexadienone to afford tropolone natural product stipitaldehyde (ring-expansion product) alongside 3-hydroxyorcinaldehyde (shunt product). This study reveals how the enzyme environment guides the reaction to ring-expansion product preferably over shunt product, where the precise selectivity ratio depends on just a handful of residues. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical\n(QM/MM) simulations describe how the substrate binds within the NHI active site and can proceed through two distinct mechanisms, ring-expansion or rebound hydroxylation, to yield the two experimentally observed products. Discovery of a linear relationship of different Ea values and hydrogen bond distances between Arg191 and the Fe(III)\u2013OH group reveals that inhibition of the rebound\nhydroxylation step increases selectivity towards ring-expansion. Our findings suggest that the rebound hydroxylation rate is further tuned through the Fe(III)\u2013OH bond strength, as influenced by specific secondary sphere coordination effects around the active site. These influences are largely orthogonal to the ring-expansion mechanism, which is shown to prefer to proceed\nthrough a radical pathway. In addition, a cationic pathway initiated by electron transfer from substrate to iron is ruled out based upon thermodynamic infeasibility.

The simulations revealed that the water molecules at the interface adopt specific orientations to achieve the optimal interactions with the surface. The GC-DFT simulations further revealed that the adsorption of water molecules strengthens at positive potentials, whereas atomic oxygen adsorption weakens under the same conditions. Moreover, water dissociation, the key step in iron corrosion, is found to be catalysed by the oxygens adsorbed on the O-bridge sites of the Fe(100) surface.

Unfortunately, these devices rely on pulsed high-voltage sources and are not fully transparent, even in their open state, which can lead to ion losses and contamination. Here, a novel atmospheric-pressure ion gate based on a resonant acoustic field structure is described. This effect was accomplished through the formation of a resonant, standing acoustic wave of alternating nodes and antinodes. Alignment of an atmospheric-pressure gaseous ion beam with an antinode, i.e. a region of transient pressure, of the acoustic structure acted as a gate and blocked ions from impinging ion-selective detectors, such as a mass spectrometer and a Faraday plate. The velocity of the ion stream and acoustic power were found to be critical parameters for gating efficiency. In the presence of an acoustic field (i.e. a closed gate), ion signals were decreased by as much as 99.8% with a response time faster than the readout of the ion-measurement devices used here (ca. 75 ms).

The pure electronic transitions of terrylene molecules are spread over a broad energy scale, from 570 to 610 nm. Surprisingly, peaks in the vibrationally resolved fluorescence spectrum show intensity variations up to 20-fold between molecules. We find an extreme case where the Debye-Waller-Franck-Condon factor of the zero-phonon line exceeds 0.8. The vibronic intensity correlates both with the spectral position of the electronic transition and with the frequency of the longitudinal stretch mode, which varies between 243 and 257 cm-1.

However, the biological production, fluxes, and interplay between methane and carbon dioxide due to microbial activity must be better understood. This is primarily attributed to the lack of sensor technology that can provide the required spatial and temporal resolution. Herein, we demonstrate how a porous metal-organic framework material can be used to create a sensor to quantify dissolved methane. The sensor is based on a quartz crystal microbalance, which measures methane adsorption using a quartz resonator functionalised with the material. Combining quartz crystal microbalance and the porous material yields fast response rates and high sensitivity.  This is due to a favourable partitioning coefficient between the empty pores of the material and the aqueous phase, promoting rapid migration of dissolved methane into the material. The result is a sensor system that achieves equilibration and response times below 60 seconds with parts-per-billion sensitivity. A fully functioning prototype has been designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate real-life applicability, demonstrating sense response using spiked lake water. The modular nature of metal-organic frameworks opens possibilities for designing materials for selective sensing of other aqueous analytes. Thus, our study showcases the importance of new materials for methane sensing and general environmental monitoring.

This is particularly true of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which are produced as heterogeneous samples. Current techniques used for their characterization require sophisticated instrumentation, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), or a compromise on accuracy. In this paper, we propose to use super-resolution microscopy (SRM) to accurately determine the morphology (orientation, length and shape) of individual luminescent SWCNTs. We generate super-resolved images using three recently published SRM analytical software packages (DPR, eSRRF and MSSR) and metrologically compare their performance to determine the morphological properties of SWCNTs. For this, ground-truth information on nanotube morphologies were obtained using polarization measurements and AFM to directly correlate the results from SRM at the single particle level. We show a more than 4-fold improvement in resolution over standard photoluminescence imaging, revealing hidden morphologies as efficiently as AFM. We finally demonstrate that DPR, and eventually eSRRF, can effectively assess SWCNT length distribution in a much faster and more accessible way than AFM. We believe that this approach can be generalized to other types of luminescent nanostructures and thus become a standard for rapid and accurate characterization of samples.

Among several emerging methods, the use of light-driven reactions benefits from milder conditions and the possibility of using sunlight to directly irradiate reactants, or alternatively, to power LEDs with a high and constant light intensity. Dinaphthylketone photosensitized dimerization of isoprene can afford C10-cycloalkenes that, after hydrogenation, meet the required properties for jet fuels (strongly resembling Jet-A). Isoprene can be photobiologically produced by metabolically engineered cyanobacteria from the conversion of CO2 and water by utilizing solar light, contributing to a carbon-neutral process. The scale-up of such a combined photobiological-photochemical route is essential to bring it closer to a commercial level. Herein, we present the optimization and scale-up of the photosensitized dimerization of isoprene. By designing different reactor setups, flow versus no-flow conditions and LED lamps (\u03bbmax = 365 nm) versus sunlight as the light source, we reached a 2.6 liter-scale able to produce 61 mL of isoprene dimers per hour, which represents a 14-fold higher productivity compared to our previous results at smaller scale. We also demonstrated a continuous feed process converting isoprene into dimers with a 95% yield under LED irradiation.

We herein report a method for the carbon-to-nitrogen atom swap in N-alkyl indoles, allowing for the direct conversion of indoles to the corresponding benzimidazoles. The reaction leverages the innate reactivity of the indole scaffold to engage in an initial oxidative cleavage step, followed by oxidative amination, Hofmann-type rearrangement and cyclization.

The reaction tolerates a wide range of functional groups which is demonstrated by the interconversion of 15 drug-like molecules implying its immediate applicability across a wide range of discovery programs.

Using an electric field as the stimulus is of particular interest as it possesses the potential for seamless integration of materials with electronic systems. While many materials with electric field responsive actuation have an associated mechanical property change, it is beneficial to develop materials that exhibit mechanical property changes without accompanying significant shape deformation. To address this challenge, here we designed a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) hydrogel system containing both polyelectrolytes and salt ions, which enables electric field induced changes in mechanical properties while minimizing actuation. We first successfully verified the viability of our design by removing salt ions through a diffusion-only method where we witnessed the stiffness increased to 4.5 times the initial value while still being highly deformable. After this, we applied an electric field to transport the salt ions out of the hydrogel, as shown by both Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. We were able to show a time-dependent stiffness increase, the maximum of which was 5 times the original stiffness. We quantified ion transport and water-splitting in the hydrogel by both experiments and simulations. Finally, we showed functional system reversibility by reversing the direction of the current to reinject salt ions into the semi-IPN hydrogel and reducing its stiffness to below the initial value. It's worth noting that our simulations enable us to understand the governing mechanisms behind ion generation and salt transport that leads to mechanical property changes.

Mapping out conformational landscapes provides valuable insights into protein behaviors and biological phenomena, and has relevance to therapeutic design.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool for exploring these landscapes at atomic-scale resolution. However, inferring functionally relevant information, such as the full conformational pathway of long-timescale processes, the impact of mutations on binding, or allosteric coupling between residues across long distances, requires too extensive sampling that a single MD simulation may not achieve.

In addition to our recent demonstration of the formation of EDMBs in electron-rich systems, such as pnictogens, chalcogens, and chalcogenides related to phase change materials (see H.H.

The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect implies that an electronic device formed from a quantum ring and metallic leads will exhibit such behavior under external magnetic fields. At first sight, it appears that unrealistically large fields would be required to significantly alter the conductance of a molecular ring. However, the sensitivity of a molecular AB interferometer to magnetic fields can be increased by weakening the coupling between the molecular ring and the metallic leads. An ideal molecular ring for an AB interferometer has a large radius (to access a larger portion of the full AB cycle), and a small effective mass (high electron mobility) to enhance its response to magnetic fields. Here, we use computational modelling to demonstrate that recently synthesized porphyrin nanorings, with radii of 2\u20139 nm, could behave as molecular AB interferometers at achievable magnetic field strengths (5\u201310 T), if weak ring-lead coupling is used. Building on our recently developed semi-empirical approach, which incorporates the effects of finite magnetic fields on the electronic structure, we develop a transport computational platform that allows us to identify sharp Fano resonances in the transmittance probability of porphyrin nanorings that could be exploited to control the current with an applied magnetic field. These resonances are rationalized in terms of a magnetic field-induced delocalization of the molecular orbitals. Our findings indicate that molecular AB interferometry should be feasible with current experimental capabilities.

Here, we present the mechanism of activity enhancement elucidated by first-principles (FP) free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration within finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. These calculations accelerate phase space sampling, including nanosecond-scale fluctuations of interfacial water, by employing machine-learned force fields. The errors introduced by the force fields are corrected via thermodynamic integration from the machine-learned potential to the FP potential, allowing us to obtain accurate FP free energies. The results reveal that melamine destabilizes the OH adsorbate, an intermediate in the ORR, thereby accelerating the OH removal step and pushing the catalytic activity to the top of the volcano plot. This behavior is similar to what is observed on Pt(1-x)Cux alloy surfaces evaluated using the same method. However, the mechanism of OH destabilization by melamine differs entirely from that on alloy surfaces. Unlike alloys, melamine does not shift the d-band center or shorten the metal-metal distance. Instead, melamine disrupts the hydrogen bonds between the OH adsorbate and the surrounding interfacial water. Structural and vibrational analyses have revealed that the solvation structure changes induced by melamine are manifested as alterations in the radial distribution function of water near the OH adsorbate and as a blue shift in the O-H stretching vibrations of interfacial water. These findings indicate that manipulating interfacial solvation with organic compounds could be a promising approach to enhance catalytic activity without compromising durability.", "date": "2024-10-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Strategies for predicting which enzyme is most likely to be compatible with a given small molecule have been hindered by the lack of well-studied biocatalytic reactions.

Our simulations describe the transitions within the B800 and B850 rings in agreement with experimental findings, suggesting an incoherent hopping process in the B800, and a more delocalized transfer in the B850 subsystem. The reorganization energies and excitonic couplings are comparable in the B850 ring, promoting the transport model \u201ctransient delocalization\u201d. This theory is characterized by a dynamic interdependence of moderately delocalized excitons that exhibit large delocalization events. To demonstrate the efficiency of this transport, we compare the exciton dynamics in LH2 with the most efficient electron and exciton transfer processes in organic semiconductors. We find that the Bacteriochlorophyll\u2019s unusual electronic properties, leading to tiny inner and outer-sphere reorganization energies, are the reason for the astonishing efficiency.", "date": "2024-10-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A different distribution of Ni2+ cations in the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated sites of the spinel lattice and an increased reducibility of the smaller crystallite size sample were identified as the main impacts of different crystallite size. Their catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of 2-propanol was investigated by temperature programmed reaction studies using different ratios of 2-propanol:O2 as well as of possible parallel and consecutive reactions at atmospheric pressure and maximum 400 \u00b0C. Operando-DRIFTS-MS studies at different 2-propanol:O2 ratios were carried out under continuous-flow conditions at atmospheric pressure as well. Thereby, the increased reducibility of the small crystallite size sample could be linked to an unselective activity for dehydrogenation yielding acetone and hydrogen, partial oxidation of 2-propanol and acetone, and total combustion leading to a complex network of reactions going on, being further pushed by an excess of oxygen.

This manuscript aims to explore the therapeutic prospects of exosome-based treatments in neural injury and neurodegenerative conditions. Recent advancements have deepened our understanding of exosome cargo, including microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, and growth factors, which are critical to their regenerative capacity. Exosomes operate at various levels to support neuroprotection, enhance axonal growth, promote synaptic plasticity, and modulate immune responses. This paper further discusses the efficacy of exosome treatments, highlighting ongoing and recent clinical studies that investigate the therapeutic benefits of exosomes, particularly through intranasal and intravenous administration routes. Despite their potential, several challenges remain, notably in the large-scale production, distribution, and immune compatibility of exosome-based therapies. This review also addresses future directions for enhancing exosome targeting within neural tissues, with a focus on bioengineering strategies to improve treatment precision.

Such microfiber scaffolds can be prepared by melt electrowriting (MEW), wherein a polymer melt is electrostatically drawn out of a syringe onto a computer controlled moving collector. The fabrication of such scaffolds via MEW has previously been shown for a polymer with a glass transition temperature (Tg) just above room temperature, making handling challenging. For this reason, ABA triblock copolymers bearing poly(2-oxazoline) and poly(2-oxazine) with slightly higher Tg were synthesized and their processability into drug loaded microfiber scaffolds was assessed. Additionally, plasticizers commonly used in drug products were added to decrease the fabrication temperature. The aim was to investigate the influence of plasticizers on the melt viscosity and printability to expand the polymer platform for the preparation of drug loaded microfiber scaffolds.\nTemperature dependent melt rheology measurements of the polymers and their mixtures revealed a drop in viscosity by one order of magnitude by the addition of triethyl citrate and ethylene glycol, respectively. Addition of the model drug indomethacin led to a further decrease in viscosity. Even though the drug loaded samples were printable with and without the addition of triethyl citrate, better fiber stacking and therefore improved printing results were obtained with the plasticizer added. However, the addition of the plasticizer did alter the dissolution profile for some of the polymer samples, leading to longer dissolution times or lower drug release compared to the samples without plasticizer, which makes it difficult to predict the influence of the plasticizer on the dissolution profile.

Racemic AZ11645373 can be separated, into its respective enantiomers by chiral chromatography, albeit in small batches, and these were stereochemically in-tact over a year later, by chiral HPLC analysis. On a higher scale, significant decomposition is ob-served. One of the enantiomers was crystallised as a palladium complex and its (R)-configuration was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, further confirmed, in solution, by vibrational circular dichroism.  Biological studies demonstrated that both (S)- and (R)-forms were able to fully inhibit human P2X7, but (R)-AZ11645373 was more potent, with an IC50 of 32.9 nM. Contrary to its effect on human P2X7, (S)-AZ11645373 was ineffective on mouse P2X7, while the (R)-AZ11645373 enantiomer was a full antagonist. These results demonstrated that the antagonistic effects of racemic AZ11645373 are mainly due to its (R)-enantiomer. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynam-ics simulations indicated that the (R)-enantiomer may form specific interactions with Phe95 and the antagonists bound to the other P2X7 monomers. Phe95 is situated at the channel pore and appears to be the pivotal molecular gateway between AZ11645373 allosteric binding and locking of the closed state of the P2X7 channel.

By carefully balancing the diffusion kinetics through concentration control, we also successfully synthesized continuous SnSe2 nanosheets. To elucidate the anion exchange mechanism, we conducted a comprehensive investigation using electron microscopy techniques, varying parameters such as time, precursor concentration, and reagents. Our findings revealed that the exchange process initiates at the edges of the template SnS2 nanosheets and progresses inward. Cross-sectional atomic-resolution electron microscopy of the interfaces and layer stacking in the SnS2-SnSe2 heterostructure uncovered numerous defects, attributed to ion migration and lattice mismatch, which were not detectable in planar views. Furthermore, as-synthesized materials are explored for gas-sensing applications. Our anion-exchange-derived SnS2-SnSe2 heterostructure and SnSe2 exhibited exceptional selectivity and sensitivity towards NO2 gas (response > 700%) at room temperature comparable to state-of-art sensors, significantly outperforming the pristine SnS2 material, which required elevated temperatures (150\u00b0C) for optimal response. This study underscores the potential of anion exchange as a powerful tool for designing novel nanomaterials with tailored properties and applications, particularly in the realm of gas sensing.", "date": "2024-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Core-Shell Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, strong adsorption of carboxylic acid on the catalyst surface leads to poisoning of the active site, demands harsher reaction condition and use of organic solvents. In this study, we demonstrate that the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) and hydrogen spillover on Ru/V2O3 can counter the poisoning effect. The Ru/V2O3 catalysts reduced at 400 C formed a layer of V2O3 over Ru. The catalyst was able to hydrogenate succinic acid to gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) in 77 % yield in the presence of water at mild conditions of 150 C and 6 h. H2-D2 exchange experiment showed that for the Ru/V2O3 without SMSI the H2 dissociation was inhibited due to the adsorption of substrate over Ru surface, whereas catalysts with SMSI effect created a barrier between the substrate and the hydrogen dissociation sites. Spillover of dissociated H2 onto the V2O3 surface was found to enhance the catalytic activity. Thermodynamics calculations using density functional theory showed that transfer of a hydride from Ru and proton from V2O3 to the substrate have a lower reaction free energy compared to that of transfer of two hydrogen atoms from a bare ruthenium surface. Additionally, weaker adsorption of substrates and easier desorption of product from the Ru/V2O3 surface increased catalytic activity compared to that of bare ruthenium surface.

Renewable H2 is expensive and is currently produced in a limited amount. Therefore, selective utilization of H2 towards methanol formation, which has been paid little attention to, is necessary without being wasted towards side product formation. Here, we show that using Co containing dual-atom doped oxide (Co-Zn-ZrO2) catalyst H2 utilization can be selectively directed towards methanol formation and at the same time, H2 wastage can be minimized by suppressing competitive CO formation. Co-Zn-ZrO2 produced methanol with space time yield of 1.5 gMeOH h-1 gcat-1, which is one of the highest ever reported under industrially relevant conditions. In this catalyst, Co was responsible for CO2 activation and formate stabilization and made Zn free of formate poisoning, which helped in easy H2 dissociation promoting formate hydrogenation to methanol. When Co was replaced with other metals (for example: Pd, Ni and Cu), H2 utilization was promoted more towards CO formation than towards methanol formation decreasing methanol selectivity.

However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of adsorbate configurations among diverse site environments presents a considerable challenge in accurately estimating these interactions. Here, we propose a strategy combining high-throughput simulation pipelines and a neural network-based model with the MACE architecture to increase sampling efficiency and speed. By training the models on unrelaxed structures and energies, which can be quickly obtained from single-point DFT calculations, we achieve excellent performance for both in-domain and out-of-domain predictions, including generalization to different facets, coverage regimes and low-energy configurations. From this systematic understanding of model robustness, we exhaustively sample the configuration phase space of catalytic systems without active learning. In particular, by predicting binding energies for over 14 million structures within the neural network model and the simulated annealing method, we predict coverage-dependent adsorption energies for CO adsorption on six Cu facets (111, 100, 211, 331, 410 and 711) and the co-adsorption of CO and CHOH on Rh(111). When validated by targeted post-sampling relaxations, our results for CO on Cu correctly reproduce experimental interaction energies reported in the literature, and provide atomistic insights on the site occupancy of steps and terraces for the six facets at all coverage regimes. Additionally, the arrangement of CO on the Rh(111) surface is demonstrated to substantially impact the activation barriers for the CHOH bond scission, illustrating the importance of comprehensive sampling on reaction kinetics.

The structural and functional diversity of PoTeMs is biosynthetically elaborated from lysobacterene A by pathway-specific cyclizing and modifying enzymes. This results in diverse core structure decoration and cyclization patterns. However, approaches to directly edit the PoTeM carbon skeleton are currently not existing. We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural L-ornithine-derived building block by L-lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH2 group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro.

For the transfer hydrogenation of ketones, an optimization study showed that all catalysts (Ru-1 to Ru-4) are highly active at 90 \u00b0C, reaching high to full conversion already within 5 minutes, a behavior that was comparable to the well-known commercially available Ru-MACHO derivative Ru-5. At 35 \u00b0C, Ru 1 (X = Cl) and Ru 2 (X = BF4) were more efficient than Ru 3 (X = BPh4) and Ru-4 (X = PF6), likely due to their higher solubility in isopropanol. Interestingly, for the transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes, higher temperatures and longer reaction times were required. Thus, Ru-1 and Ru-3 performed better with the aldehydes, leading to full conversion after 7 hours at 70 \u00b0C.

By optimizing the PhoN-IPK system through rational engineering and incorporating a Nudix hydrolase, we achieved a drimenol production of 398.4 mg/L and high albicanol titers of 1804.9 mg/L in shake flasks and 3.5 g/L in bioreactor. Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of the engineered PhoN provided insights into its improved catalytic efficiency. We demonstrated the utility of this platform by synthesizing several DMTs using albicanol as the starting material, reducing synthetic steps and improving overall efficiency compared to classical approaches. This work presents a sustainable and cost-effective platform for producing valuable drimane-type building blocks, enabling efficient synthesis of complex DMTs with potential therapeutic and agricultural applications.

HPs are indeed known to internalize in specific cells, thanks to their GAG-targeting sequence (Joliot et al. 2022; Cardon et al. 2023). We quantified the capacity of these peptides to enter into various cell lines known to express different levels and types of heparan sulfates (HS) and chondroitin sulfates (CS) GAGs. We also analyzed by calorimetry (DSC, ITC) and fluorescence spectroscopy, the binary and ternary interactions between heparin (HI), (4S, 6S)CS (CS-E), zwitterionic phosphocholine (PC) model membranes and those peptides. Altogether, our results demonstrate the existence of Ca2+-dependent interactions between CS-E or HI and PC lipid bilayers, the major phospholipid found in animal cell plasma membrane. Importantly, we show that CS-E can act as a Ca2+-dependent bridge with PC membranes that can be exploited by a chimeric CS-E-recognition motif-H3 peptide to bind and cross the membrane lipid bilayer and get access directly to the cytosol of cells. Altogether, this study brings further information uncovering the molecular mechanism of the translocation process of CPPs that implies specific GAGs at the cell-surface.

The QSAR model was validated to ensure predictive reliability.\nResults: Compound g18_mol18 demonstrated a binding affinity of -9.9 kcal/mol, significantly stronger than the standard compound (-7.381 kcal/mol) (p = 0.039). Interaction analysis showed that g18_mol18 formed multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with key residues. Despite its strong binding affinity, ADMET analysis highlighted challenges such as poor intestinal absorption (HIA: 0.005) and potential hepatotoxicity. However, its low hERG inhibition (0.302 vs. 0.923) indicates a lower risk of cardiotoxicity, suggesting a favorable cardiac safety profile.\nConclusion: The study identifies g18_mol18 as a potent EGFR inhibitor with significantly higher binding affinity and more extensive interactions than current treatments. Although it presents pharmacokinetic challenges, these findings underline its potential as a more effective and safer alternative for NSCLC treatment, warranting further experimental validation and optimization for clinical applications.

These powerful therapies, such as synergistic nitric oxide (NO) gas and chemotherapy, are able to simultaneously target different biological targets, thereby overcoming or reducing drug resistance and decreasing dose-related toxicity. However, in nearly all existing carriers, gases and drugs compete for loading in the same physical space of the carrier and can thus interfere with each other. Herein, we use a porous organic polymer (POP) as a design strategy to pre-pare a combination therapy vehicle with spatially segregated gas and drug loading sites. SH-POP, synthesized by a facile, room-temperature method, is rich in both thiol (-SH) and secondary amine (R-NH-R\u2019) functional groups, which can be post-synthetically nitrosated, yielding light-stimulated NO-releasing SNO-POP. Upon white light irradiation, SNO-POP releases up to ~56 \u00b5mol of NO per gram and exhibits reversible on-off NO release behavior triggered by simple light irradiation for at least 20 cycles. Unlike many conventional systems, where a known small-molecule NO donor is incorporated into the pores, here, the porous polymer scaffold serves as a NO reservoir, so the pores remain available for the encapsulation of another therapeutic, Doxorubicin (Dox). The release of Dox from the Dox@SNO-POP system is pH-sensitive and occurs preferentially in a slightly acidic environment (pH = 5.4). HeLa and HepG2 cancer cell viability studies confirm an enhancement in toxicity that can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of light-triggered NO release and pH-triggered Dox release. Confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging reveals the presence of both therapeutic species inside cancer cells. This study is expected to stimulate interest in the development of other combination therapy vehicles that minimize the interference between different cargos in cancer treatment.

Atom-to-atom mapping (AAM) is a procedure that establishes such correspondence(s) between the atoms of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Currently, automatic AAM tools play a pivotal role in various chemoinformatics tasks. However, achieving accurate automatic AAM for complex or unknown reactions within a reasonable computation time remains a significant challenge due to the combinatorial nature of the problem and the difficulty in applying appropriate reaction rules. In this study, we propose a rule-free AAM algorithm, which enumerates all atom-to-atom correspondences that minimize the number of bond cleavages and formations during the reaction. To reduce the computational burden associated with the combinatorial optimization (i.e., minimizing bond changes), we introduce Ising computing, a novel computing paradigm that has gained significant attention for its efficiency in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. We found that our Ising computing framework outperforms conventional combinatorial optimization algorithms in terms of computation times, making it feasible to solve the AAM problem without reaction rules in an acceptable time. Furthermore, our AAM algorithm successfully found the correct AAM solution for all problems in a benchmark dataset. In contrast, conventional AAM algorithms based on chemical heuristics failed for several problems. Specifically, these algorithms either failed to find the optimal solution in terms of bond changes, or they identified only one optimal solution, which was incorrect when multiple optimal solutions exist. These results emphasize the importance of enumerating all optimal correspondences that minimize bond changes, which is effectively achieved by our Ising-computing framework.", "date": "2024-10-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Transition metal complexes have lagged behind their organic counterparts on all three of these avenues. The large diversity of structures, coordination numbers and modes have made its translation to a machine-readable format an ongoing challenge. Here we introduce ELECTRUM, an electron configuration-based universal metal fingerprint for transition metal compounds. Its lightweight implementation enables the straightforward conversion of any transition metal complex into a simple fingerprint.

By plotting nearest-neighbor relationships in ELECTRUM space, we reveal meaningful clustering in two-dimensional representations. Furthermore, we use the ELECTRUM encoding to train machine learning models on the prediction of metal complex coordination numbers from ligand structures and metal identity alone. We show that on a subset of this data, we can train models to predict the oxidation state of metal complexes.

Histones can exhibit half-lives on the order of 100 days, and unsurprisingly, isoAsp formation has been observed in nearly every histone family. Delineating the molecular consequences of isoAsp formation in histones is challenging due to the multitude of processes that occur on such time scales. To isolate the effect of specific isoAsp modification thus necessitates precise in vitro characterisation with well-defined substrates. Here, we adapt a protein semisynthesis approach to generate full-length variants of histone H4 in which the canonical Asp at position 24 is replaced by its isoAsp isomer (H4isoD24). This variant was incorporated into chromatin templates, and the resulting constructs were used to interrogate key parameters of chromatin integrity and maintenance in vitro: compaction, nucleosome remodelling, and methylation of H4 lysine 20 (H4K20). Remarkably, despite its disruptive changes to the backbone\u2019s spacing and direction, isoD24 did not dramatically disrupt Mg2+-mediated chromatin self-association or nucleosome repositioning by the remodeller Chd1.

Reactive uptake coefficients (\u03b3), the fraction of gas-surface collisions that yield a reaction, are used to quantify the kinetics in these heterogeneous and multiphase systems. Unlike rate coefficients for homogeneous gas or liquid phase reactions, uptake coefficients are emergent quantities that depend upon a multitude of underlying elementary steps.  As such, uptake coefficients adopt complex scaling behavior with reactant concentrations and other physicochemical properties of the interface, making predictions of \u03b3 particularly challenging.\n\nTypically, \u03b3gas is obtained by measuring the loss rate of a gas phase molecule above a liquid or solid surface relative to its collision frequency.  By definition, \u03b3gas \u2264 1. Highly efficient reactions proceed at or near the gas-surface collision frequency and exhibit values of \u03b3gas near unity.  Alternatively, heterogeneous kinetics are often measured using the consumption rate of a condensed phase reactant normalized to the gas-surface collision frequency, yielding instead an effective uptake coefficient (\u03b3eff).  In many cases, \u03b3eff and \u03b3gas are not equal, yielding additional insights into the nature of the reaction. For example, substantial diffusive limitations in the condensed phase may inhibit reactivity, yielding \u03b3eff << \u03b3gas. In contrast, \u03b3eff > \u03b3gas in the presence of condensed phase secondary reactions, with values of \u03b3eff often exceeding 1 for the case of radical chain reactions. \n\nIn this account, we will discuss how measurements of \u03b3eff  in aerosol reveal the origins of complex physical and chemical behavior in multiphase reactions that can be uniquely observed and understood through the lens of effective uptake coefficients. For example, the scaling of \u03b3eff with water vapor in aqueous systems, or shell thickness in core-shell aerosol, yields insight into relative transport and reaction timescales of gaseous oxidants, while the scaling of \u03b3eff with oxidant and trace gas concentrations provides a distinctive signature of the underlying competition between free radical propagation and termination mechanisms. Further, changes in \u03b3eff induced by careful selection of the molecular structure of the condensed-phase reactants help identify new reaction pathways and indirectly report on the reaction kinetics of short-lived species, including Criegee Intermediates. Through these examples we will show how proper experimental design and accurate measurements of an effective uptake coefficient can be used to interrogate complex multiphase reaction mechanisms.\n", "date": "2024-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Chemical Kinetics; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Carboxysomes are thought to locally concentrate CO2 in the shell interior to improve rubisco efficiency through selective metabolite permeability, creating a concentrated catalytic center. However, permeability coefficients have not previously been determined for these gases, or for Calvin-cycle intermediates such as bicarbonate (HCO3-), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), or ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). Starting from a high resolution cryo-EM structure of a synthetic beta-carboxysome shell, we perform unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) to track metabolite permeability across the shell. The synthetic carboxysome shell structure, lacking the BMC trimer proteins and encapsulation peptides,  is found to have similar permeability coefficients for multiple metabolites, and is not selectively permeable to HCO3- relative to CO2. To resolve how these comparable permeabilities can be reconciled with the clear role of the carboxysome in the CO2-concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria, complementary atomic-resolution Brownian Dynamics (ARBD) simulations estimate the mean first passage time for CO2 assimilation in a crowded model carboxysome. Despite a relatively high CO2 permeability of approximately 10^-2 cm/s across the carboxysome shell, the shell proteins reflect enough CO2 back towards rubisco that 2650 CO2 molecules can be fixed by rubisco for every 1 CO2 molecule that escapes under typical conditions. The permeabilities determined from all-atom molecular simulation are key inputs into flux modeling, and the insight gained into carbon fixation can facilitate the engineering of carboxysomes and other bacterial microcompartments for multiple applications.", "date": "2024-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We use an EDC/NHS coupling reaction to synthesize alginate-azide molecules, which are then crosslinked to DNA-alkyne or RNA-alkyne oligonucleotides using a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC).

Acid-cleavable surfactants are well-established for the formulation of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles and much work has been done to tune the sensitivity of these motifs to match their intended application. Acid-labile hydrazone-linked surfactants, specifically display increased stability over the more common imine linkage to prevent premature release outside of the cell, but remain labile enough for effective payload release once endocytosed. Furthermore, their cationic byproducts are known to facilitate enhanced endosomal escape through membrane disruption. Herein, we report the synthesis of a hydrazone-linked poly(oxazoline)-based diblock copolymer surfactant. This surfactant cleaves in a pH-dependent manner both in solution, and at the perfluorocarbon-water interface. We then demonstrate the ability of nanoemulsion encapsulated payloads to partition into cell membrane mimics only after cleavage of the surfactant. In all, this work demonstrates a viable route to create POx-based nanomaterials with controlled release capabilities in biologically relevant conditions and is a promising platform for advancing the endosomal escape and cancer targeting of nanomaterials.

By setting a performance target (e.g. maximizing electrochemical power output, reducing pumping power), the computational framework iterates mathematically over multiple electrode structures to satisfy the target, finding the optimal structure in a predictive manner. Here, we present a high-performance topology optimization framework, integrated with multi-physics computational models of transport processes, to design optimal porous electrodes in two- or three-dimensional space for use in electrochemical flow cells.

In this work, we further improve the \u201cCIDtims\u201d method by incorporating the dynamic control of ion populations, optimizing the bioinformatic approach to better leverage the mobility separation, and finally porting the technique to an improved version of the instrument, the timsTOF Pro2. Lastly, we utilize these improvements to assess internal ions generated by CIDtims. Internal ions are of particular importance in the CIDtims workflow as all charge states are simultaneously activated and the highest charge states will likely be subjected to \u201cover fragmentation\u201d. We demonstrate that mobility separation increases the signal-to-noise ratios and the isotopic fit scores of internal ions and enables the assignment of additional product ions.", "date": "2024-10-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We envisage that mechanical\nrecycling in tandem with a halogenation reaction provide a new solution to waste PVC management. Herein,\nwe demonstrated that PVC plastic could serve as chlorination reagents, in combination with triboelectric\ncatalyst, to achieve efficient halogenation of alcohols under ball milling condition. The triboelectric catalyst,\nTiO2, mediates the single electron transfer process that promotes the dehydrochlorination of PVC, thereby\nenabling the in-situ chlorination of alcohols. This strategy was applicable to a variety of aliphatic and benzylic\nalcohols, yielding the corresponding organic chlorides in moderate to excellent yields. In particular, the yield\nof benzyl chloride reached 95% after 4 h of ball milling. Structural analysis confirmed that polymer formed by\ndehydrochlorination of PVC contained olefin, carbonyl and aromatic structures. Additionally, Cl could be\ncompletely removed, and the molecular weight decreased from 65.0 kDa to 4.6 kDa after recycling and\nreusing PVC five times.

Several factors potentially contribute to this efficiency. One often proposed in the literature is the heavy atom effect from the nearby (and eventually adduct-forming) cysteine. However, some LOV domain derivatives missing the cysteine residue also undergo ISC efficiently. Using hybrid multi-reference quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical (QM/MM) models, we investigate the effect of the protein electrostatic environment in a prototypal LOV domain, AtLOV2, compared to the effect of the dielectric of a solvent. We find that the AtLOV2's electrostatic environment is especially well tuned to stabilize a triplet (nN,\u03c0*) state, which we posit is the state involved in the ISC step. Other low-lying triplet states having (\u03c0,\u03c0*) and (nO,\u03c0*) character are ruled out based on energetics and/or their orbital shape. The mechanistic picture that emerges from the calculations is one that involves ISC of photoexcited flavin to a triplet (nN,\u03c0*) state followed by rapid internal conversion to a triplet (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state, which is the state detected spectroscopically. This insight into the ISC mechanism can provide guidelines for tuning flavin's photophysics through mutations that alter the protein electrostatic environment and potentially helps explain why ISC (and subsequent flavin photochemistry) doesn't occur more frequently in many classes of flavin-binding enzymes", "date": "2024-10-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we study a potential remedy in the form of non-atom-centered or floating orbitals (FOs). FOs are still rarely employed even for small molecules due to the practical complication of defining their position, number, exponents, etc. The most frequently used FO method thus simply places a single FO center with a large number of FOs toward the middle of non-covalent dimers, however, a single FO center for larger complexes can soon become insufficient. A recent alternative uses a grid of FO centers around the monomers with a single s function per center, which is currently only applicable for H, C, N, and O atoms.\n \nHere, we build on the above advantages and mitigated some drawbacks of previous FO approaches by using a layer of FO centers and 4\u20139 FOs/center for each monomer.\nThus, a double layer of FOs are placed between the interacting subsystems. When extending the double-\u03b6 AO basis with this double layer of FOs, the quality of conventional augmented double-\u03b6 or conventional triple-\u03b6 AO bases can be reached or surpassed with less orbitals, leading to few tenths of a kcal/mol basis set errors for\nmedium-sized dimers.

Here, using density functional theory calculations, we investigate stability and reactivity of a broad SAC chemical space with various metal centers (3d transition metals) and dopants (2p dopants of B, N, O; 3p dopants of P, S) as electrocatalysts for CO2R to methane and methanol. We observe that the rigidities of these SACs depend on the type of dopants, with 3p-coordinating SACs exhibiting more severe out-of-plane distortion than 2p-coordinating SACs. Using CO adsorption energy as a descriptor for CO2R reactivity, we narrow down the candidates and identify seven SACs with near-optimal CO binding strength. We then elucidate full reaction mechanisms towards methane and methanol generation on these identified candidates and observe highly dopant-dependent activity and rate-limiting steps, divergent from conventional mechanistic understanding on metallic surfaces, calling into question whether previous design principles established on metals are directly transferrable to SACs. Consequently, we find that zinc embedded in boron-doped graphene (Zn-B-C) is a highly active catalyst for electrochemical CO2R to C1 hydrocarbons.

The high potency of many nitazene derivatives, which can in many cases exceed that of fentanyl, poses a significant challenge to the public health and early warning systems used to detect and respond to the emergence of new high-risk substances.

Currently, machine learning-based property prediction models for peptides primarily rely on amino acid sequence, resulting in two key limitations: first, they are not compatible with non-natural peptide features like modified sidechains or staples, and second, they use human-crafted features to describe the relationships between different amino acids, which reduces the model\u2019s flexibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we have developed PepMNet, a deep learning model that integrates atom-level and amino acid-level information through a hierarchical graph approach. The model first learns from an atom-level graph and then generates amino acid representations based on the atomic information captured in the first stage. These amino acid representations are then combined using graph convolutions on an amino acid-level graph to produce a molecular-level representation, which is then passed to a fully connected neural network for property prediction. We evaluated this architecture by predicting two peptide properties: chromatographic retention time (RT) as a regression task and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) as a classification task. For the regression task, PepMNet achieved an average R\u00b2 of 0.980 across eight datasets, which spanned different dataset sizes and three liquid chromatography (LC) methods. For the classification task, we developed an ensemble of five models to reduce overfitting and ensure robust classification performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.978 and an average precision of 0.981. Overall, our model illustrates the potential for hierarchical deep learning models to learn peptide properties without relying on human engineering amino acid features.

The most common commercial catalyst for CO2 reduction to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers at the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a sub-nano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T = 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 = 4.5 atm and CO2 = 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the reason the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, is the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.", "date": "2024-10-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The stationary phases were characterized physicochemically by infrared spectroscopy, indicating the polymer attachment on the silica surface with 180 m2 g-1 of surface area and 22 nm of mean pore size. The stationary phase was column-packed and chromatographically characterized by separating the Tanaka mixtures. These separations occurred in reversed-phase mode with hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions related to the acetate/butyrate and hydroxyl groups from cellulose derivative. The stationary phase showed unique selectivity for separating small polar molecules with 90 % water in mobile phases. Cellulose acetate butyrate stationary phase can potentially separate polar compounds requiring high water contents, making reversed-phase liquid chromatography closer to the Principles of Green Chemistry.", "date": "2024-10-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, it is a great challenge to experimentally clarify the contributions to ECD spectra from molecular vibrational motions and the intermolecular interactions, key factors for an efficient system architecture design of chemical sensors, catalysts or optoelectronics. Focusing on this issue, here, we per- form theoretical studies on the vibrationally resolved absorption and ECD spectra of two one dimensional bay-substituted chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) by employing the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\u00a8odinger equation with respect to the model Hamiltonian in the diabatic representation, which includes the intramolecular local- ized excited states (LEs), inter molecular change-transfer excited states (CTEs) and the vibronic couplings (VC) as well. Our calculated results exhibit that the theoretical spectra with inclusion of VC effect agree better with the experimental ones than those without this effect, and that the difference between the traditional absorption spectra of two bay-substituted PDIs is much less obvious than that in their ECD spectra, veri- fied that ECD spectroscopy is sensitive to the absolute configuration and conformation of chiral supramolecules. We further make a comparison among the pure electronic spectra of aggregates with different aggregate size calculated by the time-dependent density functional theory, and the mixed exciton model with and without decoupling the LE and CTE states. It is shown that the hybridization between LE and CTE states results in the emergence of new peaks or trough in the high-energy band, and a significant deviation between the calculated ECD spectrum and that predicted by the exciton chirality rule. It is further shown that the ECD spectra of oligomers exhibit an odd-even alternation pattern with changes in aggregate size.", "date": "2024-10-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, it remains challenging to accurately model the whole landscape towards the formation of ternary complex and understand the influence of linker rigidity/flexibility on each step in the working mechanism of PROTAC. To address this, we revisited a well-established system of the VHL-based BET degrader MZ1 and also explored the likely ternary complex of ARV771 with enhanced MD simulation, which explains for the first time the plasticity and selectivity of BET degradation with VHL E3-ligase. Regarding facile conformational change possibly induced by different linkers, the physics-driven modelling of ternary complex was applied to confirm and propose a highly cooperative and potent BET degrader HL1 which was shown to preferentially degrade BRD4 with a late onset of the hook-effect, similar to MZ1. A further novel PROTAC containing a semi-rigid fully sp3 linker, HL1CON, was developed to potentially stabilize the MZ1-type ternary complex similarly to HL1 and improve membrane permeability, but also appears to suffer from non-chameleonic hydrophobic collapse in different solutions as well as in VHL binary complexes. This resulted in significant barriers for HL1CON to get into cell, bind with either receptor and ultimately form cooperative and productive ternary complex. This study has demonstrated that rational PROTAC linker design is a multi-task object and the rigidification strategy with redundant hydrophobicity does not necessarily benefit degradation activity in our case.

The enhanced HCOOH selectivity and the drastic decrease in the H2 yield are well rationalized by the fact that the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is not only driven photochemically via the attack of RhIII(H)Cp*(LH2-\u2022) on CO2 but also partly bypassed by a dark H2 addition reaction yielding [RhIII(H)Cp*(L)]- from [RhIIICp*(L)Cl]+, which was also separately investigated under the dark conditions.

In this work, a well-known solid-state electrolyte, Na2ZrCl6, is modified by aliovalent substitution of inactive Zr4+ cations with redox-active M5+ (M = Nb or Ta) cations to create a series of Na2\u2013xMxZr1\u2013xCl6 solid-solutions that possess both high ionic conductivities and active sites for Na+ storage. The Na+ intercalation mechanisms of these solid-solution materials, in addition to the NaMCl6 end-member materials, are elucidated in this work. It was discovered that both the niobium- and tantalum-containing chlorides exhibit rather high electrochemical potentials (2.2\u20132.8 V vs. Na9Sn4), making them ideal catholytes to pair with commonly used oxide cathode materials like NaCrO2. This synergistic pairing leads to a cathode composite with an 83\u2013102% increase in energy density and 39\u201381% improvement in areal discharge capacity compared to a redox-innocent solid electrolyte. This approach highlights the benefits of designing and employing redox-active solid-state electrolytes that can reversibly intercalate charge-carrying cations, opening up a broad new avenue for solid-state electrolyte discovery and solid-state battery design.", "date": "2024-10-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inorganic cages are less strained owing to their longer and more ionic bonds, and many can be very accessible, offering an inroad into the minimally explored third dimension that is difficult to study with organic systems. However, only two families of inorganic cages \u2013 carboranes and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) \u2013 have so far been studied and commercialized to capitalize upon the enhanced mechanical and thermal properties resulting from the use of higher dimensionality backbone components. Further exploration of this fundamentally interesting and potentially valuable parameter space requires development of new inorganic cages that are accessible on large scales, stable under ambient conditions, and polymerizable to give air- and moisture-stable materials. Here we report that a readily-assembled and bench-stable PN cage, P(NMeNMe)3P (1), undergoes clean Staudinger polycondensations with organic diazides (7R) to yield air/water-stable, solution-processable, and film-forming linear poly(trihydrazino-diphosphine diazide)s, PHPDs (8R), as a new family of hybrid organic-inorganic polymers. The solubility of PHPDs in organic or aqueous media can be controlled by choice of diazide and backbone architecture, which we rationally modify to access alternating co-polymers (12R-alt-R\u2019) or multi-block copolymers (12R-block-R\u2019). We also show how a tetraphosphorus cage P4(NMe)6 (2), can be used to crosslinking PHPDs to make more robust materials. Thermal analyses show Tg values for PHPDs that are comparable with rigid \u03c0-conjugated polymers (up to 152 \u00b0C) and, despite a high nitrogen content (up to 32%) and 3 N-N \u03c3-bonds per repeat unit, decomposition temperatures exceeding 200 \u00b0C with char yields up to 60%. These data bear out theoretical predictions of high stability arising from the presence of 3-dimensional units in the backbone. As one potential application area, we show that the high char yields and PN content of a polyether based PHPD (8e) can be leveraged for halogen-free flame-retardancy. These results debut new low-carbon hybrid organic-inorganic polymers with an unusual backbone topology, reveal the design rules for controlling their microstructures and mechanical properties, and lay the foundation for future applied studies with PN cages.

These chemical signatures are not typically thought of as biosignatures because we know that organic synthesis can occur through abiotic processes. Therefore, development of methods for distinguishing biotic and abiotic biosignatures would enable interpretation of data collected from habitability and life-detection missions. Life on Earth harnesses energy-releasing reactions to power biosynthesis reactions, which often require energy. Using thermodynamic data, we can quantify the energy required for organic synthesis. If an organic molecule is detected in an abundance that is thermodynamically unstable, then it is possible that life coupled its synthesis to other energy-releasing reactions. On the other hand, if an organic molecule is detected in an abundance that is thermodynamically stable, then abiotic synthesis was plausible. This sorting framework can be applied to the search for life wherever we have geochemical data. One such example is Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus. Small compounds involving the elements that comprise the majority of biomass were detected by the Cassini spacecraft in the plume gas erupting from the subsurface ocean. Using Enceladus as an example, we demonstrate the utility of thermodynamic calculations for distinguishing biosignatures and show that organic synthesis is often favorable using the carbon sources available on Enceladus. While these results may lead us to conclude that hypothetical organic signatures on Enceladus are abiotic, this framework can be applied to other environments in the search for genuine biosignatures.

Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are frequently employed in this domain, utilizing random mutations and crossovers steered by explicit mathematical objective formulations to navigate the search space. The transfer and sharing of knowledge across different GA optimization tasks, however, remain challenging. Here, we introduce the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) for TMCs. LLM- EO significantly outperforms traditional GAs due to the intrinsic chemical knowledge embedded within LLMs, acquired during their extensive pretraining. Notably, without the need for supervised fine-tuning, LLMs can leverage the entirety of historical data amassed during the optimization processes, demonstrating superior performance compared to LLMs that are limited to the best TMCs identified in the evolutionary cycle. Specifically, LLM-EO identifies eight out of the top 20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by interrogating merely 200 candidates within a vast search space of 1.37 million TMCs. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility in multi-objective optimizations, especially when guided by seasoned researchers, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs possess the capability to propose novel ligands and TMCs with unique chemical properties by amalgamating both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and molecular generation.

However, clinical data has demonstrated that the administration of non-selective BET bromodomain inhibitors has led to significant dose-limiting toxicity in clinical settings. More selective inhibitors of the second BET bromodomains, referred to as pan-D2 inhibitors, are better tolerated, however their efficacy varies significantly depending on disease indication.  Here, we use three orally bioavailable inhibitors, 1\u20133, that are either selective for the first N-terminal bromodomain of BRD4 (BRD4-D1 selective), or pan-D1 biased, for assessing their cellular and in vivo efficacy and safety profile in two models of inflammatory liver disease. We compare their effects to known pan-D2 and pan-BET inhibitors. Our results show that pan-D1 biased inhibitor, 3, is as efficacious as the pan-BET inhibitor I-BET151 in reducing inflammation from LPS-induced and drug-induced toxicity, whereas pan-D2 inhibitors are less effective.  BRD4-D1 selective inhibitors, 1 and 2, are also efficacious; however, new inhibitors with improved cellular target engagement will be necessary to more thoroughly assess their effects. Finally, BRD4-D1 selective inhibitors are better tolerated in a preclinical model of thrombocytopenia than pan-D1 biased inhibitors, while gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity may be a BRD4-driven effect.

Here we describe the development and testing of an immersive, virtual reality (VR) laboratory simulation to teach correct glassware assembly procedure before entering a wet lab. Before attempting to assemble a reflux in real life, first year students were taught via one of three interventions: the VR game, an online game, or watching an instructional video. The VR group made $0.2\\pm0.4$ mistakes, less than the other two interventions and statistically indistinguishable from experts, and reported higher enjoyment and confidence. We attribute these results to the higher realism and skeuomorphism of the VR intervention and the synergistic contribution embodied cognition to the procedural learning. We believe this demonstrates the usefulness of VR in chemistry education and suggest that VR-based pre-laboratory training offers an efficient route to increased safety and effectiveness to wet laboratory training.", "date": "2024-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Envisioning to uncover general electronic descriptor for the nature of imido ligands, we computationally investigate the solid-state 15N NMR signatures of late TM imido complexes with various central metals, geometries and d-electron counts, and compare them against these of the corresponding early TM systems. The spectroscopic signatures are mostly driven by the presence of filled, \u03c0-symmetry orbitals in late TM imido complexes, suggesting the development of high-lying \u03c0(M=N) and low-lying \u03c3/\u03c3*(M=N) orbitals. This contrasts with what is observed for the reported early TM systems, for which high-lying \u03c3-type orbitals determine the NMR signature. Noteworthily, Ni- and Pd-imido complexes with d10 configurations exhibit highly asymmetric nitrogen-15 NMR signature with extremely deshielded principal components, because of the presence of filled, high-lying antibonding \u03c0*(M=N) orbitals, consistent with their high reactivity.

However, the exploration of new types of chirality has been largely stagnant for more than half a century, likely due to the complexity and challenges inherent in this field. In this work, we present the discovery of a novel type of chirality\u2014staircase chirality as inspired by the design and synthesis of unnatural amino acid derivatives. The architecture of staircase chirality is characterized by two symmetrical phenyl rings anchored by a naphthyl pier, with the rings asymmetrically displaced due to the influence of chiral auxiliaries at their para positions. This unique staircase chiral framework has been thoroughly characterized using spectroscopic techniques, with its absolute configuration definitively confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Remarkably, one of the staircase molecules exhibits four distinct types of chirality: central, orientational, turbo, and staircase chirality, a combination that has not been previously documented in the literature. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to analyze the relative energies of individual staircase isomers, and the results are in agreement with our experimental findings.

Based on our calculations, the experimentally observed hyperporphyrin spectra are attributed to an admixture of phenol/phenoxide character into the a2u-type HOMO of tetraphenylporphyrin. The admixture results in an elevation of the orbital energy of the HOMO in relation to other frontier orbitals, which accounts for the observed spectral redshifts. The calculations underscore differences in the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals. Thus, while the popular hybrid functional B3LYP greatly exaggerates the redshift of the far-red hyperporphyrin band of O-deprotonated H2[THPP], the range-separated functional CAMY-B3LYP predicts a more moderate redshift.

Several model dyes were synthesized and characterized, and then used to prepare the corresponding sol-gel solutions on basis of the n-propyltriethoxysilane (nPTES) precursor. These solutions were applied to the fabric via the pad-dry-cure method. The affinity of the dyes toward the fabric was evaluated by measuring their uptake from the dye bath, which was found to vary between 3% and 16% depending on the molecular structure of the dye. Furthermore, four dyeing parameters were studied with respect to their effect on (i) the exhaustion of the dye bath using UV-visible spectroscopy, and (ii) on the obtained nuance of the textile employing colorimetric (Datacolor) and diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy. The process parameters are dyeing temperature, dye concentration, impregnation time, and the number of dyeing cycles. Our results showed the transfer of dye from bath to textile depends only weakly on temperature, and below 40\u00b0C the transfer reaches an optimum. Also, the dye transfer is rapid, where already after 1 minute, the color strength on the textile is close to the plateau value. However, residual dye uptake from the bath continues for up to 2 hours. Further intensification of the textile coloration requires the deposition of additional sol-gel layers or an increase in the dye bath concentration. On basis of these results, the optimal conditions of dyeing by this process were proposed.

However, for identification of novel substances that are absent from EI databases, de novo structure elucidation using EI is hampered by extensive in-source fragmentation. To address this problem, a new method based on GC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) coupled to ion mobility-high resolution mass spectrometry (IM-HRMS) was developed for simultaneous target, suspect, and non-target screening of HOCs. Of 102 target chemicals, 85.3% produced (quasi-)molecular ions as base peaks, with 71.6% displaying method detection limits lower than those of GC-EI-low resolution MS. The optimized method was applied to standard reference sediment and sediments from the Baltic Sea, an Arctic shelf, and a Norwegian lake. In total, we quantified 56 target chemicals with concentrations ranging from 4.86 pg g-1 dwt to 124 ng g-1 dwt. Further, using a combination of exact mass, collision cross section (CCS), retention time, and MS2 spectra, a total of 54 suspects were identified at Confidence Level (CL) 2.

There is a consequent need to study the hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodeoxygenation(HDO) of amides. This work studies the HDN and HDO of hexadecanamidewith sulfided NiMo/\u03b3-Al2O3 and NiMo/TiO2 catalysts. The experiments are conducted in a batch reactor, with decalin as a solvent. Hexadecanamide is found to easily undergo either dehydration into hexadecanenitrile or deammonization into palmitic acid. Hydrotreating of hexadecanamide consequently occurs either through an initial HDO step (dehydration) into hexadecanonitrile, followed by reduction and HDN of the resulting hexadecylamine, or through an initial HDN step (deammonization) followed by HDO of the resulting palmitic acid. On both NiMo/\u03b3-Al2O3 and NiMo/TiO2, HDN of the amide is slower than HDO. The secondary amine, dihexadecylamine, is a major intermediate, formed through condensation reactions between hexadecylamine and palmitic acid or by the self-condensation of hexadecylamine. Thus, after the initial dehydration or deammonization step, hydrotreating of the primary amide follows the pathways associated with the HDN of primary amines and the HDO of primary carboxylic acids. NiMo/TiO2 is a more active amide hydrotreating catalyst than NiMo/\u03b3-Al2O3. This is attributed to TiO2 catalysing initial amide HDO, as well as the more complete sulfidation of Mo and the better incorporation of the Ni promoter in the MoS2 phase.", "date": "2024-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The prediction of human dose in discovery requires proper modelling of preclinical intravenous (IV) pharmacokinetic (PK) data which is usually achieved either through non-compartmental analysis (NCA) or compartmental analysis. While NCA is straightforward, it loses valuable information about the shape of PK curves. In contrast, compartmental analysis offers a more comprehensive interpretation but poses challenges in scaling up for high-throughput applications in discovery. To address this challenge, we developed computational frameworks, termed Compartmental PK (CPK) and Automated Dose Prediction (ADP), to enable automated compartmental model-based IV PK data modeling, translation, and simulation for human dose prediction in compound triage and optimization. With CPK and ADP, we analyzed compounds with data collected at MRL between 2013 and 2023 to quantitatively characterize the impact of different PK modeling and simulation methods on human dose prediction. Our study revealed that, despite minimal impact on estimating animal PK parameters, different methods significantly impacted predicted human dose, exposure, and Cmax, driven more by different simulation assumptions than by the PK modeling itself. CPK-ADP therefore enables us to efficiently perform complex human dose predictions on a large scale while integrating the latest and best information available on absorption, distribution, and clearance to support decision making in discovery.

The approach centers on creating the NanoLinks semantic model, which unifies diverse data modalities representation, such as cytotoxicity, transcriptomics, and physicochemical data. By leveraging established ontologies like the BioAssay Ontology (BAO), NanoParticle Ontology (NPO), Data Catalog vocabulary (DCAT) and the PROV-O ontology, NanoLinks facilitates the conversion of semi-structured data into Resource Description Framework (RDF) format using the RDF Mapping Language (RML). This transformation allows to generate machine-readable and interoperable datasets. Five datasets from the literature, spanning nanomaterial characteristics and biological assay data, were selected by the NanoSolveIT EU project partners for FAIRification. These datasets were converted into RDF format, hosted on Zenodo under a CC-BY 4.0 license, and integrated into a knowledge graph, NanoLinks-KG, following the linked-data best practices. The knowledge graph was validated for consistency and adherence to the semantic model using shape expressions (ShEx). The presented applications of this graph showcase the potential of querying interconnected datasets to derive insights and support integration with external resources such as AOP-Wiki and the NanoCommons knowledge base. One usage example given is the cross-dataset dose-response curve comparison of zinc oxide nanomaterials. The results demonstrate the successful application of semantic modeling and linked-data knowledge graphs to convert and integrate diverse nanosafety datasets, enhancing their interoperability, and promoting reuse.

Such combined brush-ion-fluid dynamics can be captured in unprecedented atomistic details using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations unraveling a plethora of new and fascinating nanoscale science. In this paper, we use such simulations to describe a most remarkable non-linearly enhanced large electroosmotic (EOS) flow, where, in a nanochannel grafted with cationic PMETAC ([Poly(2-(Methacryloyloxy)Ethyl) Trimethylammonium Chloride]) brushes, a two-fold increase in the electric field strength leads to a several-fold (much more than two-fold) increase in the EOS flow strength and volume flow rate. The electric field enforces the PMETAC brushes to undergo a bending-tilting driven deformation with a significant portion of the brush layer becoming parallel to the grafting surface. In response, a substantial fraction of the counterions come out of the brush layer (hence become more mobile), but instead of going into the bulk, accumulate at the brush-bulk interface, i.e., stay in close proximity of the brush segments aligned parallel to the grafting surface. This creates a fascinating situation, where the counterions are not completely within the brush layer, yet they fully screen the brush charges. Such \u201cfreer\u201d conditions enable the counterions to achieve very high velocity, which eventually ensures that the water solvating the counterions themselves move very fast triggering the significantly augmented EOS transport. Probing deeper we can identify that the bending-tilting driven brush deformation, enforcing the brushes to align parallel to the substrate, results from the anti-electrophoretic behavior of the brushes, where despite being positively charged, the brushes move against the electric field direction: such a highly unprecedented behavior can be associated with the very fast velocities of the negatively charged counterions and the electrostatic coupling of the counterions with the positive functional groups of the brushes. We anticipate that the findings of this paper will not only open up novel strategies for flow enhancement in functionalized nanochannels and shed light on a myriad of applications associated with the anti-electrophoretic response of charged polymer chains, it will kindle interests in the need for understanding the detailed chemical architecture of polyelectrolyte systems (beyond coarse-graining based simplifications) in nanoscale science and engineering.

Mixtures with a reduced Krafft point (TK) are particularly useful as they enable applications at lower temperatures. Such an example is the soap maker\u2019s eutectic: the mixture of sodium laurate (NaL) and sodium oleate (NaOl). A true eutectic implies that the two surfactants do not mix in the solid state but mix readily in the micellar solution above TK, leading to a sharp TK depression at a specific composition. However, the NaL/NaOl mixture shows a broad TK depression of > 15 \u00b0C at a NaOl weight fraction (wO) of about 0.5. Our tie-line analysis shows that pure NaL and NaOl do not coexist in the solid phase on either side of the TK minimum. X-ray analysis of the isolated solids with varying wO reveals that a unique intermediate compound (I.C.) forms in the solid state with a NaL-to-NaOl mole ratio of about 4/3. Below the TK minimum, NaL and the I.C. coexist in the solids for wO < 0.5, whereas the I.C. and NaOl coexist in the solids for wO > 0.5. Each pair of solids exhibits eutectic or monotectic solubility behavior, and the congruent I.C. melting point is so close to that of the eutectic point(s) that a broad TK minimum ensues.

Their widespread applications are often hindered by a high surface affinity for oxygen, which blocks catalytic sites. However, recent reports indicate that the \u03b1-MoC phase is a stable and effective co-catalyst for reactions in oxidative or aqueous environments. In this work, we elucidate the factors affecting the stability and catalytic activity of \u03b1-MoC under mild electrooxidation conditions (0\u20130.8 V SHE) using density functional theory calculations, kinetics-informed surface Pourbaix diagram analysis, electronic structure analysis, and cyclic voltammetry. Both computational and experimental data indicate that \u03b1-MoC is significantly more resistant to electrooxidation by H2O than \u03b2-Mo2C. This higher stability is attributed to structural and kinetic factors, as the Mo-terminated \u03b1-MoC surface disfavors substitutional oxidation of partially exposed, less oxophilic C* atoms by hindering CO/CO2 removal. The surface exposes H2O-protected [MoC2O2] and [MoC(CO)O2] oxycarbidic motifs available for catalysis in a wide potential window. At higher potentials, they convert to unstable [Mo(CO)2O2], resulting in material degradation.  Using formic acid as a probe molecule, we obtain evidence for Pt-like O*-mediated O-H and C-H bond activation pathways. The kinetic barrier for the rate-limiting C-H bond activation correlates with the hydrogen affinity of the site in the order O*/Mofcc > O*/Ctop > O*/Motop.

On the one hand this approach is inefficient for large droplets because the computational  cost increases as the squared of the number of the atomic sites, and on the other hand the   force field is not the same as that that has been parametrized for the bulk solution. The effect of this new force field in the conformations of macromolecules is still unknown. Multilevel summation method (MSM) has been developed [Hardy et al. ``Multilevel summation method for electrostatic force evaluation'' J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 766 (2015)] for the efficient treatment of electrostatic forces in non-periodic and semi-periodic systems, charged or neutral. MSM maintains the same force field in droplets as in the bulk solution. We compare MSM with direct electrostatic treatment in droplets. The comparison shows the same probability distribution of the conformations, but differences in the rate of transition between the conformations. We demonstrate the usage MSM to study Rayleigh jet formation and charge emission from droplets. We conclude that robust approaches for droplet simulations that can be used with a force field of any complexity are available and can be implemented within many of the available open-source molecular modeling softwares. In the near future, the presented approach may provide reliable reference mass spectra for experiments, where the deviations from the experimental data may reveal valuable information about the processes that take place within the instrument.", "date": "2024-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Theory - Computational; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A straightforward synthesis from readily available substrates offers a unique possibility of fusing the 1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole subunit not only with carbocyclic building blocks, such as electron-deficient phenanthrenes, chrysenes, or [4]helicenes, but also with heterocyclic systems, such as benzo[b]furan and 5-thiatruxene. The clear advantage of this strategy is that there is no requirement to assemble complex scaffolds possessing bromoaryl units since bromine atom is introduced by bromination of 1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole core which, because of its exceptionally electron-rich character, is universal and straightforward reaction.

This allows us to model the effect of molecular distortion on T(1/2), the characteristic temperature of thermal crossover and T(LIESST), the maximum temperature at which trapped excited high spin (HS) complexes are stable. We find that T(1/2) is a purely thermodynamic quantity as the kinetics are entirely determined by the relative free energies of the HS and low spin (LS) states [G(diff)=G(HS)-G(LS)]. The average distortion across HS and LS species {Sigma(avg)=[sigma(HS)+sigma(LS)]/2} has a significant impact on G(diff) whereas the change in the metal-ligand bond length between HS and LS species [d(diff)=d(HS)-d(LS)], and the change in the molecular distortion between the HS and LS states [Sigma(diff)=Sigma(HS)-sigma(LS)] do not. Therefore, Sigma(avg) has a large effect of T(1/2), whereas d(diff) and Sigma(diff) do not. T(LIESST) is largely determined by the height of the barrier [E(barrier)] between the metastable HS state and the LS state. E(barrier) is strongly affected by d(diff), Sigma(diff), and Sigma(avg), so each of these quantities strongly impact T(LIESST). Thus, decreasing the average distortion across HS and LS species will increase T(LIESST) and decrease T(1/2), which may provide a route to high temperature spin-state switching. Increasing the change in the metal-ligand bond length between the HS and LS species or the molecular distortion between the HS and LS states will increase T(LIESST) without substantially change T(1/2).", "date": "2024-10-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Characterizing intramolecular folding re-quires using structural probing techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry. However, inferring solu-tion structures of nucleic acids is difficult because the low-charge state ions produced from aqueous solutions at physiological ionic strength get compacted during electrospray. Here we explored whether native supercharging could produce higher charge states that would better reflect solution folding, and whether the voltage required for collision-induced unfolding (CIU) could reflect preserved intramolecu-lar hydrogen bonds. We studied pH-responsive i-motif structures with different loops, and unstructured controls. We also implemented a multivariate curve resolution procedure to extract physically meaning-ful pure components from the CIU data and reconstruct unfolding curves. We found that the relative unfolding voltages reflect to some extent, but not always unambiguously, the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that were present in solution. Reaching phosphate charging densities over 0.25 makes it easier to discriminate between structures, and the use of native supercharging agents is thus essential. We also uncovered several caveats in data interpretation: (1) when different structures (for example the i-motif with and without hairpin) unfold via different pathways, the unfolding voltages do not necessari-ly reflect the number of hydrogen bonds, (2) unstructured controls also undergo unfolding, and the base composition influences the unfolding voltage, (3) changing the solution pH also unexpectedly changed the unfolding voltage, and (4) the ion mobility patterns become more complicated when two structures are present simultaneously, such as an i-motif and a harpin, because of opposite effects on the collision cross section upon activation.

Contrary to established selectivity trends found for C-H activation by transition metal complexes, strained cycloalkanes, including cyclopentane, cycloheptane, and cyclooctane, undergo C-H addition much more readily than n-alkanes which in turn are much more reactive than cyclohexane. Aromatic C-H bonds also undergo H/D exchange much less rapidly than those of the strained cycloalkanes, but much more favorably than cyclohexane. The order of reactivity toward dehydrogenation correlates qualitatively with the reaction thermodynamics, but the magnitude is much greater than can be explained by thermodynamics. Accordingly, the cycloalkenes corresponding to the strained cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenation much more readily than cyclohexene, despite the less favorable thermodynamics of such hydrogenations. Computational (DFT) studies allow rationalization of the origin of reactivity and the unusual selectivity. Specifically, the initial C-H addition is strongly assisted by \ud835\udefd-agostic interactions, which are particularly favorable for the strained cycloalkanes. Subsequent to \ud835\udefc-C-H addition, the H atom of the \ud835\udefd-agostic C-H bond is transferred to the hydride ligand of (iPrPCP)IrH+, to give a dihydrogen ligand.

Among the most well-known active photoanodes for the oxygen evolution half-reaction are various TiO2-based materials. A hole polaron, which consists of a metal-oxide distortion around trapped holes, has been suggested as a local reactive oxygen configuration for the oxidative reaction. While first principal calculations identify new electronic states in the middle of the band gap due to hole-polarons and the influence of hole-polaron dynamics on transport, an assignment of hole-polaron configurations to a measured spectrum has been challenging due to broad optical transitions in the visible regime. Here, we compare the excited state absorption (ESA) for two titanium oxide materials with a similar electronic structure, but different titanium-oxide crystal structure and find that the maximum in the broad spec-trum shifts from 3.1 eV in rutile TiO2 (100) to 2.2 eV in perovskite SrTiO3.

Moreover, the development of multiple utilizations of sustainable biomass materials especially in developing biobased materials for catalysts is highly demanding. So in this work, advanced flow synthesis methodology was used to prepare primary amines via bio-based chitosan Co@CS heterogeneous catalyst through the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrile. The effects of temperature, pressure, ammonia concentration, and liquid flow rate on the flow reaction were investigated. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the benzonitrile (BN) conversion rate was greater than 99%, and the selectivity of benzylamine exceeded 99%. The synthesized graphene-encapsulated Co-based catalyst with chitosan as the carrier material was tested for a long time to verify the stability of the Co@CS catalyst. The substrate expansion experiments of various aromatic nitriles gave satisfactory primary amine yields. Due to its exceptional mass and heat transport properties, the H-Flow system offers an efficient route for the large-scale synthesis of primary amines from biomass platform compounds in industrial production.

Despite its importance, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source for this elementary step remain elusive and are under intense debate. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been used to investigate such a mechanism. However, semi-local functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level face significant challenges in accurately describing adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. In this work, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and incorporated a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that, in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed water at the surface acts as the proton source for the reduction of *CO to *COH over a wide range of potentials via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals not only significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation but also consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all the potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H2O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potential within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO2RR modeling. These potential-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic data illustrate a pronounced divergence between the mechanistic insights offered by RPA and those derived from DFT-GGA functionals.

These parameters help categorize reactivity into thermal and mechanical domains, providing a useful framework for developing new mechanophores that are responsive to force but thermally stable.

Surfactants known as deposit control additives (DCAs) ad- sorb and self-assemble on the surface of deposit precursors to keep them suspended in the fuel. Here, we show how molecular simulations can be used to virtually screen the ability of surfactants to bind to a major class of carbonaceous deposits, polyaromatic hydrocarbons. We use molecular dynamics with the adaptive biasing force method to generate the potential of mean force as a function of the distance between the surfactants and model deposits in gasoline and diesel fuel surrogates. We find that a zwitterionic surfactant outperforms non-ionic polyisobutylene succinimide for bind- ing to these aromatic species. The amine groups in the succinimide head-group only weakly adsorb on the polyaromatic deposit, while additional functional groups in the zwitterionic surfactant, particularly the ammonium ion, markedly enhance the binding strength. We decompose the adsorption free energies of the surfactants into entropic and enthalpic components, to find that the latter dominates the attraction from these non-aqueous solvents. The adsorption free energy of both surfactants is slightly weaker from n-hexadecane (diesel) than iso-octane (gasoline), which is due to the stronger molecular layering on the deposit of the former. Density functional theory calculations of the adsorption of DCA fragments validate the force field used in the molecular dy- namics simulations and provide further insights into the nature of the intermolecular interactions. The approach introduced here show considerable promise for accelerating the discovery of novel DCAs to facilitate more advanced fuel formulations to reduce emissions.", "date": "2024-10-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Remarkably, it uncovers a universal extraordinary state of matter featuring strictly one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional structures formed by ions and polar molecules, beyond solids, liquids, and gases. This discovery significantly expands our understanding of material structures in terms of elemental composition, spatial structure, dimensionality, distribution, and stability, opening up a new, unknown frontier for research at atomic and mesoscopic scales.

It remains unknown whether the unique alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q might contribute to the toxicity of 6PPD-Q. To test this, we herein synthesized chemical standards of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q isomers and investigated their metabolic formation mechanism and toxicity. The predominant alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q was confirmed to be hydroxylated on the C4 tertiary carbon (C4-OH-6PPD-Q). The formation of C4-OH-6PPD-Q was only observed in microsomal, but not cytosolic fractions of rainbow trout (O. mykiss) liver S9. A general CYP450 inhibitor fluoxetine inhibited the formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD-Q, supporting that CYP450 catalyzed the hydroxylation. This well-explained the compound- and regio-selective formation of C4-OH-6PPD-Q, due to the weak C-H bond on the C4 tertiary carbon. Surprisingly, while cytotoxicity was observed for 6PPD-Q and C3-OH-6PPD-Q in a coho salmon (O. kisutch) embryo (CSE-119) cell line, no toxicity was observed for C4-OH-6PPD-Q. To further confirm this under physiologically relevant conditions, we fractionated 6PPD-Q metabolites formed in the liver microsome of rainbow trout. Cytotoxicity was observed for the fraction of 6PPD-Q, but not the fraction of C4-OH-6PPD-Q. In summary, this study highlighted the C4 tertiary carbon as the key moiety for both metabolism and toxicity of 6PPD-Q, and confirmed that alkyl hydroxylation is a detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q.", "date": "2024-10-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Innovating diverse DAC materials will enable their effective use in varying conditions, and bring forth a better understanding of CO2 capture mechanisms. In our current contribution, we have synthesized a family of homoleptic alkali tetraperoxotitanate materials (generally formulated A4Ti(O2)4, A=Li, Na, K) and studied their DAC reactivity. Synthesis was achieved with inexpensive reagents, and >90% yields. We present the first single-crystal X-ray structures (five total) of A4Ti(O2)4 compounds, along with supplemental bulk characterization and computation. We compare their DAC behavior in simple ambient benchtop experiments, determining CO2 uptake by combustion analysis of post-capture materials. The K-analogue exhibited the most rapid and high capacity DAC, 8.17 mmol CO2/gram sorbent, translating to nearly 3 moles CO2 per mole Ti, and reaching near maximum capacity in under 10 days. The Li and Na analogues both exhibit delayed reactivity, but also with high DAC capacity (respectively 6.66 and 8.18 mmol CO2/gram sorbent). Characterization of the DAC products via scanning electron microscopy shows phase separation of alkali-rich and Ti-rich regions in core-shell morphologies for the Na and Li analogues, and this is discussed with respect to the role of the titanium vs the alkali in DAC. On the other hand, no phase separation was observed for the K-analogue. In situ monitoring detailed the early-stage CO2 capture behavior of the K-analogue, and it reaches ~50% of maximum capacity within one hour. The differentiating behavior of the K-analogue is attributed to its unique composition, containing four H2O2 lattice molecules in addition to the four O2- peroxide anions bonded to TiIV. While H2O2 (aq) alone does not exhibit CO2 chemisorption, the basic environment of the A4Ti(O2)4 lattice activates its rapid DAC, inspiring future exploration of peroxosolvate materials for DAC.

This structure evokes a mental schema in which the layers form nanoscopic channels, but very little is known regarding the permeability of the lattice by small molecules. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain predictions for the diffusion of small molecules through TATB single crystal. An approach to fit classical MD force fields is developed to accurately model interactions between TATB and small molecules including H2O, He, Ne, and Ar. Fitted force fields are combined with a steered MD approach to probe transport of these small molecules along selected directions in the crystal. We find that small molecule transport occurs via a hopping mechanism exhibited by distinct jumps between interstitial sites. Perhaps counter-intuitively, we find that transport via the hopping mechanism is substantially faster normal to the layers as compared to along them. This result stems from the finding that intralayer junctions between adjacent TATB molecules are the most stable interstitial sites, which leads to lower energetic barriers along directions that have a component normal to the layers. An empirical model for diffusion rate based on the MD data shows that the rate decays exponentially with increasing molecular radius and is negligibly small for for all molecules larger than He, including common atmospheric gases.

However, the influences of preliminary functionalization of the carbon component (e.g., nitrogen doping, hydroxyl grafting) and pairing of cathodes and anodes on the desalination performance have yet to be thoughtfully explored.  Herein, we prepared a group of MnO2-decorated mesoporous carbon composites with nitrogen as a dopant (i.e., MK-NMCS, K-NMCS, NMCS, and CS), and systematically evaluated the desalination performance of various cathode//anode pairs in a hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) for capturing Na+, Cu2+, and Pb2+, respectively.

This study explores the application of ultrasound in oxidation processes using the wastewater treatment as a case study. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are highly effective for degrading the pollutants in wastewater through the generation of oxidative radicals, with ultrasound emerging as a promising AOP method due to its mild conditions and synergistic potential with other methods. However, ultrasound alone faces challenges in efficiently degrading complex compounds like azo dyes, partly due to issues with cavitation bubble stability and non-uniform ultrasonic fields. Microfluidic reactor combined with microbubble technology offers a solution to enhance ultrasound efficiency by improving bubble stability and energy distribution. In this study, we investigate microbubble formation in a microfluidic reactor with T-junction and flow-focusing inlets, aiming to enhance ultrasound-driven AOPs. The flow-focusing design successfully generates relatively small and monodisperse bubbles allowing for effective ultrasound application at 108.5 kHz using a piezoelectric transducer. Our results demonstrate a relatively high H2O2 generation rate of 0.54 \u03bcM/s, among the highest reported in the literature, and a methyl orange (MO) degradation efficiency of 35% in just 2.9 seconds - significantly surpassing conventional systems and prior microfluidic studies.

In this work, we use physically realistic kinetics models of photo-driven water oxidation on TiO2 to evaluate how hole generation, bulk diffusion, surface mobility and reaction are coupled. The calculations show that hole formation and diffusion in the bulk crystal dominate O2 formation at low light intensity, resulting in an apparent high order dependence of the O2 production rate on holes. As light intensity increases, the water splitting reaction becomes nearly independent of hole concentrations because of a buildup of intermediates that can only react thermally. Although it is believed that high hole mobility is a requirement for hole accumulation, a comparison of predicted to observed surface species indicates that immobilized holes dominate surface reactivity. The primary surface reaction sites are predicted to involve oxygen atoms that bridge two Ti atoms, supplied with OH formed by water dissociation on Ti sites. Because of the similarity among photocatalytic water oxidation mechanisms on diverse metal oxide semiconductors, which have generally low hole mobilities, the findings from this work may be relevant to them as well. If so, manipulations of hole mobility and accelerating the rate of thermal steps may provide a general pathway for improving water oxidation efficiency.

In this sense, intercalation of POMs in the interlaminar space of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), formed by positively charged brucite-type inorganic layers, is a very interesting strategy that is gaining attention in the field. Despite their huge potential, there is a lack of accurate characterization of the materials, especially after their use as water oxidation catalysts in pH conditions in which the POM counterpart has been demonstrated to be unstable (strong alkali media). For this reason and as a proof-of-concept, we have intercalated the well-known [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10- POM (Co4-POM) in the lamellar space of the Mg2Al-LDH layered double hydroxide, to study its catalytical capabilities and stability. Remarkably, the nanocomposites show improved water oxidation efficiencies with excellent stability in close-to-neutral media compared to the water-insoluble cesium salt of Co4-POM or commercial Co3O4. However, thorough post-catalytic characterization of the nanocomposites demonstrates that the polyoxotungstate framework of the POM suffers from hydrolytic instability in strong alkali conditions, leading to the formation of a mixed-valence cobalt(II/III) oxide in the interlayer space of Mg2Al-LDH.

The applicability of the Butler Volmer equation (B-Ve) based on Tafel analysis is limited to single electron transfer reactions which are not typical of CO2 reduction reactions on Cu catalysts. We developed a method that involves linking the nanoscale effects encapsulated in a detailed calibrated microkinetic model (MKM) on Cu(100) electrodes to a mass transport model (MTM) on a low surface area, flooded agglomerate electrode. The MKM carries richer kinetic information of most reaction pathways described in contemporary literature for Cu(100). Polynomial equations are used to bridge kinetic and transport models without the need for excessive complexity. Our results show that using regression modelling, the microkinetic information at the microscopic level of the catalyst can be successfully linked with the macroscopic electrode models. We observe how mass transport parameters such as CO2 concentration, pH, and applied voltage, interacts with microkinetic information of the catalyst, influencing the reaction pathways and current densities of key products methane, ethylene, ethanol, and hydrogen. Although the model explores the medium to high voltage regimes, the methodology can address the oversimplification of CO2 reduction (CO2RR) kinetics and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for observed multiple kinetic regimes if comprehensive microkinetic models are integrated. It also serves as a foundational work for further experimental endeavours for the development of comprehensive microkinetic models.

This work uses the donor-acceptor natures, steric effects, and conjugation lengths of six benzothiadiazole (BTD) based organic dyes (PC1-PC6) to control their charge transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) states. Thus, effective photosensitization and photoredox characteristics are brought about for photocatalytic applications. Additionally, theoretical research shows that the carbazole-linked-BTD with methyl (PC2 and PC3) demonstrates an effective CT feature in the T1 state. While the LE nature of the methyl-free carbazole-linked-BTD dye (PC1) is excellent. TPA-linked-BTD dyes (PC4-PC5), on the other hand, have good LE properties in the T1 state except for mono-TPA-linked-BTD derivative (PC6).

Among various synthesis approaches, the direct ion exchange incorporation of Ni into a TiO2 network prepared by an alginate synthesis route allowed the key-factors orientating the reaction selectivity towards 5-MF to be identified.

Here, we investigate the functionalization of lanthanide-doped NaYF4 UCNPs with low-vibrational-energy Sn2S64- ligands.

This binding enhances upconversion efficiencies up to a factor of 16, consistent with an increase in the luminescent lifetimes of the lanthanide ions. Annealing Sn2S64--capped UCNPs results in the formation of a nanocomposite comprised of UCNPs embedded within an interconnected matrix of SnS2, enabling each UCNP to be electrically accessible through the semiconducting SnS2 matrix. This facilitates the integration of UCNPs into electronic devices, which we demonstrate through the fabrication of a UCNP-SnS2 photodetector that detects UV and near-IR light.

Recent advances offer an innovative solution - the virtual generation of billions of synthetically feasible compounds with an impressive 80% success rate for synthesis. This breakthrough has the potential to significantly expand the chemical space available for purchase and experimental validation, bringing about a revolution in the field. Our study presents a comprehensive approach to compound discovery and optimization, harnessing quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS), chemical databases, and reaction-based enumeration. To further enhance the synthesis process and gain deeper insights into compound formation, we utilize the Reaction Cookbook from Biosolveit, which comprises reaction SMARTs for around 300 chemical reactions. By employing this wide range of reactions, we aim to uncover the full spectrum of a chemotype's potential and customize its structure to optimize desired properties.

Herein, a systematic investigation of twelve Zr(IV)-based UiO-66 MOFs with varying ether-chain functional groups was carried out to elucidate the critical microscopic interactions that facilitate improved solid-state electrolyte performance. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed and revealed a three-tier ion hopping mechanism: linker-linker hopping, linker-counterion hopping, and counterion-counterion hopping. Detailed structural analysis of the MD trajectories revealed that the chemistry and morphology of the linker groups affects the relative stability and population distribution of the electrolyte components, such that crown-ether based linker groups enhances the probability of extended, low-barrier ion percolation pathways. As a result, we were able to tune the ion conductivities by means of rationally manipulating the counterion distributions, linker binding strengths, and the configurational entropy (multi-variability of the linkers).

The exo-chair isomer is found to be more stable by 1.83 kcal/mol, with an energy barrier of 3.65 kcal/mol separating the two using the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ method. Despite small geometric differences, significant changes in the shape, dipole moments (0.0156 Debye for the exo-chair and 0.0426 Debye for the exo-boat) and NMR chemical shifts at the flag carbon (C5), the boat tip carbon (C10) and the hydrogens bonding with them.

This study investigates the impact of adsorption of closed-shell (e.g. N2, CO, CO2) and open-shell paramagnetic (e.g. O2, NO, NO2) molecules on the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of zig-zag graphene nanoribbons using density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green\u2019s function (NEGF-DFT) methods. We found that closed-shell molecules physisorbed on graphene nanoribbons, while open-shell molecules chemisorbed strongly at the edges. This chemisorption disrupts the symmetric spin distribution, leading to spin-polarized transmission. The underlying mechanism for spin-polarized transmission in open-shell molecule adsorbed cases is quantum interference between the localized states of the molecule and the delocalized states of the graphene nanoribbons. The bond current, the current between a pair of two atoms, analysis shows that physisorbed closed-shell molecules act as a scattering center, which reduces the current through graphene nanoribbons. We showed that the interaction of open-shell molecules with the graphene nanoribbons depends on the electronic properties of adsorbed molecules. Thus a variation in destructive quantum interference pattern is observed for different open-shell molecules resulting in different spin current. This phenomenon can be used for molecular recognition of open-shell paramagnetic species, providing avenue for quantum spin sensors technology.", "date": "2024-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites SZO, which open under mild reaction conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO3 and sulfate groups. This adsorbed SO3 is a very strong Lewis acid that binds 15N-pyridine or tri-ethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (Eads > \u201339 kcal mol-1), reacts with Ph3CH to form Ph3C+, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene-d4. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites have a modest 26.1 kcal mol-1 barrier to form the adsorbed SO3 and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C\u2013H in this model is exo-thermic and subsequent -scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO3 between 226.2 to 237.9 kcal mol-1, among largest values reported for a Lewis acid. This study explains how SZO, a classic heterogeneous catalyst whose activity is often attributed to Br\u00f8nsted acidity, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.", "date": "2024-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.); Acid Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Summed PFAS levels in water nearby the plant ranged from 30 ng/L to 22.5 \u03bcg/L and were dominated by perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), most notably perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; up to 20.6 \u03bcg/L), EEA (up to 1.7 \u03bcg/L) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA; up to 650 ng/L). Additionally, various homologous series of PFAS suspects, such as hydrogen-substituted PFCAs (H-PFCAs), chlorine-substituted PFCAs (Cl-PFCAs) and monoether perfluoroether alkyl carboxylic acids (ME-PFECAs) were identified, some for the first time in Europe. In air, PFOA was detected in all but one sample collected 20 km from the plant at concentrations ranging from 0.51 to 2.50 pg/m3. The three air samples that showed detectable EEA concentrations also displayed evidence of long-chained targets and suspects and were associated with high wind speeds from a southwesterly direction.

In turn, the predictive power of density functional theory calculations is seldom enough for reliable prediction of the excited state properties of iridium(III) complexes. In this work, we aimed at data-driven prediction of the emission energies and photoluminescence quantum yields of such complexes. To this end, we created a database (IrLumDB) that contains experimentally measured luminescence properties for over 1200 literature bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. Based on this database, we developed machine learning models that are capable of predicting the energy of emission maxima and photoluminescence quantum yields for the iridium phosphors with mean absolute errors of 18.26 nm and 0.129, respectively, requiring only SMILES of ligands. Furthermore, we validated the model for emission wavelength prediction on the set of 33 experimentally obtained luminescence spectra for newly synthesized and characterized iridium(III) complexes. Our data-driven methodology will complement quantum chemical calculations as an efficient alternative approach for the prediction of the excited-state properties of large sets of bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, facilitating computational discovery of efficient emitters.

However, the early variant, methyl viologen (MVi), exhibits low stability in aqueous electrolytes, restricting its practical implementation in AOFB technology. In this context, leveraging the tunability of organic molecules, various substituents have been incorporated into the viologen core to achieve better stability, lower redox potential, and improved solubility. In this work, we introduce bisphosphonate-substituted viologens as candidates for AOFBs. The bulkiness and negative charges of the bisphosphonate groups enhance the solubility and the electrostatic repulsion among viologen molecules, minimizing the bimolecular side reactions that lead to degradation. Additionally, the electron-donating effect of this new substituent significantly lowers the redox potential. As a result, the proposed viologen derivatives exhibit high solubility (1.66 - 1.81 M in water) and stability (capacity decay of 0.009 %/cycle or 0.229%/day when tested at 0.5 M). These parameters are coupled with the lowest redox potentials exceeding all previously reported viologens utilized in AOFBs (\u20130.503 V and \u20130.550 V against SHE for mono- and bis-phosphonate viologen, respectively).", "date": "2024-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, because the transition dipole matrix elements must be calculated between two excited states (i.e. the valence excited state and the final core-excited state arising from the initial valence excited state) of very different energies, this can be challenging and time-consuming to compute. Herein using two molecules, protonated formaldimine and cyclobutanone, we assess the ability of n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2), equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory (EOM-CCSD), linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) and the maximum overlap method (MOM) to describe excited state X-ray spectra. Our study focuses in particular on the behaviour of these methods away from the Franck-Condon geometry and in the vicinity of important topological features of excited-state potential energy surfaces, namely conical intersections. We demonstrate that the primary feature of excited state X-ray spectra is associated with the core electron filling the hole created by the initial valence excitation, a process that all the methods can capture. Higher-energy states are generally weaker and more sensitive to the nature of the reference electronic wavefunction. As molecular structures evolve away from the Franck-Condon geometry, changes in the spectral shape closely follow the underlying valence excitation, highlighting the importance of accurately describing the initial valence excitation to simulate the excited state X-ray absorption spectra.

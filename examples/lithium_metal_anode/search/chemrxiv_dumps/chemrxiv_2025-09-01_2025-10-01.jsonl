This places these materials on par with other, better-studied soft materials, such as polymers. However, the physical inaccessibility of the contact interface with common analytical methods hinders direct experimental observation of the critical molecular-scale processes responsible for the recovery of the interfacial gap; as a result, this effect has largely remained phenomenological. This report employs molecular dynamics simulations and mechanical analysis to unravel the mechanistic details behind the remarkably efficient (95%) self-healing observed in the ferroelastic crystal anilinium bromide. Bulk simulations successfully reproduce the experimentally observed phase transitions under both uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions, while slab model calculations with free surfaces capture crack formation and self-healing phenomena associated with twinning and detwinning. The atomistic insights establish a two-step model: external mechanical loading first activates molecular slip along the (110)[1-10] path, providing a periodic impulse force that encourages molecular reorientation, leading to twinning and detwinning, along with subsequent ferroelastic and self-healing behaviors. These findings underscore the critical roles of crystal packing and mechanical loading and offer clear design principles for developing new, efficient organic self-healing materials with enhanced mechanical properties.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Pseudomonas species possess significant potential for the biosynthetic assembly of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)-derived terpenes with unusual carbon skeletons. However, their structural and biosynthetic diversity is largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of grimophan, an unprecedented C17 terpene featuring a deltacyclane skeleton. The compound was accessed by heterologous expression of the pgr biosynthetic gene cluster from Pseudomonas grimontii DSM 17515 in E. coli. The roles of the enzymes involved in grimophan biosynthesis were elucidated through in vitro reconstitution of the entire biosynthetic pathway. In-depth functional studies on the involved SAM-dependent methyltransferases led to the discovery of novel methyltransferase-like enzymes that do not perform functional group transfer, but rather significantly enhance the production titer of non-canonical terpenes. These enzymes thus constitute valuable tools for increasing biotechnological production levels of terpenes. The function of the cognate terpene synthase PgrE was evaluated by targeted point mutations within the conserved Asp-rich motif D92DMPLG97 to map effects of active-site residues on product formation. These investigations facilitated redirecting product selectivity, leading to alternative products. Overall, our work sheds light on the general biosynthetic logic leading to non-canonical C17 terpenes, provides a basis for their targeted discovery by genome mining and heterologous expression, and for engineering C17 terpene structural frameworks.", "date": "2025-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Natural Products; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

MDD is the leading cause of disability worldwide, yet it is still largely underdiagnosed due to misinterpretation of behavioral symptoms. Despite growing evidence implicating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of genes linked to psychiatric disorders, few computational tools exist to reliably classify miRNAs as being associated with depression. This study presents a novel quantum machine learning approach to predict whether dysregulation of specific miRNAs is linked to depression.  Methods: We used web scraping to create a dataset of sequence attributes, predicted gene target attributes, and predicted pathways attributes for 54 miRNAs frequently dysregulated in MDD patients and 54 randomly selected miRNAs. The dataset was limited to the most important attributes for classification using feature selection.  Results: A quantum classifier was then built with 7 qubits, achieving an accuracy of 90%, and a Multilayer Perceptron model was built, achieving an accuracy of 87%. The role of cancer pathways was also implicated in MDD development.  Discussion: This work represents one of the first applications of quantum machine learning to depression biomarker classification and provides proof of concept for its use in more complex mental health diagnostics. The quantum classifier not only handles entangled feature space and non-linear relationships to uncover patterns inaccessible to classical algorithms but also provides a real-world benchmark for using quantum computing in machine learning.

In Part I, we presented the fundamental theory within the adiabatic Born\u2013 Huang framework that describes the interaction between nuclear motion and the elec- tronic (spin and spatial) degrees of freedom. In particular, we highlighted how spin- orbit coupling introduces electronic spin-dependence in the dynamics. Electronic spin- dependence emerges in the nuclear equations of motion through the non-adiabatic couplings, which serve as conduits for angular momentum transfer between electrons and nuclei. In addition, the non-adiabatic couplings are shaped by the topology of the electronic Hilbert space. Here in Part II, we illustrate these concepts through the analysis of a one-electron triatomic E\u2032 \u2297e\u2032 Jahn\u2013Teller model. In the spin-independent case, this system represents a prototype cylindrically symmetric model featuring a con- ical intersection, which disappears once spin-orbit coupling is included. Starting from total angular momentum conservation, we find that in the body-fixed frame of our model, angular momentum transfer occurs between the electron and nuclear vibra- tions. In the spin-dependent dynamics, this manifests as an asymmetric dispersion of an angular-momentum-free initial wave packet, contrasting the symmetric evolution in the spin-independent case. This asymmetry is mirrored for the two spin direc- tions, providing a mechanism to differentiate spin states. The full implications of this mechanism in more realistic systems remains an open question.

Type II polyketide synthases (T2PKS) are multi-subunit complexes responsible for condensing acylated intermediates, including acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, into complex fused-ring aromatic natural products. While type II polyketides have traditionally been associated with gram-positive actinomycetes, more recent discoveries have identified PKS systems in gram-negative bacteria. These findings have provided new genetic tools and opened new pathways for producing and manipulating polyketides in the versatile chassis organism Escherichia coli. In this study, we altered the genetic circuit of the Photorhabdus luminescens PKS for octaketide production in E. coli. Promoter engineering and ribosome binding site optimization of the antDEFBG minimal PKS (mPKS) resulted in 181 mg/L SEK4 and 392 mg/L SEK4b production titers. Further refinement of downstream ketoreductase, aromatase, and cyclase expression enabled the biosynthesis of native polyketide AQ-256 and naphthopyrone (S)-DNPA at titers exceeding 200 mg/L/d. Additional metabolic reprogramming strategies further increased yields by 25%.

However, design optimizations have largely focused on structural properties, leaving the impact of the electronic environment less explored. To investigate how the electronic environment influences reactivity, we carry out both classical and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of mimochromes, MC6, MC6*, and MC6*a, with known differences in reactivity. To uncover patterns in electronic structure, we train supervised machine learning (ML) models and carry out statistical analysis. The ab initio MD simulations uncover key charge coupling interactions between Arg10' and Glu2' that are not identified in classical dynamics. These residues are determined to be essential in orienting Arg10' in the active site. Furthermore, using our ML classifiers trained to distinguish mimochromes based on partial charge dynamics alone, we identify critical residues such as Arg10', Lys11, Glu2', and Ser6' that distinguish the mimochrome analogues. Disruption of the computationally-identified Glu2'\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Lys11 salt bridge in a new mimochrome analogue, MC6*a-LysBoc, that we synthesize and characterize experimentally supports this prediction by resulting in a seven-fold decrease in the total turnover number. Quantum mechanical calculations show that Arg10' stabilizes the transition state for the formation of the reactive oxo from hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that partial charge distribution dynamics are important in the reactivity series in mimochromes, which should guide the engineering of a broad array of next-generation metalloenzymes.", "date": "2025-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

A. van der Vegt", "abstract": "    The modulation of acid-base equilibria by salts is a cornerstone of solution chemistry, yet the underlying mechanisms in complex, multi-component electrolyte mixtures remain poorly understood. While prior studies have established that individual salts can induce ion-specific shifts in the pKa of weak acids, the molecular origins of these effects-especially in mixed salt environments-have not been systematically elucidated. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation combining experiment and constant pH molecular dynamics simulations to unravel how ion pairing and specific ion effects govern the pKa of acetic acid in both single and mixed sodium salt solutions. By spanning a range of anion charge densities (sulfate, chloride, iodide), we demonstrate that the extent of cation-anion association, rather than electrostatic screening alone, dictates the observed pKa shifts. Notably, we reveal that in mixtures of sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, the effects on acetic acid pKa deviate from additivity owing to the underlying complexity of ion\u2013ion interactions in solution.

While 2D elasticity theories such as Canham-Helfrich-Evans adequately capture the dominant energetics of membrane deformation, a full characterization of the 3D elastic response is necessary to account for the many modes of deformation and the role that lipid structure plays in determining the elastic energy. We use the stress-stress fluctuation (SSF) method to obtain local elasticity profiles of a simple water-dodecane interface and a lipid membrane from coarse-grained MARTINI molecular dynamics simulations. We validate the results from the SSF method through the explicit deformation method, which measures the change in the local stress tensor relative to a specific strain. Furthermore, we show that some expected symmetries of the elasticity tensor are locally broken due to the lateral fluidity of the interfacial systems and the physical constraint of mechanical equilibrium. Profiles of the lateral and transverse shear moduli show that the membrane is locally fluid, while the transverse shear modulus is locally non-zero but its integral vanishes. We define the area and Young's moduli as well as the Poisson ratio for a lipid membrane through the compliance tensor, and use the area modulus to estimate the position of the neutral surface and macroscopic bending modulus.

This duality presents a major obstacle in understanding the emergence of RNA-based systems at the origins of life, where protein enzymes capable of catalyzing such reactions were absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying phosphoester formation is therefore essential for developing non-biological catalytic strategies. In a recent proof-of-concept study (Benayad et al. Proc.

Combining temperature-dependent high-resolution synchrotron X-ray scattering with optical birefringence measurements, we uncover that confinement geometries (pore diameters 25\u2013180 nm) and surface chemistry govern the emergence of distinct smectic A textures, featuring molecular layers either parallel or perpendicular to the pore axis. The competition between axial and radial smectic layering is modulated by pore size, surface hydrophilicity, and thermal history, enabling reversible control over domain orientations and transitions between liquid crystalline and crystalline states.

Herein, I-PCET at a metal-semiconductor-solution interface is investigated computationally using a Au-TiO2 model system, where the proton transfers from the TiO2 surface to an alcohol acceptor. We studied four possible I-PCET mechanisms that could occur in the system. For each mechanism, the calculated slope of the I-PCET equilibrium constant as a function of applied potential qualitatively agrees with experimental measurements of I-PCET-promoted Bronsted acid catalysis on a Ti-TiO2 composite system, although the dependence of the calculated results on the thickness of the TiO2 slab modeled prevents the unambiguous identification of the I-PCET mechanism. Focusing on one specific I-PCET mechanism, our charge analysis indicates that each proton transfer from the TiO2 surface is coupled to transfer of n \u2248 0.5 electrons from the Au metal to the external circuit. The calculated inverse slope of \u223c110 mV is consistent with the Nernstian slope of a 1H+-ne\u2212 PCET process.

A series of catalysts with systematically varied Pd loadings (0.1\u201350 wt%) were prepared to unravel the relationship between their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance. Comprehensive characterization and catalytic evaluation revealed a volcano-type dependence of activity on Pd loading, with the 5 wt% Pd/CeO2 (5Pd/CeO2) catalyst exhibiting the highest catalytical performance in mild conditions (97% yield, turnover number = 19.4).

We demonstrate that this approach allows the magic angle spinning of frozen aqueous solutions and an efficient 1H -> 13C cross polarization process. In particular, the application to 13C-enriched sodium bicarbonate (NaH13CO3) solutions, leads to the quenching of the fast carbonate (CO32-) <-> bicarbonate (HCO3-) chemical exchange and the observation of the two distinct 13C resonances corresponding to both species possibly dispersed in an amorphous water matrix.

Given the stoichiometry, these proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions are thermochemically equivalent to net H-atom transfer (HAT) reactions. The correlation between the chemical nature of solid catalysts to HAT kinetics has been employed for decades as the design principle for energy-relevant reactions (e.g., reactions of 2H+/H2). More recently, chemists have experimentally determined that a change in liquid electrolytes that alters the microenvi-ronment at the redox-active sites has an equally profound impact on electrocatalysis involving PCET/HAT. Yet, precise correlations between the chemical nature of electrolytes and the PCET kinetics are, to date, rare in the literature.

Each Ce6(\u03bc3\u2013O)4(\u03bc3\u2013OH)4(OH)6(H2O)6 nodes of this MOF undergo a 1H+/1e- redox reaction. Using chronoamperometry and the Cottrell analy-sis, we have determined that the PCET kinetics within the pores of Ce-MOF-808 can change by orders of magnitude by altering the buffer species and the proton activity of the electrolyte. Furthermore, in all buffers, reductive reactions were ~3-10 times faster in kinetics than the reverse oxidative reaction with the same electrochemical driving force, suggesting that the system, at first glance, violates the principle of microscopic reversibility. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and computational simulations corroborated that the buffer-node binding thermodynamics are quite distinct, depending on the chemical nature of the buffer and the oxidation state of the node. Together, these results suggest that the substrate and the product during the oxidative vs. reductive reaction of Ce-MOF-808 are chemically different species, which ex-plains the apparent \u2018microscopic irreversibility.\u2019 Thus, the rational modulation of electrolytes can dramatically enhance PCET kinetics; therefore, energy-relevant electrocatalysis even though the solid catalysts remain identical.

Electrode displacement modulation within 0.7\u20133.7 \u00c5 at 50 Hz leads to an increase in the high-to-low conductance ratio from ~55 to ~7900, quantitatively correlating the high-to-low conductance ratio with electrode displacement and applied force. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that progressive mechano-responsive planarization of the molecule enhances \u03c0-delocalization and improves through-bond charge transport efficiency, which underlies the consistent conductance enhancement in response to mechanical force. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for single-molecule piezoelectric devices with sub-\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m precision and advances the fundamental understanding of energy conversion at the molecular scale.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among them, the anion exchange membrane (AEM)-based systems offer the advantage of direct gas-phase CO2 capture. Fundamentally driven by pH swing, an AEM-based eDAC system requires a reduction reaction to generate hydroxides for CO2 capture and an oxidation reaction to consume hydroxides for CO2 release. Coupling the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is preferable due to zero thermodynamic equilibrium voltage, facile kinetics, and non-oxidative electrochemical environment, leading to high energy efficiency and long lifetime. However, this pairing remained unrealized because HER is incompatible with oxygen in air. Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical H2-redox-mediated CO2 separator (eHCS) that incorporates an anion-conducting isolation membrane between the cathode and airflow, which blocks O2 access to the HER side while supporting back-diffusion of hydroxides for CO2 capture, and simultaneously enables internal hydrogen recycling to the HOR side for CO2 release. Once optimized, the eHCS shows a CO2 flux of 330 kg/m2/yr with an electricity usage of 1.08 MWh/tCO2 and minimal H2 loss. Durability and scalability were validated through 720-hour continuous operation and a 3-cell stack demonstration. Rapid load-following response under dynamic conditions reveals its potential for integration with renewable electricity sources. For a 1 MtCO2/yr eHCS plant, technoeconomic analysis projects an eDAC cost of $97/tCO2.

Initially designed for single-droplet injection, ADE-MS can be adapted for direct infusion with stable signals. In this study, we developed and benchmarked a scalable workflow based on ADE-MS/MS with parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on a ZenoTOF MS platform, implemented in a 384-well format. By optimizing solvent composition, droplet parameters, and MS acquisition settings, the workflow enabled reproducible quantification of over 1000 polar and nonpolar lipid species across 14 subclasses, with low sample consumption and a total run time of approximately five minutes per sample.

Here we introduce MolSculptor, an adaptive diffusion-evolution framework designed to generate inhibitors for any combination of on- and off-targets, circumventing the need for target-specific training data or prior expert knowledge. MolSculptor conveniently unifies both de novo design and lead optimization, provides a versatile workflow applicable to different stages of drug discovery, and allows for direct conditioning on key drug-like properties. At its core, the framework integrates a 3D-aware surrogate model that enables flexible guidance for any set of specified on- and off-targets. Furthermore, MolSculptor employs an active learning protocol to adaptively refine this guidance, ensuring high performance even in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate MolSculptor on a series of challenging multi-target and selective inhibitor design tasks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality candidates that satisfy all complex constraints.

GABA is present at relatively low concentrations compared to other neurotransmitters therefore requiring sensitive analytical methods for accurate identification and quantitation. Described herein is a rapid and facile liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based chemical derivatization method to enhance the detection of GABA, demonstrated in both saline culture media and Carassius auratus (goldfish) retina samples. We have expanded the use of trimethylation enhancement using diazomethane (TrEnDi) to permethylate GABA ([GABATr]+) at 98\u2013100% yields across all matrix types. Quantitative methylation of the carboxylic acid and amino moieties nullifies any zwitterionic character and fixes a permanent positive charge on [GABATr]+ leading to MS sensitivity enhancement. In biological triplicates of goldfish retina samples, [GABATr]+ boasted 6.3\u201327.9-fold increases in MS sensitivity compared to its unmodified counterpart enabling quantitation with concentrations ranging between 78.6 to 806.5 nM.

Reaction of these pro-ligands with Mg{CH2(SiMe3)}2 yields the bulky, geometrically constrained, solvent free magnesium diamides [Mg(tBuNONTCHP)] 2 and [Mg(EtNONDipep)] 3, which are closely related to previously described [Mg(EtNONTCHP)] 1. The X-ray crystal structures of 1 and 2, reveal them to be dimeric with their Mg centers being intermolecularly coordinated by a CH2 fragment from a cyclohexyl group on an opposing monomeric unit. Compound 3 is monomeric in the solid-state, with its Mg center engaging in intramolecular interactions with CH3 protons of its flexible Dipep groups. Treating 1 with neat n-pentane, n-hexane or the neopentane analogue, tetramethylsilane (TMS), led to the first examples of group 2 metal alkane/TMS complexes, [Mg(EtNONTCHP)(2-H,H-pentane)] 4, [Mg(EtNONTCHP)(2-H,H-hexane)] 5 and [Mg(EtNONTCHP)(3-H,H,H-TMS)] 6, respectively. While the coordinated alkane in 4 and 5 appears to be readily displaced in cycloalkane solutions, the TMS ligand in 6 was spectroscopically observed to coordinate to the magnesium center at temperatures down to 180 K in cyclopentane solutions. The X-ray crystal structures of 4-6, and the neutron crystal structure of 5, confirm their formulations in the solid-state. A detailed theoretical analysis of the strength and nature of the Mg-alkane/TMS bonding in 4-6, has also been carried out. DFT analyses show that strength of bonding between the alkane/TMS and the Mg(EtNONTCHP) fragment is quite weak (Go298K = -2.9 to -5.6 kcal mol-1), but comparable to calculated bond dissociation values for -alkane complexes of transition metals (ca. 10-15 kcal mol-1). A combination of ETS-NOCV and NBO analyses of the bonding in 4-6 indicate that electrostatic interactions between the alkane/TMS and Mg(EtNONTCHP) fragments dominate (ca. 65%), but dispersion (ca. 20%) and orbital (ca. 15%) interactions make up significant contributions to the total attractive energy. Dispersion forces predominantly result from the interaction of the alkane/TMS unit with the TCHP flanked lipophilic coordination pocket of Mg(EtNONTCHP). Although compounds 4-6 should not be considered as magnesium -alkane/TMS complexes, 40-60% of the orbital interaction between the alkane/TMS and Mg(EtNONTCHP) units results directly from charge flow from the alkane/TMS CH2 or CH3 fragment to the magnesium center of Mg(EtNONTCHP). This view of the bonding in 4-6 is supported by NCI and QTAIM analyses of the compounds. Given the redox active nature of Mg(EtNONTCHP), and its demonstrated ability to reductively activate normally inert substrates, e.g. N2 and arene C\u2012H bonds, under reducing conditions, compounds such as 4-6 have potential as precursors for the reductive C\u2012H activation, and subsequent functionalization of the coordinated alkane/TMS unit.", "date": "2025-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.); Small Molecule Activation (Inorg.); Theory - Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Initial Fe oxidation is shown to proceed via increased Fe\u2013S covalency driven by ligand-to-metal rehybridization. This accounts for only ~60% of the Fe capacity, after which phase separation into Li1.5FeS2 and Li0.5FeS2 induces a shift to S oxidation. We identify nonbonding S 3p orbitals as redox-active and track their evolution using a newly developed electronic structure descriptor. These orbitals undergo S-to-Fe rehybridization, progressive oxidation, and eventual reorganization into persulfide bonds. At high states of charge, Li vacancies enable FeS4 tilting and facilitate S\u2013S bond formation. Further delithiation beyond Li0.5FeS2 would require unstable S hole formation or conversion to pyrite FeS2, explaining why it is challenging to fully delithiate this material.

Molecular docking simulations using AutoDock Vina predicted strong binding free energy (BFE) for all inhibitors (-10.1 kcal/mol to -11.2 kcal/mol). Together with the structural analysis showing the presence of distinct polar and nonpolar regions in each inhibitor, this suggests effective dual-site engagement with both the hydrophilic glutathione-binding (G-site) and hydrophobic substrate-binding (H-site) pockets of the GSTT1 active site. In silico pharmacokinetic profiling using SwissADME further suggested that the de novo GSTT1 inhibitors had favourable oral pharmacokinetics and drug-like properties, although some were predicted to be P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates, inhibitors of major cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoforms, or capable of permeating the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Overall, three top candidates (Syn-C1, Syn-C2, Syn-E3) emerged with the best balance of affinity, synthetic feasibility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. A key limitation of this study is its reliance on a static protein structure, which may not fully capture the conformational dynamics of GSTT1. Future work should address this by incorporating molecular dynamics simulations to generate conformational ensembles of GSTT1, thereby improving the physiological relevance of binding predictions. De novo inhibitors could also be further optimised using open-source tools such as AutoGrow4, while machine learning-based in silico ADME prediction methods could provide more accurate pharmacokinetic profiling.

We hypothesise that the secondary coordination sphere surrounding the metal centre, which is indispensable for enzymatic activity, is the crucial component missing in biomimetic catalysts. To address this issue, we have designed and synthesised hangman dipyrrin complexes that emulate both the primary and secondary coordination sphere of the fungal PMO active site by including a pendant phenol above the metal centre.

Although DNA-PK inhibitors show strong in vitro potency, their clinical advancement has been hindered by poor selectivity, low tumor accumulation, and systemic toxicity, preventing the achievement of maximum tolerated doses. To address these limitations, we targeted the Ku-DNA interaction and were the first to develop Ku-DNA binding inhibitors (Ku-DBi\u2019s) that block the Ku70/Ku80 interaction with DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA-PK activation and downstream repair. Our earlier Ku-DBi\u2019s exhibited potent inhibitory activity and selectivity, but their in vivo utility was restricted by poor solubility, metabolic stability, and limited cellular permeability.\nIn this study, we identified lead compounds with a novel 2-oxindole scaffold through iterative structure-activity relationship (SAR) optimization.

Here, the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a potential target for antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19, was explored based on QM/MM simulations with fixed-charge and polarizable force fields (cFF and pFF, respectively). Free energy perturbation (FEP) method allowed exploring the free energy landscape of the enzymatic reaction mechanism, addressing key questions about the initial deprotonation of the 3'\u2013OH group of the terminal nucleotide before a nucleophilic attack on the incoming nucleotide takes place. Indeed, among five mechanisms explored, the most favorable was identified as a three-step process. The first step consists of a proton transfer from the 3'\u2013OH group of the terminal nucleotide to a hydroxyl group coordinated with an Mg\u00b2\u207a ion. Subsequently, the O3\u2032 atom nucleophilically attacks the P\u03b1 atom of the incoming ATP. Finally, a proton is transferred from the water molecule formed in the first step to the \u03b3-phosphate group of the pyrophosphate leaving group, regenerating the Mg\u00b2\u207a-coordinated hydroxyl group. This mechanism was found to be exergonic, with the rate-determining step being the nucleophilic attack, having a free energy barrier of 15.2 kcal mol\u20131. Both cFF and pFF yield consistent energetic and geometrical descriptions of the full RdRp-catalyzed reaction, though pFF provides a more accurate account of the electronic environment. Non-covalent interaction (NCI) and electron localization function (ELF) analyses provide insights into the electronic evolution during the reaction, showing strong polarization on electronic basins associated with the reactive oxygens O3' and O3. Together, findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the RdRp mechanism, which could aid in the discovery of new antiviral inhibitors.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The process of deriving usable fuel from carbon dioxide was dubbed hydrogenation of CO\u2082, involving a series of intricate steps, each necessitating a specific catalyst to drive the reaction towards the desired compound. To start, the reverse water-gas shift reaction is needed to convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen into carbon monoxide and water, more commonly known as syngas. Syngas is then fed into the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, the primary procedure in hydrogenation, which converts syngas into liquid hydrocarbons. However, such hydrocarbons are inherently smaller chains, as the amount of energy needed to convert syngas into hydrocarbons increases as the chain length increases, yielding only C\u2081-C\u2084 chains. To resolve this, a process known as oligomerization synthesizes identical smaller hydrocarbon chains into longer chains, in this case, octane. Yet even after such complex processes, the octane that is produced is not optimal for use. In actuality, the octane is in a linear form, which is inferior to its branched counterpart, yielding lower results and worse performance. Isomerization mitigates this process by restructuring the compound.

Although protocells have been reported to display biologically inspired functions in both systems chemistry and prebiotic contexts, the rules underlying lipid selection in competitive environments remain largely unexplored. Here we show that combinatorial libraries based on dynamic covalent imine bonds provide a suitable model to investigate selection mechanisms in micellar formation, leading to the emergence of enzyme-like catalysis and the chemical evolution toward bilayer structures. Systematic studies reveal that micelles protect their imine-based surfactants from hydrolysis through the micro-environments they generate, thereby stabilising their own components via a self-selection process. Remarkably, this mechanism also pro-motes the self-sorting of reaction networks, which in turn reinforces the robustness of selection. Increasing compositional diversity enables micelles to adopt complex behaviours, such as mimicking hydrolase activity through the incorporation of a catalytic triad, and affording sufficient stabilising interactions to drive the micelle-to-vesicle transition. Our findings suggest that micelles can act as dynamic attractors, selecting molecules of interest from mixtures and initiating chemical evolution towards function and higher levels of organisation. This study provides guidelines for probing the emergence of protocells by elucidating key selection rules that may be extended to a wide range of micro-compartments.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Physical Organic Chemistry; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, existing in silico methods face two major issues: a decline in predictive performance caused by limited ADME data and a lack of clarity regarding the rationale for lead optimization to improve ADME properties. In this study, we built an AI model capable of predicting ten different ADME parameters to overcome these challenges. Our training approach was based on a graph neural network combining multitask learning, which shares information across multiple tasks to increase the number of usable samples\nwith fine-tuning that adapts to each task. In addition, we applied the integrated gradients (IG) method to compound data collected before and after lead optimization to quantify and interpret each input feature\u2019s contribution to the predicted ADME values. Our proposed model achieved the highest performance for seven of the ten ADME parameters compared with conventional methods.

In weakly interacting walls (Wall A), hydroxide is destabilized at the interface and the reaction proceeds preferentially in the subsurface, whereas in strongly interacting walls (Wall B) the interfacial and subsurface states are nearly isoenergetic, reducing selectivity. This contrast arises from confinement-enforced coordination motifs where hydronium remains tri-coordinated across environments, while hydroxide is restricted to tetra coordination at the interface but adopts hypercoordinated states in the subsurface. Mechanical flexibility of the confining framework further modulates the overall thermodynamics by reducing the entropic penalty, as water molecules can explore a broader configurational space compared to rigid pores.

This work introduces a risk-averse multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that accounts for heteroscedastic experimental uncertainty in the outcomes of different synthesis conditions using a value-at-risk approach. It employs two Gaussian processes per objective, one for the expected function value and one for its variance, and optimizes a novel risk-averse acquisition function.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state and future prospects of batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells in the context of AAM applications. Batteries, particularly lithium-ion chemistries, are currently the most mature technology, enabling near-term demonstrations and certification efforts. However, their limitations in energy density, charging time, and thermal management restrict endurance and necessitate innovations in solid-state and lithium\u2013sulfur variants. Supercapacitors, though limited in energy capacity, offer unparalleled power density and rapid response, making them ideal for handling transient loads during take-off, landing, and regenerative braking. Fuel cells present a promising long-term solution, providing high specific energy and zero carbon emissions at the point of use. Yet, their adoption depends heavily on the establishment of scalable hydrogen production, storage, and refueling infrastructure. The review further highlights hybrid architectures that combine these technologies, such as battery\u2013supercapacitor and battery\u2013fuel cell systems, to exploit complementary advantages. Integration challenges, including thermal management, power electronics, and intelligent energy management systems, are analyzed alongside safety considerations and certification requirements. Case studies of ongoing demonstrators illustrate the diverse strategies being pursued globally. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges and future directions, emphasizing material innovations, infrastructure readiness, supportive policy frameworks, and a roadmap for next-generation AAM energy systems.

The obtained data provide spectroscopic evidence that the charging process can be understood in the framework of a nanoscale capacitor model, where the applied voltage is governed by the chemical potential of holes generated in the 5d-bands of gold. Experimental observations of the dependence on particle size, oxygen content in the solvent and ligand type further corroborate the proposed capacitor model. The results of this work present the foundation for the rational engineering of dynamic charge states during plasmon driven photoreactions.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nevertheless, its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is severely limited by the very short hole diffusion length. To mitigate this limitation, we prepared nanostructured mesoporous CuWO4 photoanodes using the Pechini method, aiming to shorten the transport distance for photogenerated holes and enhance collection efficiency. The optimized mesoporous electrodes achieved a photocurrent of 0.6 mA cm\u20132 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, nearly an order of magnitude higher than benchmark compact films and among the highest values reported for CuWO4. However, the performance remains far below the theoretical limit, both in terms of photocurrent (lower by a factor of ~15) and maximum achievable photovoltage, with a photocurrent onset potential at ca. +0.6 V vs. RHE. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the low efficiency arises from severe bulk recombination and inefficient electron transport, as indicated by charge-separation efficiencies below 10% and electron collection lengths ~5 times shorter than the thickness required for optimal light harvesting. While electron transport might be partially improved by doping, fast recombination via deep ligand-field\u2013induced mid-gap states appears intrinsic to CuWO4. These findings indicate that, despite nanostructuring, CuWO4 is fundamentally unsuitable for constructing high-efficiency photoanodes for solar water splitting.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Redox Catalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This study explores the mechanisms causing this loss during Al2O3 growth with SiO2 as the non-growth surface, inhibited by trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS). We analyze SMI adsorption, maximum coverage, precursor penetration, and reactions with surface hydroxyl groups. Using a crystalline \u03b1-quartz slab to model SiO2, we compare outcomes to previous amorphous surface studies to evaluate the validity of idealized models. We find that TMPS achieves inhibitor densities similar to those in amorphous models but does not fully saturate surface hydroxyls. Precursor access through the inhibitor layer depends on molecular size, adsorption energetics, and dimerization. Larger species like TDMAA and DMAI are effectively blocked, while smaller ones such as TMA and AlCl3 reach exposed OH groups, leading to ALD reactions at these sites and selectivity loss. Although findings generally align with those from amorphous surface models, distinctions emerge: Amorphous models better reflect realistic OH densities and bonding diversity, capturing surface chemistry more accurately. Thus, while idealized (crystalline) models inform general SMI behavior, amorphous models are crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of AS-ALD selectivity and inhibitor mechanisms.

Here we report that the air stable molybdenum(0) complex 2 (Mo(CO)\u2083(cht)) serves as a highly efficient precatalyst when combined in a 1:1:1 ratio with tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy\u2083) and diphenyl phosphate (dpp). Under mild condi-tions (room temperature, 0.2\u202fmol\u202f% catalyst) the system delivers >95\u202f% conversion of 1 octene within 1 hour and Z:E ratios exceeding 20:1, outperforming our previously reported Mo(CO)\u2084(pip)(PCy\u2083) system. Systematic variation of the phosphine ligand reveals that symmetrical, bulky monodentate phosphines (PCy\u2083, P(p tolyl)\u2083) afford the optimal balance of activity and stereocontrol, whereas biaryl phosphines and the less sterically demanding P(Bn)3 give di-minished selectivity. Bidentate ligands (Xantphos, dppf) offer moderate conversion but do not match the 2/PCy\u2083 benchmark. The catalyst exhibits high turnover numbers (TON\u202f> 500) and retains Z selectivity across a broad sub-strate scope, including functionalized alkenes, epoxides, and heteroatom substituted olefins, albeit with reduced effi-ciency for strongly coordinating substrates. Kinetic investigations indicate a zero order dependence on alkene con-centration and an apparent second order dependence on total catalyst concentration, suggesting (a) partial catalyst inhibition or (b) involvement of two catalyst molecules in the same step.

Surface plasmon resonance analysis of this monoclonal species demonstrated sub-nanomolar (0.4 nM) antibody affinity for (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine-BSA bioconjugates and >150-fold selectivity in comparison to ketamine-BSA bioconjugates.

The SOCME derivatives are crucial physical quantities for capturing spin-vibronic coupling (SVC) effects associated with the induced SOC values via molecular vibrations. These SVC effects are often crucial for describing spin-forbidden or spin-flip processes, such as intersystem crossing (ISC), reverse ISC (RISC), and phosphorescence.   Previously, these derivatives could only be obtained through numerical differentiation. With our new implementation, they can now be computed based on analytical formulas, underpinning a significant advance toward more accurate and efficient dynamics simulations of spin-forbidden processes where SVC effects are vital.   Although developing the analytical nuclear derivative method is challenging, our implementation achieves substantial efficiency gains over numerical approaches, yielding up to a 36-fold speedup in benchmark tests. To showcase its applicability, we performed excited-state dynamics simulations based on thermal vibration correlation function (TVCF) formalism, incorporating SVC effects via SOCME derivatives, to predict RISC rate constants ($k_\\mathrm{RISC}$) for a large set of 126 thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules.

Moreover, many methods that overcome these limitations require specialized instruments or complex photochemistry typically not accessible in for those using standard lipidomics core facilities. We report a streamlined LC-MS/MS method that integrates N-(4-aminomethylphenyl)pyridinium (AMP)-based charge-switch derivatization with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) epoxidation to enable rapid and sensitive profiling of MUFA double bond positional isomers. Charge-switching enables enhanced detection of fatty acids while epoxidation improves chromatographic resolution and produces diagnostic fragmentation patterns upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), enabling precise localization of double bond positions. The optimized workflow achieves baseline separation of 16:1, 18:1, and 20:1 MUFA isomers within a 20-minute gradient, with reproducible retention times and consistent epoxide yields. The method also supports partial resolution of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and cis/trans isomers. Application to prostate cancer cell lines revealed distinct MUFA isomer profiles associated with aberrant fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) activity, including elevated n-10 and n-12 isomers in tumorigenic lines.

Here, we integrate in situ synchrotron X-ray computed nano-tomography, deep learning algorithm for image classification and Digital Volume Correlation-based analysis to uncover explicitly in three dimensions (3D) the lithiation behaviour of an 89 wt% Si anode in a high-energy-density 811NMC|Si cell.

Despite being discovered over 40 years ago, TS-1 is seeing an increase in use in the chemical industry. The catalyst structure, especially the Ti speciation and local environment in the zeolitic framework as well as the nuclearity of the Ti sites in the pristine zeolite material are still debated. The lack of molecular insight into this industrial relevant catalyst hampers the rational development of Ti-zeotype materials for more selective and sustainable oxidation processes, as well as potential new applications. Here, we address this issue by applying high field (28.2 T) 47/49Ti NMR and 17O NMR spectroscopy, for an array of TS-1 catalysts. For extra-framework-free TS-1 catalysts the Ti sites are associated with a distinct NMR signature \u2013 \u03b4iso (49Ti) = -900 ppm; CQ,0(49Ti) = 7.2 MHz; \u03b7Q,0 = 0.2 \u2013 which can be translated into structural parameters and a dominant first coordination environment according to an extended Czjzek model. The dominant Ti environment and its associated distribution was found to be independent of Ti weight loading, hinting towards similar Ti site across these samples. Combining high-field 47/49Ti NMR measurements of a hierarchical TS-1 in the hydrated and dehydrated state enabled to resolve an additional 47/49Ti NMR signatures, linked to extra-framework TiO2. Further, we develop a 47/49Ti NMR crystallography protocol aided by 17O NMR spectroscopy, benchmarked on a library of molecular models. This method is applied to identify the Ti sites present in both classical and hierarchical TS-1s, their distortion and location. Overall, this highlights the presence of mononuclear Ti framework sites in pristine Ti-zeotype structures. The observed distribution of the NMR parameters presumably originates from variations of mononuclear Ti framework in the first and second coordination sphere, likely due to the occupancy of several T-sites.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Compounds; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Costa", "abstract": "Halogenation is a commonly used strategy in drug design, not only due to the improvement of ADME properties of the compounds but also due to the ability of halogens to engage in halogen bonds (XBs) with biological targets such as proteins. The prediction of binding free energies (\\dGbind{}) is paramount in drug development, and, in this context, MM-PBSA calculations are a fast and commonly used method to achieve such a task. However, the usage of parameters to describe halogen anisotropy, such as extra-points of charge (EPs) that allow for the sampling of XBs, in MM-PBSA calculations is not common. Despite the recent development of optimized radii for halogens (r$_{opt}$), compatible with EP implementations, providing accurate hydration free energies at the PBSA level, the impact of these parameters in the calculation of binding free energies (\\dGbind{}) on protein-ligand complexes was yet to be tackled. In this work, we evaluated the performance of r$_{opt}$ in the estimation of \\dGbind{} values using MM-PBSA calculations for three sets of CK2 inhibitors. for which the experimental binding energies are available. We tested the performance of three EP models and standard RESP charges (i.e. when no EP is added), along with the effect of the internal dielectric constant ($\\epsilon$_{\\textnormal{in}}$) and sampling time. Our results indicate that, while directly using the X-ray structure does not typically lead to good results, relaxation through MM minimization, especially with $\\epsilon$_{\\textnormal{in}}$ = 4, leads to very decent correlations with the experimental values. Better correlations were achieved when adding configurational sampling via MD simulations, though, the Pearson coefficients varied substantially with sampling time and PBSA setup used, indicating that longer sampling times do not necessarily lead to higher correlations with experimental values. For all cases, optimized halogen radii (r$_{opt}$) leads to slight improvements whereas the description of the halogen anisotropy \\textit{via} and EP considerably improved the correlations for \\textbf{Set A} and \\textbf{Set C}. In addition, our findings suggest that $\\epsilon$_{\\textnormal{in}}$ has a considerable impact on the prediction of the \\dGbind{} values, with the usage of an EP being enough to account for polarizability for systems with several halogens, whereas for systems with fewer halogens, a higher $\\epsilon$_{\\textnormal{in}}$ might be needed. Moreover, the use of an EP allowed the sampling of XBs without impairing the sampling of hydrogen bonds (HBs).

Although ER-targeted photosensitizers offer an optimal solution by direct immune activation, their clinical translation is constrained by tumor hypoxia, poor accumulation, high diffusivity, dependence on a heavy atom for Type-I PDT, and an elusive mechanism underlying Type-I photosensitization. This work presents a structurally minimalistic, heavy-atom-free indole-based covalent photosensitizer (C2) that achieves Type I photosensitization via an unprecedented triplet-state hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. Remarkably, C2 enables N\u2013H homolysis to generate H\u2022 and indole radicals under ultra-low dose of (3.47 mW/cm2) green light. Intriguingly, C2 imparts excellent photostability, negligible dark cytotoxicity, and is capable of activating adaptive immune response towards dying tumor cells. Structurally, C2 integrates an indole donor with nitrile acceptors that also serve as electrophilic handles for covalent protein modification. A bis-trifluoromethylphenyl moiety directs selective ER localization, enabling localized ROS generation and sustained immune activation through targeted covalency. Under dark conditions, C2 was found to elicit autophagy as a cell survival mechanism to counteract the unfolded protein response (UPR); however, upon light exposure, C2 undergoes photosensitization to induce severe oxidative damage via generated singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radicals (O2\u2022-) within the ER, which leads to the massive releases of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) as a danger signal to ameliorate immunogenic cell death (ICD) and apoptosis.

We elaborate on seven categories of human reasoning activities and connect each to applications in chemical science and engineering: inductive, deductive, abductive, probabilistic, causal, analogical, and informal reasoning. For each, we describe approaches and tools for implementing in computational settings. We find the traditional categories of logic (induction, deduction, abduction) to be useful for interpreting a wide range of research activities in the computational sciences: curve fitting and supervised learning are induction, predicting from a curve or a supervised model is deduction, first-principles simulations are deduction, molecular structure elucidation is abduction, and inverse design is isomorphic to abduction. Experimental design incorporates themes of all three, but also stands apart because it modifies the data. We also survey the ``reasoning'' capabilities of large language models, and illustrate some challenges and opportunities in building systems that learn to reason. Central concepts that emerge include the dual nature of reasoning as propositional and step-by-step (the \"what\" and the \"how\"), the importance of appreciating syntax and semantics, and the centrality of abstraction in formal and informal contexts.

Six plant-derived phytochemicals\u2014Withanolide A, Ginkgolide B, Epigallocatechin gallate, Huperzine A, Baicalein, and Fisetin\u2014were thoroughly screened in silico and their interactions with the four main AD-associated proteins\u2014\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, tau protein, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)\u2014were examined in this study. High-resolution protein\u2013ligand complexes were used for docking investigations, and binding preferences were then captured by interaction fingerprinting and energy-based comparisons. Our findings show that different phytochemicals have different but similar binding landscapes, with some exhibiting stable binding orientations and good docking scores across a variety of targets. While Baicalein and Fisetin showed consistent interactions with BACE1, Epigallocatechin gallate and Withanolide A showed the best multi-target potential, especially against AChE and \u03b3-secretase. Comparative interaction heatmaps revealed hydrophobic interactions and conserved hydrogen bonds among catalytic residues, indicating that certain phytochemicals take advantage of structural weaknesses that AD proteins frequently share. Additionally, selectivity profiling demonstrated how particular drugs can distinguish between structural and enzymatic targets, providing information on both target-specific suppression and broad-spectrum modulation. The potential of phytochemicals derived from plants as scaffolding for multi-target AD treatments is highlighted by this integrated investigation.

Low-spin complexes 1 and 2 exhibit wavelength-dependent competition between photoreductive and redox-neutral ligand dissociation, and photooxidation to yield high-valent nitrenoid species. More specifically, excitation of 1 and 2 with visible light promotes photoreductive and redox-neutral ligand dissociation pathways, whereas excitation with UV light allows accessing the photooxidation channel via excited states that effectively funnel energy into azide-centered low-frequency vibrational modes. In contrast, the high-spin ground state of 3 with a significantly altered excited state manifold precludes photooxidation, instead favoring photoreduction and a unique acetato-ligand decarboxylation channel not observed in the low-spin analogs. In this first comparative in silico study of the three complexes, we show how the steric demands of the methylated ligand in 3 lead to a weakened equatorial ligand field resulting in a high spin ground state which in turn influences the excited state manifold. With a simple approach wherein we explore the evolution of the electronically excited states along specific vibrational modes, we find the onset of dissociative photooxidation paths in 1 and 2 which are absent in the high-spin species 3.

We examined the steady-state population dynamics for a Holstein-Tavis-Cumming Hamiltonian to illuminate the long-term polaritonic dynamics and lifetime of the exciton polariton in an optical cavity.  To enable a realistic description of polariton relaxation, cavity loss, and various exciton decay channels are included in the model.  We found that in the presence of weak but finite exciton loss, the apparent lifetime of the lower polariton coincides with the out-of-cavity exciton lifetime and is independent of cavity-matter detuning. This is a simple explanation for the experimentally observed lifetimes for exciton polaritons, and theoretically justifies the dark state reservoir hypothesis.  Further, if the upper polariton is initially populated, the system reaches the steady state very quickly, leading to single-exponential polariton relaxation. Starting from the lower polariton leads to a longer pre-steady-state time period, leading to double-exponential relaxation. Finally, we considered the effect of site orientational disorders and the exciton frequency disorderers. Under the collective limit, the effects of this disorder can be included in Fermi's golden rule population dynamics without explicit sampling. For the exciton energy disorders, numerical calculations are needed.

TabPFN, a recently introduced transformer-based tabular foundation model, enables accurate predictions on small datasets without task-specific retraining. Applying TabPFN to a variety of molecular data sets, we find that TabPFN performs on par with XGBoost in classification, but demonstrates clear and stable advantages in regression, with its strongest gains on small and medium datasets and under OOD evaluations.

All of these diseases are triggered by the same response, i.e., the hyperactivation of the protein caspase-1, which plays a very crucial role in our body's immune response (Molla et al., 2020; Dhani et al., 2021). Although current generic drugs have attempted to regulate inflammatory activity, all of them possess significant side-effects and lack long-term efficacy (Karimi et al., 2015; Dhani et al., 2021). We have selected 10 Ayurvedic plants and extracted compounds from each plant as these species have been employed traditionally to treat inflammation for centuries. Using advanced computer modeling software, we screened how well these natural molecules would bind to caspase-1, as well as other key inflammasome components such as ASC. We not only confirmed if they were a good fit but also examined if these molecules would be safe and well-tolerated by the human body with the assistance of specialized computer software such as SwissADME and ProTox-II. Most of the compounds showed high potential for inhibiting caspase-1 with good binding affinity and low toxicity. Some compounds even had the potential to act on more than one inflammatory pathway, and thus they could be more effective than single-target approaches. The findings suggest that traditional Ayurvedic medicine may hold the key to fighting modern-day inflammatory diseases. The study focuses on how traditional plant-based remedies can be scientifically evaluated systematically using modern scientific methods, closing the gap between drug discovery and traditional medicine. While this computational research is a great starting point, the subsequent task will be to test these compounds using laboratory experiments and eventually clinical trials.

An important general characteristic of porous liquids studied to date is that they exhibit very high gas solubilities. Here, we examine this aspect in more detail than has been done previously, in particular with regard to CO2 and CH4 solubility in the Type II porous liquid NoriaOEt@15C5 (15C5 = 15-crown-5). Whilst this porous liquid exhibits increased CH4 solubility compared to neat 15-crown-5, counterintuitively it actually exhibits equal or lower CO2 solubility than the neat solvent 15C5 at pressures above 1 bar. Molecular dynamics modelling reveals that although the pore space does provide a good binding site for gas molecules, there is an \u2018exclusion zone\u2019 around the pore space within which binding of CO2 molecules is disfavoured compared to binding within the bulk solvent. The unfavourable binding in this region arises from a number of effects, including i. steric exclusion from the bulky covalent framework of the NoriaOEt host, and ii. ordering of 15C5 solvent molecules in the solvation shell around the NoriaOEt. The first porous liquid to be based on the host Cryptophane-A, Cryptophane-A@Cyrene, was prepared in the expectation that the smaller framework bulk of Cryptophane-A compared to that of NoriaOEtshould result in a smaller exclusion zone. Correspondingly, this porous liquid did indeed exhibit improved CO2 uptake compared to its neat solvent, supporting the assertion that the exclusion zone is at least in part due to exclusion of gas from the framework of the host. Overall, the work provides a more sophisticated understanding of gas solubility in Type II PLs and suggests some additional design considerations for achieving high solubility for a given gas. It also shows that, as well as being able to increase the solubility of certain gases PLs can also conceivably be designed to suppress the solubility of gases under some conditions, which could be useful in tuning selective dissolution.

The objective is to disentangle between photoinduced and thermal polymerization using the same acrylate chemistry. In photochemical regime, local photopolymerization is observed at the apex of the nanotriangles with spatial control depending on the excitation polarization. For the thermal polymer, at moderate power, nanometer-sized polymer lobes are observed on the apexes of the triangle, their position depending also on the direction of polarization. At higher power, anisotropic melting of the gold within the gold nanotriangles was observed, also depending on incident light polarization. These results are compared with theoretical calculations using modified three-temperature model, to study the nanotriangle particles time and space heat distribution.

This study proposes the use of a cycle-consistent adversarial network to design multi-target directed ligands (MTDL-GAN), drugs designed to inhibit two primary AD target enzymes simultaneously; our targets of interest are acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3), each contributing to AD through distinct pathological mechanisms. Inhibitor libraries of the targets were curated from ChEMBL database and further characterised to represent each inhibitor domain, resulting in 69 AChE, 572 BACE1, and 246 GSK3 inhibitors.

Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a class of multimetallic alloys having a disordered structure, have emerged as highly stable catalysts for a diverse set of reactions. They typically consist of greater than four elements, allowing for greater tunability as compared to conventional bimetallic alloys. HEA catalysts are, therefore, promising candidates for the mitigation of sulfur poisoning. However, the combinatorial space of these multimetallic alloys is exceedingly complex, and therefore, comprehensive experimental investigation of all candidate HEAs, or computational design of HEAs using exclusively using first principles methods, is infeasible. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework that combines Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and a machine learning model (SlabGCN) to simultaneously predict sulfur adsorption energies and surface energies of binary, ternary, and quaternary alloys comprised of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Cu. Rapid screening of diverse surface structures and varying sulfur coverages using this framework permits construction of detailed surface phase diagrams at arbitrary compositions that elucidate evolution of sulfur poisoning as a function of reaction conditions. We explicitly study the influence of sulfur-induced surface segregation on HEA surface stability, which has not been previously explored, and we demonstrate that this influence decreases as the number of elements increases.

Using machine learning-accelerated molecular dynamics, combined with in situ X-ray diffraction and catalytic activity measurements, we show that the pristine material undergoes significant structural transformation upon exposure to ammonia at elevated temperature. Surface disorder, lithium mobility, and the progressive formation of amides and imides give rise to a reactive interface, where chromium centers mediate key redox processes.

Here, we resolve this ambiguity by demonstrating that S1 possesses charge transfer (CT) character. In solution, UV/vis absorption spectra show a strong transition below 375 nm, indicative of a locally excited (LE) state, while the CT (S1) transition remains optically quasi-dark due to its low oscillator strength. Direct excitation into S1 is inefficient; however, S1 becomes emissive following population from the higher-lying S2 (LE) state. By contrast, in the solid state, a pronounced absorption band appears beyond 400 nm is present, concurrent with a single emission band. Solution-phase dual emission is contrasted by the solid state\u2019s single emission. Time-resolved measurements reveal complex emission dynamics, including nanosecond prompt fluorescence and microsecond delayed fluorescence via TADF and triplet-triplet annihilation. Ultrafast spectroscopy (35-fs pump) uncovers coherent oscillations, attributing these to vibronic coupling between S2 (LE) and S1 (CT) states.

To address these challenges, I introduce SlaKoNet, a parameter optimization framework that learns SK-based Hamiltonian matrix elements across 65 elements of the periodic table using automatic differentiation. SlaKoNet is trained on density functional theory data from the JARVIS-DFT database using the Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (TBmBJ) functional, encompassing over 20000 materials. The framework achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.74 eV for bandgap predictions against experimental data, representing a reasoable improvement over standard GGA functionals (MAE = 1.14 eV) while preserving the computational advantages and physical interpretability of tight-binding methods. SlaKoNet demonstrates promising scalability with up to 8.4\u00d7 speedup on GPUs, enabling rapid electronic structure screening for materials discovery.

Here, we present a matched molecular pair study of twelve (12) 3-aryl-3-amino-oxetane and benzamide matched molecular pairs to assess their viability as isosteric replacements. Across the surveyed physicochemical properties (pH stability, solubility, lipophilicity, clearance, permeability), amino-oxetanes exhibited comparable profiles to their amide counterparts, while displaying improved solubility. The aryl amino-oxetane motif is more basic than an amide, yet offers significant reduction of amine basicity in comparison to the benzylamine. These findings support the potential of amino-oxetanes as amide replacements. However, analysis of crystal structures of the amino-oxetane and benzamide pairs highlights the conformational difference and alternative exit vectors available through introduction of the oxetane ring. Amino-oxetanes maintain both the H-bond acceptor and H-bond donor capabilities of analogous amides. Amino-oxetanes have significantly lower barriers to rotation, allowing for the potential to flexibly accommodate binding sites of interest. However, the preferred gauche conformation makes the torsion angle and exit vectors of amino-oxetanes more similar to sulfonamides, and on this basis amino-oxetanes provide better like-for-like topological replacements for sulfonamides rather than of amides.

Strong non-linear behavior is observed in the optical properties (bandgap bowing), leading to full visible-range light absorption for the chloride perovskites. Theoretical calculations at the density functional theory provides a framework for the process, shedding light into the electronic structure of the complex alloys. As a proof of concept, the alloys are implemented in a standard electrochemical cell fitted with a quartz window for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution testing, showing a clear photocatalytic response.", "date": "2025-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Alloys; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that clionene binds to a hydrophobic pocket at the IL-17A/IL-17RA interface via shape complementarity and \u03c0-interactions.

Compared to C- or N-only reduction reactions, convergent electrocatalytic processes to form value-added C\u2013N bond containing compounds have attracted increasing attention. Specifically, the exploration centers on the generation of oximes featuring C=N bonds, which are essential chemicals with widespread applications in the pharmaceutical and final chemical fields. Previous state-of-the-art work reported that formaldoxime, H2C=NOH, is electrosynthesized as a side product with a Faradaic efficiency of less than 6%. Here, we develop an integrated electrocatalytic platform to produce formaldoxime as the target product in a green solvent using metal-doped MoS2 as efficient catalysts. Notably, Fe-doped MoS2 significantly boosts the Faradaic efficiency and yield rate for H2C=NOH to a record-high 81% and 963 mmol\u2e33h\u20131\u2e33g\u20131, respectively. Kinetic isotopic effect studies and density functional theory computational analysis are carried out to unveil the electrocatalytic mechanism of this tandem C=N bond formation process and the importance of Fe dopants toward boosting the efficiency for C=N electrosynthesis. Upon incorporating into a flow electrolyzer, the yield rate for H2C=NOH electrosynthesis is drastically enhanced to 2630 mmol\u2e33h\u20131\u2e33g\u20131, almost tripled that obtained from H-cell setups. By tailoring the microenvironment of MoS2 nanosheets with Fe dopants, Fe-MoS2 exhibits an optimal binding affinity for NO2\u2013 than MoS2, thus enhancing substrate engagement and subsequently H2C=NOH formation in an aqueous medium. Overall, this work establishes a coherent strategy that upcycles low-cost C- and N-containing pollutants into valuable organonitrogens.

In contrast, this work considers an improved description of spin-orbit coupling by explicitly accounting for its relativistic origins. To this end, we extend the standard one-electron triatomic Jahn\u2013Teller model to the four-component relativistic domain. In our formulation, the electron is treated using the Dirac\u2013Coulomb Hamiltonian, while the nuclei remain non-relativistic, departing from the conventional for- mulation that incorporates the Pauli\u2013Breit spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation. The most striking difference between our relativistic model and the conventional one is the presence of vibronic coupling terms on the anti-diagonal of the diabatic potential matrix. These terms scale as 1/c2, and although nominally small, they can be amplified near avoided- crossings or in systems with heavy nuclei. The presence of these couplings implies that nuclear motion can affect the direction of the electron spin, a feature entirely absent in the conventional formulation. In the adiabatic representation, these additional couplings trans- late to non-Abelian characteristics of the non-adiabatic coupling matrix that persist even in the single-surface limit. Thus, our relativistic formulation reveals a more intricate interplay between the electronic spin and nuclear degrees of freedom. These model findings suggest that more spin-dependent effects may yet be uncovered through improved treatments of spin-orbit coupling.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we extend CIET theory to explicitly incorporate the electronic properties of the electrode to highlight the direct influence of electrode quantum physics on reaction kinetics. For electrocatalytic reactions limited by ion transfer, the modified formulation for \u201cion-coupled electron transfer\u201d (ICET) predicts Butler-Volmer kinetics with an exchange current density having an Arrhenius dependence on the electrode\u2019s work function times the anodic charge-transfer coefficient.

The theory predicts experimental trends in the rates of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid and aqueous iron redox reactions on different metals, while also capturing the volcano dependence on adsorption free energies. CIET theory thus provides a convenient basis for the design of electrocatalytic interfaces, combining insights from molecular simulations and experimental characterization.

Near-complete compensation of the CrIII and radical magnetic sublattices yields a weak but persistent magnetization extending above room temperature, establishing Cr(pyrazine)3 as a rare example of a low-defect, compensated ferrimagnet. The stability and simplicity of this molecule-based network make it an attractive platform for redox tuning, postsynthetic modification, and chemical vapor deposition, providing new opportunities to engineer strongly correlated behavior in molecular analogues of ReO3 and perovskite frameworks.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Magnetism; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Specifically, we show the degrees of influence of hydrogen bonding, dispersion, polar forces, proton donor/acceptor ratio, dipole induction, orientation parameter, and electrostatic interaction on the denaturation process of DNA. The absolute enthalpy values for DNA chemical denaturation are significantly lower than those in the thermal denaturation process (where values are positive). We show that the mechanism for reaching 50% DNA denaturation differs thermally and chemically. The thermal denaturation process mainly involves breaking hydrogen bonds via heating, while the chemical denaturation process involves replacing DNA's hydrogen bonds with denaturants. We show that hydrogen bonding is the dominant enthalpic contributor to the chemical denaturation of T4 bacteriophage DNA, and the proton-donor effect is the dominant mechanism for disrupting hydrogen bonds during DNA denaturation. The influence of this effect is two times greater than that of the proton-acceptor effect. We also show that the orientation component is another essential factor for DNA denaturation, which is part of the polar cohesion parameter. We show that the total cohesion parameter measured at 50% of DNA chemical denaturation represents the electrostatic (repulsion) forces that maintain the DNA helix.    The conclusions above were achieved using the cohesive energy density approach and corresponding equations based on the thermodynamics of the denaturation process. Independent experimental data, which we analyzed using our theory, support these conclusions.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We critically examine decades of developments and applications in ultrasonic evaluation techniques, assessing their relevance and identifying challenges specific to the high-concentration, non-Newtonian battery slurries. Key wave-slurry interaction mechanisms, including attenuation, wave speed, scattering, and guided wave propagation, are discussed in the context of characterising microstructural features (e.g. particle dispersion and agglomeration) and macroscopic rheological properties (e.g. viscosity and viscoelasticity).

We explored three distinct workflows for decoy selection: (1) random selection from extensive databases like ZINC15, (2) leveraging recurrent non-binders from highthroughput screening (HTS) assays stored as dark chemical matter, and (3) data augmentation by utilizing diverse conformations from docking results.

While acid-base official definitions have long remained untouched, in the last decade Supramolecular Chemistry provided many new additions to the IUPAC chemical vocabulary, e.g. halogen-, chalcogen, pnictogen-bond. The discussion moves from two distinct-yet-connected premises. First, the scope of supramolecular chemistry is addressed, and it is showed how existing official acid-base frameworks, essentially subtending to all donor-acceptor interactions - non-covalent ones included - are restrictive with respect to the general consensus and understanding of supramolecular interactions. Second, attention is brought to some underappreciated elements of novelty in the halogen- and post-halogen-bond IUPAC definitions, which, again, are not mirrored in current acid-base definitions. For these reasons, a quest is herein undertaken for an acid-base framework fully apt for supramolecular chemistry. This requires: first, reconsideration of both classical acid-base theories, including non-canonical ones (Lewis, Bronsted-Lowry, Arrhenius, Lux-Flood, SST, Usanovich, ionotropic definitions, etc\u2026); second, of modern notable post-Lewis restatements (Mulliken, Jensen, Huheey, Drago, etc\u2026).

In this study, the polymerization of 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl acrylate (1) using Lewis pair (LP) catalysts composed of B(C6F5)3 with PPh3 or PCy3 proceeded exclusively at the acryloyl moiety without cross-linking, thus retaining the methacryloyl group in the polymer side chain. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) computations revealed that the complete chemoselectivity of this reaction, preferentially occurring at the acryloyl moiety rather than the methacryloyl moiety, could be attributed to the conformational preference of the 1\u2013B(C6F5)3 complexes. Specifically, a highly electrophilic s-trans conformer formed upon coordination of the acryloyl group, whereas a much less reactive s-cis conformer formed upon coordination of the methacryloyl group. Additionally, acrylic copolymers of 1 bearing multiple methacryloyl groups were synthesized and employed as polymeric cross-linkers for the radical photopolymerization of ethyl acrylate (EA).

Herein, we have developed a hyper-steric engineering method, with the intentional increase of steric size of an amino acid exploited as a superior alternative handle for the targeted increase of catalytic cavity size and correspondingly, elevation in catalytic activity and/or enantioselectivity. In particular, a carboxylesterase has been engineered for the achievement of highly efficient acyl transfer to alcohols.

An emerging approach to these challenging separations is the self-assembly of lanthanide-based supramolecular cages. In this study, we establish design principles for self-assembly-driven rare-earth separations by investigating five ligands with distinct substituents (L-Cbz, L-propyl, L-alkene, L-benzyl, L-NH2), two polymer networks based on these ligands, and a monotopic fragment of the tritopic ligand structure. The ligand L-CBz shows a unique ability to separate lanthanides compared to the monotopic ligand and the polymer networks, underscoring the importance of cage self-assembly to separation performance. We found that L-Cbz forms M4L4 cages with middle-to-late rare-earth ions (Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Y3+, Ho3+, Lu3+) but a mixture of M2L2/M4L4 species with larger lanthanides (La3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+), while L-propyl forms cages with all tested rare-earth ions, with minor La2L2. Single crystal X-ray diffraction shows that pure L-Cbz precipitates from La2(L-Cbz)2 solution, suggesting that M2L2 is an unstable intermediate. In contrast, L-alkene and L-benzyl display size-dependent thresholds for cage formation, beginning at Sm3+ and Pr3+, respectively. Our results suggest that ligand-arm flexibility modulates these thresholds, providing design rules for L-based lanthanide separations. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, corroborated by DFT calculations, further reveal a correlation between M\u2013N bond length and a ligand\u2019s propensity for cage formation.

In a recent report with iron tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe\u2010TPP) catalysts bearing SCS amides, we found that pairing a more acidic SCS with a more acidic exogenous phenol acid provides the largest kinetic advantage for CO2 reduction to CO. Expanding on this precedent, we report a new series of Fe-TPP catalysts bearing highly acidic thioamides in the SCS (pKas of 17.5 \u00b1 0.1 to 18.7 \u00b1 0.1 in MeCN) \nand describe their catalytic activity in the presence of exogenous benzoic acid. Despite the uncommonly acidic conditions, we observe the selective 2e\u2013/2H+ reduction of CO2 to CO with minimal competitive H2 evolution or porphyrin decomposition. Decreases in SCS pKa continue to provide significant rate enhancements, and the catalyst bearing the most acidic thioamide displays kinetics (log(kcat) = 8.65 \u00b1 0.09) that are comparable to the leading molecular systems. Cyclic voltammetry, UV-Visible \nspectroelectrochemistry, kinetic analysis, and density functional theory show that the highly acidic SCS thioamide groups cause a change in catalyst speciation by promoting in situ protonation of the reduced iron porphyrin to form an iron phlorin. This iron phlorin is reduced to form a highly active and selective catalyst for CO2 reduction that operates at more positive potentials compared to traditional Fe\u2010TPP catalysts. This work therefore reveals a new role for the SCS in promoting beneficial changes to catalyst speciation and motivates further investigation of reduced metalloporphyrinoids.

We have developed a suite of plasma metering cards (PMCs) can divide microsampled plasma from whole blood into multiple sample zones, enabling the metering of reproducible volumes across a wide range of hematocrits (30\u201355%). Sample zones can be used individually or aggregated together for assays that may require higher volumes. Critically, we show that a four-zone PMC outperforms a commercial plasma microsampling card (ADx 100 Serum Separator Card) in terms of three key performance criteria: total recovered sample volume (25.2 vs. 20.2 \u00b5L), sampling precision (CVs of 9.2% vs. 25.8%), and plasma quality (69% vs 26% characterized as below mild hemolysis). These PMCs have the potential to support the rapid growth of decentralized clinical testing by empowering patients to self-collect high-quality dried plasma samples.

Here, we investigated the effects of Fenton oxidation on 5\u00b5m sized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide-12 (PA-12) MNPs using a multimodal characterization approach. Particles were treated with a Fenton reagent mixture (1 mM FeSO\u2084, 10 mM H\u2082O\u2082) at 40 \u00b0C for 2 hours to simulate oxidative conditions relevant to advanced water treatment and processes. Helium Ion Microscopy revealed that pristine PVC particles were aggregated and spherical, while oxidized PVC exhibited extensive aggregation and surface roughening. In contrast, PA-12 maintained a largely dispersed morphology post-oxidation, with moderate increases in surface texture. Dynamic light scattering measurements showed that the hydrodynamic diameter of PVC increased from 300\u2013400\u202fnm (pristine) to 700\u2013900\u202fnm (oxidized), with polydispersity index broadening and a new minor population emerging at 80\u201390\u202fnm, indicating aggregation and polymer fragmentation. Oxidized PA-12 showed a stable size profile with minor peak shifts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a 150.0% increase in surface oxygen on PVC (from 8.2% to 20.5%) and a 126.5% increase on PA-12 (from 11.3% to 25.6%). PVC showed a 17.1% reduction in chlorine and PA-12 experienced a 62.9% nitrogen loss, consistent with dechlorination and amide degradation. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed these chemical transformations, showing new bands for hydroxyl (O\u2013H stretch, ~3400\u202fcm\u207b\u00b9), C\u2013O (1000\u20131200\u202fcm\u207b\u00b9), and possible CO\u2082-related species (~2300\u202fcm\u207b\u00b9), alongside diminished amide II signals in oxidized PA-12. These findings demonstrate that Fenton oxidation induces significant morphological and chemical transformation in PVC and PA-12, with PVC exhibiting greater aggregation and surface restructuring, while PA-12 maintains greater colloidal stability but undergoes substantial surface oxidation and nitrogen loss. These oxidative transformations may enhance the surface reactivity, inflammatory potential, bioavailability, and ultimately influence the biological uptake, fate, and transport of MNPs in human exposure pathways, particularly through inhalation or ingestion. Our findings highlight the need to consider oxidation processes, such as those used in advanced water and wastewater treatment, in health risk assessments of plastic particles in both ambient and engineered settings.

However, no agreement on the best \u03b3-tuning procedure has been made when considering the solvent effect with implicit solvent models like the polarizable continuum model (PCM). To answer that question, this study created a diverse dataset with 997 937 molecules with experimental solution-phase UV/vis absorption spectra. Three \u03b3-tuning methods, the gas phase \u03b3-tuning (GP\u03b3T), the partial vertical \u03b3-tuning (PV\u03b3T), and the strict vertical \u03b3-tuning (SV\u03b3T), were evaluated for the \u03c9PBEh functional over the entire dataset.

Our findings revealed that the optimal \u03b3-values obtained by the PV\u03b3T and the SV\u03b3T are significantly smaller than the GP\u03b3T.

Beyond bath composition, the design of task-specific current protocols offers significant opportunities for tailoring the structural features of plated metals. In particular, the present work is motivated by the role of a Transient Solid\u2013Electrolyte Interphase (T-SEI) formed during fast electro-dissolution, which arises from local supersaturation and salt precipitation. The formation of such a T-SEI can remove the heterogeneous native passivation layer, expose fresh metal grains for electrochemical growth, and fundamentally alter electrodeposition morphology by promoting compact, uniform growth upon redeposition. Using Zn electroplating\u2014relevant to both battery anodes and corrosion-resistant coatings\u2014as a model system, we investigate a new T-SEI pulsed protocol for fabricating metallic coatings up to 100 mAh/cm2, and compare it against conventional direct current (DC), pulsed current (PC), and pulse-reversed current (PRC) methods. In the moderate-thickness regime (~5 mAh/cm2, a few microns), conventional protocols promote independent nucleation, producing small grains and increasing surface roughness due to the native passivation layer\u2014highlighting the importance of surface cleaning. In contrast, the T-SEI protocol exposes fresh grain surfaces, yielding larger grains and flatter morphologies, indicative of preferential growth of existing grains. Optimal deposition occurs at moderate current densities (~100 mA/cm2); excessively low currents (~1 mA/cm2) lead to mossy growth, while high currents (~1 A/cm2) cause dendritic growth. By contrast, in the ultra-high-capacity (UHC) regime (~100 mAh/cm2), even with optimized current densities, growth under all four methods becomes dominated by a small number of colossal grains with favorable orientations that exhibit high growth rates, resulting in large grain sizes and roughness metrics over an order of magnitude higher than in the thin-film regime. This roughness persists despite periodic reapplication of the T-SEI step, indicating that non-uniform surface passivation is no longer the dominant factor in the UHC regime. Nevertheless, UHC films plated with the T-SEI protocol exhibit excellent mechanical adhesion to the substrate, in contrast to the poor adhesion observed for films produced by other protocols. Taken together, these results highlight the critical role of initial surface passivation in the early and moderate-capacity stages of electroplating, where the T-SEI pulsed method serves as an effective de-passivation strategy; in the UHC regime, efforts should instead focus on suppressing anisotropic grain growth rates\u2014such as through the introduction of leveling agents\u2014to mitigate roughening.", "date": "2025-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We compare the computed GBCI spectra with those from the spin-flip complete-active-space (SF-CAS) method and experiment. These comparisons demonstrate that the bath-orbital relaxation in GBCI is crucial for accurately describing both the energies and wavefunctions of charge-transfer states. For L-edge XAS, GBCI accounts for the core-hole relaxation neglected in SF-CAS, leading to a uniform energy shift across the spectral bands. For 2p3d RIXS, GBCI produces an energy shift in the charge-transfer band that corrects the overestimated energy in SF-CAS. Moreover, GBCI improves the wavefunctions of charge-transfer states, thereby correcting the RIXS intensities overestimated by SF-CAS. Nevertheless, discrepancies with experiment indicate that additional dynamic correlation remains necessary.

Here, we introduce a unified theoretical framework that rigorously incorporates vibronic contributions through a phase-consistent Herzberg-Teller expansion of the hyperfine Hamiltonian. Applying this method to the FMNH\u2022-Cys\u2022 radical pair in AsLOV2, we demonstrate that second-order vibronic coupling significantly enhances the effective rates of hyperfine-mediated electronic transitions between spin states by up to eight orders of magnitude. Rates increase from\u223c 10^0 s\u22121 in the Franck-Condon limit to\u223c 10^8 s\u22121 on the singlet manifold and\u223c 10^7 s\u22121 on the triplet manifold. This brings the kinetics into the nanosecond regime, which is essential for enabling the microsecond-timescale photoadduct formation central to their biological function. Our analysis across Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt spectral profiles further reveals the critical sensitivity of these kinetics to environmental broadening, with the Voigt profile providing the most physically realistic rates.

Issues such as a pinch-off effect at the top of the via from PVD of the metal or the diffusion barrier-liner bilayer being too thick for the via dimensions means that a solution is required for interconnect downscaling. The proposed solution is a single combined barrier and liner material that can be grown using PEALD. The currently used barrier material is TaN and ruthenium can be used as a liner layer between TaN and copper. In this paper the reactivity of ruthenium precursor RuO4 on NHx-terminated \u03b5-TaN (110) surfaces was examined. We first report on the possible surface terminations of \u03b5-TaN (110) post the N2/H2 plasma pulse. Reaction energies were endothermic after H2O elimination for surfaces terminated with additional Ta-NHx terminations. This shows that the TaN surface can be treated with just hydrogen plasma and surfaces such as 1 ML N-H and 0.5 ML N-H/0.5 ML N-H2 \u03b5-TaN (110) can promote ligand elimination. RuO4 adsorption along with H2O formation via hydrogen transfer from the surface was highly exothermic and the risk of oxygen contamination is minimized by the favourable interaction of hydrogen plasma to remove remaining oxygen from the surface.

These couplings become singular, and thus dominant, at conical intersections, and manifest in topological characteristics of the electronic states. However, their role extends further: the non-adiabatic couplings, appearing as pseudo-magnetic forces in a semi-classical setting, provide a mechanism that enables angular momentum exchange between electrons and nuclei in the adia- batic electronic basis that otherwise assumes infinite nuclear masses. In this two-part tutorial review, we explore the additional complexity that emerges by incorporating electronic spin and spin\u2013orbit coupling into this framework.

This study addresses this challenge by developing a predictive, density functional theory (DFT)-informed machine learning (ML) framework that maps complex degradation networks and quantitatively assesses associated environmental risks. Using tetracycline as a model compound, we constructed an unprecedented reaction network of over 120 steps and 9,533 elementary reactions. To overcome the computational bottleneck of evaluating this network, an ML model was trained on DFT data to rapidly predict Gibbs free energy changes, enabling the first large-scale, network-wide thermodynamic feasibility assessment. This hybrid DFT-ML approach was successfully validated against the complex pathways of ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, a systematic pathway scoring system was developed to rank routes by integrating Diversity, Ecotoxicity, Biodegradability, and Feasibility of pathway (DEBF). Crucially, our analysis reveals that several TPs, particularly hydroxylated, amide ketone, and aminated species, pose a heightened risk of promoting antibiotic resistance. DFT-based docking studies confirm that these TPs form strong hydrogen bonds with key residues (Ile339A, Lys337A, Asp363A) in the tetM protein, potentially enhancing its binding affinity and ARG induction.

The mechanism has been investigated through computational and experimental means. Both the Os- and Ir-catalyzed reactions proceed through a [2 + 2 + 1] cyclization of the corresponding bis-olefin complex, to give an experimentally observed metallacyclopentane intermediate.

Both the greater reactivity and the different chemoselectivity of the Os system versus the Ir system are attributable to C H elimination by the \ud835\udf0e-\ud835\udf0b-but-3-enyl hydride having a much lower barrier for Os then for Ir. This much lower barrier to C\u2013H elimination for Os relative to Ir is unexpected, given that the thermodynamic driving force for elimination from Os is much smaller than that for Ir.

HER mass activities for the Ptn/HOPG electrodes were between 2 and >10 times higher than that for the surface monolayer of bulk Pt, and also substantially higher than those for Ptn deposited on several other supports. Thus, high activity is a property of the Pt-C structures formed by Ptn \u2013 HOPG impacts, rather than simply being due to high Pt surface availability. The physical properties of the Ptn/HOPG electrodes were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low energy He+ ion scattering, and a variety of electron microscopy methods.  Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamic (BOMD) trajectories were used to simulate the Ptn \u2013 HOPG impacts, revealing the types of structures formed at different energies, then DFT was used to simulate different HER pathways for the most important Ptn-carbon structures. Experiment and theory lead to the following mechanism.  For low deposition energies, the Ptn deposit onto the HOPG surface with sticking probability below unity, and aggregate at defects and steps.  With increasing deposition energy, the sticking probability initially decreases, then approaches unity as subplantation and carbon defect creation increase the Pt-surface binding.  The rate-limiting barriers for HER at the structures formed in the trajectories were found to be low and weakly dependent on the Ptn size, consistent with the observation of high HER activities that were weakly size dependent.

The activity of the larger aggregated structures form at low energies was lower, but still substantially higher than the surface monolayer of bulk Pt.

Conventional quantitative structure\u2013property relationship (QSPR) models often provide limited accuracy and fail to yield mechanistic insights into the molecular origins of solubility. Here, we introduce an interpretable machine learning framework that integrates predictive modeling with explicit physicochemical reasoning, aiming not only to forecast solubility but also to uncover its molecular determinants.\n\nA high-quality dataset of 9,982 compounds was curated from multiple public sources, filtered for standardized conditions (25 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C, pH 7 \u00b1 1) and outlier removal. For each compound, 26 molecular descriptors were initially computed, spanning electronic, topological, and thermodynamic features. After redundancy reduction, 20 chemically meaningful descriptors were retained. Benchmarking of 18 algorithms identified tree-based ensemble methods as optimal, with LightGBM selected for its strong balance of accuracy and computational efficiency. The optimized model achieved R\u00b2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 1 logS unit on a held-out test set, outperforming previously reported approaches.\n\nInterpretability analyses provided mechanistic clarity. SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) identified the octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (LogP) as the most influential descriptor, contributing nearly 40% of predictive variance. This directly reflects the hydrophobic effect, where transferring non-polar molecules into water incurs an entropic penalty from ordering solvent molecules. Topological polar surface area (TPSA) was the second most important factor, highlighting the enthalpic benefit of polar interactions and hydrogen bonding. Partial dependence plots revealed nonlinear threshold effects: solubility declines steeply when LogP exceeds ~3.5, aligning with Lipinski\u2019s \u201crule of five,\u201d while TPSA shows diminishing returns beyond ~100 \u00c5\u00b2, where intramolecular hydrogen bonding may shield polar groups.\n\nAdditional features such as molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, and molecular complexity (BertzCT index) were identified as negative correlates of solubility. These findings are consistent with entropic losses upon dissolution and the unfavorable packing of bulky, branched structures in aqueous environments. Local SHAP explanations further elucidated molecule-specific predictions: for caffeine, solubility arises from balanced polarity and moderate hydrophobicity, whereas for fenbendazole, high LogP and large molecular size dominate its insoluble profile despite moderate TPSA.\n\nThis study establishes a robust, interpretable framework that bridges machine learning with physical chemistry. By quantifying the roles of hydrophobicity, polarity, molecular size, flexibility, and complexity, our model not only predicts solubility with high accuracy but also recapitulates established thermodynamic principles.

Computational evidence shows that characterizing formations and scissions of chemical bonds through parametric polynomials derived from catastrophe theory (CT) is critical to gaining further insights into chemical bonding and reactivity. However, most of the insofar application of BET conducts this association without considering the robust mathematical basis supporting BET. Consequently, misinterpretations and incorrect results have arisen because of the inherent ambiguity of such an oversight. The proper utilization of BET involves the calculation of the Hessian matrix at potentially degenerate critical points of the electron localization function (ELF) and measuring their relative distance along a reactive coordinate. This methodical approach is tailored to incorporate key CT concepts into the original BET framework, thereby recovering the rigor of the latter. The systematic application of these steps has led to various unexpected outcomes, including the correlation between electron density symmetry and CT\u2019s polynomials, the interplay between these polynomials and the heterolytic/homolytic character of bond breakages, and a CT-based model for scaling bond polarity. These discoveries underscore the relevance of adhering to concepts and highlight that rationalizing electron reorganizations using CT\u2019s functions is far from a technical subtlety.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, lithium dendrite penetration and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation hinder stable cycling at high current densities. This work presents a synergistic strategy to address these challenges by combining mild sintering of LPSCl pellets with the deposition of a lithium fluoride (LiF) passivation layer on 50 \u00b5m thick lithium metal. Optimized sintering at 80\u202f\u00b0C improves surface uniformity and densifies the LPSCl pellets, reducing porosity and increasing ionic conductivity.

We show that ZnGa2O4 exhibits a dispersive conduction band minimum with a low effective mass (0.27 m0), supporting phonon-limited electron mobilities approaching 500 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. However, impurity scattering dominates across experimentally relevant carrier concentrations, limiting the achievable mobility to values consistent with state-of-the-art measurements.

Their remarkable chemical diversity makes their identification by untargeted LC-MS/MS analyses challenging. To date, effective solutions for their characterization remain unavailable.  Here we present the first implementation of the recently refined Ion Identity Molecular Networking (IIMN) methodology to map the chemical space of oxylipins, together with a systematic evaluation of factors that hinder accurate annotation in MS/MS datasets. Our approach leverages recent enhancements to the mzmine software, offering an alternative GNPS-independent method of connecting oxylipins in molecular networks. We established a high-quality MS/MS spectral library from 67 commercially available oxylipin standards using LC-MS data obtained in data-dependent acquisition mode. Detailed characterization of ion species generated during electrospray ionization reduced network complexity. Across configurations, the modified-cosine algorithm proved most effective for separating full-length from cyclized forms and for clustering oxylipins through structurally coherent relationships. Application of the IIMN workflow to mouse spleen extracts, in combination with our in-house and publicly available experimental MS/MS libraries, enabled the organization of oxylipins into molecular families, facilitating their structural characterization. Although manual curation remained necessary for certain co-eluting isomers and ambiguous fragments, the IIMN-based approach significantly improved network interpretability and understanding. Overall, this study establishes IIMN as a robust bioinformatic tool for decoding oxylipin diversity and provides a successful strategy for mapping and characterizing these mediators in biological matrices.

The photophysical properties of the compounds were characterized by UV\u2013vis absorption, fluorescence, and phosphorescence spectroscopic measurements, and the electrochemical behavior was monitored using cyclic voltammetry. The electron-donating and \u03c0-extended substituents induced pronounced bathochromic shifts in absorption and emission, consistent with the narrowing of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, whereas strong electron-withdrawing groups or 6-methoxy substitution caused a slight hypsochromic shift. Nitrogen incorporation and electron-withdrawing substituents stabilized the LUMO, affording more positive ground- and excited-state reduction potentials.

Our predictions, driven by machine learning models and climate projections under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, highlight several key trends. The total water use for cotton production is dominated by irrigation water and is expected to increase slightly by 2049 because of climate change. The current pattern of lower irrigation needs in the East and higher needs in the West will continue. Nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen fertilizer application are significantly influenced by wet and dry climate conditions. These emissions constitute a major source of greenhouse gas emissions for cotton lint production, representing approximately 28% of total emissions under current practices. Regarding energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the declining trend in electricity and diesel usage since 2000 highlights the benefits of technological advancements in agricultural machinery and irrigation systems. The scenarios proposed in this study replace diesel with electricity to power farm equipment, not only meet cost constraints but also provide environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 24% to 32% by 2050.

In this perspective, we apply explainable machine learning to a publicly available dataset of 28 LIBs to quantify the contributions of key cycling parameters on degradation as a function of SOH. Our analysis reveals that in the early stages of life (SOH 1.00 - 0.90), degradation is primarily governed by temperature, likely due to the abundance of available electrolyte. At later stages (SOH 0.875 - 0.80), charging current emerges as the dominant driver, reflecting the growth of the solid\u2013electrolyte interphase (SEI), electrolyte depletion, and associated effects such as Joule heating. These stage-dependent findings align with prior mechanistic studies and demonstrate how combining small-data ML with interpretability can yield new insights into degradation pathways.

The new functional is an improvement of our previously developed MC23 functional; it is obtained by adding a more diverse set of databases with electronic excitation energies to the training set. MC25 has improved accuracy for the excitation energies with a mean unsigned error, averaged over same-spin and spin-change excitation energies, of 0.14 eV. Combining this with its approximately-as-good-as-MC23 performance for ground-state energies means it has the best overall accuracy on the combination of both ground-state energies and excitation energies of any available on-top functional. It has more accuracy on both excitation energies and ground-state energies than 18 other methods that we tested on the same data. In addition to developing MC25, we also developed a local functional using the same set of databases and optimization algorithm. Although the local functional, which is named MC25L, is not as accurate as MC25, it is still more accurate than the three other local on-top functionals that are tested in this work (tPBE, tM06-L, and t\u03c4-HCTH).

PTZ-Dipp-(Bu)SO2B contains an additional n-butyl group attached to the SO2B core. In dilute low-polarity solutions, both molecules show a yellow-orange photoluminescence with \u03bbem = 561-588 nm, and red to near-infrared (NIR) PL in neat films, \u03bbem = 680-706 nm. The PL of PTZ-Dipp-(Bu)SO2B is systematically blue shifted in respect to PTZ-Dipp-(Bu)SO2B thanks to a ~0.1 eV difference in LUMO energy caused by \u03c3-donor properties of the n-butyl group. These molecules were successfully applied as luminescent dopants to organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although both compounds have similar electronic structures and exhibit comparable \u03a6PL in dilution, the PTZ-Dipp-(Bu)SO2B is a significantly more efficient luminophore in solid state than its counterpart. The OLED external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 7% load is 12.2% and in neat film is 1.0% for PTZ-Dipp-(Bu)SO2B, while the same values for PTZ-Dipp-SO2B are 5.4% and 0.4%, respectively. The difference in \u03bbem or \u03bbEL between the two emitters is too small to explain the differences in EQE exclusively with the effects of the energy gap law. Instead, we believe that the n-butyl group disrupts the environment around the molecule through locally lowering the polarity and disturbing formation of aggregates in solid state. Due to the similarity with behaviour observed earlier by some of the current authors and associated with solvation of the emitter with hexane molecules we decide to name this effect as internal solvation effect.", "date": "2025-09-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Dyes and Chromophores; Optical Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this context, poly(amino esters) derived from N acylated-1,4-oxazepan-7-ones (OxPs) emerge as promising candidates in the development of new and degradable amphiphiles for hydrogel preparation and delivery platform formulations. Here, the synthesis of amphiphilic triblock copolymers by ring-opening copolymerization (ROCP) of OxP monomers with various pendant chains is reported. Copolymerization reactions using organocatalysts and 1,4 benzenedimethanol (DiOH) as a bifunctional initiator afforded neutral P(OxPMe) b P(OxPBn) b P(OxPMe) and cationic P(OxPNH2+) b P(OxPBn) b P(OxPNH2+) amphiphilic triblock copolymers with controlled molar masses and narrow dispersities (\u0110 \u2264 1.21). By tuning the reaction conditions, a panel of polymeric materials with various block lengths and compositions was synthesized. The study of their self-assembly in water revealed the formation of nanostructures, including worm-like or spherical morphologies, which were correlated to the macromolecular structure of the amphiphile. In addition, hydrogel formation using the block copolymers has demonstrated that modulation of the copolymer composition and concentration enables control over the macroscopic properties of the hydrogels.

Recently, Pinski and Neese developed fully analytical nuclear energy gradients for second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) using pair natural orbitals (PNOs) based on projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) [J. Chem. Phys. 148, 031101 (2018); J. Chem. Phys. 150, 164102 (2019)]. Here, we present an analytical nuclear gradient method based on the PNO-MP2 theory using orthonormal and non-redundant localized virtual molecular orbitals (LVMOs) instead of conventional PAOs. Compared with PAO-based approaches, our method exhibits two main differences. First, constraints from the construction of LVMOs are incorporated into the Lagrangian, requiring the solution of an additional Z-vector equation---the coupled-perturbed virtual localization (CP-VL) equation. Second, owing to the orthonormality of the LVMOs, the derivatives of the PNO coefficients with respect to both the MO coefficients and the nuclear coordinates vanish. The latter property significantly simplifies the formulation of analytical energy gradients. Additionally, to mitigate the technical complexity of deriving gradient formulas with the PNO treatment, we used an extended scheme implemented in our automatic derivation program. Benchmark calculations on phenylalkane chains, docetaxel, and a host\u2013guest complex demonstrated high computational scalability of our nuclear gradient implementations, additionally confirming that the computational effort required to solve the CP-VL equation is relatively minor. We illustrated that the energy gradients as functions of nuclear coordinates are smooth and that the errors in the predicted structures are small.", "date": "2025-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we show that graph-theoretic representations of the physical phenomena within unit operations can help navigate and decompose equations to systematically identify alternative approaches for fast and robust numerical solutions. Specifically, we present a graph-theoretic abstraction that captures the connectivity between the model variables/equations and use this abstraction to group variables/equations into fundamental phenomena.

Large scale pilot trials of IPSE systems have obtained approximately 0.7 kg.m-2.h-1 of purified water at 1 kW.m-2 solar illumination, while a commercial PV-RO seawater desalination plant running with commercially available photovoltaic panels would achieve approximately 65 kg.m-2.h-1 of water at 1 kW.m-2 solar illumination.

This protocol provides an integrated experimental and computational framework to investigate the effect of H3K9-methylated heterochromatin on spontaneous mutation rates in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We utilize a tetracycline-inducible system that switches a reporter gene, ura4, between euchromatic and heterochromatic states within a single isogenic clone during one experiment. Mutation rates are estimated using a precision-enhanced 96-well fluctuation assay, which improves reproducibility and minimizes variability by enabling side-by-side comparison of chromatin states. For data analysis, we developed a new R script that requires only two inputs\u2014mutant counts (r) and total cell numbers (Nt)\u2014and implements a non-recursive Ma\u2013Sandri\u2013Sarkar maximum likelihood estimator (MSS-MLE) with bootstrap-derived confidence intervals, optimized for large datasets.

Expected results demonstrate quantifiable mutation rate differences between H3K9-methylated heterochromatin and euchromatin states.

A fundamental challenge lies in the inherent biases of public biochemical databases. These databases predominantly catalog valid enzyme activities, rarely include negative instances, and report quantitative catalytic parameters for only a relatively small subset of enzymes. Such limitations pose a major obstacle to supervised learning of enzyme catalytic properties. One existing approach for model training involves generating synthetic negative enzyme--activity pairs by recombining existing enzymes and their activity information, particularly substrates or chemical reactions, that were not originally associated within datasets. However, it remains unclear whether generated negative examples are truly inactive or merely unobserved active instances. To build a model that captures functional properties across diverse enzyme families while avoiding reliance on negative examples, this paper introduces a self-supervised domain adaptation methodology for pretrained protein language models solely on positive enzyme-reaction pairs. The enzyme representations obtained from the adapted protein language model achieved superior or at least competitive performance in comparison with those from an existing method that rely on synthetic negative examples, in both the turnover number prediction task for natural reactions of wild-type enzymes and activity prediction task for family-wide enzyme-substrate specificity screening datasets.

The required molecular information is inferred in a topological fashion, with generic topological bond lengths, based on experimental covalent radii of the contained elements. The model is parameterized on the basis of atom types, that encode the local atomic coordination environment up the nearest bonded neighbors. Consequently, the model is geometry-independent, requiring only a graph representation of the molecular bonds, which is easily retrieved due to the explicit bond definitions in non-reactive force fields. Therefore, by sacrificing the dependence of the atomic charges on changes in the system's geometry, the proposed model avoids the computation of distance matrices, increasing the overall performance. By parameterizing the model on three different atomic encoding levels of increasing parametric resolution, the model's accuracy is systematically increased. To this end, a global optimization scheme is employed, in which the model parameters of atomic width, electronegativity and hardness, are trained to reproduce a set of reference charges. These, were obtained from the QMOF database, which hosts electronic structure properties computed for over 20000 MOFs and related materials. Curated subsets of the QMOF database were generated depending on the employed atom encoding scheme with a balanced atom type incidence. These subsets were used for the training and testing of the new model, containing atomic reference charges of around 10000 MOFs for selected metallic species and with comparable relative atom type distributions between the sets. The model is able to predict charges with an accuracy below 0.02\u202fe for the most detailed atom typing scheme for a wide chemical space without the need to to correct for charge neutrality.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Upon application of AMF to electroconductive FeSA:rGO, AMF-induced charge separation led to formation of low-lying electron holes (EHOMO = 2.41/2.43 eV) and excited electrons (ELUMO = -0.65/-0.57 eV), which triggered AMF power-dependent magneto-voltaic and magneto-electric activity (0.19-1.56 V and 0.15-0.62 mA). In the presence of H2O2, these AMF-induced low-lying electron holes in FeSA:rGO promoted oxidation of Fe3+ resting state leading to transient formation of a high-valent Fe4+ species, which served as a critical intermediate for magneto-catalytic oxidation of H2O2 and evolution of O2. Furthermore, kinetic study unveiled that FeSA:rGO concentration, H2O2 concentration, and AMF power played key roles in controlling the rates for FeSA:rGO-mediated magneto-catalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

In this work we first assess the simplest phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) model, which uses restricted Hartree-Fock trial wavefunctions, for representative test sets of noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, and dispersion (S66, A24, S22, and X31).

Interstitial fluid (ISF) offers a relatively painless alternative to blood as a reliable source of biomarkers for routine monitoring. In this study, we introduce the combination of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (\u00b5PAD) integrated within a 3D printed hollow microneedle platform with a vacuum-based suction system for reliable sampling and multiplexed quantification of inflammatory and stress biomarkers in the ISF, namely interleukin 6 (IL-6), glucose, and lactate. The microneedles are 3D printed offering high resolution structures for penetration and sampling. In our \u00b5PAD, a dry-binding protein assay is employed for colorimetric IL-6 determination, reducing the use of expensive reagents like antibodies and simplifying the analysis procedure. Correspondingly, glucose and lactate monitoring are based on the oxidation reaction with their enzymes and potassium iodide (KI). The variation of the colour changes in each detection zone is proportional to these biomolecule levels. With these characteristics, the linear range of our \u00b5PAD sensor is from 10.0 to 30.0 pg mL-1 for IL-6 and from 1.25 to 15.0 mmol L-1 for both glucose and lactate. Additionally, detection limits (LODs) of 2.0 pg mL-1, 0.25 mmol L-1, and 0.32 mmol L-1 for IL-6, glucose, and lactate, respectively, were obtained. By integrating \u00b5PAD into the hollow microneedle platform, the workflow begins with positioning the device into the skin. The interstitial fluid is sampled reliably through the hollow microneedles using a handheld vacuum pump causing it to flow into the \u00b5PAD, where the colorimetric reactions are initiated. Studies were performed in tissue models of agarose gel and ex vivo pig skin samples revealed the recovery range of 96.0-108.0% with the highest RSD of 4.72%. This demonstrates the remarkable reliability and precision of the proposed technique. Consequently, the proposed device offers a first of its kind inexpensive wearable platform that integrates a complete workflow from sample acquisition to multiplexed sensing and visual readout without the need for trained personnel or expensive instrumentation. The device also holds significant potential as a wearable device for monitoring and management of chronic conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Precise kinetic measurements and operando spectroscopy were employed to elucidate the interplay between the formation of surface intermediates and the transformations of the surface sites, leading to the occurrence of a frustrated phase transition that can potentially define the catalyst activity under different reaction conditions. Our work specifically highlighted the effect of partial cobalt substitution into the perovskite\u2019s structure on improving the activity of the reference iron-containing lanthanum-based perovskite. In this regard, modulation-excitation spectroscopy coupled with phase-sensitive detection (MES-PSD) and near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) were employed at different temperatures to elucidate the multifaceted role of cobalt in promoting the carbonate-mediated pathway for CO oxidation. For LFO, kinetic and theoretical analyses confirm a pure Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism mediated by bidentate carbonates, yielding low activity but high stability. In contrast, LFCO exhibits higher activity (despite slight deactivation) through a dual MvK/Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) pathway. Monodentate carbonates act as low-temperature and unstable intermediates, with LFCO accelerating carbonate-to-CO\u2082 conversion via enhanced surface oxygen mobility. The temperature also dictates mechanistic shifts: LH dominates below 170\u00b0C, while MvK prevails above this threshold. Additionally, operando NAP-XPS reveals this transition coincides with cobalt reduction, iron oxidation, and frustrated phase transitions that activate carbonate intermediates. In our catalytic systems, cobalt serves as the primary active site, while lanthanum stabilizes the perovskite structure and surface carbonates, and iron maintains charge balance.

This work combines density functional theory calculations with microkinetic modeling to systematically explore propane to propene conversion over W(VI) dioxo species, both with and without catalyst reduction, along with W(VI) mono-oxo pathways. The mono-oxo W(VI) species is observed as the most promising catalytic site for propane dehydrogenation due to its greater reactivity in facilitating effective C\u2013H activation with a lowest effective barrier of 2.76 eV at 823 K. Microkinetic analysis revealed that the initial C\u2013H cleavage of propane is the rate-determining step for the dehydrogenation pathway over W(VI) mono-oxo species. In addition, microkinetic calculations predicted a high TOF on the order of 10-3 s-\u00b9 for propane dehydrogenation over W(VI) mono-oxo species at the reported olefin metathesis catalyst activation temperature 700 \u02daC (973 K). As the dioxo W(VI) species (A0) is believed to be the active site for propene metathesis, these DFT results strongly suggest that instead of using separate catalysts, a single WOx/SiO2 catalyst may be sufficient for converting propane into propene efficiently via high-temperature pretreatment of the catalyst with propane prior to propene metathesis at a lower temperature.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we combined the advantages of M-N4-C site and sulfur vacancies (VS) on the MoS2 basal plane (MoS2-VS) to investigate the eNRR catalytic behavior within the interlayer space of Mn-N4-C/MoS2-VS bilayers, where TM atoms are doped at the S vacancy sites (denoted as M-N4-C/MoS2-TM), using first-principles simulation.

More importantly, during the catalytic process, switching of the active sites between the S vacancy and Mn-N4 within the interlayer space for key intermediate binding significantly lowers the energy barrier of potential-determining step, thereby facilitating N2 reduction to NH3.

However, in the context of colloidal synthesis, the mechanism by which these nanoparticles form remains unexplored. Here, we employ in situ X-ray diffraction and photon-in photon-out spectroscopic studies to elucidate the reaction pathway of Fe(acac)3 and thioacetamide (TAA) in benzyl alcohol (BA), which yields crumpled Fe3S4 nanosheets. Using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), we identify FeS (mackinawite) as a crystalline intermediate whose anisotropic growth, driven by its layered crystal structure, governs the crumpled nanosheet-like morphology of Fe3S4 (greigite) through a topotactic transition. By performing high-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption near edge structure (HERFD-XANES) spectroscopy, we show that the formation of Fe3S4 proceeds through a multi-step mechanism involving two intermediates. Supported by density functional theory (DFT), we find that Fe(acac)3 is initially reduced in the presence of TAA in BA, forming a molecular intermediate [Fe(acac)2(BA)2], which subsequently transforms into FeS and ultimately into Fe3S4. Complementary valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy (vtc-XES) reveals the evolution of the coordination environment from Fe-O to Fe-S throughout the reaction. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism of Fe3S4 nanosheets in solution, shedding light on how crystal growth dynamics and electronic structure evolution dictate their unique crumpled nanosheet morphology.

Chemical upcycling converts low-value waste plastics into higher-value products. Here, polyethylene (PE) upcycling is accomplished using acid-only activation of PE (PEAA), thus eliminating costly and toxic organic solvents. Acid mixtures of chlorosulfuric acid (CSA) and sulfuric acid (SA) were used to effectively sulfonate PE, allowing subsequent facile depolymerization. Molecular deconstruction of sulfonated PE using H2O2 in the presence of Fe(III) catalyst achieved molar yields of C2-C4 diacids exceeding 40\\% (based on estimates of acids generated from sulfonates). The sulfonation step using PEAA is hypothesized to follow a shrinking core mechanism (SCM) in which PE particles quickly reach a saturated state in the outer sulfonated layer as CSA diffuses radially inward. This proposed mechanism is supported by the fact that, regardless of the extent of sulfonation, similar molar yields of products and ratios of liberated carbon to sulfur are observed. Modeling and experimentation show that deviations from the SCM occur by lowering the Damk\u00f6hler number (Da) or increasing CSA solubility in PE.

Deep learning has been used in these prediction tasks for a wide variety of molecular properties, and the availability of user-friendly, open-source software implementing such architectures has democratized access to these methods. chemprop is one of the most popular examples of such software in this field. It implements a directed message-passing neural network (D-MPNN) architecture, enabling end-to-end learning of molecular properties directly from molecular graphs without the need for hand-crafted descriptors or fingerprints. The original chemprop release was intended for use primarily via a command line interface, rather than programmatic use via a Python API. As the field has evolved, the need for increased modularity and usability in Python-based workflows has become clear. We have completed a ground-up rewrite of chemprop that addresses this need, providing improvements in speed, extensibility, and overall user experience. We have conducted extensive benchmarking to demonstrate algorithmic parity with the original implementation, while seeing improvements of about a factor of two in execution time and a factor of three in memory usage. chemprop v2 effectively scales to multiple GPUs, which enables training more and larger models. chemprop v2 also includes some new features.

However, these analyses do not often lead to mechanism-based interpretations, such as validating a hypothesis for a key reaction phenomenon. In this study, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models for dispersity (\u0110) are constructed using reaction representations based on a putative reaction mechanism. These models are built on nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization reaction data sets collected from the literature. The proposed reaction representation consists of 17 descriptors based on the quasi-equilibrium reaction of forming dormant species, including the stability of mediator radicals. The tendency for the decomposition of the mediator radicals is quantified with a single descriptor. Excluding an unstable mediator radical based on this descriptor significantly increases the prediction accuracy for a poly(n-butyl acrylate) data set. Removing reactions proceeding on different reaction paths contributes to more accurate QSPR-based \u0110 prediction models, and also to clearer model interpretation in light of the mechanism assumption.

Two-photon cross-sections are intrinsically small, consistent with the asymmetric substitution pattern.

To this end, high-energy ball milling is the most versatile synthesis method for disordered rocksalt cathode materials, and many of the best-performing compounds with high fluorine content have only been synthesised mechanochemically. A lack of mechanistic understanding of mechanochemistry hinders the development of different synthesis approaches, as it is not clear which part of mechanochemistry enables high fluorination. In this report, in situ powder X-ray diffraction performed during the mechanochemical synthesis of Mn-based disordered rocksalt oxyfluorides reveals a previously unknown, Mn-poor amorphous intermediate prior to forming the final rocksalt compound. We find that the intermediate forms regardless of transition metal composition and continues to react slowly with the remaining Mn precursors and thus, appears to be a common node to rocksalt formation for at least four compounds studied here. Attempts to characterise the intermediate with ex situ neutron and X-ray scattering, alongside solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, suggest that the intermediate is thermodynamically unstable, decomposing into a collection of crystalline compounds when removed from the mill. This study highlights the unique chemistry of mechanochemical reactions and pathways accessible at moderate temperatures, ultimately pointing synthetic chemists to the intermediates that enable a wider range of fluorination for disordered rocksalt cathodes.

The performance of theoretical methods in predicting reaction rate constants under these conditions is not straightforward. In this paper, ring polymer instanton rate theory, known to provide accurate rates for tunneling-driven reactions, is compared classical transition state theory (TST) and semiclassical transition state theory (SCTST) for the H- and D-atom-abstraction reactions of the astrochemically relevant molecule alanine.  Classical TST, in line with expectations, fails completely, underestimating the rates by several orders of magnitude unless tunneling corrections are included. SCTST, in contrast, yields rate constants in surprisingly good agreement with instanton theory over a broad temperature range, even within the deep-tunneling regime. However, at very low temperatures, SCTST increasingly deviates from instanton rates. A comparison of the quantum-chemical potential energy surface used in ring polymer evaluation and that used for the vibrational energy levels within VPT2 in SCTST shows that the latter does not adequately describe the regions that dominate at low temperatures.  These findings clarify the origins of the limitations of SCTST and eventually can be used to create possible strategies to improve its applicability.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite their promising attributes, incorporating Aurivillius phases into miniaturized devices presents significant challenges, primarily because their polarization is largely confined to the in-plane direction. This presents a challenge for industry, as conventional vertical devices are designed to operate with out-of-plane (OOP) polarization, making integration with laterally polarized materials difficult.  To address this, industrially relevant Direct Liquid Injection Chemical Vapor Deposition (DLI-CVD) processes were developed to enhance OOP polarization and vertical ferroelectric properties in odd-layered Bi4Ti3O12 thin films. By controlling supersaturation and oxygen partial pressure, the growth mechanism is directed to proceed through either two-dimensional nucleation and growth or dislocation-mediated spiral growth. Piezoresponse force microscopy and atomic resolution electron microscopy studies reveal that films exhibiting growth-spiral morphology show enhanced vertical ferroelectric properties. Notably, the minimum vertical switching voltage is reduced from \u00b120 V to \u00b15 V. The improvement is attributed to defect-mediated modifications of elastic strain energy, localized electron densities and local symmetry-lowering distortions within the crystal structure.

The construction partitions the sphere into belts that match the cardinalities of the s/p/d/f blocks (2/6/10/14), places lanthanoids and actinoids on a continuous \u201cf-ring,\u201d and defines groups as meridians and periods as concentric shells. A compact parameterization provides Cartesian coordinates  (x,y,z) (x,y,z) for all 118 elements, enabling property overlays without changing geometry.  \n\nMethods: On the fixed spherical layout, I quantify periodic trends using four diagnostics: (i) local smoothness via geodesic k-nearest-neighbour mean absolute difference (kNN-MAD) for first ionization energy, Pauling electronegativity, and covalent radius; (ii) azimuthal gradients along constant-\u03b8 rings (block\u00d7period) using central differences, reported per step and per radian; (iii) ring-level monotonicity via Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 between azimuthal order and property ranks; and (iv) cross-shell group coherence as the within-group standard deviation across periods. Real property values are compiled primarily from NIST (ionization energies) and complemented by standard compilations for EN (Pauling scale) and covalent radii (Cordero et al., 2008).  \n\nFindings: Across all three properties, the spherical\u2013ring manifold recovers expected periodic structure: smooth azimuthal progressions along many p-block rings, coherent meridians for several groups across shells, and clear, localized departures where chemistry is known to deviate from simple trends. The same patches recur across diagnostics, indicating genuine signals rather than plotting artefacts. Because the geometry is invariant, different properties can be overlaid on an identical canvas (only color/size change), facilitating side-by-side comparisons. \n\nSignificance: The spherical\u2013ring representation reframes periodicity from an arrangement problem into a geometric, testable structure. It provides a neutral canvas on which periodic trends, anomalies, and cross-property correspondences become quantifiable. This, in turn, supports new hypothesis generation about where periodic regularities are robust and where deeper theoretical or experimental scrutiny is likely to be most informative.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The design of coordination compounds using pyrazole-based ligands is of fundamental importance in contemporary materials chemistry due to their versatile coordination modes and diverse applications. Introducing trifluoromethyl groups onto such ligands is a powerful strategy to modulate the electronic and steric properties of the resulting metal complexes, significantly influencing their acidity, stability, and reactivity. In this context, 5-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole stands out as a particularly promising ligand whose coordination chemistry with transition metals remains surprisingly underexplored. Despite its potential, a systematic investigation into the synthesis, structural diversity, and properties of its coordination compounds is largely absent from recent literature. This gap presents a missed opportunity, as the unique electronic profile of this ligand could unlock new functionalities in molecular materials. To address this, we present a comprehensive study on the synthesis and characterization of a new family of coordination compounds of first-row transition metals (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) with the 5-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole ligand. This work aims to systematically explore its coordination landscape, providing fundamental insights for the future design of advanced functional materials.\nMethods. A variety of techniques were used to identify the complexes, such as elemental analysis, IR, UV/Vis, and NMR spectroscopy. All materials were commercial without further purification. The IR spectra of the synthesized compounds were recorded on a Fourier IR spectrometer Perkin-Elmer \u0412\u0425 (400-4000 cm-1) in KBr tablets. Electron spectra of diffuse reflection (ESD) of polycrystalline of samples in the UV and visible range were recorded on a Varian spectrometer 5000. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini 2000 spectrometer.\nResults. The interaction of 5-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole (L) with 3d-metal acetates (Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni) in non-aqueous solutions was found to be solvent-dependent. In a solvent environment CH\u2083CN and CH\u2083OH (M(Ac)\u2082\u00b74H\u2082O\u2013L\u2013CH\u2083OH/CH\u2083CN systems) at M:L ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, products with the composition M(Ac)\u2082\u00b72L were formed. Meanwhile, in dimethylformamide (M(Ac)\u2082\u00b74H\u2082O\u2013L\u2013DMFA systems) under the same ratios, the complex Mn(Ac)\u2082\u00b7L\u00b7DMF, which incorporated a solvent molecule, was isolated. The composition of the compounds was confirmed by elemental analysis, as well as IR, UV/Vis , and NMR spectroscopy.\nConclusions. An organic ligand, 5-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole, was synthesized. The compound was identified by elemental analysis, IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The interaction of 3d metals such as Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) with 5-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole was investigated. Methods for the synthesis of Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) compounds with 5-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole were developed. Based on the data of elemental analysis and methods of IR, NMR, and electronic spectroscopy, the composition and structure of the obtained complexes have been proposed. It has been shown that in the obtained complexes: the most typical method of coordination of the pyrazole cycle is realized: monodentate - through the pyridine nitrogen atom; the formation of two types of mononuclear Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) complexes is observed: M(Ac)2\u00b72L and M(Ac)2\u00b7L\u00b7DMF; in the obtained complexes M(Ac)2\u00b72L and M(Ac)2\u00b7L\u00b7DMF complexes, a six-coordinate environment of the central atom is realized due to four oxygen atoms from bidentate chelate coordinated acetate groups and two nitrogen atoms from molecules of a non-deprotonated ligand.

The ejected microdomains had raft and non-raft domains, and they were assembled to form solid-ordered phase domains.

Previous experiments have successfully distinguished between purine and pyrimidine bases and have revealed insights into the effect of applied electric voltage on the ssDNA translocation dynamics. Unfortunately, the microscopic details of ssDNA translocation over experimental timescales, which are not easily accessible through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), remain to be further explored. Coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations offer a promising avenue to bridge this gap, allowing simulations over longer timescales closer to the experimental ones. This paper investigates ssDNA translocation through the alpha-hemolysin (aHL) nanopore using constant-force steered MD with the MARTINI CG force-field, building on our previous work validating this approach for ionic and ssDNA transport through this nanopore. We simulated the translocation of poly(dA) and poly(dC) molecules with varying lengths through the aHL nanopore, under different pulling forces to mimic the effect of the voltage applied in the experiments. The influence of the sequence and of the magnitude of the pulling force on translocation dynamics is explored. The simulations were run in two replicas for several microseconds for all systems. Our results demonstrate that CG MD simulations efficiently generate statistically significant data and are successful in capturing experimental properties of ssDNA translocation, such as the shorter translocation times of pyrimidine bases over purine and the effect of the applied force. They also provide new insights into the role of the DNA conformation dynamics during translocation. Despite the simplification of the CG model, our findings are in accordance with previous experimental and all-atom MD simulation results, underscoring the potential of the model for studying further nanopore systems.", "date": "2025-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Processes; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Essential oil yields ranged from 0.24\u00b10.06% to 0.77\u00b10.06%, with O. gratissimum exhibiting the highest yield. Chemical profiling revealed eugenol (79.83\u00b113.04%) as the major constituent in O. gratissimum L., while O. tenuiflorum L. subtypes contained higher levels of germacrene D, caryophyllene, and other monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds.

Computational methods for binding affinity prediction are crucial for accelerating drug discovery, with Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) being a gold standard for accuracy at high computational cost, and co-folding models like Boltz-2 offering speed but with unproven accuracy on novel targets. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of FEP and Boltz-2 for predicting the binding affinity of molecular glues to protein complexes. We assessed 93 compounds across six diverse target/effector complexes, yielding 140 unique protein-compound measurements with experimentally validated ternary complex binding and degradation data. Our results demonstrate that FEP consistently outperforms Boltz-2 across all datasets in terms of correlation and RMSE, showing good absolute predictability with RMSE values within 0.3-1.25 kcal/mol as well as strong correlations. In contrast, Boltz-2 exhibited poor absolute predictability (RMSE over 3 kcal/mol in some cases) and generally poor or even negative correlations. While FEP is computationally more expensive, its accuracy makes it a valuable tool for molecular glue optimization. The poor performance of Boltz-2 suggests it is not suitable for high-throughput screening of molecular glues, highlighting the need for more accurate, high-throughput machine learning methods for pre-FEP screening.

While structural and chemical traits of ternary oxides have been related to proton migration barriers, the role of lattice dynamics has not been established quantitatively. In this work, we quantify these effects by introducing a phonon-based dynamic descriptor of the flexibility of oxygen sublattice, that we term as thermal O...O fluctuation. This dynamic descriptor enables direct comparison of O-sublattice flexibility across diverse structures and chemistries of ternary oxides. By applying regression models, we systematically evaluated the importance of structural, electrostatic, and dynamic descriptors in predicting proton-transfer energy barriers. We found that hydrogen bond length and thermal O...O fluctuation together were the strongest descriptors. Further analysis revealed a critical O...O spacing of 2.4 \u00c5 at the transition state, and this critical spacing was easier to reach by more flexible donor-acceptor pairs. Donor-acceptor flexibility also enabled protons to avoid nearby cations more easily and reduce repulsion effects during transfer. These results suggest that enhanced proton conductivity can be achieved in materials that contain percolating paths of flexible oxygen pairs with short hydrogen bonds.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The accuracy of determining size distributions and number concentrations in SP ICP-MS is critically dependent on a precise knowledge of transport efficiency (TE), which describes the fraction of particles transferred from a suspension into the plasma. While for NPs TE can be assumed to be a constant, a sharp decline can be noted as sizes of particles increase. In this study, we systematically investigated the size dependency of TE by analysing polystyrene (PS) MPs within a range from 1 \u00b5m to 20 \u00b5m using SP ICP-MS and flow cytometry (FC). The latter was employed as a reference technique which allowed a quantitative counting of microparticles. We evaluated two nebuliser/spray chamber combinations, a conventional Scott-type and a total consumption (TC) setup. To improve the comparison of the same standard suspensions across the different setups, a novel multi-particle event filter was implemented to identify overlapping event signals and to improve particle counting accuracy. The results demonstrated a pronounced decrease in TE as MP sizes increased. The shift of the TE from a constant to a size-variable parameter has significant repercussions for the accurate determination of both particle number concentrations and size distributions. Using the Scott-type spray chamber and the total consumption setup, the aerosol-based TEs were 5.5% and 47.3%, respectively. When targeting MPs with a size of 3 \u00b5m, TEs decreased to 1.3 % and 30.0%. For larger MPs of 10 \u00b5m it further decreased to 0.1 % and 3.3%, respectively. To address the size dependency of the TE and the resulting overrepresentation of small particles in size and number-based calibrations, we propose a correction method based on a sigmoidal TE model that retrospectively adjusts histogram frequencies affected by size-dependent losses.", "date": "2025-09-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Revising our approach, we developed a protocol to directly introduce the disulfide with the correct relative stereochemistry on a complex DKP using benzhydryl hydrodisulfide prior to dimerization. Given the sensitivity of ETPs to carbon-centered radicals and UV-irradiation, we developed a strategy to mask the disulfide as a pair of alkyl sulfides prior to an ambitious radical dimerization, fusing two bis-sulfide DKPs at the C3\u2013C3' linkage, followed by photochemical N1-desulfonylation.

Here, we present a de novo strategy for identifying competitive inhibitors using peptide phage display in combination with Bi(III)-mediated in situ formation of bicyclic peptides.

Here, we introduce non-centrosymmetric single crystals of 1-(9-anthryl)ethanol that exhibit rapid (~20\u2013100 ms) autonomous crack healing under low mechanical stress cycles (<10 mN), enabled by crystal self-actuation. Inspired by self-healing of the macroscopic crystals, we fabricate flexible two-terminal microcrystal-based devices that maintain stable conductivity under repeated mechanical bending deformation, enduring bending strain of 1.8% for 100 cycles. Owing to their polar nature, these crystals demonstrate pronounced macroscopic and nanoscale piezo- and ferroelectric properties, realized under an exceptionally low coercive field (~2.7 kV/cm). As a proof-of-concept, we embed the crystals in a PVA matrix to realize a flexible nanogenerator capable of harvesting both mechanical and thermal energy. The device exhibits piezoelectric and pyroelectric coupling coefficients of ~11 pC/N and 1.38 \u03bcC/m\u00b2\u00b7K, respectively, delivering piezoelectric open-circuit voltages of ~3 V and short-circuit currents of ~2.5 \u03bcA under a continuous mechanical loading (12 N).

This study introduces a definitive solution to this long-standing problem: the Kulkarni-NCI Fingerprint (KNF), a compact, 9-feature, physics-informed descriptor engineered to be both informationally dense and interpretable. On its native domain of 2,600 Deep Eutectic Solvent complexes, the KNF demonstrates robust and reliable predictive accuracy with R2 = 0.793, representing a 47% relative improvement over state-of-the-art structural descriptors.  A particularly notable outcome is the KNF\u2019s demonstrated capacity for generalization, suggesting promise for broader supramolecular applications. By training a single \u201cUniversal Model\u201d on a pan-chemical dataset uniting DES complexes with the chemically diverse S66x8 benchmark, this work demonstrates that one model can master the distinct physics of both hydrogen-bond- and dispersion-dominated domains simultaneously, with R2 for DES \u2248 0.69 and R2 for S66 \u2248 0.96.

Here, we report macroscopic assembly of centimeter-scale, free-standing monolayer films of two-dimensional DNA origami polymers (2D-DOPs) using a surfactant-mediated interfacial assembly strategy. Using a tailored surfactant (Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, DSS) which provides a high interfacial activity and a surface tension reduction of 36.0 mN/m in the buffer solution, we achieve highly coherent 2D-DOP films with single-crystalline domains up to 1,200 \u03bcm\u00b2.

Although this atomistic framework has been highly successful, it also exhibits certain limitations. In particular, the equations of motion are defined on a per-atom basis, whereas in practice atomic displacements are often coordinated, with groups of atoms moving synchronously rather than independently. Furthermore, the dominant internal degrees of freedom in molecules correspond to rotations about single bonds, a feature that is not strongly represented in current models. Here, I introduce a theoretical framework for molecular simulation that represents motion in terms of collective rotations of groups of atoms about bonds, thereby emphasizing bond-rotational degrees of freedom. The method is physically motivated yet conceptually straightforward.

Small compounds with the capacity to modify these proteins can be found in natural phytochemicals, and computational methods offer a quick and economical way to assess their potential. This study used CB-Dock, which combines cavity detection with AutoDock Vina-based docking, to evaluate the interaction of four phytochemicals: fisetin, baicalein, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and ursolic acid. Cavity volume and coordinates were used to characterize the binding sites, and centroid\u2013pocket distance measurements were used to confirm that the docking postures were correctly localized within the anticipated active sites. Baicalein showed positive interactions with DPP-4 (\u20139.0 kcal/mol), ursolic acid showed selective binding to SGLT2 (\u20139.4 kcal/mol), and EGCG was shown to be a strong multitarget binder with high affinity for PPAR\u03b3 (\u201310.0 kcal/mol) and \u03b1-glucosidase (\u20139.2 kcal/mol) according to docking studies.

In this work, we introduce a heterobifunctional \u2018sticker\u2019-based complex coacervate that produces hierarchical cytoskeleton-like structures fueled by a chemical response, with concomitant dissolution of the coacervate droplets. The sticker combines methyl viologen and a carboxylic acid moiety separated by an alkyl spacer, designed to crosslink sulfonated polymers via multivalent interactions, including electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. Notably, these heterobivalent linker provides much greater coacervate stability than the analogous homobifunctional linkers (with a half-life at least six times longer). Besides upregulating the specific activity of the compartmentalized enzymes inside the coacervates upto ~5-fold, reversible assembly is tuned efficiently through cycling of the redox state. Moreover, the redox-responsive viologen unit engages in charge-transfer complexation with electron-rich pyranine molecule, producing higher-order fibrous assemblies. These cytoskeleton-resembling structures emerge from the coacervates upon their dissolution, with a redox-responsive reappearance across multiple cycles.

Using glyphosate (GLY) as a model system, we investigate its dynamic binding to AuNRs across a pH gradient.

We use fluorescence microscopy (>900 nm) to image DNA functionalized (6,5)-SWCNTs, which detect the neurotransmitters dopamine and epinephrine as well as the interfering molecule ascorbic acid. By analyzing fluorescence traces of these sensors, we directly observe binding and unbinding events of individual analyte molecules.

Debinding is best described by two exponential first order kinetics with k_(off,fast)=0.40 s^(-1)-0.71 s^(-1) and k_(off,slow)=0.01-0.10 s^(-1) depending on DNA sequence and analyte. Additionally, we find that sensitivity is correlated with sensor brightness and darker sensors have faster off-rates. We also show that differences in rate constants can be exploited for kinetically improved sensor selectivity (KISS) beyond the thermodynamic limit.

Transparent insulators applicable for windows can effectively reduce such heat loss. Conventional options for transparent insulators are silica aerogels that provide both optical transparency and thermal insulation benefits.

In this study, we developed transparent and thermally insulating \u201ccryogels\u201d comprising mechanically strong cellulose nanofibers (CNFs). The term cryogels refers to porous structures prepared via practical freeze drying of wet gels. In the synthesis, the agglomeration of nanofibers in a wet CNF gel during the freezing step was suppressed by rapidly freezing tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH)-exchanged wet gels with a stiffened network skeleton.

The inherent tendency of MXenes to degrade under environmental conditions constrains their compositional diversity and limits certain practical applications. Our computational study shows that degradation of defect-free Ti3C2Tx is kinetically limited, whereas common defects markedly lower the activation barriers for water attack.. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic analysis, we show that VTi defects act as active sites for protonation of subsurface carbon atoms, weakening the bonds with and accelerating release of adjacent Ti atoms. Targeted passivation of these sites by adsorbed metal cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+) is predicted to effectively mitigate degradation by suppressing protonation and increasing the barrier for Ti oxidation. This stabilization arises from two synergistic effects: (i) electronic structure modification driven by a strong dipole moment, which markedly shifts the work function, and (ii) steric hindrance that limits water access to reactive defect sites. We also find that VC defects significantly destabilize adjacent Ti atoms, lowering the energy barrier for water attack reaction. The substitution of VC with electronegative species such as O or N does not significantly improve stability of Ti3C2Tx, highlighting the detrimental role of any defects in carbon sublattice. Because VC are typically inherited from the precursor MAX phase and cannot be removed during post-synthesis, controlling their concentration during MAX phases synthesis is essential. Our thermodynamic analysis reveals that Al-rich conditions substantially raise the formation energy of VC defects in a large spectrum of MAX phases, providing a generalizable strategy for defect suppression and enhanced MXene durability. Our thermodynamic analysis reveals that A-rich (e.g., Al-rich) synthesis conditions substantially raise the formation energy of VC and VN defects in a large spectrum of Mn+1AXn phases, providing a generalizable strategy for defect suppression and improved durability of resulting MXenes.

Black carbon (BC) aggregates, initially highly branched, are also a prominent pollutant in the urban environment, emitted largely by diesel engines, and they have effects on climate and public health that are influenced by their physical properties, e.g., size and morphology. Here, we investigate the effects of geranyl esters, abundant components of fragrances in VCPs, on the morphology of laboratory generated BC aggregates. BC with an initial mobility diameter of 200 nm, generated by an inverted diffusion burner, was selected using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) for coating experiments. We find that geranyl formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate are extremely efficient at inducing BC restructuring. Complete compaction to a diameter growth factor of less than 0.75 occurs already at a volume growth factor of 1.01, i.e., when the coating volume is less than 1% of the initial BC volume, in contrast to dioctyl sebacate, a common coating taken as a reference material. Compaction was also observed by scanning electron microscopy. Using a publicly available model of condensation to BC, we confirm this efficient restructuring occurs because the geranyl esters partition exclusively to point contacts between primary particles of BC through capillary condensation.

Optical and EPR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations, and thermochemical analysis reveal that excited-state protonation of PPTs occurs at the N5 of the heterocycle, generating the PPTH\u2022 key intermediate.

These heterogeneous substrates present significant challenges for residue recovery and analysis when conventional methods, optimized for small, homogeneous samples are applied. This study aimed to develop and evaluate forensic strategies tailored to oversized and fragmented evidence from mixed explosive detonations. Methods: Oversized exhibits from ANFO\u2013nitrate detonations were examined using sequential swabbing, solvent extraction, and spatial subsampling techniques. Organic residues were characterized using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (GC\u2013MS), while inorganic ions were identified through chemical spot tests and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The efficacy of syringe filtration was further assessed to improve the residue recovery efficiency. Results: GC\u2013MS analysis of ether extracts confirmed the presence of high-boiling petroleum hydrocarbons, consistent with diesel fractions in ANFO. Inorganic analyses revealed the presence of ammonium and potassium nitrate, whereas chlorate, perchlorate, and metallic additives were absent. Spatial subsampling enhanced the detection sensitivity, and syringe filtration produced the highest recovery yield by minimizing background interference. Conclusions: The integrated workflow, which combines targeted swabbing, sequential solvent extraction, syringe filtration, and complementary analytical methods\u2014proved highly effective for investigating oversized post-blast exhibits.

Reaction of binucleating bis(pyrazolyl)alkane ligands PD(R)H with two equivalents of LiHMDS (HMDS\u2013 = \u2013N(SiMe3)2) gives complexes PD(R)Li2(HMDS) with a symmetric mu-amide structure, analogous to simple alkali amides. These complexes polymerize rac-lactide by a mechanism analogous to LiHMDS. Notably, PD(4-Me)Li2(HMDS) gives lower dispersity and better molecular weight control than LiHMDS, consistent with a more well-defined catalyst. In the polymerization of o-phthalaldehyde, PD(H)Li2(HMDS) and PD(4-Me)Li2(HMDS) give higher activity and higher selectivity than LiHMDS or butyllithium, commonly used initiators for this reaction, and also gives modest stereoselectivity. Our detailed computational analysis of o-phthalaldehyde insertion resulted in a highly cooperative mechanism, with mu-alkoxide bridging of the two metals in the resting state and with back coordination of the furanyl oxygen. Aldehyde insertion occurs through synchronous nucleophilic addition and migration of the chain end alkoxide, not by aldehyde coordination and insertion.

Aliphatic polyesters such as poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLA) are promising \nbiodegradable alternatives to conventional polymers, but their environmental degradation is often slow. Here, we introduce a polyester metamorphosis strategy for editing carbonyl-to\u0002thiocarbonyl bonds, directly converting commercial polyesters into their sulfur-rich analogues, \npolythionoesters. This relatively underexplored class of material, with distinct physicochemical properties and enhanced degradability, are not easily accessible from sulfur-\u0002containing monomers due to challenges of instability and purification. This work circumnavigates these issues by achieving the first post-polymerisation thionation of PCL using Lawesson\u2019s reagent under benchtop conditions. Controlled degrees of thionation (\u226475%) allow systematic tuning of crystallinity, thermal transitions, and degradation behaviour. Importantly, PLA resists thionation, enabling selective modification of PCL domains in PCL\u2013PLA copolymers. The resulting polythionoesters display accelerated degradation under acidic conditions compared to their polyester analogues, demonstrating how bond editing at the ester linkage reprograms polymer lifetimes and properties.

The attachment of triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS-ethynyl) groups to aromatic compounds has led to the development of many annihilators with high upconversion quantum yields. Here, we synthesized a series novel of symmetrical biphenyls bearing silylethynyl substituents of varying sizes and evaluated them as annihilators in visible-to-UV upconversion systems. While all of these systems do not suffer from excimer formation issues, their upconversion performances differ significantly. Small substituents like trimethylsilylethynyl gave similar upconversion quantum yields (up to ~ 12 %) as the TIPS-ethynyl groups, but the larger triphenylsilylethynyl substituents reduce the achievable quantum yields by half, which is likely due to additional non-radiative loss channels arising from altered energies of higher excited triplet states. The UV emission of the novel annihilators is hypsochromically shifted by about 20 nm relative to the TIPS-naphthalene benchmark UV annihilator, thereby reaching a highly attractive spectral region for bond activation photochemistry. Using the most efficient annihilator, bTIPS-BP, we achieved blue-to-UV upconversion-driven release of fluorescein from a photocage.

Building off our prior work which directly measured the roughness-dependent capillary pinning of individual particles, we now show how the reduction in capillary interaction energy between rough ellipsoids, and increase in interaction energy between spheres, impacts their collective assembly. Two types of surface topography (convex/concave) and two degrees of roughness are compared with their smooth analogues. With increasing roughness, the measured surface pressure increases for spheres, in accordance with stronger capillary interactions, and decreases in ellipsoids, likewise confirming that individual particle attributes impacts their monolayer properties. However, the type of surface topography, not just the roughness magnitude, is shown to be a critical aspect of the assembly morphology as the interfaces approach their jammed state. In particular, concave rough ellipsoids are observed to form a complete unidirectional monolayer with high area fraction (~0.86), avoiding the kinetically arrested assemblies and low area fraction jamming (0.68) shown by smooth ellipsoids. Moreover, monolayers of concave rough ellipsoids demonstrate a two-dimensional interfacial isotropic\u2013nematic phase transition with increasing particle areal density.

The geometric, electronic, and optical properties of M3O@C18Br6 were explored in detail by using (time-dependent) density functional theory [(TD-)DFT] combined with wavefunction analysis. About one unit of charge is transferred from M3O to C18Br6 resulting in charge-separated [M3O]+@[C18Br6] electrides, thus stabilizing the complexes by virtue of remarkable electrostatic interaction within the system. The isotropic polarizability (\u03b10) of M3O@C18Br6 gradually increases with the atomic number of alkali metal due to the different abilities of the metal nuclei to bind to surrounding electrons. Li3O@C18Br6 has the first hyperpolarizability (\u03b20) opposite in direction to its Na3O and K3O analogues, with a magnitude more than twice that of them. The essential differences in the \u03b20, including magnitude and orientation, were elucidated through analyses of hyperpolarizability tensor and hyperpolarizability density. Electronic excitation studies showed that the absorption spectra of M3O@C18Br6 exhibit an obvious red-shift compared to that of the pristine C18Br6 and have transparency in the light range with wavelengths greater than 500 nm.

To address the challenge of improving access to HIV testing, we have developed a passive, paper-based microfluidic sample preparation device we term the QuickDraw. We demonstrate that QuickDraw efficiently processes HIV-containing finger stick-quantities of whole blood to yield purified viral RNA. The output of the QuickDraw is then used as input for a colorimetric reverse transcriptase - loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay. Coupled with sample preparation conducted with the QuickDraw, the assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 1,000 copies/mL, with a PPV of 93% and an NPV of 87%. QuickDraw simplifies viral nucleic acid sample preparation and detection by dramatically reducing the amount of equipment needed, suggesting it could be suitable for deployment in clinical and low-resource settings. By decentralizing nucleic acid testing, the QuickDraw platform has the potential to expand access to nucleic acid diagnostics in low-middle income countries (LMICs), while also supporting the UNAIDS goals for HIV detection, leading to wider access to treatment and reduced community transmission.

Several computational approaches have recently been emerged to estimate experimentally observed RT using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

Direct air capture (DAC) that directly removes CO2 from the atmosphere provides great potential in carbon neutralization and even reverses the CO2 concentration in the long run. However, the massive land use and capital investment of centralized DAC plants and the energy-intensive process of adsorbent regeneration limit its wide employment. Here, we develop a distributed carbon nanofiber (CNF)-based DAC air filter capable of adsorbing CO2 downstream in indoor ventilation systems. The DAC air filter not only has the potential to remove 596 MtCO2\u2009yr\u22121 globally but can also decrease the energy consumption in existing building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. The CNF-based adsorbent has a high capacity of 4 mmol/g under a humid atmosphere and excellent lifetime cyclability. More importantly, the CNFs can be regenerated either via solar thermal or electrothermal method with extremely low carbon footprints, owing to their superior solar absorptivity of 94.4%, electrical conductivity, and low heat capacity of 1.3 J/(g\u00b7\u02daC). The ultrafine nanofiber has a low pressure drop of 66 Pa at a face velocity of 76 cm/s, minimizing the additional energy load to the ventilation system. Through life cycle assessment, the CNF air filter shows an excellent carbon removal efficiency of 92.3% from cradle to grave with low environmental impacts, such as land use and ecotoxicity.

In molecular catalysis, the Oxo-Wall dictates a transition from a stable oxo intermediate (OER active) to a meta-stable metal-oxo (OER inactive) generally occurs. In this work, we find that in heterogeneous catalysis the same Oxo-Wall applies, but a meta-stable oxo preferentially coordinates with lattice oxygen to form a more stable surface peroxo intermediate. We identify a universal free energy onset of this process at 3.39 eV under electrochemical activation in water and show that it is completely decoupled from the OER oxo species. Such decoupling gives rise to a new region of oxygen reactivity relevant for AOR where we predict a selective oxidation of the unsaturated C-C bonds to occur instead of OER. We construct a distinct AOR overpotential volcano and identify recently reported electrocatalysts, including palladium-platinum for propylene epoxidation and silver-nickel for ethylene epoxidation, along with others on TiO2 and CuO.

The model integrates spatially explicit resource data, learning-driven capital cost trajectories, and a dynamic, country- and technology-specific cost of capital, supported by robust scenario and uncertainty analysis. By 2050, median levelized costs are projected at 0.07 to 0.10 EUR2024 per kWh for green hydrogen, 0.15 to 0.18 EUR2024 per kWh for power-to-liquid kerosene, and 0.14 to 0.20 EUR2024 per kWh for most bio-based aviation fuels, reflecting both substantial progress and persistent regional disparities.

However, conventional TK bonds are relatively hydrophobic and have limited responsiveness to physiological doses of water-borne ROS. Here, a library of TK linkers was synthesized from different ketone-containing monomers to evaluate the relationship between linker hydrophilicity and ROS-mediated degradation. NMR studies demonstrated that hydrophilic TK constructs degraded more rapidly at lower ROS concentrations compared to standard TK bond configurations. Similarly, crosslinked hydrogels made with more water-friendly TKs showed greater polymer net-work degradation when exposed to ROS than traditional, more hydrophobic TK formulations. When these TK link-ers were incorporated into tissue engineering scaffolds, all samples exhibited negligible in vitro cytotoxicity while the more hydrophilic varieties experienced nearly a doubling of mass loss upon oxidation. This structure-function relationship was also confirmed in vivo as porous scaffolds constructed from more hydrophilic TKs underwent sig-nificantly more bioresorption and improved tissue in-growth when implanted subcutaneously in rats.

Their efficient ET chemistry is enabled by a conflated interplay of cofactor-protein interactions, which can be categorized into the covalent first (1\u00b0) sphere ones and the non-covalent second (2\u00b0) sphere ones. The latter have remained particularly elusive, as they are difficult to observe and assess directly and independently. Accordingly, our understanding of these effects is hampered by their entangled nature. To address this, we herein leverage a systematic series of synthetic Fe4S4 complexes, which allows us to spectroscopically investigate 2\u00b0 sphere electrostatic interactions and covalent 1\u00b0 sphere interactions separately from one another. We expand the study of 1\u00b0 sphere interactions with a histidine-type ligand in [Fe4S4]1+ complexes to the [Fe4S4]2+ and [Fe4S4]3+ oxidation states, supporting the notion that 1\u00b0 sphere interactions \u201cfine-tune\u201d the electronic/magnetic structure of these systems in a manner that persists at ambient temperatures.

These results thus not only systematically catalogue the influence of 1\u00b0 sphere covalent and 2\u00b0 sphere electrostatic interactions on the observables and properties of Fe4S4 complexes, but also establish a clear energetic distinction between the two.

Being able to simultaneously quantify distinct components within heterogeneous mixtures, while also requiring small amounts of material and minimal sample preparation provide numerous advantages over traditional solution-phase biochemical techniques. However, several caveats related to species specific MS signal responses, including changes in response factors (RFs) upon biological complex formation, have not been fully resolved, which has prevented the technique from being widely adopted. Herein, we utilize nMS to determine the stepwise binding affinities of a recombinant single-strand DNA binding protein (SSB) from Saccharolobus solfataricus (Sso) along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This work resolves conflicting previous biochemical reports on the stoichiometry and affinities of SsoSSB, while also highlighting the advantages and limitations of nMS quantification. Covalent concatemers of SsoSSB were used to compare RFs of each oligomer as a function of molecular weight and to correct for physical and instrumental parameters that systematically underrepresent abundances of larger mass species. Furthermore, we show that regardless of quantification metric (peak area or intensity) utilized for the nMS data, meaningful biochemical data can be extracted from multicomponent biochemical systems.

Reverse osmosis is a common treatment technology employed in potable reuse treatment trains because it is a physical barrier to most biological and chemical contaminants, but it produces a concentrate stream that must be managed. The concentrate includes chemical contaminants of concern, which are an emerging topic of research, but we were not able to identify studies characterizing biological contaminants in reverse osmosis concentrate from municipal wastewater. In this perspective, we i) determine how common the use of reverse osmosis is in potable reuse globally; ii) determine current management practices for concentrate globally; iii) identify biological contaminants in reverse osmosis concentrate; and iv) summarize factors that need further research to assess the fate of biological contaminants from wastewater in reverse osmosis concentrate. Factors identified that needed further research included the effects of reverse osmosis concentrate composition (eg, salinity and heavy metal content) and the effectiveness of concentrate treatment technologies on biological contaminants. In addition, we identified that ocean (11/22 coastal facilities) and other surface water bodies (4/7 inland facilities) were the most common reverse osmosis concentrate management strategies for coastal and inland potable reuse facilities, respectively. Ultimately, concentrate from these facilities was discharged to surface water bodies, either directly or through sewer discharge, which highlights the potential for human exposure that depends on the uses of the receiving surface water bodies.

Aerial measurement campaigns have been extensively deployed to detect and quantify methane emissions from oil and gas facilities to inform and assess effectiveness of mitigation activities.

Understanding the impact of ambient conditions, such as wind, on the performance of aerial detection technologies is essential not only for assessing their ability to detect emission sources, but also for interpreting the measurements. Accurate quantification of emissions requires estimating the portion of emissions that may be missed. In this work, we present a method to determine a practical detection limit, which reflects the magnitudes of emissions that these technologies are capable of detecting under real-world operating conditions. Our results show that wind speeds have a more pronounced impact on minimum detection limits than predicted by analytical models or probability of detection curves built from controlled test results. We find that under varied field conditions, approximately 18% of emissions may not be observed, compared to what would be expected from detection limits established through controlled release experiments.

Here, we introduce a novel online liquid chromatography (LC) approach that enables isomer-specific TG identification through in-source ozonolysis via ozone electrospray ionization (OzESI) combined with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. By directly incorporating ozone into the electrospray ionization source, our approach generates diagnostic ozonolysis product ions that localize C=C positions without the need for post-ionization reaction chambers or major instrument modifications. We demonstrate the utility of this method using synthetic TG standards and apply it to real-world samples, including the analysis of canola oil across processing stages. To overcome the challenging data analytics, automated data-processing is achieved via CLAW-OzESI-MRM (Comprehensive Lipidomics Automated Workflow for OzESI-MRMs) that includes artificial intelligent (AI) agentic framework to streamline structural assignment of TGs with C=C specificity.

Evaluation on two physics-based datasets demonstrates that the explanations reliably capture the predictions of the respective machine learning models. Furthermore, our workflow reveals that explainability methods can only meaningfully reflect the property of interest when the underlying models achieve high predictive accuracy. Therefore, the explainability performance on a test set can function as a quality measure of the underlying model.

This study proposes a microkinetic model to elucidate the oscillatory dynamics of ethanol electro-oxidation on platinum in acidic medium by comparing experimental galvanostatic data with computational simulations. By coupling 16 reaction steps, the model captures time-dependent potential oscillations driven by the competitive adsorption of intermediate species such as OH_ad and carbonaceous. Simulated potential oscillations align revealing a progressive increase in oscillatory period due to due to CH_x accumulation (up to 60% surface coverage), which impedes active site regeneration. Key findings highlight high selectivity toward partial oxidation products (acetaldehyde and acetic acid), attributed to kinetically favorable pathways that avoid C-C bond cleavage. The model successfully captures key dynamic features as: progressive increase in the oscillatory period over time, surface coverage dynamics and selectivity toward partial oxidation products.

From these key intermediate azetidine enamines, we synthesized two 6-functionalized 4-azaspiro[2.3]hexanes.

Despite being thermodynamically favorable, the CO2 hydroxylation kinetics are sluggish due to a higher energy barrier associated with bending the linear CO2 molecule prior to nucleophilic attack by OH-. Here, we report a previously unrecognized catalytic effect where ionic liquids (ILs) increase the rates of CO2 hydroxylation by pre-activating (or bending) CO2 locally around IL. ILs are known for their higher CO2 solubilities owing to larger void fractions; however, their role in catalyzing the CO2 hydroxylation reaction, an important step in RCC, has not been reported before. NMR, FTIR, and quantum-chemical calculations confirm bicarbonate as the dominant stable species, with carbonate converting back to bicarbonate over time. For instance, the addition of BMIM NTf\u2082 in KOH-ethylene glycol mixture accelerates CO2 hydroxylation by sixfold by lowering the activation energy (~35%) without chemically binding CO\u2082, highlighting its catalytic role. While low IL loadings enhance kinetics, higher concentrations hinder CO2 mass transfer due to reduced interfacial tension. The nature of IL cation and anion strongly influences rates, with shorter alkyl chains and I\u207b/OTf\u207b anions providing the highest activity. The system demonstrates reversibility and robustness under flue gas conditions, offering a tunable pathway for efficient CO2 capture.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The short peptide KLVFF, derived from the central hydrophobic domain of A\u03b2, binds to A\u03b2 oligomers and interferes with A\u03b2 aggregation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of action of this peptide remains to be elucidated. This work addresses this question by studying the interaction between A\u03b211-42 (A\u03b2 peptide with 32 amino acids length, from residue 11 to 42) hexamer models and an increasing number (n =1, 3, 6) of randomly positioned KLVFF peptides using triplicate microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our findings revealed that KLVFF interacts non-specifically with the fibril model, maintaining a disordered secondary structure. This interaction induces conformational changes at the ends of the hexamer, leading to the gradual detachment of terminal monomers from the fibril. Structural and energetic data suggest an inhibitory mechanism based on the loss of structural integrity and the prevention of ordered A\u03b2 addition at the fibril ends. This proposal differs from the mechanism previously postulated in the literature, according to which KLVFF would disrupt A\u03b2 aggregation by binding to the central hydrophobic domain at an A\u03b2 region that matches the peptide sequence in an amyloid-like secondary conformation. The validity of our computational findings was corroborated by circular dichroism experiments, which confirmed the ability of the KLVFF peptide to reduce the formation of \u03b2-sheet secondary structures in A\u03b2 solutions, with a concentration- and incubation time-dependent effect. Additionally, thioflavin T aggregation assays supported the role of KLVFF in reducing the A\u03b2 aggregation propensity with no evidence of KLVFF self-aggregation. These results provide key insights for the rational design of novel A\u03b2 aggregation inhibitors mimicking KLVFF as fibril end destabilizers and hinders of oligomer elongation", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) potential, with dynamic, conformationally-dependent charges on the atoms in the ML region, that can be used to address this important challenge in drug design. By way of a case study, molecular dynamics simulations were used to compare the performance of intermolecular potentials in evaluating the solution phase conformational free energy differences of pharmaceutically relevant ligands based on the protonated 2-phenylethylamine scaffold. We show that satisfactory performance of an MM-only force field in predicting the preferred conformations of these molecules in solution (with a mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.9 kcal/mol) is due a convenient cancellation of errors in the intramolecular and intermolecular contributions to the conformational free energy difference. Specifically, the underestimation of intramolecular cation- interactions which preferentially stabilise the folded conformation is compensated by underestimated solute-solvent interactions which preferentially stabilise the extended conformation. A straightforward approach to an ML/MM potential, in which the intramolecular MM representation of the solute is simply substituted by a ML model without making other changes to the potential, disrupts this error cancellation and results in a systematic underperformance relative to the MM-only approach, with a MAE of 1.9 kcal/mol. To remedy this shortcoming, a new ML/MM potential is presented that combines an accurate, trained-for-purpose ML (PairFEQ-Net) model of the charged solute, with the polarisable SWM3 MM model of water. Crucially, by employing an empirical parameter to scale gas phase charges, the ML model predicts dynamic, solvent-polarised charges that effectively electrostatically embed the solute in the solvent in a balanced way, outperforming the MM-only approach when it comes to conformational free energy predictions, reducing the MAE to 0.5 kcal/mol. This balanced ML/MM potential furnishes a possible route to the chemically accurate prediction of the shapes of organic molecules in aqueous solution.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

A central challenge in this field is the identification of molecular descriptors that can effectively capture both geometric- and electronic structure-derived features, enabling the development of reliable and interpretable predictive models. While numerous descriptors focusing solely on structural characteristics have been recently proposed, improvements in model accuracy often come at the cost of increased computational demands, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce the \u201cQUantum Electronic Descriptor\u201d (QUED) framework, which integrates both structural and electronic data of molecules to develop ML regression models for property prediction. In doing so, a quantum-mechanical (QM) descriptor is derived from molecular and atomic properties computed using the semi-empirical density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method, which allows for efficient modelling of both small and large drug-like molecules. This descriptor is combined with inexpensive geometric descriptors--capturing two-body and three-body interatomic interactions--to form comprehensive molecular representations used to train Kernel Ridge Regression and XGBoost models. As a proof of concept, we validate QUED using the QM7-X dataset, which comprises equilibrium and non-equilibrium conformations of small drug-like molecules, demonstrating that incorporating electronic structure data notably enhances the accuracy of ML models for predicting physicochemical properties. For biological endpoints, we find that QM properties provide some predictive value for toxicity and lipophilicity prediction, as assessed using the TDCommons-LD50 and the MoleculeNet benchmark datasets. Moreover, a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis of the toxicity and lipophilicity predictive models reveals that molecular orbital energies and DFTB energy components are among the most influential electronic features. Hence, our work underscores the importance of incorporating QM descriptors to enhance both the accuracy and interpretability of ML models for predicting multiple properties relevant to pharmaceutical and biological applications.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The most recent biomolecular foundation model, Boltz-2, even claimed to approach the performance of free-energy perturbation (FEP) in estimating small molecule\u2013protein binding affinity.\nHowever, there is still an ongoing debate about the capabilities of such models regarding generalisation or memorisation. A comprehensive assessment remains difficult due to the lack of demanding and relevant benchmark data sets. Here, we present a new approach to benchmark affinity prediction based on the inter-protein scoring noise problem of classical scoring functions. This well-known phenomenon describes the problem that classical scoring functions are capable of enriching active molecules for a protein target but are unable to identify the correct protein target for a given active molecule. This is due to scoring variation between different binding pockets, which limits the ranking capabilities for target identification. In contrast, a successful and reliable binding affinity prediction method should be able to identify the correct protein target and differentiate between binders and non-binders. \nWe therefore developed a new benchmark set for target identification based on the LIT-PCBA and tested whether Boltz-2 can correctly identify the target of active molecules. Our study highlights that, while the affinity module of Boltz-2 seems promising, it is still not able to identify the correct protein target by correctly predicting a higher binding affinity in comparison to the decoy targets. This indicates that a generalisation of protein-ligand interactions is still not achieved, which is in line with other benchmarks that indicate a memorizing effect. Such a benchmark can be seen as the next major hurdle to successful deep-learning-based affinity prediction using protein-ligand complexes. Any model or method truly capable of accurate binding affinity prediction should perform well on target-prediction benchmark tasks.\n", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Among polyoxotungstates, [NaP5W30O110]14-, with a high tungsten content, showed the greatest cytotoxicity towards PC-3 cells at low concentrations.

Several studies have examined how perturbations of electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) affect the refractive index at metal-electrolyte interfaces and the consequent sensor output. However, the individual contributions of cations and anions to the overall optical response remain unexplored. We address this gap using coupled electrostatics and electrodiffusion models to simulate the metal-electrolyte interface, with resulting ion concentration profiles used to compute refractive index changes. We develop a mathematical model based on the Lorenz-Lorentz equation to estimate macroscopic refractive index changes using the concentration and molar refractivity of ions. We demonstrate this effect computationally using three optical configurations: Normal Incidence Reflection Modulation (NIRM), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) with the Kretschmann-Raether configuration, and Localised Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) via gold nanoparticles. Each method exhibits sensitivity to refractive index variations due to excess or depletion of cations and anions. For 1:1 sodium chloride electrolyte, we observe an asymmetric optical response upon polarity switching, with enhanced sensitivity at positive potentials due to chloride ions' higher molar refractivity relative to sodium ions. The response increases in inverse proportion to the optical field penetration depth at the sensing interface. These findings inform the design of highly sensitive optical sensors and offer insight into ion dynamics in biological systems, battery charge transport, and metrology of optical properties of ionic species.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis; Microscopy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Mallapragada", "abstract": "Decarbonizing thermal steam cracking (TSC) of hydrocarbons - the primary pathway for ethylene production - remains essential for reducing the carbon footprint of the global chemical industry. Proposed decarbonization strategies include CO2 capture and storage (CCS) as well as the use of electricity to provide high-temperature heat for the reaction in lieu of fossil fuel combustion. Here, we undertake a multi-scale assessment of recently proposed internal electric-resistance-heated (i-ERH) reactors for enabling electrified steam cracking (ESC), assessing both reactor-level performance and process-level integration. We compare the ESC process against the conventional TSC process with and without post-combustion CO2 capture using ethane as the feed, in terms of process design, product yield, energy requirements, cost, and life cycle emissions. Reactor-level modeling indicates that i-ERH reactors can increase ethylene yield compared to conventional externally heated reactors using fuel combustion while also reducing reactor size. These reactor-level improvements translate into lower process-level capital expenditures (12% lower than TSC in our base case) and reduced feedstock consumption (16% lower than TSC), which can partially or fully offset the cost of increased energy imports (91% higher) under the evaluated electricity and fuel supply scenarios. While higher ethylene yields reduce chemical (C3+) co-product revenues for the ESC process, this can be mitigated by the sale of hydrogen and methane byproducts that are otherwise combusted in the TSC process. The emissions impacts of ESC versus TSC, and TSC-CCS are sensitive to the emissions intensity of the electricity supply: under 2022 Texas grid conditions, ESC emissions would be 50% higher than TSC, but future grid electricity supply scenarios for 2035 result in 20.8\u201347.7% lower emissions. Through sensitivity analysis, we identify the combinations of electricity price (75\u2013113 $/MWh), ESC reactor capital cost, and electricity emissions intensity (\u2264 0.2 t CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq)/MWh) that enable carbon abatement costs of $100/tonne CO2 or lower relative to the TSC process.

The structures of proteins and nucleic acids are challenging due to omission of several atoms from the structural model, and from the lack of connectivity and bond order information in the PDB and mmCIF file formats.

Electrocatalysis by soluble molecules is known to depend strongly on substituents that tune the catalyst redox potential (E1/2), but it is unclear if this parameter similarly impacts catalysis by MMEs. Herein, we employ the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a test case for comparing the activity of carbon-adsorbed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc/C) and cobalt hexadecafluoro-phthalocyanine (CoFPc/C). By correlating HER activity and voltammetric data to total Co surface concentration across a wide range of catalyst loadings, we find that only 5 to 25% of adsorbed Co sites contribute to the Co(II/I) redox wave, and that this sub-population poorly correlates with catalytic activity. Instead, in the low-loading limit, catalytic activity correlates linearly with the majority redox-silent Co population, revealing per-site turnover frequency (TOF) values for HER. Despite a 230 mV difference in Co(II/I) redox potentials, CoPc/C and CoFPc/C display TOF values that differ by less than a factor of 3 when compared over a wide potential range. Mechanistic studies point to an inner-sphere concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) step as rate-determining for both MMEs, suggesting that the Co\u2013H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) rather than the Co(II/I) E1/2 is thermodynamically relevant. Computational studies indicate that the fluoro-substituents lead to compensatory changes in Co(II/I) E1/2 and Co(I) basicity, leaving the Co\u2013H BDFE largely unchanged between CoPc and CoFPc and thereby manifesting in similar catalytic rates.

It is found that SCTP is typically obeyed for monomer-to-catalyst ratios up to 25, while the combination of a tBu3P-based Pd pre-catalysts and a boronate-based monomers enable excellent SCTP fidelity with monomer-to-catalyst ratios up to 500.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Conducting polymers; Polymerization (Polymers); Polymerization catalysts", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

By analyzing the interplay between La 4f and 5d orbitals in various environments, we extract key information about ligand-field effects and bond covalency. Our findings demonstrate that spectroscopic features of the La L2-edge CC-RIXS map reflect the nephelauxetic effect, which arises from central-field 4f orbital-specific bond covalency. The energy separation between the pre-edge and main absorption edge of the La L2-edge HR-XANES spectra also serves as direct probes of electron density for both 4f and 5d orbitals. Quantum chemical modeling, including ligand-field density-functional theory (LFDFT) and \\textit{ab initio} bond analysis, complements our experiments. This allows us to establish a direct correlation between spectroscopic observables and theoretical metrics for bonding properties, offering a framework to understand the coordination chemistry of f-element.

Although conducting polymer-based gas sensors have been widely reported for amine detection using DC resistivity measurements, they often lack selectivity to distinguish between intragroup compounds. To overcome this limitation, this work reports a machine learning-enabled electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) approach using a tin oxide\u2013polypyrrole composite sensor, forming a virtual sensor array for intraclass amine classification.\nThe sensor's impedance response to four representative amines, ammonia, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and trimethylamine, was investigated and classified over a wide  frequency range (100 Hz to 8 MHz). Electrical parameters were extracted from the obtained impedance data from Nyquist plots using equivalent circuit models with an overall fitting error of less than 3%. It was observed that the sensor exhibits frequency-dependent impedance behaviour in response to different amines and can be classified using a unique set of frequencies as features. Principal component analysis was employed to visualize 20 distinct classes of the four different amines at five concentrations each (4x5 matrix). A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained and tested on the obtained dataset, with 40%:60%, respectively. The tested data was classified with an accuracy greater than 90% for all 20 classes. In addition, a wrapper approach was employed for feature selection to enhance the model efficiency. \nThis work establishes EIS combined with machine learning as a powerful strategy for selective classification of different amines and highlights its real-time prediction capability.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

We probed the impact of molecular weight and stereochemistry, and we evaluated the accuracy of theory in modeling the end-to-end relaxation. Our results support that trans-PI dynamics is distinct, with entanglements forming at a lower degree of polymerization than other compositions due to differences in the characteristic ratio and packing of this polymer.

Comprehensive characterisation techniques investigated structural, morphological, and surface composition changes. The doped materials retained the layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure and exhibited reduced cation mixing, lattice stabilisation, and suppression of detrimental phase transitions. Sn-B co-doped cathodes delivered superior rate performance and capacity retention, consistently outperforming both pristine and single-doped cathodes at room (25\u00b0C), elevated (45\u00b0C), and low (-5\u00b0C) temperatures.

This study explores the fundamental case of methyl radical addition reaction (MRAR) to monosubstituted ethylene derivatives (H2C=CHR, with R = H, CHO, and NMe2) using Density Functional Theory at ZORA-(U)OLYP/TZ2P. We quantitatively analyzed the factors governing regioselectivity and substituent effects using the Activation Strain Model and Energy Decomposition Analysis. Regarding regioselectivity, radical addition@ is universally favored over addition@ due to reduction in the buildup of unfavorable Pauli repulsion (\u0394EPauli) and maximization of orbital interactions (\u0394Eoi) with the -carbon. Substituents modulate reactivity through electronic effects: both electron-donating groups (EDGs) like NMe2 and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like CHO lower activation barriers with respect to the unsubstituted reactions due to improved orbital interactions. Among the substituents, the EWG lowers the activation barriers more than the EDG due to a change in the orbital interaction mechanism. By linking qualitative theories like Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory with detailed computational insights, this work advances the mechanistic understanding of radical addition reactions and provides a physically sound and intuitive basis for understanding these key transformations.", "date": "2025-09-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

PBEs are solved over the compartments, capturing mixing effects on the evolution of the PSD, at a fraction of computational cost. Crystallization case studies are conducted to examine mixing effects under varying kinetics, operating conditions, and impeller types. Results show that mixing-driven phenomena are system-specific, and hydrodynamic effects must be considered when transferring insights between systems and scales.

Our results reveal the tendency of Ti\u2083AlC\u2082 to undergo partial oxidation with oxygen occupying the interlayer space between Al and Ti. Upon Al removal, the oxidized structure exothermically transforms into configurations resembling O-terminated Ti\u2083C\u2082 MXenes, suggesting that MXene-like fragments form even before the etching process is complete. A systematic analysis of Ti\u2083AlC\u2082 surface chemistry across varying electric potentials reveals that OH-rich terminations at MAX phase edges promote selective Al extraction while suppressing Ti dissolution, whereas O-terminated edges can compromise the selectivity of the etching reaction. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Al extraction proceeds with low energy barriers (~0.25 eV) in both fluorine-free and fluorine-containing aqueous environments.

Here we report an organic high-temperature photothermal material (BTDyA) featuring the extended donor-acceptor-donor structure through ethynyl group \u03c0-bridges connection (D--A--D).

Activation strain and energy decomposition analyses reveal that \u03c3-binding is preferred over \u03c0-binding due to reduced steric (Pauli) repulsion between the LA and the substrate. Furthermore, LAs \u03c3-bind more strongly to the nitrogen of azabutadiene than to the oxygen of acrolein due to enhanced electrostatic and orbital interactions. In addition, the role of solvation in the \u03c3-binding versus \u03c0-binding preference was also examined: the preference for \u03c3-binding clearly remains and even increases for strong LAs, but for weak LAs such as I2, the preference for \u03c3-binding diminishes in solvent, though \u03c3-binding remains dominant.

While Pd(0)/Pd(II) catalytic cycles are well understood, the behavior of Pd(IV) alkyl complexes is less studied, particularly due to their instability. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization by X-ray diffraction, solid-state magnetism, and 1H NMR of several Pd(Alkyl)4 fragments, which demonstrate unusual stability thanks to a Cp*2Yb(bipym) fragment (Cp* is for pentamethylcy-clopentadienyl and bipym for 2,2\u2019bipyrimidine). As such, the Cp*2Yb(bipym)Pd(Me)3(R) (R = Me, 3Me; Et, 3Et) complexes have room temperature half-life of more than 17 h, while the one-electron reduction of 3Me leads to a Pd(Me)4 fragment, 3@crypt, which does not degrade over time. This unusual stability allowed us to study the original reactivities of these Pd(Alkyl)4 fragments other than classical reductive elimination. Thus, we report the first light-induced Pd(IV)-C bond ho-molysis, which leads to the formation of alkyl radicals. The Cp*2Yb(bipym)PdMe4 complex, 3Me, reacts under irradiation at 370 nm to form the Cp*2Yb(4Me,4H-bipym)PdMe4, 4, and the Cp*2Yb(4Me,4H-bipym)PdMe2, 5, in which the methyl radical couples with the bipym radical.

This leaves a critical gap in the  rational design of 2D sensors and catalysts. This work addresses this gap through a first-principles investigation into the intercalation of CO and  CO2 within pristine and vacant MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 bilayers. While pristine materials exhibit weak interactions governed by the energetic  cost of layer expansion, the introduction of a single chalcogen vacancy unlocks dramatically different and material-specific catalytic functions.  These behaviors are dictated by an interplay between vacancy size, charge availability at exposed metal sites, and intermolecular interactions  within the confined interlayer space. The compact S-vacancy in MoS2 is found to uniquely catalyze CO oxidation (2CO \u2192 CO2 + C) due to  geometric constraints, while remaining inert to CO2. In stark contrast, the larger, more electron-rich vacancies in MoSe2 and MoTe2 are inactive for  CO oxidation but instead promote the crucial CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 \u2192 CO + O).

Moreover, external validation of the best-performing model on the unseen data was carried out to illustrate its capability to assist the potential anticancer drug exploration process, leading to >2x increase in the hit rate compared to random sampling. The possibility of multi-metal predictions was explored, enabling assessment of cytotoxicity among the complexes of metals, for which experimental data is relatively scarce. The interpretability and limitations of the developed models are discussed, providing data-driven chemical insights into metal complexes cytotoxicity and laying foundation for future work. Finally, a pipeline for effective high-throughput computational screening of ruthenium complexes is proposed.

Upon heating, a phase transition from the M1(P21/c) phase to the R(P42/mnm) phase was observed at ~341 K corresponding to the well-known insulator to metal (IMT) phase transition. Upon cooling however, the R phase proceeds first through the intermediate M2 phase between 345-340K before converting to the M1 phase. This constitutes the first observation of the RM2M1 phase progression in pristine free standing single crystals of VO2, a result reported previously only in doped samples, nanocrystals, and thin films. The Vanadium coordination in the M2(C2/m) phase is found to exhibit structural characteristics of both the M1(P21/c) and R(P42/mnm) phases containing both V-V dimers and 1-dimensional V chains along the c-axis. The presence of the insulating M2(C2/m) phase in undoped VO2 is consistent with a Mott-Hubbard type IMT phase transition. Significant changes in the Vanadium atomic displacement parameters observed at 340 K suggest thermal vibrations play a crucial role in the phase transition.", "date": "2025-09-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Magnetism; Solid State Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Silicone oil, a lubricant in PFSs to facilitate plunger movement during injection, and the headspace from syringe fillings, have been reported to induce protein aggregation and particle formation as a result of the associated interfacial stress. However, their impact on the stability of peptide drugs is underexplored. In this study, we employ biophysical techniques, including size exclusion chromatography (SEC), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT), to investigate aggregate formation, secondary structural changes, and fibrillation following physical stress on liraglutide in the presence of varying silicone oil concentrations, headspace, and agitation strength. In contrast to the minimal structural changes or formation of higher molecular weight aggregates observed under mild agitation or limited headspace, enhanced headspace and agitation promote fibrillation of liraglutide. Furthermore, we utilized advanced techniques to probe silicone\u2011oil-liraglutide interactions and interfacial stress, including high\u2011resolution label\u2011free stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) for chemical imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization. We observed, for the first time, the peptide adsorption on the silicone oil surface at submicrometer resolution by SRS. 1H NMR showed line broadening and signal loss, consistent with peptide aggregation or surface adsorption, but no chemical shift changes, supporting the absence of strong, specific interactions. Therefore, our data suggest that the dual air-water and silicone-oil-water interfacial stress plays a significant role in liraglutide aggregation. These findings emphasize the interactive roles of several stress parameters, including silicone oil concentration, silicone oil interface, headspace, and agitation strength, on the stability of peptide combination drug products, and highlight the critical role of interfacial stress-induced biophysical instability.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

TiNb2O7 (TNO) is gaining increasing attention as a promising anode material for high power Li ion batteries due to its high rate capability, excellent structural stability, and safer operating voltage compared to conventional graphite. However, recycling strategies for TNO remain underdeveloped. This study presents a direct recycling approach for TNO anodes recovered from a cycled TiNb2O7/ LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (TNO/NMC622) cell. A full range of procedural steps including electrochemical cycling of the TNO/NMC622 pouch cell, cell dismantling, electrode delamination, materials recovery and repair, and lastly cell remanufacturing and electrochemical evaluation were investigated. The results showed that residual lithium in the TNO can lead to a rutile-type impurity, which is detrimental to performance. To address this, a recycling approach was developed, combining hydrothermal lithium removal with a post heat treatment. Electrochemical testing of the recovered TNO highlighted that lithium removal is crucial as the recovered material without Li removal showed poor performance, while recycled TNO after Li removal exhibited high capacity and excellent rate capability and stability at high current densities, 279(5) and 261(10) mA h g-1 at 2 and 4 A g-1 respectively, similar to top-of-the-range commercial TNO.

Herein, we present an abiotic aqueous system in which aminoacyl phosphate esters bearing alkyne groups undergo a defined sequence of covalent reactions governed by pep-tide-based nucleophiles. In the presence of phenolic groups (e.g., tyrosine), copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) proceeds rapidly, generating mixtures of esters and triazole products. In contrast, cysteine-containing peptides first form selectively thioesters, suppressing early CuAAC and enabling temporal resolution. Monitoring the reaction over time reveals that thiol-copper coordination controls early steps, while self-assembly prolongs intermediate lifetimes, introducing a second layer of regulation. Embedding both nucleophiles in one peptide (Ac-CY) yields a three-step sequence: thioester, diester, followed by CuAAC.

Woo", "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials assembled from inorganic nodes and inorganic linkers. These materials have garnered significant interest for gas separation and storage applications, particularly because of their porosity and their tunability due to their massive design space. However, navigating such a massive design space poses significant challenges. Atomistic simulation techniques have been applied to accelerate discovery and design of MOFs for various applications. A key property obtained from these simulations is the adsorbate probability distribution (APD). An APD maps the probability of finding an adsorbate molecule in the pore of a MOF at a given temperature and pressure, whose maxima correspond to free energy minima (i.e., binding sites). While APDs and binding sites are not easily accessible experimentally, their generation via simulation is tractable. However, high-throughput generation of APDs still requires long simulation times to converge. A machine learning (ML) model to predict APDs would enable the use of this property in data-driven pipelines to identify high performing materials or binding sites. To date, nobody has attempted to apply ML to the prediction of APDs or binding sites of MOFs. \nIn this work, we present DeepAPD \u2013 a ML model which predicts APDs at a given temperature and pressure. As an initial proof of concept, the model has been trained on simple spherical adsorbates such as CH4 and Xe. DeepAPD was found to generate APDs of MOFs at a speedup factor of >105 in comparison to GCMC. An in-depth discussion of training strategies and dataset size/composition on model performance is presented. It was found that the APDs obtained by ML were sufficiently accurate to get a reliable estimation of binding sites in MOFs, particularly binding sites which have high probability. Finally, the transferability of the ML models was investigated by evaluating the performance of the GNN model on a dataset of experimentally characterized MOFs. We have also implemented the DeepAPD inference code into our binding site identification algorithm to facilitate an end-to-end MOF to binding site prediction.

Using amphiphilic distyrylanthracene derivatives, we show that aggregation in water \u2212 triggered via concentration, charge screening, or counterion exchange \u2212 enhances fluorescence and enables light-driven transformations of solar energy into storable fuels, such as hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

Reported herein is a detailed electrochemical study of N2 binding and splitting by a molybdenum complex supported by a diphosphino-thioether (PSP) pincer ligand. Cyclic voltammetry of (PSP)MoCl3 exhibits reversible reductions indicating slow chloride dissociation and a lack of N2 binding, and electrolysis did not result in nitride formation. The corresponding bromide complex, (PSP)MoBr3, was therefore synthesized and characterized by spectroscopy, crystallography, and electrochemical methods. Analysis of scan-rate-dependent cyclic voltammetry of the bromide complex was used determine rate constants for bromide dissociation. Although the first reduction of (PSP)MoBr3 occurs at encouragingly mild potentials with concomitant Br\u2012 dissociation, subsequent binding of N2 requires an additional reduction that occurs at quite negative potentials. Controlled potential electrolysis at the second reduction resulted in successful splitting of N2 to form the nitride complex (PSP)Mo(N)Br.

Two popular lines of argument have been proposed: the \"charge regulation'' (CR) effect, involving reionization and charge reversal, and the \"charge patch'' (CP) effect, arising from the anisotropic distribution of protein charges. In this work, we employ \"explicit-ion based'' coarse-grained simulations to investigate the competing roles of CR and CP interactions in the adsorption of inhomogeneously charged patchy nanoparticles (NPs) as model proteins onto polyelectrolyte brushes. Previous studies have largely reported their contributions as additive, with both independently influencing adsorption behavior. In contrast, our study reveals that these two effects are coupled and interdependent, exerting a synergistic influence on adsorption. High local charge densities (patches) induce strong monopolar charge regulation in a NP, favoring higher charge reversibility near the pI. Additionally, these patches undergo direct complexation with stretched polymer strands via a latching mechanism, accompanied by strong charge regulation and the emergence of higher charge moments, collectively enhancing adsorption in patchy NPs, in cases where a homogeneous NP exhibits negligible adsorption, defying ideal expectations. These strong local electrostatic couplings transcend mean-field descriptions, particularly in patchy NPs. We also observe intriguing asymmetry effects: for patchy NPs, the sign of \u0394pKa = pKa(acid) \u2212 pKa(base) (\u0394pKa << 0 or \u0394pKa >> 0) leads to contrasting uptake behaviors. This asymmetry arises from patch-induced cooperative charge regulation effects, which adds up differently in the two cases, causing huge non-idealities. While previous models of patchy proteins attributed binding affinities to multipolar effects or opposite patch association and counterion release, our study uncovers an additional layer of complexity in the interplay between charge patchiness and charge regulation, which dominates over the others.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymer brushes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we investigated the excited state dynamics of uracil after excitation at 267 nm in both aqueous and deuterated buffered phosphate solutions. We employed broadband transient absorption with femtosecond time resolution, complemented by steady-state absorption spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations. The primary focus is on detecting and investigating the reactivity toward water addition of a recently predicted reaction intermediate, which may lead to the formation of 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrouracil photohydrates. We support the experimentally determined transient absorption spectrum of this intermediate with the simulated absorption spectrum obtained through quantum-chemical calculations, which accounted for both explicit and implicit solvent effects. This comparison confirmed that the transient species can be identified as a ground-state half-chair twisted uracil intermediate. The intermediate is formed in less than 1 picosecond from the decay of the 1pipi* excited state. Additionally, its decay is driven by the nucleophilic addition of a water molecule, which occurs with lifetimes of 22.7 \u00b1 0.2 ps in aqueous solutions and 30.8 \u00b1 0.3 ps in deuterated water solutions.

Here, we explore the role of A-cation chain head and chain length on the structural and optical properties of alkylammonium metal halides, using the well-studied manganese halides A2MnCl4 as a test system. We report the discovery of four new A2MnCl4 compounds based on ammonium (C12-Am and C18-Am) and trimethyl (C14-TMA and C18-TMA) chain heads.

It has been shown that cellulose fibers can act as super-bridging agents offering enhanced turbidity removal when used in conjunction with traditional coagulants and flocculants. Yet, the chemical modification of cellulose fibers and their performance under varying influent conditions remain largely unexplored. In this study, recycled cellulose fibers are modified with quaternary ammonium groups, imparting a positive charge that significantly improves performance. Where conventional treatment (without fibers) reduces turbidity from 62 to 25 NTU, the addition of modified fibers lowers the effluent turbidity to 3 NTU. To assess the robustness of this strategy, influent pH, ionic strength, and turbidity are varied in controlled laboratory experiments. Modified fibers achieve turbidity below 5 NTU across all pHs (7\u20138.9) and initial turbidities (62\u2013285 NTU) tested, whereas the conventional method is unable to reduce turbidity when pH exceeds 7.7. Furthermore, the modified fibers enhance the removal of metals such as Ni, Mn, Zn, Cr, Fe, and Pb. In total, pristine and modified fiber-enhanced treatments remove 52 % and 65 % of metals, respectively, compared to 39 % with the conventional method.

First, we overview recent work in automated active-space selection, which has enabled increasingly large-scale applications of multireference methods to modeling vertical excitations and reactivity. Second, we highlight the increasingly efficient methods for recovering correlation energy beyond the active space, as headlined by extensions of pair-density functional theory and its role in accurate and efficient treatment of excited-state dynamics and its utilization to train machine-learned potentials. Finally, we highlight recent efforts to treat extended systems that until recently have lied beyond the traditional limits of active-space methods, giving center stage to product-form wave functions of the localized active space family of methods that allow for the computation of multiconfigurational band structures.

This step is often rate-limiting for aqueous CO2 capture processes under ambient temperature and pressure, and is precisely the chemistry catalyzed by the family of carbonic anhydrase enzymes. As a result, incorporation of carbonic anhydrases (CAs) into various CO2 capture schemes may be used to accelerate CO2 hydration, increasing the rates of downstream processes coupled to this DIC equilibrium. While this potential use for CA has been long-studied, extending these basic chemical principles to real applications have been hampered by practical questions of how to economically source carbonic anhydrase enzymes at mass scale. This work explores the use of modified cyanobacterial expression hosts as a potential resolution to that problem. Specifically, engineering the surface display of carbonic anhydrases in fast-growing, marine cyanobacteria would yield a self-sustaining CO2 hydration catalyst that requires only sunlight, CO2 itself, and nutrients freely available in seawater, as inputs for passively generating carbonic anhydrases on the cell envelope during cell growth. These possibilities motivated the development of such constructs; their potential for enhancing CO2 hydration rates are reported here.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The gold nanoparticles were obtained at room temperature by adding the precursor to a mixture of water and alcohol under alkaline conditions, or by mixing the precursor with only water and NaBH4. The use of HAuBr4 leads to gold nanoparticles over a wide range of conditions including the use of different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol), for various amount of alcohols (10 to 95 v.%), leading to size control over the nanoparticles in the range 5-30 nm, and to some degree of shape control from spheres to triangles when high contents of ethylene glycol are used with HAuBr4.

This reaction operates at very positive potentials where the electrocatalyst is exposed to highly oxidative conditions and prone to potential-dependent surface structural transformations. While substantial evidence for such surface restructuring exists, its extent and relevance for the catalysts\u2019 activity is unclear. We address this topic for the case of Co3O4, one of the best known electrocatalysts exhibiting surface transformations, by studies of epitaxial (111)-ordered electrodeposited films with combined operando surface X-ray diffraction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements on rotating disk electrodes. Comparison of the as-prepared and the annealed state of the same samples, which both are stable even under long-term oxygen evolution conditions, provides clear insight into the role of surface defects. Our results show that defect-free annealed Co3O4(111) surfaces are structurally stable over a wide potential range and hydroxylate via adsorption at surface oxygen and Co sites. Potential-induced surface restructuring of the Co3O4 lattice only occurs in the presence of surface defects, leading to the formation of the well-known nanometer-thick oxyhydroxide skin layer. The presence of this skin layer promotes oxygen evolution at low overpotentials, but results in higher Tafel slopes. As a result, highly ordered Co3O4(111) surfaces are more active at high current densities than defective Co3O4 surfaces that undergo surface transformation. These results highlight that strategies for catalyst surface defect engineering need to be application-oriented.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we unravel the molecular mechanisms of action of a specific mutation that is linked to startle disease: Asn46Lys (N46K). This residue, in the GlyR extracellular domain, is not directly involved in neurotransmitter binding but can disrupt the neurotransmitter pathway. To understand how, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and mutated extracellular domain of a homomeric alpha1 GlyR, assessing the effects of the Asn46Lys mutation. We then sampled multiple unbinding and binding events by means of metadynamics simulations, with a funnel restraint to limit the exploration in the solvent.

Herein, we describe a practical approach to native chemical ligation at phenylalanine (Phe), via the Phe surrogate 2-mercaptophenylalanine. The commercially available amino acid Boc-2-iodo-phenylalanine was used as a starting material and incorporated at the N-terminus of the peptide via standard solid-phase peptide synthesis. A solid-phase copper-mediated cross-coupling reaction with thioacetic acid was conducted on fully synthesized peptides with an N-terminal Boc-2-I-Phe to introduce, after TFA cleavage and deprotection, a nucleophilic aryl thiolate in the resultant N-terminal residue 2-mercaptophenylalanine (pKa = 5.1). Alternatively, 2-mercaptophenylalanine could be incorporated at the N-terminus via the short synthesis of Boc-2-(S-tert-butyl)-mercaptophenylalanine and coupling to peptide on resin. Peptides containing this amino acid rapidly underwent native chemical ligation reactions with peptides containing C-terminal thioesters. NCL reactions with the thioesters of Gly, Ala, Leu, and Phe were complete in 5 min-1 hour at room temperature at 0.5-2 mM peptide concentrations. Reactions with the more sterically demanding Val and Pro thioesters also proceeded in high yield, in 6 h and 12 h, respectively. NCL reactions with 2-mercaptophenylalanine also proceeded efficiently at pH 5. The peptide ligation product was desulfurized using nickel boride to generate phenylalanine at the ligation site. These results, using commercially available reagents and the possibility of amino acid synthesis on the solid phase which eliminates the requirement for solution-phase amino acid synthesis, represent a practical approach to native chemical ligation at phenylalanine.

However, their oxidative stability deteriorates rapidly under high-voltage conditions, restricting their practical deployment. Previous approaches to extend electrochemical stability have primarily relied on interphase engineering or molecular modifications, under the assumption that oxidative limits are intrinsic and fixed. In this study, we demonstrate that oxidation tolerance is dynamically compromised by lithium-ion (Li\u207a) concentration polarization during the charging process. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals localized Li\u207a depletion at the cathode interface, which disrupts Li\u2013O coordination in the PEO matrix. This depletion increases the electron density on ether oxygen atoms, elevating their HOMO energy and accelerating oxidative degradation. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) directly confirms the correlation between Li\u207a desolvation and HOMO energy elevation. It is further shown that incorporating immobile Mg\u00b2\u207a ions stabilizes Li\u207a coordination, suppresses this polarization-induced HOMO shift and restores oxidative resilience.

Herein, we overcome this limitation by investigating chemiresistive moisture sensing using single crystals of a series of isostructural MOFs, M\u2082(TTFTB) (M2+ = Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+; TTFTB4\u2212 = tetrathiafulvalene tetrabenzoate). We reveal that electrical conductivity in these materials is strongly affected by Coulombic interactions between TTF\u00b7+ radical defects and charge-balancing anions. In dry conditions, these interactions induce charge trapping. The adsorption of water vapor screens the hole-anion interactions, mitigating charge trapping and thereby significantly enhancing electrical conductivity. This mechanism is particularly pronounced in Zn\u2082(TTFTB) owing to the high Coulombic potential of Zn\u00b2\u207a. This study establishes a general methodology for understanding charge transport in MOFs and provides critical guidelines for the rational design of high-performance chemiresistive sensors.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We demonstrate that consistent treatment of the bulk fluid phase in GCMC and TMMC simulations is critical for reconciling isotherms across methods, and we construct simulation-based equations of state for the TIP4P water model to enable rigorous fugacity-to-pressure conversions. Large shifts in the isotherms are observed for two force fields developed using different parameterization strategies, with the GCS force field representing implicitly a defect-containing all-silica zeolite, whereas the TraPPE-zeo force field accurately represents an essentially defect-free all-silica zeolite.

Under dynamic cation switching conditions, this catalyst system yielded monomodal EMA with molecular weight and MA incorporation that can be varied independently. Studies of the EMA revealed that while they retain the thermal and mechanical properties of polyethylene having the same molecular weight, increasing the MA per chain by as few as 1-3 units leads to measurable increase in their wettability and susceptibility toward oxidative cleavage.

X-ray crystal structure determination involving combination of partial diffraction data sets from multiple crystals has been developed for application in structural biology to protein crystals to alleviate similar problems. The potential for adaptation and exploitation in chemistry and materials science, however, is largely unrealised. Here we report the use of synchrotron radiation for multi-crystal X-ray diffraction (MCXRD) adapted for structure determination of metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with crystal dimensions too small for conventional single-crystal diffraction studies. We further show that such methodologies can alleviate the radiation damage that substantially degrades diffraction quality and undermines structure determination. Our approach encompasses both rotation-MCXRD and static-crystal measurements (serial crystallography, SX) for 10s to 1000s of crystals with software-optimised combination of the multiple data sets.

It is shown that in classical Transition State Theory, the unimolecular rate constant is the \u201cthermal frequency\u201d kBT/h times a Boltzmann factor in the free energy of activation, provided the transition state is defined as a slice of 3N-dimensional configuration space of thickness equal to the thermal deBroglie wavelength, where N is the number of atoms in the system. Equivalently, the unimolecular rate constant is the product of a normal mode frequency and a Boltzmann factor in the free energy of activation, provided the free energy is evaluated for a 3N-1 dimensional hypersurface that is perpendicular to the direction of normal mode motion along the reaction coordinate. Various other expressions for the unimolecular rate constant are derived for various other definitions of the transition state. The apparent activation enthalpy and the pre-exponential factor in the Van\u2019t Hoff-Arrhenius equation for the temperature-dependence of the unimolecular rate constant are interpreted in terms of 3N-dimensional thermodynamic properties of the system and the thermal frequency, as well as in terms of 3N-1 dimensional thermodynamic properties of the system and a normal mode frequency.\n     The relationship between the back reaction and the forward reaction is developed, providing an expression for the net rate as a function of thermodynamic driving force. Examples are presented for which the ratio of net rate constant to the unbiased forward rate constant saturates or increases exponentially with increasing thermodynamic driving force.\n     This approach was developed for teaching a graduate course in materials science called \u201cKinetics of Condensed Phase Processes\u201d in the late 20th century.\n", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Processing; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Most compounds (24) showed clearance over 98% across the process for the 3 protein materials. The specific protein characteristics and process parameters for each protein had a minimal impact on clearance, with sieving coefficients essentially the same for each of the 3 protein processes. Physicochemical properties of the studied compounds had a decisive impact on clearance with the octanol-water coefficient (Log P) being most important. Compounds with Log P <4 had sieving coefficients close to ideal clearance, and compounds with Log P >7 showed lower but still significant clearance (> 93%). Other influential parameters on clearance were identified to be polarizability, solvent accessible surface area and molecular weight. Orthogonal Partial Least Square (OPLS) regression models were developed and validated using the sieving coefficient to characterize and predict clearance behaviour of organic compounds during UF/DF. Results from this study lay a solid foundation for the understanding and prediction of UF/DF capacity to remove potential organic leachables.

Specifically, we investigated the adsorption of locked nucleic acid (LNA) and DNA oligomers on MoS\u2082 surfaces in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+, employing [Ru(NH3)6]3+ as an electrostatically adsorbed redox probe. Qsur was determined by removing the diffusion-controlled contribution and subtracting the adsorbed charge (Qads) from the total measured charge (Qtotal). Our results show that interfacial charge is highly sensitive to metal ion identity, nucleic acid backbone chemistry, strand conformation, and nonspecific adsorption\u2014factors that significantly influence diffusion-limited charge transfer. Mg\u00b2\u207a, owing to its higher charge density, induces strong electrostatic interactions with both nucleic acids and MoS\u2082, resulting in pronounced charge accumulation, whereas Na\u207a produces weaker and less predictable effects. Duplex formation reduced surface electropositivity relative to single-stranded probes, while nonspecific adsorption of noncomplementary strands caused large charge perturbations that could mimic hybridization, underscoring potential risks for false positives and the critical need for blocking layers in such biosensing interfaces.

One approach to increase the performance of the blue subpixel is to use thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which combine of a small singlet-triplet gap , EST, and non-trivial spin-orbit coupling to enable the harvesting of both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light; however, device stability is compromised due to long triplet lifetimes that increase the probability of materials degradation by biexcitonic and polaron events. In this work, we correlate the efficiency and stability of the device with the device structure, identifying possible origins for the trade-off between device efficiency and stability. By compar-ing a set of sky-blue emissive devices and fitting drift-diffusion simulations to intermittent opto-electronic measurements during stress-testing, the layers most affected by degradation can be determined. By coupling electrical simulations to an excitonic model, the contributions from biexcitonic and polaronic events to efficiency roll-off can be distinguished. We find that effi-cient, but less stable devices suffer mainly from exciton-exciton annihilation, while stable but less efficient devices have excitons predominantly quenched by polarons. This implies that the device structure is responsible for determining non-radiative exciton pathways, and an efficient and stable OLED structure should aim to minimize exciton accumulation at high brightness.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This framework exploits the internal readability of the SIDT using the node uncertainties and occurrence rates in the configurational space to select sets of calculations to run that are expected to best minimize the uncertainties in the SIDT each iteration. We validate our approach against enumerative DFT and cluster expansion approaches for the HO* dissociation reactions on Ru(0001) with O* as the co-adsorbate showing we are able to reach a mean absolute error of ~0.05 eV relative to DFT in only 43 DFT calculations, only about ~3x the cost of the running isolated calculations for the same configurations. Further, we demonstrate our approach on ammonia decomposition on Pt(111) with N* as a co-adsorbate and for the initial reactions for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on Ru(0001) with OC* as the co-adsorbate.

Herein, for the first time, we report that different intermediates are sequentially formed during the self-assembly process of diphenylalanine and phenylalanine in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ metal ions. These metal ions strongly influence the assembly process, by stabilizing the distinct intermediate structures and retarding the fibril formation, especially at higher metal ion concentrations. Notably, FF-based assemblies (AFF) form stable microspheres in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which persist for long periods without transitioning into fibrils. The enhanced stability is attributed to salt-bridge-mediated crosslinking (by Ca2+) and increased hydrophobic interactions (by Mg2+). When biological molecules like nucleotides and acidic amino acids are introduced into Ca2+ and Mg2+ stabilized AFF intermediates, they chelate the metal ions and disrupt the assembly and stability of intermediates.

Here, we bring the proof of concept of electromediated metal stripping and recovery as a means to alleviate the footprint of late-stage metal recycling processes.

Central to the underlying model is the formation of an adduct between quencher and excited-state (dynamic-quenching), or ground-state (static-quenching), fluorophore at steady-state conditions. Assuming a thermodynamic behavior, that is, large numbers of fluorophore and quencher molecules, the resulting dependency of the ratio between fluorescence intensities, with and without quencher, on quencher's concentration is linear. Yet, alongside abundance reports confirming this linear behavior, numerous observations indicate the dependency can also be non-linear with either upward, or downward, curvature. By maintaining the same physical mechanisms for quenching, in this paper we derive an alternative equation to describe fluorescence quenching. Here however, we assume a local equilibrium (steady-state) between a single-fluorophore and surrounding quencher molecules, effectively, partitioning the (macroscopic) system into many non-interacting small subsystems. Depending on fluorophore's properties, association's strength, and conditions, the resulting behavior exhibits linear dependencies, upward curvatures, or downward curvatures. More specifically, the relation reads, $ I_\\circ/I = 1 + ZK[Q]_T/(1 + (1-Z)K[Q]_T) $, where $K$ is a steady-state equilibrium constant for complex formation and $[Q]_T$ is total concentration of quencher in the small subsystem. The dimensionless parameter $Z$ has different interpretations for dynamic and static mechanisms, though, it is related to the fraction of excited fluorophore. Partitioning the system into small subsystems naturally represents fluorophore-quencher interactions physically confined to restricted volumes. Nonetheless, this model accounts successfully also for deviations from linearity observed in homogeneous solutions. This is plausibly due to limited diffusion, triggering repetitive binding of the fluorophore with the same set of surrounding quenchers. We tested the validity of this equation (except for downward curvatures induced by a static mechanism, in which case a related equation was applied) on 151 experimental fluorescence quenching plots, taken from the literature, operated by dynamic, static, and combined mechanisms. The results of the fitting are excellent with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9985.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With the advent of modern machine learning methods DFT-based calculations of energies and forces have been used to train machine learning (ML) models to learn the inter-atomic potential. However, a fatal flaw in DFT-based calculations is the single-particle approximation-based treatment of the exchange-correlation functionals, which severely limits the accuracy of the calculations for materials with open d and f shell elements. ML predictions trained on such limited-accuracy models are also of limited accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate training sophisticated deep learning based ML models on state-of-the-art ab initio dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of self-energies - the part which is entirely missing in DFT - of real materials. Our calculations show that ML-based methods trained on DMFT self-energies, whereby the ML algorithm is trained to recognise the correlation between non-interacting Green's functions obtained from DFT and self-energies from DMFT, allow the ML models to predict self-energies for Green's functions it has never seen before to a very high accuracy. Taking the example of prototypical SrVO$_3$ a correlated metal, and training on a minimal data set we are able to show that with transfer learning techniques, the ML algorithm is able to predict self energies of CaVO$_3$, BaVO$_3$ and very importantly even for  SrNbO$_3$ - which has a completely different element in the same electronic configuration, and is an extremely important material in terms of futuristic device application as transparent conducting oxide. Our study further shows that the transfer learning technique based on pre-trained models on SrVO$_3$ and SrNbO$_3$ is able to predict the self-energy of BaNbO$_3$ when provided with the non-interacting Green's function, without ever having been trained on its self-energy. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates that ML can predict self-energies of unknown materials using small datasets and transfer learning, drastically reducing computational effort. This approach not only enables efficient predictions but also shows that the physics of diverse systems can be captured with minimal data, paving the way for a transformative shift in materials theory.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Zirconia and especially yttria-stabilized zirconia (3Y-TZP) is commonly used as balls and jar material for mechanochemical reactors due to its excellent mechanical and chemical resistance. The challenge is to develop zirconia balls with supported organic catalysts resistants to shocks and friction generated in mechanochemical conditions. This new feature would open up unexplored routes for chemical synthesis. First examples of direct organo-mechanocatalysis with a piperazine-based organocatalyst, covalently grafted onto amine-functionalized zirconia milling balls are reported. The amine surface coverage was optimized up to 27 NH2/nm\u00b2 with a multistep strategy : initial grafting of phosphonic acid on zirconia, amide bonding via a linker, and subsequent reaction of the remaining surface anhydride groups of the linker with the primary amines of a fourth generation PAMAM dendrimer, which contains 64 terminal primary amines per molecule.  This unprecedented system catalyzed Knoevenagel condensations under solvent-free conditions, operating with thousand-fold less catalyst than traditional methods, achieving full conversion within 3 hours only. Its robustness was demonstrated with a constant catalytic activity after several cycles (more than 10 runs). The turnover frequency (TOF) reached 5700 h\u207b\u00b9, far exceeding that of homogeneous analogues (40 h\u207b\u00b9) due to catalyst low loading and to efficient energy transfer.

Cancer cells in particular rely on these chaperone proteins to facilitate their proliferation and survival. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor, sits at the center of this pathway controlling downstream HSP regulation. HSF1, itself, is upregulated in response to heat or stress.

In this study, we investigate NP enrichment, with and without subsequent mixed-mode anion exchange (MAX) enrichment, for characterizing N- and O-linked glycopeptides in human plasma and CSF. Using the Seer Proteograph XT platform, we demonstrate that NP enrichment significantly enhances the N-glycoproteome coverage, particularly in plasma, and increases the detection of N-glycopeptides from low abundant glycoproteins. These N-glycoproteome improvements are further enhanced when combined with MAX enrichment. For the O-glycoproteome, NP enrichment alone outperformed NP+MAX, suggesting that MAX may preferentially enrich N-glycopeptides. We also generated the first application of the Seer Proteograph XT platform to analyze CSF, another biofluid of interest for biomarker discovery, and found that NP enrichment increased proteome and glycoproteome depth, with notable identification of extracellular vesicle protein biomarkers. Overall, this study highlights the synergy of NP-based enrichment and glycopeptide enrichment for enhancing the glycoproteome coverage of human biofluids and provides a valuable framework for studying glycoproteins in complex biological samples.

We found conjugation of the CDI substituents is the key factor for visible light absorption, with azoben-zenes as an extreme example that results in absorbance out to 600 nm due to new transitions to the lowest unoccupied mo-lecular orbital located on the azo moiety. These zwitterionic adducts are also prone to aggregation, resulting in absorption solvent effects and higher fluorescent emission at lower concentrations (>2.5-fold increase when diluted 10x). Finally, we explored the excited state reactivity of a model adduct which displayed good tolerance for a variety of functional groups, but not single-electron transfer donors and acceptors (e.g., amines, ketones). These results highlight how the structural changes of NHC-CDIs can have profound effects on their interactions with light; we anticipate these relationships will in-form the application of these adducts as dyes, ligands, photocatalysts, or organic charge transport materials.

Although mineral dust aerosol particles containing metal oxides are susceptible to the formation of oxygen vacancies (VO) on their surfaces, the impact of these defects on ice nucleation activity has not been addressed.  To investigate the impact of VO sites, we conducted a droplet immersion freezing assay on zinc aluminate (ZnAl2O4) and magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4) spinels annealed under air, nitrogen, and oxygen atmospheres.  We observe that samples annealed under nitrogen promote ice nucleation at warmer temperatures compared to those treated in oxidizing atmospheres, with the effecting being most pronounced for ZnAl2O4.  To further understand these results, we investigated the immersion freezing of zinc oxide (ZnO) and magnesium oxide (MgO).  Here, we observe that ZnO nucleates ice at substantially warmer temperatures than MgO after annealing under nitrogen.  We hypothesize the trends in ice nucleation activity are due to the varying concentrations of VO that form during the annealing process on the oxide surfaces, which tend to be higher in the absence of O2.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support our hypothesis, indicating VO are more stable on the surfaces of the Zn-containing oxides.

Expert chemists will often use common product ion peaks and neutral losses or peak matching software to predict structural aspects from MS/MS spectra, a process which is time consuming and limited by the molecular entries in the database. We introduce an instrument-agnostic machine learning (ML) framework that predicts functional groups directly from MS/MS spectra, eliminating the need for conventional database searches. The ML models are trained on data from different sources, the Mass Bank of North America (MoNA), a public database, and a custom MS/MS data-base acquired using a single high throughput desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS/MS platform to showcase transferability of model predictions independent of instrument acquisition. Additionally, a novel spectral representa-tion is developed for ML use by standardizing the spectra to the precursor ion m/z. We utilized molecular metrics, specifically, average molecular F1 score of 87% (MoNA) and 76% (DESI) and average molecular accuracy of 94% (MoNA) and 87% (DESI), indicating similar model performance when trained on different databases to validate the ML framework. To further illustrate the robustness and transferability of our ML framework, models trained on DESI-generated data successfully predicted functional groups, using spectral data from blind test set of molecules that were generated by two different company laboratories using distinct mass spectrometry instruments (Orbitrap and TOF) operated in positive-ion mode electrospray ionization.

We introduce a rigorous protocol for benchmarking DFAs for nonadiabatic dynamics regarding the initialization, the dynamics, and its evaluation. Different families of DFAs were compared with a high-level reference, highlighting that electronic populations are an unsuitable metric for evaluating the accuracy of dynamics. We found that several local functionals showed the best agreement of the population decay with the reference RMS-CASPT2, but strictly passed through a deactivation channel dominated by a single-bond torsion that is not accessible in the reference and in the literature.  While using 100% Hartree-Fock exchange in the functional yields the only correct isomerization behaviour, the time scales and quantum yields are far off the reference values, due to an artificial local minimum being predicted along the wrong torsion coordinate.  Static energy scans suggest that this issue can be circumvented by double hybrid functionals, in particular those balancing nonlocal exchange and correlation combined with range-separation. Indeed, they predict energy profiles along the two torsion coordinates in close agreement with the RMS-CASPT2 reference. This emphasizes the impact these DFAs will have on the field of nonadiabatic dynamics once analytical gradients are introduced.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

O2 diffusion, shrinkage strain, and N2 adsorption analyses further confirmed that mixtures with high MgO content were significantly less affected by carbonation, while samples with no or low MgO content showed substantial carbonation-induced damage.\nMicrostructural analysis revealed that higher MgO content facilitated the retention of unreacted MgO (periclase), which plays a crucial role in buffering the pore solution. Upon carbonation, periclase transforms into brucite, hydrotalcite, and magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H)-type phases, thus stabilizing the matrix against carbonation-induced degradation.

The redox-active polymer naphthoquinone-grafted chitosan (NQ-Chit) is produced by grafting naphthoquinones onto chitosan. To fabricate living bioelectronic devices, NQ-Chit is blended with the Generally-recognized-as-safe (GRAS) Gram-positive bacterium Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, deposited on an electrode, and ionically crosslinked. The NQ-Chit hydrogel enhances EET current compared to both pure Chit-encapsulated bacteria and planktonic bacteria with NQ-Chit\u2013coated electrodes, and Michaelis-Menten kinetics can describe the dependence of EET current on the concentration of quinone units. The hybrid devices remain functional even after multiple medium exchanges. The effectiveness of the NQ-Chit to enhance EET across diverse electroactive bacteria and a proof-of-concept biosensor integrating engineered L. plantarum within NQ-Chit hydrogel for detecting environmental chemicals are demonstrated. It is anticipated that the NQ-Chit hydrogel will propel microbial bioelectronics from lab to field.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Biocompatible Materials; Hydrogels; Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While Density Functional Theory (DFT) remains the mainstream method for transition state searches, its inherent trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost persist. To bridge this gap, a generic machine learning potential (DeePEST-OS) covering ten element types is developed for rapid and precise transition state searches in organic synthesis. To address data scarcity, a novel database (~75,000 diverse reactions) is established via a hybrid data preparation strategy, dramatically extending elemental coverage from traditional four elements to ten and reducing the cost of exhaustive conformational sampling in data preparation to 0.01% of full DFT workflows. DeePEST-OS rapidly predicts potential energy surfaces along intrinsic reaction coordinate pathways, achieving speeds nearly four orders of magnitude faster than rigorous DFT computations. By unifying physical priors from semi-empirical quantum chemistry with high-order equivariant massage passing neural networks in a \u0394-learning architecture, DeePEST-OS delivers remarkable accuracy, exhibiting a root mean square deviation of 0.12 \u00c5 for transition states geometries and a mean absolute error of 0.60 kcal/mol for reaction barriers across 1,000 external test reactions. Comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art React-OT model further highlights the superior precision and computational efficiency of our model. Leveraging its broad elemental coverage, DeePEST-OS facilitates practical applications like the retrosynthesis of halogen, sulfur, and/or phosphorus-containing pharmaceuticals such as Zatosetron, a breakthrough previously unachievable with earlier methods.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The success of machine learning-driven projects in chemistry hinges on three key factors: access to robust and comprehensive datasets, a well-defined objective, and effective molecular representations that convert chemical structures into machine-readable formats. Transition metal complexes have lagged behind their organic counterparts on all three of these avenues. The large diversity of structures, coordination numbers and modes have made its translation to a machine-readable format an ongoing challenge. Here we introduce ELECTRUM, an electron configuration-based universal metal fingerprint for transition metal compounds. Its lightweight implementation enables the straightforward conversion of any transition metal complex into a simple fingerprint. Utilising a novel dataset generated from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), we demonstrate that ELECTRUM effectively captures the structural diversity of transition metal complexes. By plotting nearest-neighbor relationships in ELECTRUM space, we reveal meaningful clustering in two-dimensional representations. Furthermore, we use the ELECTRUM encoding to train machine learning models on the prediction of metal complex coordination numbers from ligand structures and metal identity alone. We show that on a subset of this data, we can train models to predict the oxidation state of metal complexes. These case studies showcase the potential of ELECTRUM as an easy-to-implement fingerprint for metal complexes.

Stereospermum kunthianum (Pink Jacaranda) has long been employed in traditional medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases; however, its antibacterial efficacy requires scientific validation. This study investigated the phytochemical constituents and antibacterial activity of stem bark extracts of S. kunthianum. The dried stem bark powder was sequentially extracted with hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol using a Soxhlet apparatus. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids, phenols, steroids, cardiac glycosides, phlobatannins, and carbohydrates. Antibacterial activity was assessed against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, using standard bioassay methods. The extracts demonstrated variable antibacterial effects, with inhibition zones ranging from 5.0 to 17.0 mm. Ethyl acetate and methanol extracts exhibited the most pronounced activity, particularly against S. aureus and E. coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests revealed that methanol extract inhibited S. aureus and E. coli at 12.5 mg/ml, while ethyl acetate extract inhibited S. aureus at 12.5 mg/ml and E. coli at 25 mg/ml. Although less potent than chloramphenicol (control), the findings affirm the antibacterial potential of S. kunthianum stem bark and provide scientific support for its ethnomedicinal use.

These preprocessing steps are not always amenable to non-targeted analyses or quantification of low concentrations of organic compounds in complex mixtures. Here, we explore the use of two analytical methods to measure simple organic molecules in highly saline aqueous solutions (ca. 0.5 M), which were likely in seawater-associated early-Earth environments.

Unlike isolated molecules, crystalline systems require the explicit consideration of long-range order, including supramolecular chirality and collective vibrational motion.  Electronic structure and linear response theory, adapted for the solid state, provide the necessary computational framework. In practice, plane-wave basis sets and pseudopotentials facilitate efficient electronic-structure calculations using Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). A distinctive feature of solid-state VCD is the separation of local terms, which capture intramolecular contributions, from non-local terms, which describe intermolecular couplings. This can be achieved by analysing the response functions using maximally localised Wannier functions (MLWFs). Decomposing the electric and magnetic dipole operators enables the spectra to be interpreted in terms of both molecular and supramolecular chirality. Vibrational modes can be computed either statically, through harmonic normal-mode analysis (NMA), or dynamically, by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which capture anharmonicity and finite-temperature effects. In molecular crystals, Davydov (factor group) splitting determines the IR/VCD-active vibrational manifold due to intermolecular coupling.

However, precursor sensitivity varies dramatically\nacross four distinct ligand classes: biarylphosphines exhibit robust, source-insensitive performance,\nwhile monophosphines and certain bulky ligands show pronounced sensitivity to the Pd source, with\na fourth class remaining inactive regardless of precursor. These trends are rationalized through a\nkinetic framework emphasizing precursor stability under reaction conditions and competing off-\ncycle deactivation pathways. Along the way, we discovered an unprecedented base-promoted\ndecomposition pathway for MeNAP-type precatalysts, explaining discrepancies between in situ use\nand preformed catalysts. Extension to Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling confirms analogous liganddependent\ntrends. For HTE applications with in situ precatalyst formation, [Pd(tBu-indenyl)Cl]\u2082\nemerges as the most robust choice, while commonly used Pd(OAc)\u2082 and Pd\u2082(dba)\u2083 require caution.\nMeNAP precursors can be e=ectively used in high-throughput screening workflows, provided that\nprecautions are taken to mitigate their instability under basic conditions. Beyond catalytic efficiency,\nthese findings have important implications for the reproducibility and comparability of ligand\nscreening studies, where precursor choice can mask or amplify ligand effects.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our strategy involves tuning triplet spin delocalization and the amide C\u2013N bond lengths by covalent (i.e., by O-methylation and N-methylation of AmPyNH) and non-covalent (e.g., via hydrogen bonding) modifications. Spectroscopic studies of AmPy derivatives in solution revealed a unique relationship; shorter amide C\u2013N bond lengths gave lower T1 state energies and larger singlet-triplet energy gaps (\u2206EST), whereas longer amide C\u2013N bond lengths gave higher T1 state energies and smaller \u2206EST.

Computed triplet spin densities and nucleus-independent chemical shifts analyses provide insights to structure\u2013energy relationships underlying the T1 state energies. AmPy derivatives with localized triplet spin densities at distal positions of the non-K region rings exhibited lower T1 state energies and larger \u2206EST, while those with more delocalized spin densities across the \u03c0-system displayed higher T1 state energies and smaller \u2206EST.

Comparisons between \u2018best-fit\u2019 D and G bands reported by different researchers are often difficult, partly because initialization and optimization parameters and background removal procedures are inadequately described.

To illustrate the use of the code, fifteen DGC spectra, and four non-DGC spectra were fitted. RS fits with two Lorentzian functions converged to a single optimized fit for +/- 20 cm^-1 variability of initial peak positions. For five-band fits, in some cases: 1) the final fit varied with the initial values for the functions, and 2) constraints on the peak center locations were required to keep them within expected ranges. When the RS were weaker or there appeared to be large luminescence, the variability in final fits was greater.

Methane emissions in the oil and gas sector follow a heavy-tailed distribution, where underestimating the frequency of short-duration large emitters leads to inaccurate emission inventories. However, even high-frequency surveys may miss short-lived, high-rate emission events. Furthermore, operator-led surveys are routinely followed by repairs of addressable emissions, affecting inventory estimates and introducing uncertainty in measurement-informed inventories (MII). In this study, we developed a stochastic uncertainty estimation model to quantify uncertainties in MII resulting from variation in emitter duration, survey frequency, sample size, technology characteristics, and the effect of repair interventions. We find that quantification accuracy is mainly driven by survey frequency, while precision is driven by sample size. Thus, there exists an optimal combination of survey frequency and sample size that balances operational costs with developing accurate MII. For applications that require an unbiased estimate of emissions to conduct reconciliation (e.g., OGMP 2.0), a higher survey frequency is preferable to larger sample sizes.

Although strategies exist to substantially enhance the brightness of visible dyes, when applied to NIR dyes, these approaches lead to only marginal gains. Here, we report a novel and generalizable strategy to improve NIR fluorophore brightness by leveraging the multiple resonance effect (MRE). Using a library of NIR xanthenes as a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the ability to enhance fluorescence brightness up to ~240 fold by simultaneously improving \u03b5 and \u03a6F. Experimental and computational studies indicate that increased fluorescence brightness is achieved through a decrease in vibronic coupling of the dye, leading to reduced rates of non-radiative decay.

In the majority of cases the disposition of the inverted, fully deprotnated bisTBC[4] ligand favours the formation of [M4] butterflies, with two metals housed in the polyphenolic TBC[4] pockets and two encapsulated in the space between the pockets. The dominant structure directing ability of the ligand is reflected in the similarity of compounds made, despite the differences in the metal ions employed. Indeed, in some 3d-4f cases transition metals (TM) and lanthanide metals (LnM) can be swapped out whilst retaining isostructural topologies. The calixarene binding rules established for TBC[4] are carried forward for bisTBC[4] such that chelating to TMIII is favoured over TMII which is favoured over LnMIII. The addition of co-ligands is found to be both complementary and counter-complementary to cluster growth. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetisation data reveal the presence of both ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in the mixed valent Mn species and the 3d-4f clusters. Strong antiferromagnetic exchange dominates the magnetism of the CuII compounds.

Chemography with Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) was shown to be a promising approach for selecting DELs, offering both intuitive visualization and fast quantitative analysis scalable to thousands of DEL designs. This is achieved by defining each library by a \u201cstand-alone\u201d vector, the comparison of which precludes costly pairwise inter-molecular similarity calculations.

In this paper, the comparative analysis of the Morgan count fingerprint-based chemical-library similarity versus GTM-derived metrics, using 100 diverse DEL subsets and a reference set of compounds tested against cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) from ChEMBL was performed.

Intrinsically fluorescent, Watson\u2013Crick-capable nucleobase analogues are especially powerful because they can precisely probe desired loci and minimally perturb native nucleic acid function. Here, we study the fluorescent responses of the tricyclic pyrimidine analogue DEAtC to base pairing with adenine, guanine, and a set of noncanonical nucleobases in duplex DNA oligonucleotides. We find that single-stranded oligonucleotides containing one DEAtC exhibit up to a 5-fold fluorescence increase upon hybrid duplex formation and base pairing with G, and a lesser degree of fluorescence turn-on when base pairing with inosine. Other purine nucleobases do not induce significant fluorescence turn-on. Solvent kinetic isotope effect studies and differences between the absorption and excitation spectra of DEAtC as dependent on its base pairing partners show that the specificity of its fluorescence turn-on is the result of templation of the emissive C-like tautomer by base pairing, a result that is supported by DFT calculations. Base stacking effects modulate the brightness of DEAtC but do not change the mechanism and specificity of turn-on. Modulation of emission through the control of tautomerism is a powerful approach to creating nucleobase analogues with base pairing-specific fluorescence turn-on.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To that end, we adopt the length and velocity representations for the electric transition dipole moment (TDM), writing both electric and magnetic TDMs expressed as Taylor expansions in nuclear coordinates, including the constant (Franck\u2013Condon, FC), non-Condon linear (Herzberg\u2013Teller, HT) and, in some cases, second-order terms. Our analysis evidences that HT spectra, in the standard formulation, i.e. including the full first-order expansions of both TDMs, are not origin invariant, even in the velocity gauge. This inconsistency arises because the corresponding expression for the rotatory strength, which, unlike the individual TDMs, directly encodes the measurable chiroptical response, involves an incomplete second-order expansion. We show that origin invariance in the velocity gauge is restored when the product terms between the electric and magnetic TDM expansions are selected to yield a complete either first- or second-order expansion of the rotatory strength. In particular, excluding the cross-linear terms in the HT expression results in a consistent linear expansion, which delivers origin invariant rotatory strengths and ECD/CPL lineshapes. We refer to this formulation as the R1 approach. Similarly, including the additional terms required for a complete second-order expansion, i.e., those combining constant and quadratic TDM terms, defines the R2 approach, which also produces origin-invariant rotatory strengths. However, the ECD/CPL spectra lineshapes computed at this level still depend weakly on the gauge origin because the intensity of each single vibronic transition does. Nonetheless, the fact that the integrated ECD/CPL R2 lineshapes remain origin invariant effectively mitigates origin-related variations in the spectra. Simulations of ECD and CPL lineshapes for three representative systems, spanning different non-Condon strengths and sensitivities to the gauge origin, confirm these predictions. All calculations are performed at the TDDFT level, using analytical first-order derivatives and numerical second-order derivatives of the TDMs with respect to nuclear coordinates. The analytical time-correlation functions necessary to run R1 and R2 vibronic computations, in a time-dependent framework, were derived in harmonic approximation,  providing a general and robust route toward origin-independent vibronic simulations of chiroptical spectra.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Our results reveal that increasing pressure unfolds both neutral and charged polymers, while the response to pressure is dampened when the polymer is charged. At pH = pKa, we observe a pressure-dependent transition from neutral-like behavior at low pressure to charged-like behavior at high pressure, suggesting pressure-induced pKa shifts. Extending our study to a model polyampholyte with one acidic and one basic monomer, we observe that the acid and the base are coupled, leading to stabilization of collapsed states. We also observe pressure-induced salt bridge denaturation, suggesting that this stabilization due to acid-base coupling is not sufficient to protect against unfolding due to increasing pressure.

MOFs based on the reo-e or red topologies offer this type of pore system originat-ed from face-shared cuboidal, cuboctahedral, and rhombicuboctahedral cages. For this reason, they have been hypothe-sized and computationally constructed over the past 20 years but have not yet been realized experimentally. We report herein the first examples of MOFs based on the awaited red-a net, denoted as M-red-MOF-1 (M: Fe3+, Cr3+). In particular, the use of the nearly square but with a rectangular connectivity 4-c linker 4,4',4'',4'''-([1,1':4',1''-terphenyl]-3,3'',5,5''-tetrayltetrakis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))tetrabenzoic acid, denoted as H4TCEPT, combined with FeCl3.6H2O under solvothermal reaction conditions, readily afforded Fe-red-MOF-1 as cubic-like single crystals. Extensive structural characterization using SCXRD for unit cell determination, PXRD, SEM, TEM imaging, detailed gas sorption isotherms and TGA, coupled with in-silico materials construction, confirmed that Fe-red-MOF-1 displays the red-a topology. Argon sorption iso-therm recorded at 87 K revealed the presence of three well defined S-type steps, in full agreement with the hierarchical pore network of the red-a net, with an ultrahigh pore volume of 3.56 cm3 g-1 and a BET surface area of 5080.6 m2 g-1. Pore size distribution analysis by fitting the Argon isotherm in the range 0.1-0.99 p/p0 revealed two peaks centered at 29.6 and 41.2 \u00c5, associated with the cuboctahedral and rhombicuboctahedral cages in Fe-red-MOF-1. Notably, the isotherm below 0.1 p/p0 shows a concave shape rather than a convex one as expected for rigid frameworks. The formation of a flexible framework in Fe-red-MOF-1 is supported by SEM and TEM images, revealing that the faces of the cubic particles are curved inwards. These results are consistent with the observed reduced atomic periodicity in Fe-red-MOF-1, as revealed from high-resolution PXRD data. Because of its hierarchical ultrahigh porosity, the hydrogen storage properties of Fe-red-MOF-1 were investigated, revealing an exceptional gravimetric working capacity of 13.5 wt% and a high volumetric ca-pacity (39.5 g\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9) under temperature and pressure swing conditions (77 K/100 bar \u2192 160 K/5 bar), placing this material among the top-performing MOFs. Finally, the isostructural Cr-red-MOF-1 was successfully synthesized by post-synthetic metal exchange reaction. The water sorption properties of this material were investigated by recording the corresponding isotherm at 298 K up to saturation, revealing an astonishing uptake of 2.81 g g-1, which is significantly larger than that of the current top-ranking MOF, Cr-soc-MOF-1 (1.95 g g-1).

Recently emerged alkyl-primary-ammonium-TFSIs (RA-TFSIs), used as HTM additives, exhibit prominent functions as spontaneous perovskite passivators: RA cations spontaneously suppress defects over the perovskite surface during HTM deposition (viz., spontaneous perovskite passivation), while TFSI anions, remaining in the HTM bulk, enhance the hole mobility of the HTMs. Thus, RA-TFSI can enhance PSC performance without additional processes for perovskite passivation.  In RA-TFSIs, their cation composites have been developed, whereas the anion composites remain unexplored. The most commonly used TFSI is a series of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imides, and the functions of other derivative anions (e.g., bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI) and bis(pentafluoroethanesulfonyl)imide (PFSI)) are of interest as HTM additives. However, the effectiveness of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imides remains controversial even in conventional Li-based ones. In this study, the functions of n-octylammonium-TFSI (OA-TFSI), the archetypal RA-TFSI, were compared with those of the newly synthesized OA-FSI and OA-PFSI. Additionally, the effects of Li-based bis(fluorosulfonyl)imides were investigated as references. The anion composites play a pivotal role in changing the ionization energies (IEs) of the HTM, thereby effectively modulating the energy alignment in PSCs. The larger C-F moieties in bis(fluorosulfonyl)imides (i.e., from FSI to TFSI and PFSI) led to deeper IEs, presumably owing to the more delocalized electrons in bis(fluorosulfonyl)imides. In particular, the FSI-based additives led to shallow IEs of the HTMs and exhibited some benefits for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, including their stability, which have rarely been observed using the commonly used TFSI-based additives. This work serves as a guide for nascent yet potent spontaneous perovskite passivators and provides novel insights into HTM additives, which may be a bottleneck of n-i-p structured PSCs, leading to further advancements in PSCs.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the installation of these directing groups onto aromatic units depends on the inherent reactivity patterns of the associated methods (e.g., electrophilic halogenation or C\u2013H borylation), often making it impossible to selectively target all positions.

However, rational design and optimization of PROTACs remain challenging due to the need to balance simultaneous interactions with both an E3 ubiquitin ligase and the target protein. Here we employ native mass spectrometry (MS) as a rapid, label-free platform to screen and characterize the formation and stability of ternary complexes between BCL-xL, VHL E3 ligase complex (VCB), and various targeting PROTACs. Native MS enables direct detection of binary BCL-xL\u25cfPROTAC and ternary BCL-xL\u25cfPROTAC\u25cfVCB complexes and provides semi-quantitative insights into PROTAC affinity and cooperativity with both binding partners. Furthermore, we explore the dissociation pathways of these complexes in the gas phase using collision-induced dissociation (CID) and ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD), revealing distinct fragmentation and subunit release patterns that reflect the structural organization and gas-phase stability of the complexes. Variable-temperature ESI-MS (vT-ESI) further allows assessment of thermal stabilities of the complexes in solution. Together, our study demonstrates the power of native MS to both screen and mechanistically characterize PROTAC-induced ternary complex formation.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Unfortunately, in most cases, energy-demanding and/or several high purity chemicals are required to achieve a fine and reproducible size control. Here, the unique features of a room temperature synthesis of gold nanoparticles simply obtained using only NaBH4 and HAuCl4 in water, without the need for any other chemicals, are exploited.

Dysregulation is linked to diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and Alzheimer's, making them key drug targets.  High interest in this protein family has yielded large amounts of available structure and ligand data.  Fragment-based drug design has shown promise in developing kinase inhibitors, but often ignores kinase-specific knowledge. The KinFragLib library addresses this by fragmenting co-crystallized kinase ligands based on functionally relevant subpockets, resulting in a library of 7486 fragments from 2553 kinase-ligand complexes. Despite the extensive chemical space spanned by this library, enumerating all possible recombinations is computationally infeasible. To tackle this, we developed an automated Python pipeline that orchestrates fragment growing within the binding site of any protein kinase of interest, employing SeeSAR's docking engine.  A guided template docking search, informed by subpocket-specific information, reduces the combinatorial space, ensuring efficient ligand generation. In a case study, we applied our subpocket-based docking approach on a PKA kinase, generating 33,758 compounds. 1154 of these compounds were considered drug-like according to the Rule of Five and have HYDE affinity scores in the nM range.

Translational energy distributions of scattered species collected as a function of collision geometry probe both impulsive scattering (IS) and thermal desorption (TD) mechanisms. We find that CD4 scattering is dominated by IS and exhibits a super-specular angular distribution. The fraction of TD scattering events is notably smaller for cold salty water than for dodecane, consistent with a higher free energy of solvation for CD4 in the water jet.

The IS channel for CD4 was analyzed using a soft-sphere model, yielding a higher internal energy (Eint) and lower effective surface mass (meff) than was seen for Ne/water; the higher value of Eint is attributed to rotational excitation of the scattered CD4.

Using principles of DC-DFT, we illustrate several pitfalls when analyzing HF-DFT errors, including an interpolator for density-driven errors that is chronically inaccurate, using proxies instead of accurate densities, and conflating common measures of density errors with those of DC-DFT.  We report ideal density-driven errors for one- and two-electron systems, where we can calculate most properties exactly, illustrating these problems. A simple analysis of benchmarking data shows that proxy densities proposed in recent literature are too inaccurate to be useful in DC-DFT.

We identify conditions in which short-lived activated esters formed by the aqueous carbodiimide EDC promote isopeptide bond formation specifically at pre-associated amine-acid pairs by creating barriers to diffusive reactivity. For native antibody (Ab) labeling, we show that the small IgG-binding protein GB1 can be covalently attached to the Ab Fc domain, and introduction of Cys into GB1 loops allows for facile conjugation of fluorophores, micelles, or inorganic nanocrystals for imaging in live cells and animals. By varying Cys substituents and GB1:IgG stoichiometry, a defined number of probes can be uniformly attached without the need for extensive purification. In live-cell confocal microscopy, labeled GB1 serves as a stable replacement for secondary Ab, enabling simple multicolor immunostaining and imaging.

To establish a clear structure-activity relationship (SAR), this study investigated the in vitro effects of four novel phenolic-branched fatty acids and their corresponding ethylenediamine-carrying amides on three cacao pathogen isolates (one Pestalotiopsis sp. and two C. gloeosporioides). A high degree of isolate-specific susceptibility was observed, and the chemical structure of the compounds was found to be the key determinant of antifungal efficacy. A phenol-branched soy oil-derived fatty amide (PhSOAM) proved most potent, significantly inhibiting the growth of Pestalotiopsis sp. and one C. gloeosporioides isolate, while the second C. gloeosporioides isolate was completely resistant. The conversion of the carboxylic acid to its amide derivative was critical for this enhanced activity. Notably, PhSOAM uniquely altered fungal colony morphology by increasing the length-to-width ratio, suggesting a mechanism of action involving the disruption of polarized growth. Multivariate analyses and machine learning models, developed to predict pathogen growth (R\u00b2 up to 0.94), identified the specific compound structure and pathogen isolate as the most critical factors determining the interaction outcome.

Although classical free energy perturbation (FEP) methods provide very accurate lattice free energy estimates, their scalability in large polymorphic landscapes is limited by the need to ergodically sample one chain of overlapping alchemical Boltzmann distributions per polymorph. In contrast, targeted free energy perturbation (TFEP) can converge free energies of the same accuracy directly on the existing physical data sampled in each polymorph. The only major challenge in TFEP is obtaining an accurate bijective mapping between each polymorph and a common reference distribution. To achieve a general mapping strategy, we turn to normalising flow neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of normalising-flow enhanced TFEP in molecular crystals. Specifically, we describe a normalising flow architecture, based on spline-coupling, that can achieve a significant overlap between a Boltzmann distribution of a molecular crystal supercell and the artificial distribution learned by a probabilistic generative model (PGM) trained by example on relatively small amounts of MD data. The accuracy and efficiency of this approach were assessed by comparing PGM-based FE estimates to the reference FE estimates from the Einstein crystal method (ECM).

A compelling agreement in accuracy between the PGM and the ECM was observed in the polymorphic landscapes for these three compounds across all supercell sizes that were considered. In addition to showing that normalising flow can provide reliable free energy estimates in systems that are significantly more complex compared to those previously studied at a significantly lower cost than ECM, we also discuss how one can further improve the cost-effectiveness of this approach.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Statistical Mechanics; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Primary and aryl-substituted \u03b1-ketoacids undergo direct acyl radical addition to allylic difluorides, yielding exclusively acylated products. In contrast, secondary 2-oxoacids afford mixtures of acylated and alkylated products, while tertiary 2-oxoacids selectively deliver alkylated products via a decarboxylative/decarbonylation cascade.

The rate of decarbonylation vs radical addition is based on the stability and reactivity of the radical intermediate formed.

In this study, we investigate the efficiency of HC transfer from silver (Ag) NCs of varying sizes to two perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), namely, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory, we present the real-time dynamics of plasmon formation, HC generation, and HC transfer from Ag NCs to PFAS. Our findings reveal that although the probability of direct hot electron transfer (DHET) decreases with increasing NC size, the net amount of electron transfer does not exhibit a simple size-dependent trend. Instead, it is governed by the interplay between the electronic structures of the NC and the PFAS molecule. Specifically, smaller NCs exhibit Rabi-type oscillations in charge transfer, indicating back-and-forth electron transfer between Ag nanoclusters and PFAS molecules. In contrast, larger NCs support more unidirectional and stable electron transfer. These findings offer mechanistic insights into size- and electronic structure-dependent HC generation and transfer to PFAS, and provide design principles for more efficient plasmon-driven degradation strategies of PFAS and other related environmental contaminants.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, there is currently little understanding of how dough formulation and extrusion temperatures impact these properties. Hence, we used closed-cavity rheometry (CCR) to characterise soy protein concentrate (SPC) doughs under conditions varying in protein source, pH, moisture content M, and temperature T. We then fitted both a constitutive Herschel-Bulkley (HB) model to steady-shear data and a descriptive model to strain sweep data. Subsequently, a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model was applied to link the experimental factors and model parameters. We show that the temperature and moisture effects can be aggregated via the ratio Tg/T, with Tg being the moisture-dependent glass transition temperature. The yield stress \u03c40, elastic modulus G0, and the loss factor tan (\u03b4) were influenced primarily by Tg/T and, to a lesser degree, by the pH of the dough. In contrast, parameters describing rheology at high shear rates, the critical shear rate and the strain thinning index, are not affected by formulation, pH, moisture, or temperature. The protein solubilities of the two SPCs were significantly different, yet we observed similar rheological behaviour when their doughs were shifted to the same pH.

We debundled and separated CNTs from soots produced using iron (Fe) nanocatalysts, and distributed the CNTs on a monolayer graphene support for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging to gain mechanistic insights into how Fe nanocatalysts nucleated and grew CNTs in a thermal plasma.

Herein, we overcame this fundamental limitation by precisely engineering the microenvironment around copper single-atom using P-doping to introduce non-coordinating -PO2 group, which induced the transformation of symmetric CuN4 site into low-coordinated, asymmetric electron-rich CuN3 configuration. Crucially, the CuN3 site and proximal -PO2 group, co-located at pore defect, created an enzyme-mimicking catalytic pocket. When applied for the model reaction of acetylene hydrochlorination, these biomimetic CuN3 and -PO2 catalytic units enabled the profound synergistic effect, dramatically enhancing the adsorption, activation and dissociation of HCl to form the active Cu-Cl\u03b4-/P-O-H\u03b4+ intermediates. Once C2H2 approached these activated species, it became polarized due to the local micro-electric field arising from the electronegativity differences between Cu-Cl\u03b4- and P-O-H\u03b4+, thus lowering the barrier of rate-limiting step for C2H3Cl formation. This process endowed the P-doped Cu SAC with the dramatically enhanced acetylene hydrochlorination activity far surpassing conventional Cu-based catalysts and outstanding stability (>260 hours with only 1.12% coking).

In this paper, we have explored barrier+liner materials composed of 1 and 2 monolayers (MLs) of Ru-passivated epsilon-TaN and Ru doped epsilon-TaN and focus on their interactions with Cu through the adsorption of small Cu clusters with 1-4 atoms. Moreover, different doping patterns for Ru doping in TaN are investigated to understand how selective doping of the epsilon-TaN surface influences surface stability. We found that an increased concentration of Ru atoms in the outermost Ta layer improves the adhesion of Cu. The strongest binding of the Cu atoms was found on the 100% Ru doped surface followed by 1 ML Ru passivated surface. These two surfaces are recommended for the combined barrier+liner for Cu interconnects. The closely packed arrangements of Cu were found to exhibit weak Cu-slab and strong Cu-Cu interactions, whereas the sparse arrangements of Cu exhibit strong Cu-slab and weak Cu-Cu interactions. The Cu atoms seem to bind more favourably when they are buried in the doped or passivated surface layer due to the increase in their coordination number. This is facilitated by the surface distortion arising from the ionic radius mismatch between Ta and Ru. We also show that the strong Cu-Cu interaction alone cannot predict the association of Cu atoms as a few 2D Cu clusters showed stronger Cu-Cu interaction than the 3D clusters, highlighting the importance of Cu-surface interactions</div>", "date": "2020-02-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Coating Materials; Materials Processing; Thin Films; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Most frequently, theoretical studies of the addition and H-elimination reactions of dimethyl sulfide with hydroxyl radicals are studied considering the presence of oxygen that further reacts with the radicals formed in the initial steps. Although the reaction of intermediate species with additional hydroxyl radicals has been considered as part of the global mechanism of oxidation, few if any attention has been dedicated to the possibility of reactions of the initial radicals with a second \u2022OH molecule. In this work we performed a computational study using quantum-chemical methods, of the mechanism of H-abstraction from dimethyl sulfide under normal atmospheric conditions and in reaction chambers at different O2 partial pressure, including complete absence of oxygen. Additionally, important rate coefficients were computed using canonical and variational transition state theory. The rate coefficient for abstraction affords a 4.72 x 10-12 cm3 molecule1 s-1 value, very close to the most recent experimental one (4.13 x 10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1). According to our best results, the initial methyl thiomethyl radical was obtained at -25.2 kcal/mol (experimentally -22.4 kcal/mol), and four important paths were identified on the potential energy surface.

If every intermediate was tested, assembly would often get stuck in an entropic trap and essentially every capsid would follow a unique assembly path. Yet, capsids assemble rapidly with minimal trapped intermediates, a realization of the Levinthal paradox. To understand the fundamental mechanisms of capsid assembly it is critical to resolve the early stages of the reaction. We have used Time-Resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering, which is sensitive to solute size and shape and has millisecond temporal resolution. Scattering curves were fit to a thermodynamically curated library of assembly intermediates, using the principle of maximum entropy. Maximum entropy also provides a physical rationale for the selection of species.  We found that the capsid assembly pathway was exquisitely sensitive to initial assembly conditions. With the mildest conditions tested, the reaction appeared two-state from dimer to 120-dimer capsid with some dimers-of-dimers and trimers-of-dimers. In slightly more aggressive conditions, we observed transient accumulation of a decamer-of-dimers and appearance of 90-dimer capsids. In conditions where there is measurable kinetic trapping, we found that a highly diverse early intermediates accumulated within a fraction of a second and propagated into long-lived kinetically trapped states (>90-mer). In all cases, intermediates between 35 and 90 subunits did not accumulate. These results are consistent with the presence of low barrier paths that connect early and late intermediates and direct the ultimate assembly path to late intermediates where assembly can be paused.", "date": "2020-02-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Self-Assembly; Structure; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The available templates that get selected for inclusion in these machine learning models have been previously limited to those that appear frequently in the reaction databases and exclude potentially useful transformations. By augmenting open-access datasets of organic reactions with artificially calculated template applicability and pretraining a template relevance neural network on this augmented applicability dataset, we report an increase in the template applicability recall and an increase in the diversity of predicted precursors. The augmentation and pretraining effectively teaches the neural network an increased set of templates that could theoretically lead to successful reactions for a given target. Even on a small dataset of well curated reactions, the data augmentation and pretraining methods resulted in an increase in top-1 accuracy, especially for rare templates, indicating these strategies can be very useful for small datasets.", "date": "2020-02-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, it is a challenge to represent the high-dimensional structural and functional landscapes of an ESF map and to identify energetically favourable and functionally interesting polymorphs among the 1,000s-10,000s of structures typically on a single ESF map. Here, we introduce geometric landscapes, a representation for ESF maps based on geometric similarity, quantified by persistent homology. We show that this representation allows the exploration of complex ESF maps, automatically pinpointing interesting crystalline phases available to the molecule.

Biological electron transfer is often simultaneous with proton transfer\nin order to avoid the high-energy, charged intermediates resulting from the\nstepwise transfer of protons and electrons. These concerted proton electron\ntransfer (CPET) reactions are implicated in numerous biological electron\ntransfer pathways. In many cases, proton transfer is coupled to long-range\nelectron transfer. While many studies have shown that the rate of electron\ntransfer is sensitive to the distance between the electron donor and acceptor,\nextensions to biological CPET reactions are sparse. The possibility of a unique\nelectron transfer distance dependence for CPET reactions deserves further\nexploration, as this could have implications for how we understand biological\nelectron transfer.

As for every mass product, there are problems associated with the waste it causes. One has found that residues of hormones in the urine of woman cannot be removed sufficiently from waste-water and this, in-turn, has already observable and undesired consequences in the biosphere. Apart from the removal of drugs, one is in general seeking new methods for the removal of hydrophobic impurities from waste-water. An ideal system would quantitatively take up the impurity, entrap it followed by preferably simple separation. Finally, one wants to reuse the absorbent, which implies the possibility for regeneration and recycling. Such as complex set of tasks requires a relatively complex materials architecture. Functional organic polymers with high affinity towards the drug, with stable open porosity and high surface area, stimuli-responsive properties and in the form of colloidal dispersions could do the job. Unfortunately, such a system does not exist. We solved this problem by generating mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles, which are monomers at the same time. Initiation of the polymerization reaction by surface-bound pore-walls leads to the formation of a special type of block-copolymer. The pore-walls are covered by the polymer, which cannot leach. An orthogonal modification was achieved by modification of the external surfaces of the particles with a thermoresponsive polymer by click-chemistry. The final core-shell system was able to remove hydrophobic molecules such as the hormone  progesterone from water. A change of temperature induces the collapse of the thermoresponsive polymer, which closes the pores and induces aggregation of the particles. After separation of the particles, and thus also the entrapped impurity, from the solvent, one can re-open the pores, which leads to a release of the adsorbed compound(s).", "date": "2020-02-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we augment that approach by coupling large scale enumeration and cloud-based FEP profiling with goal-directed generative machine learning, which results in a higher enrichment of potent ideas compared to large scale enumeration alone, while simultaneously staying within the bounds of a predefined drug-like property space.

Despite their importance in the carbon cycle and the scarcity of Fe in seawater, the Fe requirements, storage and cytosolic utilization of these marine heterotrophs has been less studied. Here, we characterized the Fe metallome of Pseudoalteromonas (BB2-AT2).

We have developed a novel strategy for the preparation and atomic-level characterisation of aromatic compounds with vinyl functional groups. Such compounds are highly sought after since they make exceptional polymers. Until now, however, deliberate synthetic methods and precise structural details have eluded researchers. We addressed this challenge by using a metal-organic framework as a matrix to isolate the vinyl groups. Cyclobutyl rings serve as synthetic precursors. The expulsion of ethylene from them delivers the desired compounds. This transformation is unprecedented in the literature. The framework is unperturbed by the high temperature required for thermolysis, which itself is a startling observation. We further show how the inherent reactivity of the vinyl groups can be harnessed to deliver addition products in quantitative yields. The two transformations take place in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal manner without changing the overall network structure of the parent framework. This manuscript defines a new strategy for preparing and studying an important class of compound using site-isolation in a framework matrix. It will thus appeal to synthetic chemists, materials scientists and crystallographers.

Functional <i>tags</i> are conjugated via the azide, and can be <i>removed (i.e. un-tagged)</i> when needed at the acyl hydrazone via exchange with hydroxyl amine.

This ability to <i>write</i>, <i>tag</i>, <i>un-tag</i> and <i>permanently tag</i> DNA is exploited to sequentially introduce two fluorescent dyes on DNA. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the method by developing a protocol to sort labeled DNA using magnetic beads, with subsequent amplification of the sorted DNA sample for further analysis.

We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training.

With the increasing maturity of target prediction methods, researchers have started to explore ways to expand their scope to more challenging molecules such as structurally complex natural products and macrocyclic small molecules. In this work we systematically explore the capacity of an alignment-based approach to identify the targets of structurally complex small molecules (including large and flexible natural products and macrocyclic compounds) based on the similarity of their 3D molecular shape to non-complex molecules (i.e. more conventional, \"drug-like\", synthetic compounds). For this analysis, query sets of ten representative, structurally complex molecules were compiled for each of 35 pharmaceutically relevant proteins. Subsequently, ROCS, a leading shape-based screening engine, was utilized to generate rank-ordered lists of the potential targets of the 35x10 queries according to the similarity of their 3D molecular shape with that of compounds from a knowledge base of 272 640 non-complex small molecules active on a total of 3642 different proteins. Four of the scores implemented in ROCS were explored for target ranking, with the TanimotoCombo score consistently outperforming all others. The score successfully recovered the targets of 29% and 40% of the 350 queries among the top-5 and top-20 positions, respectively. For 29 out of the 35 investigated targets (83%), the method correctly assigned the first rank (out of 3642) to the target of interest for at least one of the ten queries. The shape-based target prediction approach showed remarkable robustness, with good success rates obtained even for compounds that are clearly distinct from any of the ligands present in the knowledge base. However, complex natural products and macrocyclic compounds proved to be challenging even with this approach, although cases of complete failure were recorded only for a small number of targets.", "date": "2020-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemoinformatics; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

It has a highsymmetry space group, Pm3,\u00afm with a lattice parameter of 12.776 \u00c5, as determined by X-ray diffraction at 100 K. The structure consists of a random distribution of two perpendicular basic zinc carboxylate nodes and axially disordered cubylene spacers, so the observed high-symmetry structure is an average of several lower-symmetry unit cells. The binary orientational disorder of the nodes has significant influence on the uniaxial rotation of the edges, realizing a previous idea of robust dynamics1. The structural and dynamical ifferences of 1 and MOF-5 are based on the local symmetry and the electronic structure of the organic components: i) the lack of conjugation in cubane-1,4-dicarboxylate does not fix the orientation of the nodes; and ii) the incomplete match of the cubylene (rotor) and dicarboxylate (stator) units facilitates the rotation of the cubylene units even at 100 K. The calculated rotation barrier is unusually low, and it depends on the orientation of the adjacent carboxylate units. The crystals of 1 can be activated either at elevated temperature in vacuum or at ambient conditions by solvent exchange.

We study the relative magnitude of configurational and QM-region sensitivity of energetic and electronic properties in a representative Zn<sup>2+</sup>metal binding site of a DNA methyltransferase. To quantify property variations, we analyze snapshots extracted from 250 ns of molecular dynamics simulation. To understand the degree of QM-region sensitivity, we perform analysis using QM regions ranging from a minimal 49-atom region consisting only of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>metal and its four coordinating Cys residues up to a 628-atom QM region that includes residues within 12 \u00c5 of the metal center. Over the configurations sampled, we observe that illustrative properties (e.g., rigid Zn<sup>2+</sup>removal energy) exhibit large fluctuations that are well captured with even minimal QM regions. Nevertheless, for both energetic and electronic properties, we observe a slow approach to asymptotic limits with similarly large changes in absolute values that converge only with larger (ca. 300-atom) QM region sizes. For the smaller QM regions, the electronic description of Zn<sup>2+</sup>binding is incomplete: the metal binds too tightly, is too stabilized by the strong electrostatic potential of MM point charges, and the Zn-S bond covalency is overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that efficient sampling with QM/MM in small QM regions is an effective method to explore the influence of enzyme structure on target properties. At the same time, accurate descriptions of electronic and energetic properties require a larger QM region than the minimal metal-coordinating residues in order to converge treatment of both metal-local bonding and the overall electrostatic environment.", "date": "2020-02-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinorganic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the first step, appropriate ab initio wavefunctions for the various ionic fragments (lanthanide ion and coordinating ligands) are separately optimized, accounting for the electrostatic influence of the surrounding environment, within various approximations. In the second and final step, the scalar relativistic (DKH2) electrostatic Hamiltonian of the whole molecule is represented on the basis of the optimized metal-ligand multiconfigurational non-orthogonal group functions (MC-NOGF), and reduced to an effective (2J+1)-dimensional non-orthogonal Configuration Interaction (CI) problem via L{\\\"o}wdin-partitioning.

We perform an in silico transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TRXAS) experiment at the oxygen K-edge to investigate its potential to monitor the proposed ultrafast decay pathways in malonaldehyde upon photoexcitation to its bright S2(pp*) state. We employ both restricted active space perturbation theory and algebraic diagrammatic construction for the polarization propagator along interpolated reaction coordinates as well as representative trajectories from ab initio multiple spawning simulations to compute the TRXAS signals from the lowest valence states. Our study suggests that oxygen K-edge TRXAS can distinctly fingerprint the passage through the H-transfer intersection and the concomitant population transfer to the S1(np*) state. Potential intersystem crossing to T1(pp*) is detectable from reappearance of the double pre-edge signature and reversed intensities. Moreover, the torsional deactivation pathway induces transient charge redistribution from the enol side towards the central C-atom and manifests itself as substantial shifts of the pre-edge features.

Both tests can be carried out in closed tubes with either fluorescence or colorimetric (e.g., leuco crystal violet LCV) detection. COVID-19 LAMP performs on par with COVID-19 RT-PCR. COVID-19 RAMP has 10 fold better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing purified targets and 100 times better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing rapidly prepared sample mimics.

The devices offer a great potential for advanced computing and data storage, including neuromorphic networks and resistive random-access memory. However, as for many other cases, the presence of a real interface (metal - metal oxide) has numerous disadvantages. The realization of interface-free, respectively Schottky-barrier free memristors is highly desirable.

The electric conductivity is realized by segments made of highly-doped antimony tin oxide (ATO) transitioning into pure tin oxide (TO). Complex nanoarchitectures are presented, which include ATO-TO, ATO-TO-ATO nanowires either with a stepwise distribution of antimony or as a graded functional material. The electrical characterization of the materials reveals that the introduction of memristive properties in such structures is possible.

Recently, researchers have demonstrated that machine learning models can automate this process to predict the coordinating environments of absorbing atoms from their XAS spectra. However, machine learning models are often difficult to interpret, making it challenging to determine when they are valid and whether they are consistent with physical theories. In this work, we present three main advances to the data-driven analysis of XAS spectra: we demonstrate the efficacy of random forests in solving two new property determination tasks (predicting Bader charge and mean nearest neighbor distance), we show that multiscale featurization can elucidate the regions and trends in spectra that encode various local properties, and we address the effect of normalization on model interpretability. The multiscale featurization transforms the spectrum into a vector of polynomial-fit features, and is contrasted with the commonly-used \"pointwise\" featurization that directly uses the entire spectrum as input. We find that across thousands of transition metal oxide spectra, the relative importance of features describing the curvature of the spectrum can be localized to individual energy ranges, and we can separate the importance of constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic trends, as well as the white line energy.

By analyzing different substitution patterns over several sets of isomeric compounds, we show that IRIS produces a highly consistent and distinct pattern of IR bands, especially in the range between 650 and 900 cm<sup>-1</sup>, that are mostly independent of the specific chemical functionality contained in the substituent group.

Aiming to leverage the perspective provided by large datasets, here we created and screened a topologically diverse database of 8,500 MOFs to interrogate whether thermodynamic stability metrics such as free energy could be used to generally predict the synthetic likelihood of computationally constructed MOFs.

Aiming to meet these benchmarks, we have combined the advantages of asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) catalysis with a N-terminal cysteine trapping reaction and created a chemo-enzymatic labeling system. In this approach, polypeptide with a Asn-Cys-Leu recognition sequence are ligated with a counterpart possessing an N-terminal Gly-Leu by AEP; the byproduct Cys-Leu is subsequently trapped by a stable and inexpensive scavenger, 2-formyl phenylboronic acid (FPBA), to yield an inert thiazolidine derivative, thereby driving the reaction forward to product formation. By carefully screening the reaction conditions for optimal compatibility and minimal hydrolysis, conversion to the ligated product in the model reaction resulted in excellent yields.

ME47, however, displays propensity for instability and misfolding. We therefore sought to improve ME47's structural and functional features. We used phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) to uncover \"nonrational\" changes to complement our rational design. PACE mutated Arg12 that contacts the DNA phosphodiester backbone. We would not have rationally made such a change, but this mutation improved ME47's stability with little change in DNA-binding function. We mutated Cys29 to Ser and Ala in ME47's HLH to eliminate undesired disulfide formation; these mutations reduced E-box binding activity. To compensate, we fused the designed FosW leucine zipper to ME47 to increase the dimerization interface and improve protein stability and E-box targeting activity. This \"franken-protein\" MEF comprises the Max basic region, E47 HLH, and FosW leucine zipper\u2014plus mutations that arose during PACE and rational design\u2014and is a tractable, reliable protein in vivo and in vitro.

Moreover, efficient two-color\nhybrid warm white OLEDs (CIE<sub>x,y</sub> = 0.43, 0.45) were achieved using\nCN-TPB-TPA as the blue-emitting layer and phosphor doped host, which realized\nmaximum current, power, external quantum efficiencies 58.0 cd A<sup>-1</sup>,\n60.7 lm W<sup>-1</sup> and 19.1%, respectively.

Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (\u0394G), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues.

RPA relative errors consistently range between 5-10%, significantly less than reported previously using smaller basis sets, whereas spin-scaled MP2 methods show limitations similar to MP2, albeit less pronounced, and empirically dispersion-corrected DFAs perform almost as well as RPA. Regression analysis reveals a systematic increase of relative MP2 binding energy errors with the system size at a rate of approximately 0.1% per valence electron, whereas the RPA and dispersion-corrected DFA relative errors are virtually independent of the system size. These observations are corroborated by a comparison of computed rotational constants of organic molecules to gas-phase spectroscopy data contained in the ROT34 benchmark. To analyze these results, an asymptotic adiabatic connection symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (AC-SAPT) is developed which uses monomers at full coupling whose ground-state density is constrained to the ground-state density of the complex. Using the fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem, we obtain a nonperturbative \u201cscreened second-order\u201d expression for the dispersion energy in terms of monomer quantities which is exact for non-overlapping subsystems and free of induction terms; a first-order RPA-like approximation to the Hartree, exchange, and correlation kernel recovers the macroscopic Lifshitz limit. The AC-SAPT expansion of the interaction energy is obtained from Taylor expansion of the coupling strength integrand. Explicit expressions for the convergence radius of the AC-SAPT series are derived within RPA and MBPT and numerically evaluated. Whereas the AC-SAPT expansion is always convergent for nondegenerate monomers when RPA is used, it is found to spuriously diverge for second-order MBPT, except for the smallest and least polarizable monomers. The divergence of the AC-SAPT series within MBPT is numerically confirmed within RPA; prior numerical results on the convergence of the SAPT expansion for MBPT methods are revisited and support this conclusion once sufficiently high orders are included. The cause of the failure of MBPT methods for NIs of large systems is missing or incomplete \u201celectrodynamic\u201d screening of the Coulomb interaction due to induced particle\u2013hole pairs between electrons in different monomers, leaving the effective interaction too strong for AC-SAPT to converge. Hence, MBPT cannot be considered reliable for quantitative predictions of NIs, even in moderately polarizable molecules with a few tens of atoms. The failure to accurately account for electrodynamic polarization makes MBPT qualitatively unsuitable for applications such as NIs of nanostructures, macromolecules, and soft materials; more robust non-perturbative approaches such as RPA or coupled cluster methods should be used instead whenever possible.<br />", "date": "2020-02-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

High residual chlorine concentrations lead to unpleasant odours and tastes, while low concentrations may lead to inadequate disinfection. The concentration is most commonly monitored using colorimetric techniques which require additional reagents. Electrochemical analysis offers the possibility for in-line analysis without the need for additional reagents. Electrochemical-based detection of chlorine is influenced by the solution pH, which defines the particular chlorine ionic species present in solution. As such, controlling the pH is essential to enable electrochemical based detection of residual chlorine in water. To this end, we explore the application of solid state interdigitated electrodes to tailor the in-situ pH of a solution while simultaneously detecting free-chlorine.  Finite element simulations and subsequent electrochemical characterization, using gold interdigitated microelectrode arrays, were employed to explore the feasibility of an in-situ pH control approach. In practice, the approach converted residual chlorine from an initial mixture of two species (hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion), to one species (hypochlorous acid). Chlorine detection was shown in water samples using this exploratory method, resulting in a two-fold increase in signal response, compared to measurements without pH control. Finally, tap water samples were measured using the in-situ pH control method and the results showed excellent correlation (within experimental error) with a commercial instrument, demonstrating the efficacy of the developed technique.

For the human adenosine A1 receptor (hA1AR) this has led to the discovery of capadenoson, which has been in phase IIa clinical trials for heart failure. Accordingly, the design and profiling of novel hA1AR partial agonists has become an important research focus. In this study, we report on LUF7746, a capadenoson derivative bearing an electrophilic fluorosulfonyl moiety, as an irreversibly binding hA1AR modulator. Meanwhile, a nonreactive ligand bearing a methylsulfonyl moiety, LUF7747, was designed as a control probe in our study. In a radioligand binding assay, LUF7746\u2019s apparent affinity increased to nanomolar range with longer pre-incubation time, suggesting an increasing level of covalent binding over time. Moreover, compared to the reference full agonist CPA, LUF7746 was a partial agonist in a hA1AR-mediated G protein activation assay and resistant to blockade with an antagonist/inverse agonist. An in silico structure-based docking study combined with site-directed mutagenesis of the hA1AR demonstrated that amino acid Y2717.36 was the primary anchor point for the covalent interaction. Additionally, a label-free whole-cell assay was set up to identify LUF7746\u2019s irreversible activation of an A1 receptor-mediated cell morphological response. These results led us to conclude that LUF7746 is a novel covalent hA1AR partial agonist and a valuable chemical probe for further mapping the receptor activation process. It may also serve as a prototype for a therapeutic approach in which a covalent partial agonist may cause less on-target side effects, conferring enhanced safety compared to a full agonist.<br />", "date": "2020-02-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Binding free energy of a drug candidate to its biomolecular target is used as an objective quantity in drug design. Binding kinetics -- rates of association (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation (k<sub>off</sub>) -- have also demonstrated utility for their ability to predict efficacy and in some cases have been shown to be more predictive than the binding free energy alone.  Although challenging, some methods exist to calculate binding kinetics from molecular simulations.  While the kinetics of the binding process are related to the free energy by the log of their ratio, it is not straightforward to account for common, practical details pertaining to the calculation of rates in molecular simulations, such as the finite simulation volume or the particular definition of the ``bound\" and ``unbound\" states.  Here we derive a set of correction terms that can be applied to calculations of binding free energies using rates observed in simulations. One term accounts for the particular definitions of the bound and unbound states. The second term accounts for residual electrostatic interactions that might still be present between the molecules, which is especially useful if one or both of the molecules carry an explicit charge. The third term accounts for the volume of the unbound state in the simulation box, which is useful to keep the simulated volume as small as possible during rate calculations. We apply these correction terms to revisit the calculation of binding free energies from rate constants for a host-guest system that was part of a blind prediction challenge, where significant deviations were observed between free energies calculated with rate ratios and those calculated from alchemical perturbation.

One way to deal with (1) is to lump coordinates into groups. This is called mode combination (MC). One way to deal with (2) is to reformulate MCTDH using collocation so that there are no integrals. In this paper we combine MC and collocation to formulate a mode combination collocation multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method (MC-C-MCTDH). In practice, its cost does not scale exponentially with the number of atoms in the system and it can be easily used with any general potential energy surfaces (PES); the PES need not be a SOP and need not have a special form. No integrals and hence no quadratures are necessary. We demonstrate the accuracy and e\u000eciency of the new method by computing vibrational energy eigenstates of the methyl radical, methane, and acetonitrile. To do this, we use MC-C-MCTDH with a variant of improved relaxation, derived by evaluating a residual at points rather than starting from a variational principle. Because the MC basis functions are multivariate, collocation points in multidimensional spaces are required. We use two types of collocation points: 1) DVR (discrete variable representation)-like points obtained from (approximate) simultaneous diagonalisation of matrices; and 2) Leja points, which are known to be good interpolation points, determined from a generalised recipe suitable for any (not necessarily polynomial-type) basis.<br /></p>", "date": "2020-02-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A priori bond valences are calculated for 140 crystal structures containing 266 coordination poly-hedra for 85 transition-metal ion configurations with anomalous bond-length distributions. Two new indices, \u0394\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59 and \u0394\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61, are proposed to quantify bond-length variation arising from bond-topological and crystallographic effects in extended solids. Bond-topological mechanisms of bond-length variation are [1] non-local bond-topological asymmetry, and [2] multi-ple-bond formation; crystallographic mechanisms are [3] electronic effects (with inherent focus on coupled electronic-vibra-tional degeneracy in this work), and [4] crystal-structure effects. The \u0394\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59 and \u0394\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 indices allow one to determine the primary cause(s) of bond-length variation for individual coordination polyhedra and ion configurations, quantify the dis-torting power of cations via electronic effects (by subtracting the bond-topological contribution to bond-length variation), set expectation limits regarding the extent to which functional properties linked to bond-length variations may be optimized in a given crystal structure (and inform how optimization may be achieved), and more. We find the observation of multiple bonds to be primarily driven by the bond-topological requirements of crystal structures in solids. However, we sometimes observe multiple bonds to form as a result of electronic effects (e.g. the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect); resolution of the origins of multiple-bond formation follows calculation of the \u0394\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59 and \u0394\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 indices on a structure-by-structure basis. Non-local bond-topological asymmetry is the most common cause of bond-length variation in transition-metal oxides and oxysalts, followed closely by the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect (PJTE). Non-local bond-topological asymmetry is further suggested to be the most widespread cause of bond-length variation in the solid state, with no a priori limitations with regard to ion identity. Overall, bond-length variations resulting from the PJTE are slightly larger than those resulting from non-local bond-topological asym-metry, comparable to those resulting from the strong JTE, and less than those induced by \u03c0-bond formation. From a compar-ison of a priori and observed bond valences for ~150 coordination polyhedra in which the strong JTE or the PJTE is the main reason underlying bond-length variation, the Jahn-Teller effect is found not to have a symbiotic relation with the bond-topo-logical requirements of crystal structures. The magnitude of bond-length variations caused by the PJTE decreases in the fol-lowing order for octahedrally coordinated d0 transition metals oxyanions: Os8+ > Mo6+ > W6+ >> V5+ > Nb5+ > Ti4+ > Ta5+ > Hf4+ > Zr4+ > Re7+ >> Y3+ > Sc3+. Such ranking varies by coordination number; for [4], it is Re7+ > Ti4+ > V5+ > W6+ > Mo6+ > Cr6+ > Os8+ >> Mn7+; for [5], it is Os8+ > Re7+ > Mo6+ > Ti4+ > W6+ > V5+ > Nb5+. We conclude that non-octahedral coordinations of d0 ion configurations are likely to occur with bond-length variations that are similar in magnitude to their octahedral counterparts. However, smaller bond-length variations are expected from the PJTE for non-d0 transition-metal oxyanions.<br />", "date": "2020-02-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Solid State Chemistry; Theory - Inorganic; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, nonmonotonic multi-S/R systems are still rarely studied so far. Now, we propose a rational design strategy to achieve such a unique S/R system by integrating opposite luminescence behaviors in one molecule. When solvent polarity increases, many heterocycles often become more emissive due to the suppression of the proximity effect. However, molecules with donor-acceptor (D-A) structures tend to be less emissive because of the twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Meanwhile, protonation on D/A moieties will weaken/strengthen the D-A interaction to result in blue/red-shifted emissions. By combining a protonatable heterocyclic acceptor and a protonatable donor together in one molecule, we can easily achieve nonmonotonic brightness responses to polarity stimuli and nonmonotonic color responses to pH stimuli. In this work, a simple molecule, namely ASQ is chosen as the model compound to verify the design strategy feasibility. It successfully shows two opposite trends of responses to polarity and pH stimuli, and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with a nonmonotonic AIE curve. Moreover, the acidified ASQ solution is also a pure organic up-conversion and white-light-emitting system. A new mechanistic viewpoint is established to explain its unique anti-Stokes emission. Besides, ASQ shows multivalent functionalities including albumin protein sensing, ratiometric pH sensing, and amine gas sensing, etc. Therefore, ASQ is proved to be a fundamentally important and versatile functional \u201cintelligent\u201d AIE luminogen with nonmonotonic multi-responses to multi-stimuli. <br /></p>", "date": "2020-02-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Dyes and Chromophores; Optical Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Additionally, when there is a wide distribution of the number of cross-links per chain, macrophase separation can occur. Here, we investigate the linear viscoelasticity and flow of a polyethylene (PE) vitrimer that has cross-linkable dioxaborolane maleimide grafts, which aggregate into a hierarchical nanostructure. To elucidate the role of self-assembly, noncross-linked graft functionalized PE was first studied. It had a terminal relaxation time that was orders of magnitude larger than both neat PE and partially peroxide cross-linked PE. When dioxaborolane cross-linker was added to form the vitrimer, the resulting material could not achieve terminal relaxation within 8 hr. The graft-poor soluble and graft-rich insoluble portions of the PE vitrimer were then isolated and characterized. The soluble portion expressed similar flow behavior as neat PE, while the insoluble portion \u2013 which is a network of cross-linked aggregates \u2013 relaxed very little over 8 hr. When the insoluble and soluble portions were blended, the rheological behavior of the original vitrimer was basically recovered, showing that the soluble portion acts as a lubricant. When the insoluble portion was blended with neat PE, the material relaxed much more stress, but still did not reach steady-state flow within 8 hr. When high stresses were applied, however, PE vitrimer flowed. Nonlinear rheology experiments revealed melt fracture at high strains and suggested that flow is enabled by rapid healing, which follows fracture events.

Both variations\nrequire several measurement series to set up a relaxation master curve (RMC). The basic assumption\nis that a higher strain corresponds to a higher temperature and a longer load duration, respectively.\nThe paper describes a new model approach which allows to predict the longterm behaviour by using\na reduced number of measurements as compared to widely models. The new model is based on the\nwell-known Maxwell model and assumes a mean relaxation time in combination with a relaxation\ncoecient. These parameters account for the inhomogeneity of the individual polymer chains. A\ndimensionless number, similar to the relaxation coecient, has been successfully introduced for the\nWeibull distribution and the particle size distribution. The new model allows to derive master curve\nfrom one measurement series at a single strain by fitting the data to the model equation.<br /></p>", "date": "2021-01-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biocompatible Materials; Biodegradable Materials; Fibers; Materials Processing; Polymer blends; Polymer morphology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Currently, qualitative information on NP spatial distribution is obtained by visual inspection of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Quantitative information is only indirectly obtained through the use of scattering probes such as small angle X-ray/neutron scattering. While the main challenge, that scattering probes operate in reciprocal space, can be remedied by Fourier inverting the data into real space, a much harder issue is deconvolving the contribution of the particle form factor (which is affected by the details of the NP size and shape) from the structure factor which contains information on the NP spatial distribution. These problems become acute when we deal with the popular topic of NPs grafted with polymer chains, because the polymeric corona, and hence the particle form factor, becomes context dependent and hard to quantify. To make progress, we develop and apply a deep-learning based image analysis method to quantify the distribution of spherical NPs in a polymer matrix directly from their real-space TEM images. A dataset of NP detection (DOPAD) is built by manually  labeling  particle positions on experimental TEM images of diverse polymer composite systems. A convolutional neural network (CNN)   object detection model is then trained on DOPAD.  Together with sliding-window and merging algorithms, an automated pipeline is established,  which takes a large TEM image as input and extracts NP locations and sizes.  We validate the structural information resulting from this method against SAXS derived structural information for NPs ordered by polymer crystallization, and then use it to distinguish between different states of the assembly of polymer grafted NPs in a polymer matrix achieved by using their surfactancy.

Incorporation\nof limited charge reduction into electrospray ionization (ESI) MS measurements provides an\nelegant way to obtain meaningful information on most heterogeneous systems, yielding not\nonly the average mass of the protein, but also the mass range populated by various\nproteoforms. Application of this approach to characterization of two different phenotypes of\nhaptoglobin (1-1 and 2-1) provides evidence of a significant difference in their extent of\nglycosylation, with the glycan load of phenotype 2-1 being notably lighter. More detailed\ncharacterization of their glycosylation patterns is enabled by the recently introduced crosspath reactive chromatography (XP-RC) with on-line MS detection, a technique that combines\nchromatographic separation with in-line reduction of disulfide bonds to generate metastable\nhaptoglobin subunits. Application of XP-RC to both haptoglobin phenotypes confirms that no\nmodifications are present within their light chains, and provides a wealth of information on\nglycosylation patterns of the heavy chains. The haptoglobin 1-1 glycans are mature fully\nsialylated biantennary structures that exhibit high degrees of fucosylation. In contrast,\nphenotype 2-1 contains a significant fraction of incomplete biantennary structures and exhibit\nsignificantly lower levels of sialylation and fucosylation. The glycosylation patterns deduced\nfrom the XP-RC/MS measurements are in agreement with the conclusions of haptoglobin\nanalysis by limited charge reduction, suggesting that the latter can be employed in situations\nwhen a fast assessment of a protein heterogeneity is needed (e.g., comparability studies of\nbiopharmaceutical products). <br />", "date": "2021-01-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The delicate nature of the interactions inherent to methane physisorption, such as\ndispersion interactions, polarization of both the adsorbent and the adsorbate, interplay between H-\nbonding and tetrel bonding, and induced dipole/Coulomb interactions, requires computational\ntreatment at the highest possible level of theory while remaining non-prohibitive in terms of\ncomputational cost.

The most\naccurate predictions of the methane adsorption energetics were achieved by electron-correlated\nmolecular orbital theory (CCSD(T)) and hybrid density functional theory (MN15) calculations, both\nemploying a saturated all-electron basis set. The characteristic geometry of methane adsorption on\na carbon surface was likened to a \u201clander\u201d position over the ring centers of the adsorbent.

However, designing experiments that involve EVs phenotyping is usually highly challenging and time-consuming, due to laborious optimization steps that require very long or even overnight incubation durations. In this work, we demonstrate label-free, real-time detection and phenotyping of extracellular vesicles binding to a multiplexed surface. With the ability of label-free kinetic binding measurements using the Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor (IRIS) in a microfluidic chamber, we successfully optimize the capture reaction by tuning various assay conditions (incubation time, flow conditions, surface probe density and specificity). A single (less than 1 hour) experiment allows for  characterization of binding affinities of the EVs to multiplexed probes. We demonstrate kinetic characterization of 18 different probe conditions, namely three different antobodies, each spotted at six different concentrations, simultaneously. The affinity characterization is then analyzed through a model which considers the complexity of multivalent binding of large structures to a carpet of probes, and therefore introduces a combination of fast and slow association and dissociation parameters. Additionally, our results confirm higher affinity of EVs to aCD81 with respect to aCD9 and aCD63. Single-vesicle imaging measurements corroborate our findings, as well as confirming the EVs nature of the captured particles through fluorescence staining of the EVs membrane and cargo. </p>", "date": "2021-01-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Imaging; High-throughput Screening", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ehesan Ali", "abstract": "<div>The electronic and magnetic properties of polyacenes become quite fascinating as the number of linearly conjugated benzene rings increases. Higher-order conjugated polyacenes develop radicaloid characters due to the transition of electronic structures from closed-shell to the open-shell system. Here we have investigated the role of such polyacenes as the magnetic coupler when placed between the two spin-sources based on nitroxy radicals. To do so, the magnetic exchange interactions (<i>2J</i>) are computed employing  electronic structure theories, i.e. broken-symmetry (BS) approach within the density functional theory (DFT) as well as symmetry-adopted wave function based multi-configurational methods. In the former approach, various genre of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals such as generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid functional, constrained spin density (i.e. CDFT) and on-site Coulomb correlation corrected GGA+<i>U</i> functionals are adopted. All DFT based calculations estimate an exponential increase in <i>2J</i> values with the length of the couplers, especially for the higher-order acenes. This is indeed an unexpected observation and also there is no experimental report available in support of the DFT calculations. The complexity in the electronic structure enhances with the increasing number of benzene rings due to an increase in near-degenerate or quasi-degenerate  molecular orbitals (MOs) and also the reduction of the energy gap with the low-lying excited states. Consequently, it invokes a severe challenge in the computations of the magnetic exchange interactions in DFT. As an alternative approach, the wave function based multi-reference calculations, e.g. CASSCF/NEVPT2 methods are also adopted. In the later calculations, it has been realized that the \u03c0-orbitals of the couplers play a crucial role in the exchange interactions. For larger polyacenes (i.e. hexacene to decacene) such calculations become prohibitively expensive and rigorous as the number of \u03c0-orbitals increases, thus expanding the active space enormously. The limited active spaces calculations indicate quite strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions, thus <i>in principle,</i> reinforcing long-range magnetic exchange interactions.</div>", "date": "2021-01-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

SABRE is especially well positioned for continuous generation of enhanced magnetization on a large scale, however, several challenges need to be addressed for accomplishing this goal. Specifically, SABRE requires (i) a specialized catalyst capable of reversible H<sub>2</sub> activation and (ii) physical transfer of the sample from the point of magnetization generation to the point of detection (e.g., a high-field or a benchtop NMR spectrometer).

Recently, a new class of designed peptoid macrocycle incorporating spiroligomer proline mimics (Q-prolines) has been found to pre-organize when bound by monovalent metal cations.   To determine the solution-state structure of these cation-bound macrocycles, we employ a Bayesian inference method (BICePs) to reconcile enhanced-sampling molecular simulations with sparse ROESY correlations from experimental NMR studies.  The BICePs approach circumvents the need for bespoke force field parameterization, instead relying on experimental restraints to help narrow the possible set of <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> amide isomers in solution. Conformations predicted to be most populated in solution were then simulated in the presence of explicit cations to yield trajectories with observed binding events, revealing a highly-preorganized all-<i>trans</i> amide  conformation, whose formation is likely limited by the slow rate of <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> isomerization.  Interestingly, this conformation differs from a racemic crystal structure solved in the absence of cation. Free energies of cation binding computed from distance-dependent potentials of mean force suggest Na<sup>+</sup> has higher affinity to the macrocycle than K<sup>+</sup>, with both cations binding much more strongly in acetonitrile than water.

To this end, researchers have made some considerable efforts in the high-value applications of lignin, even though there is a limited success so far. This is mainly because the exact structure of native lignin is still virtually unknown due to its highly heterogeneous nature. Besides, technical lignin undergoes unintended structural modifications during the chemical pulping and extraction processes making its final structure even more complicated. Therefore, understanding the lignin structure and its macromolecular characteristics is essential for its proper utilization. In this study, two technical lignins, such as indulin AT and alkali-treated lignin, were investigated for thermal and structural characterization. Various thermal behaviors were studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Indulin AT was found to be thermally more stable compared to alkali lignin. Structural characterization was performed using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H NMR). Cupric oxide oxidation was utilized to selectively degrade the lignin into its monomers (H/G/S-moieties), which were identified with GC-MS. The results suggested that the selected lignins are mainly composed of G-type monomers. The detailed characterization studies also revealed some minor structural differences between the two lignins due to their respective delignification process. Indulin AT underwent higher structural modifications due to the harsher delignification process and hinted to show more recalcitrance toward depolymerization than alkali lignin.</p>", "date": "2021-01-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our screening result identifies ten\ncompounds with higher binding affinity than N3 (used as a reference compound to\nvalidate the experiment). All the compounds possess desire physicochemical\nproperties. Later on, in-depth docking and superimposition of selected complexes\nconfirm that only three compounds (MMV1782211, MMV1782220 and MMV1578574) are actively interacting with the catalytic domain of\nMpro. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore,\nthe selected three molecules complexed with Mpro and N3-Mpro as control are\nsubjected to molecular dynamics simulation study (root means square deviation, root mean\nsquare fluctuation, hydrogen bonding, solvent-accessible area and radius of\ngyration). MMV1782211-Mpro\ncomplex shows a strong and stable interaction as compared to others.\nThe MM/PBSA free energy calculation shows the highest binding\nfree energy of \u2013115.8 kJ/mol for MMV1782211 compound also cross-confirms our\nmolecular docking study. Therefore,\nour <i>in silico</i> findings become very\ninteresting towards developing alternative medicine against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro\ntarget.

Reduced density gradient (RDG) has already been widely employed in literatures to visually exhibit weak interaction regions, in fact it also has the ability of revealing chemical bonding regions. Unfortunately, RDG cannot clearly show both types of the interactions at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new real space function named interaction region indicator (IRI), which is a slight modification on RDG. We found IRI can reveal chemical bonding and weak interaction regions equally well, this brings great convenience in the study of various chemical systems as well as chemical reactions. It is noteworthy that IRI has simpler definition, lower computational cost and better graphical effect than the density overlap regions indicator (DORI), which has similar purpose to IRI. In this article IRI is also compared with atom-in-molecules (AIM) topology analysis of electron density, we demonstrated that IRI has the ability to reveal additional interactions to provide chemists a more complete picture. In addition, we put forward a variant of IRI named IRI-pi, which is dedicated to reveal interactions of pi electrons. It is found that IRI-pi can not only distinguish type of pi interactions but can also exhibit pi-interaction strength.

The twisted state primarily influences the contacts involving the C-terminus of insulin\u2019s B chain, shifting the registry of its intermolecular hydrogen bonds and reorganizing its sidechain packing.

The new solver is based on a derivation of a new goal-oriented a posteriori error estimate for the electrostatic coupling. This estimate involves the consideration of the primal and adjoint problems for the electrostatic potential of the system, where the goal functional requires pointwise evaluations of the potential. A common practice to treat such  functionals is to regularize them, for example, by averaging over balls or by mollification, and to use weak formulations in standard Sobolev spaces. However, this procedure changes the goal functional and may require the numerical evaluation of integrals of discontinuous functions. We overcome the conceptual shortcomings of this approach by using weak formulations involving nonstandard Sobolev spaces and deriving a representation of the error in the goal quantity which does not require averaging and directly exploits the original goal functional. The accuracy of this solver is evaluated  by numerical experiments on a series of problems with analytically known solutions. In addition, the solver is used to calculate electrostatic couplings between two chromophores, linked to polyproline helices of different lengths.

The main benefit of this approach is related to the inherent dimensionality reduction of the large material space to just a few catalyst descriptors. Conversely, it is well documented that a small set of descriptors is insufficient to capture the intricacies and complexities of a real catalytic system. The inclusion of coverage effects through lateral adsorbate-adsorbate interactions can narrow the gap between simplified descriptor predictions and real systems, but mean-field MKMs cannot properly account for local coverage effects. This shortcoming of the mean-field approximation can be rectified by switching to a lattice-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method using cluster expansion representation of adsorbate\u2212adsorbate lateral interactions.</p>Using the prototypical CO oxidation reaction as an example, we critically evaluate the benefits of kMC over MKM in terms of trend predictions and computational cost when using only a small set of input parameters.

The mean-field implementation applies coverage corrections directly to the descriptors, causing an artificial overprediction of the activity of strongly binding metals. In contrast, the cluster expansion in kMC implementation can differentiate among the highly active metals but it is very sensitive to the set of included interaction parameters. Considering that computational screening relies on a minimal set of descriptors, for which MKM makes reasonable trend predictions at a ca. three orders of magnitude lower computational cost than kMC, the MKM approach does provide a better entry point for computational catalyst design.<br /></div>", "date": "2021-01-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Statistical\nmodels developed with the Lasso method using a training set of samples yielded per-sample\naccuracies of 95% for the beef model, 100% for the beef versus venison model,\nand 84% for the multiclass fish model.

Although there has been much research, the processes that govern the physical interactions between N2O5 and water are still not fully understood at a molecular level. Gaining quantitative insight from computer simulations requires going beyond the accuracy of classical force fields, while accessing length scales and time scales that are out of reach for high-level quantum chemical approaches. To this end we present the development of MB-nrg many-body potential energy functions for simulations of N2O5 in water. This MB-nrg model is based on electronic structure calculations at the coupled cluster level of theory and is compatible with the successful MB-pol model for water. It provides a physically correct description of long-range many-body interactions in combination with an explicit representation of up to three-body short-range interactions in terms of multidimensional permutationally invariant polynomials. In order to further investigate the importance of the underlying interactions in the model, a TTM-nrg model was also devised. TTM- nrg is a more simplistic representation that contains only two-body short-range interactions represented through Born-Mayer functions. In this work an active learning approach was employed to efficiently build representative training sets of monomer, dimer and trimer structures, and benchmarks are presented to determine the accuracy of our new models in comparison to a range of density functional theory methods. By assessing binding curves, distortion energies of N2O5, and interaction energies in clusters of N2O5 and water, we evaluate the importance of two-body and three-body short-range potentials. The results demonstrate that our MB-nrg model has high accuracy with respect to the coupled cluster reference, outperforms current density functional theory models, and thus enables highly accurate simulations of N2O5 in aqueous environments.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2021-01-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Clusters", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Still, further improvements can be achieved by increasing their electrical conductivity. In this work, we have obtained and fully characterized a variety of monodisperse core@shell hybrid nanoparticles of Au@PBA (PBA of NiIIFeII and CoIIFeII) with different shell sizes. Their electrocatalytical activity is evaluated by studying the OER, which is compared to the pristine PBA and other Au-PBA heterostructures. It was observed that the introduction in a core@shell of 5-10 % of Au in weight leads to an increment in the electroactive mass able to be reduced or oxidized and thus, to a higher number of sites capable to take part in the OER. This larger amount of electroactive sites leads to a significant decrease in the onset potential (a reduction of the onset potential up to 100 mV and an increase up to 420 % of the current density recorded at an overpotential of 350 mV), while the Tafel slope remains unchanged, suggesting that Au reduces the limiting potential of the catalyst with no variation in the reaction kinetics. These effects are not experimented in the other Au-PBA nanostructures mainly due to the lower contact between both compounds and the oxidation of Au. Hence, an Au core activates the PBA shell and increases the conductivity of the resulting hybrid while the PBA shell prevents Au oxidation. These improvements come from the strong synergistic effect existing in the core@shell structure and evidence the importance of the chemical design for preparing PBA-based nanostructures displaying better electrocatalytic performances and higher electrochemical stabilities.", "date": "2021-01-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Core-Shell Materials; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Experimental vibrational Stark effect (VSE)-based solvatochromism can be combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify the electrostatic forces in solute-solvent interactions for small rigid molecules and, by extension, when these solutes bind in enzyme active sites. While generalizing this approach towards more complex (bio)molecules, such as the conformationally flexible and charged penicillin G (PenG), we were surprised to observe inconsistencies in MD-based electric fields.

Unfortunately the papers could not go to public platform until now. Inspired by the sweet taste theory<sup>1,2</sup>, this bitter taste theory conveys that bitter molecules are recognized by receptor protein helical structures. The recognition process is a dynamic action, in which the receptor protein helices have a torsion-spring-like oscillation between helical structures of 3.6 and 4 amino acids per turn. Based on the characteristics of the bitter receptor protein helix oscillation, it perfectly explains why in bitter molecules, only one unit of hydrogen donor (DH) or hydrogen acceptor (B) is enough in helping molecules to elicit bitter taste. The potential DH and B in bitter receptor are any NH or O of receptor\u2019s peptide NHs and Os, which are the ones forming intramolecular H-bonds responsible for the formation of receptor protein helical structures. Furthermore, only one unit of DH or B is allowed for structurally simple ligands. As recognition sites are only associated with a small fraction \u2013 helix structure of whole bitter receptor, multiple binding sites or multiple receptors are well expected. As the oscillation may have different extent, it translates to bitterness intensity.

Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses have quantified the physical factors behind the decreased reactivity of the metallylene on going down Group 14, from carbenes to stannylenes. Along this series, the reactivity decreases due to a worsening of the back-donation interaction between the filled lone-pair orbital of the metallylene and the s*-orbital of H<sub>2</sub>, which, therefore, reduces the metallylene\u2013substrate interaction and increases the reaction barrier.

We further identify strategies that dramatically reduce the number of molecules required to learn a model of equivalent quality, and demonstrate the application of these principles by learning models of chemical structures found in bacterial, plant, and fungal metabolomes. The structure of our experiments also allows us to benchmark the metrics used to evaluate generative models themselves.

Here, we elucidate the interactions of halide and hydride ligands on phosphine-protected gold clusters via theoretical investigations. The computed absorption spectra using time-dependent density functional theory are in reasonable agreement with the experimental spectra, confirming that the computational methods are capturing the ligand-metal interactions accurately. Despite the similarities in the absorption spectra, the hydride and halide ligands have distinct geometric and electronic effects. The hydride ligand behaves as a metal dopant and contributes its two electrons to the number of superatomic electrons, while the halides act as electron-withdrawing ligands and do not change the number of superatomic electrons.

Herein we report the Diels-Alder (DA) reaction of (unsymmetrical) gem-diborylalkenes. These reactions provide a general and efficient method for the stereoselective conversion of gem-diborylalkenes to rapidly access 1,1-bisborylcyclohexenes. Using the same DA reaction manifold with borylated-dienes and gem-diborylalkenes, we also developed a concise, highly regioselective synthesis of 1,1,2-tris- and 1,1,3,4-tetrakis(boronates)cyclohexenes, a family of compounds that currently lack efficient synthetic access. Furthermore, DFT calculations provided insight into the underlying factors that control the chemo-, regio, and stereoselectivity of these DA reactions. This method also provides stereodivergent syntheses of gem-diboryl-norbornenes. The utility of the gem-diboryl-norbornene building blocks was demonstrated by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), providing a highly modular approach to the first synthesis of the gem-diboron-based polymers. Given its simplicity and versatility, we believe that this novel DA and ROMP approach holds great promise for organoboron synthesis as well as organoboron-based polymers and that it will result in more novel transformations in both academic and industrial research.<br />", "date": "2021-01-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In CLC, a solid oxygen carrier is used to transfer oxygen from air to a carbonaceous fuel. This indirect combustion route allows for effective CO<sub>2</sub> capture since a sequestrable stream of CO<sub>2 </sub>is inherently produced without any need for energy-intensive CO<sub>2</sub> separation. From a thermodynamic point of view, CuO is arguably one of the most promising oxygen carrier candidates for CLC. However, the main challenge associated with the use of CuO for CLC is its structural instability at the typical operating temperatures of chemical looping processes, leading to severe thermal sintering and agglomeration. To minimize irreversible microstructural changes during CLC operation, CuO is commonly stabilized by a high Tammann temperature ceramic, e.g., Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, etc. However, it has been observed that a high Tammann temperature support does not always provide a high resistance to agglomeration. This work aims at identifying descriptors that can be used to characterize accurately the agglomeration tendency of CuO-based oxygen carriers. CuO-based oxygen carriers supported on different metal oxides were synthesized using a Pechini method. The cyclic redox stability and agglomeration tendency of the synthesized materials was evaluated using both a thermo-gravimetric analyser and a lab-scale fluidized bed reactor at 900 \u00b0C using 10 vol. % H<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub> as the fuel and air for re-oxidation. In order to study the diffusion of Cu(O) during redox reactions, well-defined model surfaces comprising thin films of Cu/CuO and two different supports, viz.

Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy on focused ion beam (FIB)-cut cross-sections of the thin films revealed that Cu atoms have a tendency to diffuse outward through most of the films of the support material under redox conditions. The support that inhibits the outward movement of Cu(O), i.e. avoiding the presence of low melting Cu on the oxygen carrier surface, is found to provide the highest agglomeration resistance.

An adsorbed xenon storage system based on nanoporous materials (NPMs) could, potentially, (i) reduce the storage pressures, (ii) allow for thinner-walled and lighter pressure vessels, and (iii) if the NPM itself is sufficiently light, reduce the overall mass of the storage system and thus of the payload of the rocket launch.<br /><br />To investigate, we develop a simple mathematical model of an adsorbed xenon storage system by coupling a mechanical model for the pressure vessel and a thermodynamic model for the density of xenon adsorbed in the NPM. From the model, we derive the optimal storage pressure, tailored to each NPM, with the objective of minimizing the mass of the storage materials (walls of the pressure vessel + NPM) required to store the xenon. The model enables us to: (i) rank NPMs for adsorbed xenon propellant storage, (ii) compare adsorbed storage to the baseline of bulk storage, and (iii) understand what properties of NPMs are desirable for adsorbed xenon propellant storage.<br /><br />We use the model to evaluate several NPMs, mostly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), for adsorbed xenon propellant storage at room temperature, using experimental xenon adsorption data as input. We find Ni-MOF-74 and MOF-505 outperform the traditional adsorbent, activated carbon. However, we find each optimized adsorbed xenon storage system is heavier than the optimized bulk storage system, owing dominantly to the large mass of the NPM itself.

Although the jute bags typically used to store grains afford an ecofriendly, durable, and low-cost storage solution, their hydrophilic nature makes them vulnerable to wetting from airborne humidity and precipitation events. To address this issue, we treated jute fabrics with alkali and wax to render them water-repellent. A 2-month seed storage experiment revealed that wax-coated jute bags (WCJBs) outperformed control jute bags (CJBs) at safeguarding wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) grains exposed to 55%\u201398% relative humidity. Specifically, grains stored in WCJBs exhibited 15%\u201350% less SMC than grains stored in CJBs, which led to a 21%\u201366% enhancement in the germination efficacy of WCJB-stored seeds.

Conse-quently, very few purely heterolanthanide complexes have been synthesized. This is despite the fact that such complexes hold inter-esting optical and magnetic properties. To fine-tune these properties, it is important that one can choose complexes with any given combination of lanthanides. Herein we report a synthetic procedure which yields pure heterodinuclear lanthanide cryptates LnLn*LX3 (X = NO3- or OTf-) based on the cryptand H3L = N[(CH2)2N=CH-R-CH=N-(CH2)2]3N (R = m-C6H2OH-2-Me-5).

To demon-strate the versatility of the synthesis all dinuclear combinations of Y(III), Gd(III), Yb(III) and Lu(III) were synthesized resulting in 10 novel complexes of the form LnLn*L(OTf)3 with LnLn* = YbGd 1, YbY 2, YbLu 3, YbYb 4, LuGd 5, LuY 6, LuLu 7, YGd 8, YY 9 and GdGd 10.

In macroscale experiments, friction generally decreases as the coverage of OFM molecules on the sliding surfaces increases; however, recent nanoscale experiments with sharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips have shown increasing friction. To elucidate the origin of these opposite trends, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and study kinetic friction between OFM monolayers and an indenting nanoscale asperity. For this purpose, we investigate various coverages of stearamide OFMs on iron oxide surfaces and silica AFM tips with different radii of curvature. We show that the differences between the friction-coverage relations from macroscale and nanoscale experiments are due to molecular plowing in the latter. For our small tip radii, the friction coefficient and indentation depth both have a non-monotonic dependence on OFM surface coverage, with maxima occurring at intermediate coverage. We rationalise the non-monotonic relations through a competition of two effects (confinement and packing density) that varying the surface coverage has on the effective stiffness of the OFM monolayers. We also show that kinetic friction is not very sensitive to the sliding velocity in the range studied, indicating that it originates from instabilities. Indeed, we find that friction predominately originates from plowing of the monolayers by the leading edge of the tip, where gauche defects are created, while thermal dissipation is mostly localised in molecules towards the trailing edge of the tip, where the chains return to a more extended conformation.<br />", "date": "2021-01-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The transcription factors MarA and Rob are two homologous members of the AraC/XylS family that regulate multidrug resistance. They share a common DNA-binding domain, and Rob possesses an additional C-terminal domain that permits binding of low-molecular weight effectors. Both proteins possess two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs capable of binding DNA; however, while MarA interacts with its promoter through both HTH-motifs, prior studies indicate that Rob binding to DNA via a single HTH-motif is sufficient for tight binding. In the present work, we perform microsecond time scale all-atom simulations of the binding of both transcription factors to different DNA sequences to understand the determinants of DNA recognition and binding. Our simulations characterize sequence-specific changes in dynamical behavior upon DNA binding, showcasing the role of Arg40 of the N-terminal HTH-motif in allowing for specific tight binding. Finally, our simulations demonstrate that an acidic C-terminal loop of Rob can control the DNA binding mode, facilitating interconversion between the distinct DNA binding modes observed in MarA and Rob. In doing so, we provide detailed molecular insight into DNA binding and recognition by these proteins, which in turn is an important step towards the efficient design of anti-virulence agents that target these proteins.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>", "date": "2021-01-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Caprioli", "abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) allows for highly multiplexed, unlabeled mapping of analytes from tissue sections.  However, further work is needed to improve sensitivity and depth of coverage for protein and peptide IMS. Laser-based post-ionization MALDI-2 has been shown to increase sensitivity for several molecular classes but thus far this has not been reported for peptides. Here, we demonstrate signal enhancement of proteolytic peptides from thin tissue sections of human kidney by conventional MALDI (termed MALDI-1), and conventional MALDI augmented using a second ionizing laser (termed MALDI-2).  Proteins were digested <i>in situ</i> using trypsin prior to IMS analysis.  For identification of peptides and proteins, a tissue homogenate was analyzed by LC-MS/MS for bottom-up proteomics and the corresponding proteins identified.  These proteins were next fully \u2018digested <i>in silico\u2019</i> to generate a database of theoretical peptides to then match to MALDI IMS datasets. Peptides were tentatively identified by matching the MALDI peak list to the database peptide list employing a 5 ppm error window.  This resulted in 314 \u00b1 45 (n=3) peptides and 1 112 \u00b1 84 (n=3) peptides for MALDI-1 and MALDI-2, respectively. Protein identifications were similarly made by linking IMS data to the LC-MS/MS peptide database.  With positive protein identifications requiring two or more peptides per protein, 55 \u00b1 13 proteins were identified with MALDI-1 and 205 \u00b1 10 with MALDI-2. These results demonstrate that MALDI-2 provides enhanced sensitivity for the spatial mapping of tryptic peptides and significantly increases the number of proteins identified in IMS experiments.<br />", "date": "2021-01-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemical Analysis; Imaging; Mass Spectrometry; Biochemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These interactions are relevant in biochemical systems being increasingly explored in drug discovery, mainly to modulate protein\u2013ligand interactions, but are also found in engineered protein or nucleic acid systems. In this work, we report direct evidence for the existence of XBs in the context of biological membrane systems thus expanding the scope of application of these interactions. Indeed, our molecular dynamics simulations show the presence of favorable interactions between halobenzene derivatives and both phosphate or ester oxygen acceptors from model phospholipid bilayers, thus supporting the existence of XB mediated phospholipid\u2013halogen recognition phenomena influencing the membrane insertion profile of the ligands and their orientational preferences. This represents a relevant interaction, previously overlooked, eventually determining the pharmacological or toxicological activity of halogenated compounds and hence with potential implications in drug discovery and development, a place where such species account for a significant part of the chemical space. We also provide insights into a potential role for XBs in water-to membrane insertion of halogenated ligands as XBs are systematically observed during this process. Therefore, our data strongly suggests that, as the ubiquitous hydrogen bond, XBs should be accounted for in the development of membrane partition models.</div>", "date": "2021-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The global exploration problem is decomposed into a set of separate MD trajectories that can be restarted within a selective process to achieve sufficient phase-space sampling. Accurate statistical properties can be obtained through reweighting. Within this highly parallel setup, the Tinker--HP package can be powered by an arbitrary large number of GPUs on supercomputers, reducing exploration time from years to days. This approach is used to tackle the urgent modeling problem of the SARS--CoV--2 Main Protease (Mpro) producing more than 38 microseconds of all-atom simulations of its apo, ligand-free, dimer using the high-resolution AMOEBA PFF. A first 15.14 microseconds simulation (physiological pH) is compared to available non--PFF long-timescale simulation data. A detailed clustering analysis exhibits striking differences between FFs, AMOEBA showing a richer conformational space. Focusing on key structural markers related to the oxyanion hole stability, we observe an asymmetry between protomers. One of them appears less structured resembling the experimentally inactive monomer for which a 6 microseconds simulation was performed as a basis of comparison. Results highlight the plasticity of Mpro active site. The C--terminal end of its less structured protomer is shown to oscillate between several states, being able to interact with the other protomer, potentially modulating its activity.  Active and distal sites volumes are found to be larger in the most active protomer within our AMOEBA simulations compared to non-PFFs as additional cryptic pockets are uncovered.  A second 17 microseconds AMOEBA simulation is performed with protonated His172 residues mimicking lower pH. Data show the protonation impact on the destructuring of the oxyanion loop. We finally analyze the solvation patterns around key histidine residues. The confined AMOEBA polarizable water molecules are able to explore a wide range of dipole moments, going beyond bulk values, leading to a water molecule counts consistent with experiment. Results suggest that the use of PFFs could be critical in drug discovery to accurately model the complexity of the molecular interactions structuring Mpro", "date": "2021-01-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

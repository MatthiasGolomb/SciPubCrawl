Lifetime evaluation requires prolonged cycling experiments. Early prediction of battery cell ageing can accelerate the development timeline as well as optimal charging schedule planning, and battery cell and pack production towards an extended lifetime. We demonstrate that an autoregressive model can be trained with limited data for early prediction capacity. Our approach robustly models the capacity degradation over the entire lifetime and outperforms previous approaches in accuracy for EOL (end of life) prediction. Our model captures the uncertainty in the prediction, allowing appropriate and reliable deployment. Explainability analysis of the proposed deep model provides cognizance of the interplay between multiple cell degradation mechanisms. Finally, we show that the model aligns with existing chemical insights into the rationale for early EOL despite not being trained for this or having received prior chemical knowledge.", "date": "2022-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Unfortunately, NMP is neither sustainable nor suitable for up-scaling production due to its adverse impact on the environment. Here we show the real potential of green solvents by revealing the independent contributions of their exfoliation efficiency and graphene dispersibility to the graphene yield. By experimentally separating these two factors we show that the exfoliation efficiency of a given solvent is independent of its dispersibility.

The optimal structure between different coordination environments of FeSA was screened by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Guided by the theoretical results, FeSA with 5 nitrogen coordination (FeSA-N5-C) was selected and prepared experimentally for evaluation. The activity tests revealed that the removal efficiency of formaldehyde reached 85.5% at 25\u00b0C and 75% relative humidity, which is not possible for traditional catalysts. More importantly, moisture boosts catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde to some extent, illustrating that FeSA-N5-C is robust for practical applications.

Capturing the high efficiency of these natural proteins with man-made electrodes is the goal of biohybrid technologies such as biophotovoltaics, biofuel cells and biosensors. However, the removal of reaction centres from their natural cellular environment and their integration into an abiotic biohybrid architecture invariably introduces loss channels that compromise energy conversion efficiency. Here, we developed the combined use of spectroscopy and analytical electrochemistry to identify electron transfer bottlenecks, back-reactions and short-circuits that affect the performance of a bacterial reaction centre-based biophotoelectrode. We determined that the system was over 90% efficient under low intensity light but dropped to ~10% efficiency under intense continuous illumination. Limitations and loss processes included bottlenecks in electron transfer that rendered 62% of reaction centres inactive, as well as a short-circuiting of 73% of the photochemical product from active reaction centres. These findings will help shape rational design strategies for improving the performance of biohybrid devices and may be more broadly applied to other donor-acceptor type photocatalysts.

The method efficiently combines graph theory and quantum-chemical techniques to reduce the required human expertise and computational time for finding minima and saddle points in a potential energy surface. This is done by applying graph elementary transformations over automatically detected functional groups in molecules. Transition states in the resulted reaction network are then automatically found at a low level of theory to be later more accurately described at a higher level.\n\nAbstract: \nAlgorithms that automatically explore the chemical space have been limited to chemical systems with a low number of atoms due to expensive involved quantum calculations and the large amount of possible reaction pathways. The method described here presents a novel solution to the problem of chemical exploration by generating reaction networks with heuristics based on chemical theory. Firstly, a first version of the reaction network is determined through molecular graph transformations acting upon functional groups of the reacting. Only transformations that break two chemical bonds and form two new ones are considered, leading to a significant performance enhancement compared to previously presented algorithm. Secondly, \nenergy barriers for this reaction network are estimated through quantum chemical calculations by a growing string method (GMS), which can also identified non-octet species missed during the previous step and further define the reaction network. The proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to five different chemical reactions, in all cases identifying the most important reaction pathways. \n ", "date": "2022-06-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the development of highly effective, stable and inexpensive materials for such conversion processes is a bottleneck. Hence, establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of catalysts that influence their performance would constitute a major step towards the rational engineering of advanced electrocatalysts. In this study, by investigating a series of metal-substituted manganese oxide (spinel), Mn3O4:M (M = Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), nanoparticles as a model system, we demonstrate experimentally and rationalized the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for ORR and the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M oxides on the properties of the M substituent, viz. the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M that have a low enthalpy of formation of MO (i.e., highly exothermic oxides featuring relatively strong M\u2012O bonding) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which increases its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species on the catalyst surface. Our work provides a new perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis relying on the substitution by redox-inactive elements affecting the binding energy of oxygen to the surface of the complex metal oxide catalysts (ORR/OER activity descriptor).

In this work, we outline a theory in which chemical potentials of atoms and molecules are expressed in terms of reinterpretations of common chemical concepts and some physical quantities: electronegativity, chemical hardness, and the sensitivity of electronic repulsion and core levels with respect to changes in the electron density. At the zero-temperature limit, an expression of the Fermi level emerges that helps to connect several of these quantities to a plethora of material properties, theories and phenomena predominantly explored in condensed matter physics.

As a result, such experiment typically suffers from severe limitations for the multiphase materials containing rigid and mobile components with significant mobility contrast, where the signals of mobile components in HETCOR spectra are often lost due to the efficient averaging of dipolar couplings by the fast molecular motions.

Therefore, the exact impact of sample loss during the sample preparation is not well studied. Here, we applied qualitative and quantitative approaches to investigate the protein/peptide loss during the nanoproteomics experiment process. Our results clearly showed that there are significant differences in non-specific binding among all the tested microtubes, with a protein recovery rate ranging from less than 10% to over 90% for different microtubes. We found that storage temperature is also one of the key factors that contribute to protein recovery from the plastic. In addition, we further investigated the binding preferences of different microtubes by the physical characteristics of protein and peptides, such as isoelectric point, hydrophobicity, length, and charge. Our findings contribute to a better understand-ing of protein/peptide loss in proteomics sample preparation and provide further guidance for researchers in choosing proper containers for their precious sample.", "date": "2022-06-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The resulting mass difference (\u0394m) matrix is deconvoluted to isolate individual precursor ion \u0394m profiles and matched with structural information, which was derived from 42 \u0394m features from 14 in-house reference compounds and a global set of 11477 \u0394m features with assigned structure specificities, using a dataset of ~18000 unique structures.

Our study provides first results how \u0394m matching refines structural annotations in Van Krevelen space, but simultaneously demonstrates the wide overlap between potential structural classes.

However, their significant glycan heterogeneity poses an analytical challenge. Here, we have utilized individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS), a form of charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) that uses a commercially available Orbitrap analyzer, to directly produce heterogeneous glycan mass profiles of these three coronavirus spike protein trimers under native-like conditions. Analysis by I2MS shows that glycosylation contributes to the molecular mass of each protein trimer more significantly than expected by bottom-up techniques. This highlights the importance of obtaining complementary intact mass information when characterizing glycosylation of such heterogeneous proteins. Enzymatic dissection to remove sialic acid or N-linked glycans demonstrates that I2MS can be used to better understand the glycan profile from a native viewpoint. Deglycosylation of N-glycans followed by I2MS indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer contains glycans that are more difficult to remove than its MERS and SARS-CoV counterparts and differences in glycan removal are correlated with solvent accessibility. I2MS technology enables characterization of protein mass and intact glycan profile and is orthogonal to traditional protein mass analysis methods such as size exclusion chromatography-multiple angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and field flow fractionation-multiple angle light scattering (FFF-MALS). An added advantage of I2MS is low sample use, requiring 100-fold less than other methodologies.

Unfortunately, these configurations are highly susceptible to (i) inconsistent sampling volume due to differences in patient hematocrit or (ii) severe contamination due to leakage of red blood cells (RBCs) or release of hemoglobin (i.e., hemolysis).

Linking both vertical separation and lateral distribution of plasma yields discrete plasma collection zones that are spatially protected from potential contamination due to hemolysis and an inlet zone enriched with blood cells for additional testing.

One such group of plant specialized molecules is limonoids, which are structurally characterized as 4,4,8-trimethyl-17-furanyl steroidal skeleton. Limonoids are well known for their various biological activities such as potent anti-feedent, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, anti-diabetic, anti-viral, anti-microbial etc. These tetranortriterpenes are highly oxygenated and structurally diversified molecules majorly found in Meliaceae and Rutaceae and less frequently in the Cneoraceae families in the plant kingdom. Many of these plants have been used in traditional medicine from ages. One of the well-known limonoid, azadirachtin A is highly valued and widely popular for its outstanding insecticidal properties. Till date, nearly 2500 limonoids with over 35 unique carbon frameworks have been observed. In recent times, these molecules have dig a great interest among researchers due to their myriad biological properties. With the advancement of analytical techniques, the limonoid research is aced to explore more different molecules from their sources. In our review we cover all the Meliaceous limonoids isolated during July 2010 to Dec 2020. We found over 1502 new limonoids, which are reported from various Meliaceae plants after Jun 2010.  We have classified them based on their skeletal structure rearrangements and functional groups into various classes such as protolimonoids,   Apoprotolionoid,  Azadirone, Vilasinin, Cedrelone, Havanensin,  Trichilin, Nimbin, Salannin, Azadirachtin, Nimbolidin, Nimbolinin, Obacunol, Evodulone, Trijugin, Cipadesin, Andirobin, Mexicanolide, Phragmalin, Khayanolide, Preieurianin, Aphanamixoid, Nor Limonoid and N-containing derivatives.

On very low-loaded Ni/CeO2 surfaces, methane easily fully decomposes, CH4 -> C + 4H,  and water dissociates, H2O-> OH + H. However, in important reactions such as the direct oxidation of methane to methanol (MTM), where complex interplay exists between reactants (CH4, O2), it is desirable to avoid the complete dehydrogenation of methane to carbon.  Remarkably, the barrier for the activation of C\uf02dH bonds in CHx (x= 1-3) species on Ni/CeO2 surfaces can be manipulated by adding Cu, forming bimetallic NiCu clusters, whereas the ease for cleavage of O\uf02dH bonds in water, is not affected by ensemble effects, as obtained from density functional theory-based calculations. CH4 activation occurs only on Ni sites and H2O activation on both Ni and Cu sites. The MTM reaction pathway for the example of the Ni3Cu1/CeO2 model catalyst predict higher selectivity and a lower activation barrier for methanol production, compared with that for Ni4-CeO2. These findings point toward a possible strategy to design active and stable catalysts which can be employed for methane activation and conversions.", "date": "2022-06-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previously, our group has demonstrated that stacking a fast-wicking paper membrane on top of a slow-wicking paper membrane containing dried reagents enables the uniform rehydration of the dried reagents over large areas. This technique is utilized here to fabricate distance-based sweat chloride quantification strips, which requires the synthesis of insoluble silver chromate as an analytical reagent within paper. The in-situ generation of silver chromate for sweat chloride detection was previously accomplished by manually dipping a hydrophobically patterned paper channel into multiple precursor solutions with intermittent washing and drying. Compared to the previous technique, the stacking method obviates the need for i) patterning hydrophobic barriers in paper for creation of flow channels, and ii) multiple dipping steps that need large reagent volumes. The method is amenable to large scale manufacturing as the insoluble reagent can be synthesized uniformly over large paper areas and can then be cut into multiple sensing strips. The developed sensor has a limit of detection of ~0.3 mM and a wide linear dynamic range of 0-120mM for the detection of chloride ion, which enables the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, characterized by sweat chloride levels greater than 60 mM. This simple technique of in-situ synthesis of insoluble analytical reagents in paper could enable expanding the range of analytical chemistries that may be performed in paper-based analytical devices.

The molecular mechanism of TMAO stabilization against pressure and urea denaturation has been extensively studied, but unlike the case of other osmolytes the ability of TMAO to protect proteins from high temperature has not been quantified. To reveal the effect of TMAO on folded and unfolded protein ensembles and the hydration shell at different temperatures, we study a mutant of the well-characterized, fast-folding model protein B (PRB). We carried out >190 \u00b5s in total all-atom simulations of thermal folding/unfolding of PRB at multiple temperatures and concentrations of TMAO. The simulations show increased thermal stability of PRB in presence of TMAO. Partly structured, compact ensembles are favored over the unfolded state. TMAO forms two shells near the protein: an outer shell away from the protein surface alters hydrogen bond lifetimes of water molecules and increases hydration of the protein to help stabilize it; a less-populated inner shell with opposite TMAO orientation closer to the protein surface binds exclusively to basic side chains. The cooperative co-solute effect of the inner and outer shell TMAO has a small number of TMAO molecules \u2018herding\u2019 water molecules into two hydration shells at or near the protein surface.

Transition metal catalysis has become a powerful tool to convert unreactive aliphatic C\uf02dH bonds into an array of useful functionalities.1-3 Nonetheless, selective transformation of distal aliphatic C\uf02dH bonds still presents a significant challenge, more so in absence of an exogenous directing group.4-5 In this context, aliphatic acids have been identified as the choice of substrates that could be functionalized without utilizing any extra directing group. However, the weak coordination of carboxylate group has been shown to activate mostly the methyl group at \uf062 or \uf067 position, limiting the scope and applicability of aliphatic acids.6-8 Herein, we have developed a ligand enabled palladium catalyzed protocol that activates the challenging methylene C\uf02dH bond of aliphatic acids in presence of methyl C\uf02dH bonds to form bicyclic lactones in an intramolecular manner (mid to large size). The reported protocol allows the reversal of the general selectivity in aliphatic C\uf02dH bond activation.

Furthermore, synthesis of a variety of complex molecules via formal synthesis of natural products underscore the generality and significance of this reaction and suggestive of a new mode of C\uf02dH activation reactions in aliphatic acids that could simplify the synthesis of bicyclic lactones, that are important features of numerous natural products as well as pharmacoactive molecules.", "date": "2022-06-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Natural Products; Catalysis; Ligands (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, despite the excellent biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties, the major challenge of using diamond for implants, such as those used for hip arthroplasty, is the limitations of microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques to synthesize diamond on complex-shaped objects. Here, for the first time we demonstrate diamond growth on titanium acetabular shells using surface wave plasma CVD method. Polycrystalline diamond coatings were synthesized at low temperatures (~400 \u00b0C) on three types of acetabular shells with different surface structure and porosity. We achieved the growth of diamond on highly porous surfaces designed to mimic the structure of the trabecular bone and improve osseointegration. Biocompatibility was investigated on nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) and ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) coatings terminated either with hydrogen or oxygen. To understand the role of diamond surface topology and chemistry in the attachment and proliferation of mammalian cells, we investigated the adsorption of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and monitored the metabolic activity of fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Type I collagen with the diamond surfaces was investigated by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). We found that the proliferation of osteogenic cells was better on hydrogen terminated UNCD than on the oxygen terminated counterpart. These findings correlated with the behaviour of collagen on diamond substrates observed by FLIM. Hydrogen terminated UNCD provided better adhesion and proliferation of osteogenic cells, compared to titanium, while growth of fibroblasts was poorest on hydrogen terminated NCD and MSCs behaved similarly on all tested surfaces.

In this work, we thus assess the effect of different symmetry point groups (D3h, C2v, C3h and C3v) on the orbital localization to shed light on the role that the symmetry has in determining the optical features of the triangulene systems (on both S1-T1 inversion and oscillator strengths). The presence of the C_2 axis and the \u03c3_v plane (as it happens for the D3h, C2v and C3v groups) turned out to be critical for ensuring the proper orbital localization aimed at minimizing the exchange interaction and therefore favouring the inversion. In particular, adopting a C2v (and its subgroups) symmetry, either through the proper doping pattern, by introducing substituents, or by merging two triangulene cores, is the only way to conciliate a negative \u0394EST and a non-zero oscillator strength.

In this work, we review and synthesize published literature on the sustainability analyses of water and related technologies to present Quantitative Sustainable Design (QSD) \u2013 a methodology to expedite and support technology RD&D. With a shared lexicon and a structured approach, QSD facilitates interdisciplinary communication and research consistency. In introducing QSD, we review existing studies to highlight best practices and discuss them in the context of the specific steps of QSD, which include defining the problem space, establishing simulation algorithms, and characterizing system sustainability across economic, environmental, human health, and social dimensions. Next, we summarize tools for QSD execution and provide recommendations to account for uncertainty in this process. We further discuss applications of QSD in the fields of water/wastewater and beyond (e.g., renewable fuels, circular economy) in combination with uncertainty, sensitivity, and scenario analyses to generate the desired types of insight. Finally, we identify future research needs for sustainability analyses to advance technology RD&D. Ultimately, QSD can be used to elucidate the complex and intertwined connections among design decisions, technology characteristics, contextual factors, and sustainability indicators, thereby supporting transparent, consistent, and agile RD&D.

Polymerisation-induced self-assembly (PISA), which enables the in-situ formation of aqueous suspensions of diblock copolymer nano-objects of high solids content, has become a very popular polymerization process due to its many advantages in terms of simplicity, robustness, scalability and versatility. However, the preparation of degradable vinyl polymer nanoparticles by direct aqueous PISA has never been reported. This severely limits the use of PISA in biomedical and environmental applications. Herein, we report the first aqueous emulsion PISA able to generate degradable vinyl polymer nanoparticles. It relies on radical ring-opening polymerization-induced self-assembly (rROPISA) of traditional vinyl monomers (n-butyl acrylate or styrene) with dibenzo[c,e]oxepane-5-thione (DOT), a thionolactone that features high stability in protic solvents and favourable reactivity with many vinyl monomers, and is a precursor of labile thioester groups in the main chain. Stable aqueous suspensions of thioester-containing diblock copolymer nanoparticles were obtained with both vinyl monomers. Extensive degradation of the copolymers and the nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated under aminolytic or basic conditions. Given the success of the PISA process within the polymer community, this work has the potential to greatly expand its use in many areas, from nanomedicine (providing an extension to biocompatible vinyl polymers) to sustained materials in the context of the polymer circular economy.

The large KIE and the concavity in the Arrhenius plots are further fingerprints of tunneling. The simulations also predicted that the rapid tunneling rate and short half-life span for the forward reaction, as opposed to the reverse reaction in fluorinated secondary phosphine oxides, would result in P(V) being fleetingly stable and only P(III) being isolable, which agrees with previous experiments where only P(III) was detected by IR and NMR spectroscopy.

Here, time-resolved pulse radiolysis (PR) and stopped-flow spectroscopic studies have been applied to examine the kinetics and atomistic details involved in the elementary electron- and proton-transfer steps leading to complexes ligated by Cp*H, using Cp*Rh(bpy) as a molecular model (where bpy is 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl). Stopped-flow measurements coupled with infrared and UV-visible detection reveal that the sole product of initial protonation of Cp*Rh(bpy) is [Cp*Rh(H)(bpy)]+, an elusive hydride complex that has spectroscopically and kinetically characterized here for the first time. Tautomerization of the hydride leads to the clean formation of [(Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+. Variable-temperature and isotopic labeling experiments further confirm this assignment, providing experimental activation parameters and mechanistic insight into metal-mediated hydride-to-proton tautomerism. Spectroscopic monitoring of the second proton transfer event reveals both the hydride and related Cp*H complex can be involved in further reactivity, showing that [(Cp*H)Rh] is not necessarily an off-cycle intermediate, but, instead, depending on the strength of the acid used to drive catalysis, an active participant in hydrogen evolution.

In this work, we use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to pinpoint the nature of excited states of CdSe quantum dots embedded in various inorganic matrices. The formation of undercoordinated Se atoms and non-bridging oxygen atoms at QD/glass interface is responsible for the localization of a hole wavefunction, leading to the formation of low- energy excited states with weak oscillator strength. These states provide pathways for non-radiative processes and compete with radiative emission. The photoluminescence performance is predicted for CdSe quantum dots in different matrices, and validated by experiments.

Three aromatic amide-based ligands (L1-L3) with a central 1,8-diazatriptycene core were designed and used for self-assembly with Pd2+. While hundreds of stereoisomers based on the conformational flexibility around the amides and the unsymmetrical non-planar structure of the core are possible upon coordination with the metal, the constraints designed into the ligands direct the self-assembly towards only a single Pd2L4 cage (L1) or Pd4L8 double-walled metallomacrocycle (L2) structure, even in mixtures of the ligands. We further demonstrate that this structural approach and the modularity of the ligand synthesis affords ready access to the first deep endohedral functionalized double-walled Pd4L8 cavitands (L3).

Graphical models have been developed to predict constructive versus destructive interference in polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and have successfully estimated the large conductivity differences observed in single-molecule transport measurements. A major challenge lies in extending these models to excitonic (photoexcited) processes, which typically involve distinct orbitals with different symmetries. Here, we investigate how QI models can be applied as bridging moieties in intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) compounds to predict relative rates of triplet pair formation. In a series of bridged iSF dimers, we find that destructive QI always leads to slower triplet pair formation across different bridge lengths and geometries. A combined experimental and theoretical approach reveals the critical considerations of bridge topology and frontier molecular orbital energies in applying QI conductance principles to predict rates of multiexciton generation.

Then, by comparing the accessible conformational space and bioactivity of the analogs, it should be possible to estimate the bioactive conformational space. Here, we applied this strategy to identify the bioactive conformation of lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS(18:1)), an endogenous lipidic ligand of the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR34. We synthesized LysoPS analogues conformationally restricted with respect to the glycerol moiety and sampled the accessible conformation spaces of two active and two inactive analogues by means of long-duration replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and metadynamics (MTD) simulations. The conformational populations of these analogues and LysoPS itself were sampled with respect to two dihedral angles along the glycerol moiety. We found that REMD sampling of the whole molecule and MTD-based estimation of the free energy landscape gave similar results. Furthermore, the dihedral angles of LysoPS(18:1) in the previously identified docking pose with GPR34 were consistent with the range of dihedral angles in bioactive ligand conformations evaluated from the REMD and MTD calculations. Thus, at least with respect to the two dihedral angles of the glycerol moiety, the GPR34-bound conformation of LysoPS(18:1) corresponds well to some of the available unbound ligand conformations. Our findings are consistent with the \u201cconformational selection\u201d model of receptor recognition.

The results lead to a series of transformative insights. After initial reductive dechlorination by hydrated electron (eaq\u2013), multiple pathways occur, including hydrogenation, sulfonation, and dimerization. In particular, this study identified the unexpected hydroxylation pathway that convert the terminal ClCF2\u2212 into \u2212OOC\u2212, which is critical for the rapid and deep defluorination of F-53B. The hydroxylation of the middle carbons in CTFEOAs also triggers the cleavage of C\u2212C bonds, yielding multiple \u2212COO\u2212 groups to promote defluorination. Hence, the Cl atoms in Clx\u2212PFAS enhance defluorination in comparison with the perfluorinated analogs.

Cu is an active monometallic electrocatalyst for the NO3RR in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, where activity is limited by reduction of adsorbed nitrate to nitrite. Oxygen-vacancy forming metal-oxide supports provide sites for N-O bond activation in thermal reduction, impacting product distribution as well. Here we compare the electrochemical NO3RR activity of Cu deposited on two metal-oxide supports (cerium dioxide [Cu/CeO2\u2011\u03b4] and fluorine-doped tin dioxide [Cu/FTO]) to a Cu foil benchmark. Considering activity in phosphate-buffered neutral media, nitrate and adsorbed hydrogen compete for surface sites under NO3RR conditions. The less-cathodic overpotential on Cu/CeO2\u2011\u03b4 compared to Cu/FTO is attributed to stronger nitrate adsorption, similar to thermal nitrate reduction. Utilization of CeO2\u2011\u03b4 as electrocatalyst support slightly shift product distribution towards more oxidized products, either by enhancing nitrate affinity or by a more dynamic process involving formation and healing of oxygen vacancies.

Blocking the interaction between the S protein and ACE2 has emerged as an important strategy for preventing viral infection. We systematically developed and optimized an AlphaLISA assay to investigate binding events between ACE2 and the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (S-614G: residues 1\u20131208 with a D614G mutation). Using S-614G permits discovering potential allosteric inhibitors that stabilize the S protein in a conformation that impedes its access to ACE2. Over 30,000 small molecules were screened in a high-throughput format for activity against S-614G and ACE2 binding using the AlphaLISA assay. A viral entry assay was used to validate hits using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the full-length S protein of the Wuhan-1 strain. Two compounds identified in the screen, oleic acid and suramin, blocked the attachment of S-614G to ACE2 and S protein-driven cell entry into Calu-3 and ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells. Oleic acid inhibits S-614G binding to ACE2 far more potently than to the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 319\u2013541 of SARS-CoV-2 S), potentially indicating a non-competitive mechanism. The results indicate that using the full-length ectodomain of the S protein can be important for identifying allosteric inhibitors of ACE2 binding.

Yet their thermodynamic and kinetic properties still can not be predicted from first principles. There are three central challenges that need to be overcome to achieve this. Firstly, the dynamic nature of these solutions requires long time scale simulations. Secondly, the long-range Coulomb interactions require large spatial scales. Thirdly, the short-range quantum mechanical (QM) interactions require an expensive level of QM theory. Here, we demonstrate a methodology to address these challenges. Data from a short \\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation of aqueous sodium chloride is used to train an equivariant graph neural network interatomic potential (NNP) that can reliably reproduce the short-range QM forces and energies at a moderate computational cost. This NNP is combined with a continuum solvent description of the long-range electrostatic interactions to enable stable long time and large spatial scale simulations. From these simulations, ion-water and ion-ion radial distribution functions (RDFs), as well as ionic diffusivities, can be determined. The ion-ion RDFs are then used in a continuum solvent approach to calculate the osmotic and activity coefficients. Good experimental agreement is demonstrated up to the solubility limit of sodium chloride in water. This result implies that classical electrostatic theory can describe electrolyte solution over a remarkably wide concentration range as long as it is combined with an accurate description of the short-range interactions.  This approach should be applicable to determine the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of many important electrolyte solutions for which experimental data is insufficient.", "date": "2022-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence; Solution Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For the ortho-, meta-, or para-iodophenoxide anion (o-, m-, or p-IPhO-), the C-I bond rupture giving the anionic iodide (I-) fragment occurs via the nonadiabatic transition from the DBS to the nearby valence-bound states (VBS) of the anion where the vibronic coupling into the S1 (\u03c0-sigma*) state (which is repulsive along the C-I bond extension coordinate) should be largely responsible. The dynamic details are governed by the isomer-specific nature of the potential energy surfaces in the vicinity of the DBS-VBS curve crossings, as manifested in the huge different chemical reactivity of o-, m-, or p-IPhO-. It is confirmed here that the C-I bond dissociation is mediated by DBS resonances, providing the foremost evidence that the metastable DBS plays the essential role as the doorway into the anion chemistry especially of the dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The fragmentation channel is dominant when it is mediated by the DBS resonances located below the electron-affinity (EA) threshold, whereas it is kinetically adjusted by the competitive autodetachment process when the DBS resonances lying above EA convey the electron to the valence orbitals. The product yield of the C-I bond cleavage is strongly mode-dependent as the rate of the concomitant autodetachment is much influenced by the characteristics of the individual vibrational modes, paving a new way of the reaction control of the anion chemistry.", "date": "2022-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Achieving precise control over monomer sequence in synthetic copolymerizations is challenging, as sequence determination is influenced not only by the reaction conditions and the properties of the reactants, but also by the statistical nature of the copolymerization process itself. Mayo-Lewis reactivity ratios are often used to predict copolymer composition and sequence and are based on ratios of static reactivity constants. However, prior results have demonstrated that in a generic, solution-based step-growth A,B-copolymerization, relatively weak non-bonded attractions between certain monomer pairs induce emergent microphase separations. Such polymerization driven separations lead to deviations from standard kinetics, due to the emergent heterogeneities in reactant concentrations, which can also cause significant shifts in the resulting copolymer sequences. Previously, these effects were observed in systems where the activation energies were equal for all reaction pathways, that is, between all monomer pair combinations. In this work, we explore the combined effects on copolymerization kinetics of differences in both activation energies and non-bonded attractions between monomers and examine the sequences produced within this same step-growth copolymerization model. Our results indicate that altering activation energies influences the kinetics and sequences in a manner that also depends upon the non-bonded attractions, showing that these effects may work in concert or in opposition to one another to bias the sequences formed. Non-standard kinetic behaviors and long-range sequence biasing are observed under certain conditions, and the extent of each clearly shifts as the reaction proceeds. These findings provide insight into the complex interplay between sequence and nascent oligomer phase behavior, highlighting the potential for exploiting emergent phase properties in the informed design of advanced sequence-biased materials.", "date": "2022-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers); Polymerization kinetics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, it was found that Lewis acids of the types B(SiR3)3 and B(GeR3)3 bind N2  and CO with anomalously short and strong B-N or B-C bonds. B(SiH3)3\u2022N2  has a B-N bond length of 1.48 \u00c5 and a complexation enthalpy of -15.9 kcal/mol at the M06-2X/jun-cc-pVTZ level. The selective binding enhancement of N2  and CO is due to pi-backbonding from Lewis acid to Lewis base, as demonstrated by orbital analysis and density difference plots. The pi-backbonding is found to be a consequence of constructive orbital interactions between the diffuse and highly polarizable B-Si and B-Ge bond regions and the pi-regions of N2. This interaction is strengthened by electron donating substituents on Si or Ge. The pi-backbonding interaction is predicted to activate N2  for chemical transformation and reduction, as it decreases the electron density and increases the N-N bond length. The binding of N2  and CO by the B(SiR3)3 and B(GeR3)3 types of Lewis acids also has a strong pi-bond contribution. The relatively high pi-bond strength is connected to the high positive surface electrostatic potential [VS(r)] above the B atom at the pyramidal binding conformation.

We systematically characterize the influence of oil structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil-in-water drops. Three regimes corresponding to droplet \u201cattraction\u201d, \u201crepulsion\u201d or \u201cinactivity\u201d are identified and the chemical trends leading to these behaviors are discussed. Notably, droplet inactivity, wherein no convective flow is observed, can still occur even when the droplet is solubilizing at appreciable rates. Droplets that are inactive can be induced to become active through doping of the surfactant continuous phase with another oil type. We believe these studies contribute to a new fundamental understanding of solubilization processes in emulsions and provide guidance as to how chemical parameters can be used to influence the dynamics and chemotactic interactions between active droplets.", "date": "2022-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Typically, changes in the photocatalytic activity of donor:acceptor NPs are associated with differences in morphology due to the use of surfactants. However, as these NPs are single-component, their photocatalytic activity has a significantly lower dependence on morphology than two-component donor:acceptor NPs. Results from ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy show a minor difference between the photophysics of the TEBS- and SDS-stabilized Y6 NPs, with free charges present with either surfactant. The similar photophysics suggest that both TEBS- and SDS-stabilized Y6 NPs would be expected to have similar rates of H2 evolution. However, the results from photocatalysis show that Y6 NPs stabilized by TEBS have a H2 evolution rate 21 times higher than that of the SDS- stabilized NPs under broadband solar-like illumination (400\u2013900 nm). Transmission electron microscopy images of the Y6 NPs show effective photodeposition of Pt on the surface of the TEBS-stabilized NPs. In contrast, photodeposition of Pt is inhibited when SDS is used. Furthermore, the zeta potential of the NPs is higher in magnitude when SDS is present. Hence, we hypothesize that SDS forms a dense, insulating layer on the NP surface which hinders the photodeposition of Pt and reduces the rate of H2 evolution. This insulating effect is absent for TEBS-stabilized Y6 NPs, allowing a high rate of H2 evolution. The TEBS-stabilized Y6 NPs have a H2 evolution rate higher than most single-component organic photocatalysts, signaling the potential use of the Y-series acceptors for H2 evolution in Z-scheme photocatalysis.", "date": "2022-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Photocatalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Current DSSCs are based on either metal dye sensitizers, metal-free organic dyes or natural dyes. They have been extensively studied due to their low cost, simple preparation methodology, low toxicity, and ease of production. Still there is a need to find more abundant DSSC materials that at same time exhibit long-term stability. Computational studies have been an important ally for developing/designing new dye sensitizers. They are reviewed here with a special emphasis on the benefit of such studies. The conceptual understanding of development and working principle of photoactive DSSC materials are the primary feature of the review followed by examples of studies on different dye sensitizers using scarce to abundant metal based dyes and metal free organic dyes with donor-\u03c0-acceptor geometries for both n- and p-type DSSCs.

Keeler; Wenping Mao; Peter L. Gor'kov; Robert G. Griffin; Zhehong Gan", "abstract": "Oxygen is an integral component of proteins and nucleic acids, but remains sparsely studied in such samples because its only NMR active isotope, 17O, is a low sensitivity and resolution species. These properties are a consequence of its low natural abundance (0.039%) and the fact that 17O is a S = 5/2 nuclide with large quadrupolar couplings (6-11 MHz). In this work, we address these issues with efficient isotopic labeling, high magnetic fields, fast magic-angle spinning and indirect 1H detection. This combination of refinements, in conjunction with multidimensional heteronuclear correlation experiments, improves sensitivity and permits observation of oxygen sites specific to each amino acid residue in a model dipeptide sample in a manner consistent with the goal of high resolution. In particular, double-quantum cross-polarization at high sample spinning frequencies is found to provide efficient polarization transfer between 13C and 17O nuclei. Notably, the use of 17O as the initial source of polarization for experiments, as opposed to 1H, is found to be advantageous in terms of sensitivity per unit time due to the short 17O T1 relaxation. Additionally, the second-order quadrupolar broadening in the 17O dimension is averaged by incorporation of a low-power multiple-quantum sequence to yield sharp isotropic peaks. Comparison of isotropic and anisotropic 17O spectra allows extraction of quadrupolar parameters for each oxygen site. Finally, the high 17O resolution obtained is used in 3D experiments in combination with 13C polarization transfers and subsequent 1H detection to demonstrate the potential to determine sequential assignments and long range distance restraints. Collectively, these results suggest that 17O correlation spectroscopy can become an essential tool in the repertoire of techniques for biomolecular structure determination with the backbone 17O that has not yet been fully utilized.", "date": "2022-06-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In contrast, electrochemical CCC (eCCC) using redox carriers can theoretically approach 100% efficiency. However, there are currently few oxygen-stable redox carriers suitable for eCCC. Quinone derivatives have previously been studied as redox carriers, as they have no affinity for CO2 in the fully oxidized state and an enhanced affinity for CO2 in their reduced states. Unfortunately, the quinones used in prior studies displayed an unfavorable tradeoff between their second reduction potential (E1/2) and CO2 binding constant (KCO2). As a result, reduced quinones that exhibit a sufficient KCO2 for flue gas or atmospheric CO2 capture have E1/2 values negative of the O2/O2\u2022\u2012 reduction potential. To improve our understanding of the structural and electronic relationships that correlate KCO2 and E1/2, we report the largest set of quinones that have been experimentally evaluated for their KCO2 and E1/2 properties. The trends in the E1/2 and KCO2 properties were further investigated through extensive quantum chemical calculations to inform experimental carrier design. Notably, we identified structural handles to manipulate E1/2 and KCO2 properties of quinones; however, the altered steric and electronic effects did not disrupt their linear dependence.

The molecules proposed by these algorithms are often revealed to be false positives, i.e. outside the true candidate drug target profile (CDTP), because the predictors are being hacked by the generative model during the optimization. By hacking we mean an over-optimization of the predicted score leading to an actual decrease or stagnation of the real score. This issue is reminiscent of adversarial examples in Machine Learning and it can be seen as evidence of the Goodhart\u2019s law - \u201cwhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\u201d. This issue is even more apparent in a multi-objective setting where the models need to extrapolate outside the train set distribution, because there are no known molecules satisfying all the objectives simultaneously in the initial train set. However, analysing this problem is very difficult and expensive since it requires synthesis and tests of the generated molecules. Consequently, efforts have been made to develop various kinds of in silico oracles - real-valued functions used as proxies for molecular properties, to help with the evaluation of these generative model-based pipelines. However, these oracles have had a limited value so far, as they are often too easy to model in comparison to biological assays, and are usually limited to mono-objective cases.\nIn this work, we introduce a simulator of multi-target assays using a smartly initialized neural network (NN) which returns continuous values for any input molecule. We use this oracle to replicate a real-world prospective lead optimization scenario. First, we train predictive models on an initial small sample of molecules aimed at predicting their real oracle values. Second, we generate new optimized molecules using the open-source GuacaMol package, coupled with the previously built models. Finally, we select compounds which match the CDTP according to the predicted values and evaluate them by computing the true oracle values. We observe that even when the predictive models have excellent estimated performance metrics, the final selection still contains many false positives according to the NN-based oracle. We evaluate the optimization behavior in mono and bi-objective scenarios using either a logistic regression or a random forest predictive model. We also propose and evaluate several methods to help mitigate the hacking issue.", "date": "2022-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The predictive power of MD hinges on the ability of the interatomic potential to capture the underlying\nphysics and chemistry. There have been decades of seminal work on developing interatomic potentials albeit with\na focus predominantly on capturing the properties of bulk materials. Such physics-based models, while extensively\ndeployed for predicting dynamics and properties of nanoscale systems over the past two decades, tend to perform poorly\nin predicting nanoscale potential energy surface when compared to high-fidelity first-principles calculations.

We wondered whether a photoinduced transfer hydrogenation strategy might provide a viable pathway toward such a reaction. Hantzsch esters (and related organic structures) offer an opportunity for catalysis design in this context as they can behave as photoreductants, though to our knowledge they had yet to be shown to be compatible with such a redox intensive process (6 e\u2013/6 H+). In the present study we demonstrate that fully reduced Hantzsch esters (abbreviated as HEH2) successively deliver stored H2-equivalents to N2, producing NH3 catalytically, in the presence of a molecular precatalyst (Mo) under blue-light irradiation but otherwise ambient conditions. While not required for the observed photocatalysis, the addition of a photoredox catalyst (Ir) to the reaction mixture enhances both the rate and turnover number of the net transformation. Encouraging with respect to future studies toward recycling the donor, electrochemically or via hydrogenation, other N-heterocycle H2-donors are also compatible with catalysis in the presence of the photoredox catalyst. The reduction of N2 to NH3 by HEH2 or H2 are thermodynamically very similar (\u0394\u0394Gf(NH3) = 1.8 kcal mol\u20131 in acetonitrile). However, whereas the combination of H2 with N2 to produce NH3 is accomplished via high temperature and pressure over a metal catalyst, the needed overpotential to drive the reduction of N2 by HEH2 can instead be derived from light. This study hence illustrates a promising photoredox catalysis approach toward deep reduction of robust small molecule substrates via photoinduced transfer hydrogenation, with the complete reduction of the triple bond of N2 providing a vivid example.", "date": "2022-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Small Molecule Activation (Inorg.); Photocatalysis; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to obtain these derivatives fully analytically by combining the linear vibronic coupling (LVC) approach with analytic CASSCF derivatives and nonadiabatic couplings computed at a single equilibrium geometry and electronic structure.  We apply our analytic approach to the computation of Orbach and Raman relaxation rates in a solvated bis-cyclobutadienyl Dy(III) sandwich complex, where the solution environment is modelled by electrostatic multipole expansions, and benchmark our findings against results obtained using conventional numerical derivatives and a fully electronic description of the whole system.  Among the ghost, charge and charge+dipole representations, we find that the point charge model shows the best agreement with the reference calculation, but note that the main source of discrepancies observed in the magnetic relaxation rates originates from the approximate equilibrium electronic structure computed using the electrostatic environment models, rather than from the couplings.  We demonstrate that our novel LVC approach exhibits high accuracy over a wide range of coupling strengths and enables computational savings due to its analytic, \"single-shot'' nature.

Amorphous aluminosilicates are of particular interest in this sense because it is relatively simple to design them with diverse porous structures comprising micro, meso, and even macropores. In this work, we took advantage of the latter and developed a systematic and in-depth analysis of the results of nitrogen physisorption tests at 77 K performed over a series of microporous \u2013 mesoporous amorphous aluminosilicates and of the characterization of their texture by classical models to estimate surface area and porosity. The strategy for the analysis consisted of making a thorough description of the features showed by the recorded nitrogen isotherms, first. As a result, a proposal for considering two new types of isotherms, types I(c) and IV(c), and five new types of hysteresis loops, H1(b), H2(c), H3(b), H3(c), and H4(b), in addition to the standard IUPAC classification. These new categories stemmed from the microporous \u2013 mesoporous nature of the materials and from the presence of strong network effects. The previous analysis helped interpreting and judging the results of the calculations made with classical methods to assess the texture of the materials; namely, their BET surface area, t-plot microporosity, BJH mesopore size distribution, and fractal dimension. The performed analyses allowed establishing that the relative percentage of microporosity of the materials can be correlated to the physisorption energy as described qualitatively by the CBET constant. Concerning mesopore size distributions, it was found that the BJH method remains to be very valuable for describing the porous structure of the materials particularly if the results obtained with both branches of the isotherms are considered. Finally, it was shown that the fractal dimension can complement the analysis of the porous structure of microporous \u2013 mesoporous materials if the latter are compared considering the features of their isotherms and of their hysteresis loops. Overall, the present study can thus be said to make two contributions: (i) it proposes a systematic methodology for analyzing both the raw data and the textural properties calculated by classical methods both derived from nitrogen physisorption experiments.

Cellular proliferation and de novo synthesis of lipids are related to cancer progression. In this study, we evaluated the lipidomic profile of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer and multicellular tumor spheroids from the HCT 116 colon carcinoma cell line. We utilized serial trypsinization on the spheroid samples to generate three cellular populations representing the proliferative, quiescent, and necrotic regions of the spheroid. This analysis enabled a comprehensive identification and quantification of lipids produced in each of the spheroid layer and 2D cultures. We show that lipid subclasses associated with lipid droplets form in oxygen-restricted and acidic regions of spheroids and are produced at higher levels than in 2D cultures. Additionally, sphingolipid production, which is implicated in cell death and survival pathways, is higher in spheroids relative to 2D cells.

To date, barely a few HF yellow emitters with desired narrowband emission but moderate external quantum efficiency (EQE <20%) have been reported. This is because a systematic strategy embracing both F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and triplet to singlet (TTS) transition as complementary mechanisms for effective excitons transfer has not yet been proposed. Herein, we present a rational approach, which allows to through subtle structural modification, a pair of compounds built from the same donor and acceptor subunits, but with varied communication between these ambipolar fragments, to be obtained. The TADF-active dopant is based on a naphthalimide scaffold linked to the nitrogen of a carbazole moiety, which through the introduction of an additional bond leads not only to \u03c0-cloud enlargement but also rigidifies and inhibits rotation of the donor. This structural change prevents TADF, and allows to guide bandgaps and excited states energies to simultaneously pursue FRET and TTS process. New OLED devices utilizing the presented emitters show excellent external quantum efficiency (up to 27%) and narrow full width at half maximum (40nm), which is a consequence of very good alignment of energy levels. The presented design principles prove that only a minor structural modification is needed to obtain commercially applicable dyes for HF OLED devices.", "date": "2022-06-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Scientific methods such as fluorescence labeling, nanoscale super-resolution microscopy, advances in single cell RNAseq and proteomics technologies, provide more detailed information about biological processes which were not evident with the analysis of bulk material. This new era of single-cell biology provides a better understanding of such complex biological systems as cancer, inflammation, immunity mechanism and aging processes, and opens the door into the field of drug response heterogeneity. The latest discoveries of cellular heterogeneity gives us an unique understanding of complex biological processes, such as disease mechanism, and will lead to new strategies for better and personalized treatment strategies.

The studies on the ligand-ligand interaction are hampered by the disordered and dynamic nature of the surface, the low electron contrast of organic moieties, and the non-characteristic weak intermolecular forces. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can provide site-specific information on organic ligands and especially the motional behavior of chain segments. In this work, we develop an advanced solid-state NMR measurement and modelling strategy to quantify the \u201cdynamic volume\u201d of chain segments. The dynamic volume depicts the accessible space of a chain segment under the confinement of neighboring molecules, and is inversely proportional to the intermolecular interaction energy. The ligand-ligand interaction energies have been obtained for NCs with alkanoate ligands of different lengths. We show that the calculated ligand-ligand interaction energy determines solution dispersity and the melting transitions of NCs. This dynamic volume concept can be extended beyond experimental NMR measurements and offer semi-empirical predictions of the interaction energies for arbitrary selections of alkanoate ligands. Our study not only advances the quantitative understanding of ligand-ligand interaction on NCs but also establishes novel tactics to calibrate weak intermolecular interactions.

Therefore, an atomistic understanding of the transport properties of water in layered  GO  is pivotal for the development of novel GO membranes. Surprisingly, the very issue of the two-dimensional self-diffusion of water confined between two GO sheets appears to be controversial and simulations showing either a slow-down or no effect have been reported. In any case the formation of Hydrogen bonds, i.e. among the confined water and between water and the GO functional groups, was identified to control diffusion. However, results of molecular dynamics simulations heavily depend on the used forces. Density functional theory and empirical force fields are on opposite when it comes to accuracy and numerical costs. \nAs a compromise in the present study we performed molecular dynamics simulations using a density functional theory-based tight method (xTB) to investigate the diffusion of water confined between GO sheets. Specifically, we considered six GO/water models, differing in the ordering of epoxide and hydroxyl groups as well as in the thickness of the water layer.  For these models, having GO inter-layer distances between 8 and 12 \\AA{} we find a reduction of the diffusion coefficient by a factor in between two and three as compared with bulk water. \nOne possible origin of this effect is the temporary trapping of water within Hydrogen-bonded water bridges between the GO sheets.

In all cases, hypoxia elicits responses affecting the biological system that is experiencing low oxygen that impact on its survival. In the case of bacterial biofilms and tumors, hypoxia makes treating these conditions more difficult and has a negative impact on patient prognosis. Therefore, chemical probes that enable the study of biological hypoxia are valuable tools to help increase understanding of disease-related conditions that involve low oxygen levels, ultimately leading to improved diagnosis and treatment. While a number of small molecule-based hypoxia-sensing probes exist, the majority of these image only very severe hypoxia (\u22651% O2), and therefore do not give a full picture of biological hypoxia, which is heterogenous. Commonly used antibody-based imaging tools for hypoxia are less convenient than small molecules, as secondary detection steps involving immunostaining are required. Here we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, photophysical analysis, and biological validation of a range of indolequinone-based bioreductive fluorescent probes. We show that these compounds can image different levels of hypoxia in 2D and 3D cell culture. The resorufin-based probe 2 was activated in conditions of 4% O2 and lower, while the Tokyo green-based probe 4 was only activated in severe hypoxia \u2013 0.5% O2 and less. Simultaneous application of these compounds in spheroids revealed that compound 2 images similar levels of hypoxia to pimonidazole, while compound 4 images more extreme hypoxia in a manner analogous to EF5.

Here, we report an approach that allows for the controlled delivery of DNA and protein therapeutics to allow for either burst or slow-release kinetics without altering the formulation; further, we show we can deliver these materials into the tissues of very different organisms without the use of needles.

Translocation is one essential step for RdRp to exert the viral replication and transcription, and it describes the dynamic process in which the double-stranded RNA moves upstream by one base pair position to empty the active site for the continuous substrate incorporation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamic translocation of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp remain elusive. In the current study, we have elucidated the molecular insights into the translocation dynamics of SARS- CoV-2 RdRp by constructing a Markov State Model based on extensive molecular dynamics simulations. We have identified two previously uncharacterized intermediates which pinpoint an asynchronous and rate-limiting translocation of the nascent-template duplex. The movement of the 3\u2019-terminal nucleotide in the nascent strand lags behind its upstream nucleotides due to the uneven protein environment while the translocation of template strand is delayed by the hurdle residue K500. Although the motions of the two strands are not synchronous, they share the same \u201cratchet\u201d to stabilize the system in the post-translocation state, suggesting a coupled Brownian-ratchet model.

In the present study, we propose a strategy using CiD agonists (circular DNA aptamer-based agonists), where circularized DNA is used as a rigid scaffold to present two receptor-binding aptamers from the duplex linker domain in a fixed distance and orientation. We targeted Met, a receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and designed Met-binding CiD agonists with variable linker length. The designed CiD agonists demonstrated a distinctive periodic change in the receptor activation potential dependent on their linker length.

Finally, we applied the correction method to a few reactions with molecules significantly different from those in the QM9 dataset that was used to fit the linear regression model.

We recently identified disubstituted pyrimidine IKK16 as a compound which demonstrated strong activity against blood stage Pf3D7 parasites, while also exhibiting potent activity against PfGSK3 and PfPK6. Here we describe the synthesis of a series of IKK16 analogues and efforts to establish structure activity relationships to develop compounds with enhanced inhibition of PfPK6 and PfGSK3. We made extensive modifications focused on the 2, 4, and 5 positions of the pyrimidine core. The new synthesized compounds were assessed for enzymatic activity on PfGSK3 and PfPK6 using a split luciferase binding assay, and many of them displayed low nanomolar potency against both kinases. The most potent inhibitors were further assessed for activity against blood stage P. falciparum 3D7 parasites as well as liver stage P. berghei parasites. This culminated in the discovery of compounds 23d and 23e which displayed the most promising biological profiles among this set of analogues. Both compounds showed the greatest inhibitory activity against PfGSK3 and PfPK6 (23d PfGSK3 IC50 = 172 nM, PfPK6 IC50 = 11 nM, 23e PfGSK3 IC50 = 97 nM, PfPK6 IC50 = 8 nM) and demonstrated considerable activity against blood stage parasitemia (23d Pf3D7 EC50 = 552 nM, 23e Pf3D7 EC50 = 1400 nM). Also, the ligand efficiency of these compounds was greater than IKK16. Both compounds exhibited significant promiscuity when tested in a panel of human kinase targets.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins compromises cellular integrity by disrupting cellular proteostasis networks, which can further destabilize the cellular proteome. While direct conjugation targets can be discovered through affinity-based protein profiling, there are few approaches to probe how cellular exposure to toxicants impacts the stability of the proteome. We apply a quantitative proteomics methodology to identify chloroacetanilide-destabilized proteins in HEK293T cells based on their binding to the H31Q mutant of the human Hsp40 chaperone DNAJB8. We find that brief cellular exposure to the chloroacetanilides acetochlor, alachlor, and propachlor induces misfolding of dozens of cellular proteins. These herbicides feature distinct but overlapping profiles of protein destabilization, highly concentrated in proteins with reactive cysteine residues. Propachlor induces a general increase in protein aggregation, and selectively targets GAPDH and PARK7, leading to a decrease in their cellular activities. GAPDH is primarily modified by direct conjugation of propachlor at a catalytic cysteine residue, leading to global destabilization of the protein. The Hsp40 affinity strategy is an effective technique to profile cellular proteins that are destabilized by cellular toxin exposure.\n\nRaw proteomics data is available through the PRIDE Archive at PXD030635.\n", "date": "2022-06-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Environmental biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Results showed an average concentration between 0.17 \u2013 0.24 mg/kg, 2.22 \u2013 2.34 mg/kg, 0.12 \u2013 0.15 mg/kg, 0.95 \u2013 1.32 mg/kg, and 1.81 \u2013 1.96 mg/kg for copper, iron, lead, manganese, and zinc, respectively. Statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison test (p < 0.05) showed no significant differences in the trace metal content of free-range and factory-farmed chicken meats, suggesting that in terms of the levels of these trace metals, not much differentiates the two varieties. Analysis of the health hazards, reported as target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazardous index (HI), associated with the consumption of the said chicken breast meat indicated no potential health risks.", "date": "2022-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Accurate computational predictions would allow rapid in silico screening of candidate AMPs, thereby accelerating the discovery process. Kernel methods are a class of machine learning algorithms that utilise a kernel function to transform input data into a new representation. When appropriately normalised, the kernel function can be regarded as a notion of similarity between instances. However, many expressive notions of similarity are not valid kernel functions, meaning they cannot be used with standard kernel methods such as the support-vector machine (SVM). The Kre\u0131n-SVM represents a generalisation of the standard SVM that admits a much larger class of similarity functions. In this study, we propose and develop Kre\u0131n-SVM models for AMP classification and prediction by employing the Levenshtein distance and local alignment score as sequence similarity functions. Utilising two datasets from the literature, each containing more than 3000 peptides, we train models to predict general antimicrobial activity. Our best models achieve an AUC of 0.967 and 0.863 on the test sets of each respective dataset, outperforming the in-house and literature baselines in both cases. We also curate a dataset of experimentally validated peptides, measured against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in order to evaluate the applicability of our methodology in predicting microbe-specific activity. In this case, our best models achieve an AUC of 0.933 and 0.917, respectively. Models to predict both general and microbe-specific activities are made available as web applications.", "date": "2022-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Nutritional strategies that target microbial conversion of choline into TMA could reduce cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis burden by reducing subsequent formation of TMAO. This study aimed to evaluate 1) whether beverages rich in known inhibitors of TMA production (chlorogenic acid, catechin and epicatechin) can reduce TMA formation and 2) the effect of upper gastrointestinal digestion on efficacy. To do this, either raw or digested coffee, tea and cocoa beverages were evaluated for their TMA-d9 production inhibition in our ex vivo-in vitro fermentation model with human fecal slurries and choline-d9 substrate. Results showed that digestion was required to unlock the TMA-d9 production inhibition potential of coffee and cocoa beverages, and that teas did not possess a strong inhibition potential either digested or undigested. By fractionating digested bioactive beverages, we determined that those fractions rich in chlorogenic acid were the most bioactive. Overall, this study suggests that regular cocoa and coffee consumption could be a nutritional strategy able to reduce TMAO levels. In vivo studies should be carried out to confirm the potential of these beverages as strategies to inhibit TMA production.", "date": "2022-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, OOMP2 is known to suffer from divergent correlation energies in regimes of small orbital energy gaps. To address this issue, several approaches to amplitude regularization have been explored, with those featuring energy-gap dependent regularizers appearing to be most transferable and physically justifiable.  For instance, $\\kappa$-OOMP2 was shown to address the energy divergence issue in, e.g., bond-breaking processes while offering a significant improvement in accuracy for the W4-11 thermochemistry dataset, and a parameter of $\\kappa$=1.45 was recommended.  A more recent investigation of regularized MP2 with Hartree-Fock orbitals revealed that stronger regularization (i.e. smaller values of $\\kappa$) than what had previously been recommended for $\\kappa$-OOMP2 may offer huge improvements in certain cases such as noncovalent interactions while retaining a high level of accuracy for main-group thermochemistry datasets. In this study we investigate the transferability of those findings to $\\kappa$-OOMP2 and assess the implications of stronger regularization on the ability of $\\kappa$-OOMP2 to diagnose strong static correlation. We found similar results using $\\kappa$-OOMP2 for several main-group thermochemistry, barrier height, and noncovalent interaction datasets including both closed shell and open shell species.  However, stronger regularization yielded substantially higher accuracy for open-shell transition metal thermochemistry, and is necessary to provide qualitatively correct spin symmetry breaking behavior for several large and electrochemically-relevant transition metal systems.

Upon applying a contact force of 5 mN with a 5-10 \u00b5m microprobe, the characteristic failure diameter of lithium metal decreases by a factor of 2.6 due to the generation of nanoscale cracks as suggested by nanoindentation and finite element simulations.

The enhancements are maximized near resonant frequencies in line with the time scales of the elementary steps. In this work, we perform a microkinetic analysis on a generalized electrochemical mechanism in order to evaluate the extent to which electrochemical potential can be used as a lever to achieve resonant catalytic rate enhancement. We illustrate that, because changing the electrochemical potential changes the free energy of reaction, the approach is conceptually distinct from oscillating binding energies of catalytic intermediates in isolation. However, benchmarks for rate and efficiency gains relative to potentiostatic operation can still be defined. We show that for faradaic reactions in series, no enhancements relative to the maximum steady-state TOF (within the potential range spanned by oscillation) can be achieved, even in cases where the dynamic potential limits favor adsorption and desorption, respectively. Enhancements relative to the average steady-state TOF (weighted by time at each potential), can be achieved at specific frequency/amplitude/duty cycle combinations, but only if the elementary reactions show disparate symmetry factors. In contrast, if a faradaically-driven parallel reaction controls the coverage of a strongly-adsorbed blocking species on a surface, significant dynamic rate enhancements over the maximum steady-state TOFs can be achieved, albeit at a significant cost of thermodynamic efficiency.

The ~5.8 nm tetrahedral DNA framework affords precise spatial organization and matched valence as four neutralizing aptamers (MATCH-4), which matches with nanometer precision the topmost surface of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer, enhancing the interaction between MATCH-4 and spike trimer.

The combined evidence suggests that H2 activation occurs by addition across the Zn\u2013N bond via a four-membered transition state in which the Zn and N atoms play a dual role of Lewis acid and Lewis base. The zinc hydride complex that results from H2 addition, has been shown to be remarkably effective for the hydrozincation of C=C bonds at modest temperatures. The scope of hy-drozincation includes alkynes, alkenes, and a 1,3-butadiyne. For alkynes, the hydrozincation step is stereospecific leading exclusively to the syn-isomer. Competition experiments show that the hydrozincation of alkynes is faster than the equivalent alkene substrates. These new discoveries have been used to develop an unprecedented catalytic sys-tem for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes.

Specific enzymatic degradation of the blocker strand subsequently enables the strand displacement reaction. The kinetics of the blocker enzymatic degradation thus controls the time at which the strand displacement reaction starts. By varying the concentration of the blocker strand and the concentration of the enzyme we show that we can finely tune and modulate the delayed onset of the strand displacement reaction. Additionally, we show that the strategy is versatile and can be orthogonally controlled by different enzymes each specifically targeting a different blocker strand. We designed and established three different delayed strand displacement reactions using RNase H and the two DNA repair enzymes Fpg and UDG and corresponding blockers. The achieved temporal delay can be programmed with high flexibility without undesired leak and can be conveniently predicted using kinetic modeling.

Addition of TEMPOH to (tBu,TolDHP)CoOTf results in the formation of an unusual Co-adduct of 1-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-ium (TEMPOH2+) which has been characterized with IR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction.

In a drug discovery setting, pharmaceutical companies all own substantial but confidential datasets. The MELLODDY project develops a privacy-preserving federated machine learning solution and deploys it at an unprecedented scale (more than 100,000 tasks across ten major pharmaceutical companies), while ensuring the security and privacy of each partner\u2019s sensitive data. Each partner builds models that benefit from a shared representation, for their own private assays. Established predictive performance metrics such as AUC ROC or AUC PR are constrained to unseen labelled chemical space. However, they cannot gauge performance gains in unlabelled chemical space. Federated learning indirectly extends labelled space, but in a privacy-preserving context, a partner cannot use this label extension for performance assessment.  Metrics that estimate uncertainty on a prediction can be calculated even where no label is known. Practically, the chemical space covered with predictions of sufficient confidence, reflects the applicability domain of a model. After establishing a link to established performance metrics, we propose the efficiency from the conformal prediction framework (\u2018conformal efficiency\u2019) as a proxy to the applicability domain size. A documented extension of the applicability domain would qualify as a tangible benefit from federated learning. In interim assessments, MELLODDY partners report a median increase in conformal efficiency of the federated over the single-partner model of 5.5% (with increases up to 9.7%). Subject to distributional conditions, that efficiency increase can be directly interpreted as the expected increase in conformal i.e. high confidence predictions.

In this study, we established a polarity-switching multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry method to mine amino acid-conjugated bile acids (AA-BAs) derived from host-gut microbiota cometabolism. Using the developed method, we discovered and identified 14 types of amino acid conjugations with host BAs for the first time including serine, valine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, aspartic acid, lysine, glutamine, glutamic acid, methionine, histidine, arginine, isoleucine, and tryptophan conjugations in mouse and human feces.

When full localization of occupied orbitals into bonds is possible, bonding and antibonding orbitals exist in 1:1 correspondence with each other. Antibonding orbitals play an important role in chemistry because they are frontier orbitals that determine orbital interactions, as well as much of the response of the bonding orbital to perturbations. In this work, we present an efficient method to construct antibonding orbitals by finding the orbital that yields the maximum opposite spin pair correlation amplitude in second order perturbation theory (AB2) and compare it with other techniques with increasing the size of the basis set. We conclude the AB2 antibonding orbitals are a more robust alternative to the Sano orbitals as initial guesses for valence bond calculations, due to having a useful basis set limit.  The AB2 orbitals are also useful for efficiently constructing an active space, and work as good initial guesses for valence excited states. In addition, when combined with the localized occupied orbitals, and relocalized, the result is a set of molecule-adapted minimal basis functions that is built without any reference to atomic orbitals of the free atom. As examples, they are applied to population analysis of halogenated methane derivatives, H-Be-Cl, and SF6 where they show some advantages relative to good alternative methods.", "date": "2022-06-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Stress concentrates around locally disordered zones where the crack is pinned while crack propagation is delayed. In situ imaging shows that obstacles to crack propagation are either larger-than-average alumina platelets or bundles of alumina platelets misaligned with respect to the majority of the platelets.

Systematic evaluations in yeast display format of more than 40 ncAA-substituted variants revealed numerous clones that retain binding function while gaining either UV-mediated or spontaneous crosslinking capabilities. Solution-based analyses indicate that ncAA-substituted clones exhibit site-dependent target specificity and crosslinking capabilities uniquely conferred by ncAAs. Interestingly, not all ncAA substitution sites resulted in crosslinking events, and our data showed no apparent correlation between detected crosslinking levels and distances between sdAbs and LC/A residues.

Molecular layer deposition (MLD) allows the deposition of these hybrid films using sequential, self-limiting reactions, similar to atomic layer deposition (ALD). In this paper, we use first principles density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the growth mechanism of titanium-containing hybrid organic-inorganic MLD films, known as \u201ctitanicones\u201d. We investigate in detail the chemistry between the most common Ti precursors, namely titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium (Ti(DMA)4,) and ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol (GL) as the organic precursors. We analyse the impact of the substrate on the initial MLD reactions in titanicone film growth using three different surface models: anatase TiO2, rutile TiO2 and Al2O3. Calculated energetics show that while TiCl4 is reactive towards the anatase and rutile TiO2 surfaces, it is not reactive towards the Al2O3 surface. Ti(DMA)4 is reactive towards all surfaces. This is attributed to the stronger Ti-Cl bonds in TiCl4 compared to Ti-N bonds in Ti(DMA)4. Ti(DMA)4 also shows high reactivity to the organics compared to TiCl4. Double reactions of EG and GL with the TiCl3 species from TiCl4 and TiDMA species from Ti(DMA)4 are also explored to better understand the origin of the different thicknesses of EG-titanicone and GL-titanicone films observed in experimental work. We find that EG and GL coupled with TiCl4 can orient in a flat lying configuration on anatase while on rutile, the preferred orientation is upright. When combined with Ti(DMA)4, EG and GL prefer the flat lying configuration on all surfaces. This work shows that the choice of the surface and the metallic precursor has a major impact on the behaviour of organic species. DFT findings provide motivation to develop a low temperature rutile TiO2/titanicone film suggesting that the desired film growth could be achieved.", "date": "2022-06-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Recent investigations into the state of these deposited experimental structures\u2019 chemical accuracy identified an array of common structural errors\u2014including omitted protons, missing counterions, and disordered structures. These structural errors propagate into the SBUs mined from experimental MOFs, culminating in inaccurate hMOF structures possessing net charges or missing atoms which were not accounted for previously.

An analysis of the prevailing errors discovered during the examination process is provided along with representative cases to aid with error detection in future studies involving SBU extraction and hMOF construction. A novel repair protocol was established and employed to generate a library of SBUs that are hand-examined and labeled with enhanced detail (HEALED).

In this work, we quantify the energetic information in terms of Shannon entropy and Fisher information for energetic distributions of atoms and molecules. Two identities are unveiled for the energetic density, its gradient and Laplacian to rigorously satisfy. A new partition scheme to decompose atoms in molecules has been proposed using the energetic distribution.

Hydrogen bond acidity is reviewed and it is shown how polarity can be estimated for individual hydrogen bond donors and acceptors from alkane/water partition coefficient measurements. Hydrogen bond donors are generally less polar than hydrogen bond acceptors and desolvation penalty is therefore an implausible explanation for deleterious effects of hydrogen bond donors. Generally, the number of hydrogen bond acceptors in organic compounds exceeds the number of hydrogen bond donors and the apparently greater restrictiveness of the Rule of 5 for hydrogen bond donors may simply be a reflection of this imbalance. The weaker hydration of hydrogen bond donors implies that attempts to address polarity surfeit in optimization of permeability should be focused on hydrogen bond acceptors. Elimination of redundant hydrogen bond donors can potentially reduce active efflux and destabilize the solid state without resulting in unacceptable increases in lipophilicity. The key hydrogen bond donor-acceptor asymmetry in the context of target recognition is that the presence of a hydrogen bond donor usually implies that a hydrogen bond acceptor is also present. Target-ligand hydrogen bonds form in aqueous media and design opportunities presented by frustrated hydration and secondary interactions are discussed. Hydrogen bond donors based on oxygen, nitrogen and carbon are compared as target recognition elements and potential benefits of halogen and chalcogen bond donors as replacements for hydrogen bond donors are discussed.

The three-stage planar systems were developed by overlapping three single-stage modules.

One of the toughest challenges is analyzing the mutually amplified phenomena between various hazards, known as \u201cmulti-hazard coupling effects\u201d. Despite the increasing attention devoted to the emerging research field, there still is no systematic and comprehensive review to summarize and overview multi-hazard coupling studies in CPI. In our work, 184 relevant grey- and peer-review literature are extracted and analyzed to systemize knowledge, identify research advances, and investigate future perspectives. To be specific, the following three research objectives are proposed: (1) To develop an interdisciplinary integration of fragmented literature that is applicable to a broad range of multi-hazard coupling scenarios related to CPI; (2) To expound the coupling hazard-formative mechanism on typical multi-hazard scenarios in CIP; (3) To investigate the existing methodologies on different topics related to multi-hazard coupling effects. \nA two-part systematic and comprehensive review on more studies under the inclusive interdisciplinary integration of multi-hazard coupling scenarios was obtained to achieve the proposed three research objectives, with providing academics the picture of the inter-connections among different categories of studies and help the researchers to identify the research advances and future perspectives in this field. Compared to domino accidents and Na-tech events, the study of multi-hazard coupling is still in its infancy. There is still a fertile field for future research. Such a multi-disciplinary problem requires to be studied from environmental to technological and social aspects. Although this review provides a macroscopic and systematic framework for multi-hazard coupling research, a large number of high-quality studies are still needed to fill in the research gaps. The hope is that this work can provide some help for the development of the theoretical system of multi-hazard coupling effects.\nThis document is a technical report, which is written to support the two-part literature review: \u201cMulti-hazard Coupling Effects in Chemical Process Industry: Part I Preliminaries and Mechanism (DOI: 10.1109/JSYST.2022.3182994)\u201d and \u201cMulti-hazard Coupling Effects in Chemical Process Industry: Part II Research Advances and Future Perspectives on Methodology (DOI: 10.1109/JSYST.2022.3182983)\u201d.\n", "date": "2022-06-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Environmental Science; Industrial Manufacturing; Thermodynamics (Chem.

The formation and growth of these dendrites cause an inevitable failure at charge rates far below the threshold set by industry (>5 mA/cm2) and are supposedly caused by stress accumulation stemming from the deposited lithium itself. Herein, we demonstrate that MHz pulsed currents can be used to increase the current density by a factor of six, reaching values as high as 6.6 mA/cm2 without forming Li dendrites. To understand the origin of this improvement we propose an extension of previous mechanisms by considering the Li activity as a critical factor. The Li activity becomes relevant when Li is geometrically constrained, and the local plating rate exceeds the exchange current density. Over a critical Li activity, the solid-state electrolyte close to the tip of the dendrite fractures and releases the accumulated elastic energy. These events deteriorate the functional and mechanical performance of the SSLB. Since the buildup of a critical Li activity requires a certain time, the application of current pulses at shorter time scales can be used to significantly improve the rate-performance of SSLB, representing a potential step towards the practical realization of electric vehicles and other emerging applications.

Herein, we identify the inner membrane protein TonB, motor of active uptake in Gram negative bacteria, as a novel target in antimicrobial therapy. The interaction of the TonB box, the periplasmic N-terminal domain of ferri-siderophore transporters, with the inner membrane protein TonB is crucial for the internalization of essential bacterial metabolites. Overexpression of a TonB box-containing peptide fragment in P. aeruginosa resulted in a growth repression, even in the presence of ferric heme as an iron source. The coupling of three TonB box peptides to synthetic DOTAM and MECAM siderophores with covalent or cleavable linkers of varying length and attachment sites yielded a panel of 24 conjugates in up to 32 synthetic steps. The transporters mediating iron uptake through these conjugates were identified by molecular approaches and transporter knockout mutants to be PfeA and PirA. The conjugates 11, 13 and 17 repressed bacterial growth in P. aeruginosa strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.5, 4 and 0.1 \u03bcM, respectively.

Here, we realize high-efficiency, long-lifetime and large-area NIR light sources based on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and NIR-emitting PbS quantum dots (QDs) as color conversion layers. To obtain highly efficient PbS QDs, a unique additive composition comprising KCl and crown ethers is employed, which can significantly passivate trap states in the air and at room temperature, thus improving the photoluminescence quantum efficiency from 24% to 35% in solution and further to 45% in blend films. The well-passivated PbS QD films are then integrated with red OLEDs and the resulting QD-OLEDs exhibit high-performance NIR emission centered at 887 nm, a high external quantum efficiency of 5.2% at a radiance of 10 W sr-1 m-2, and superior operational stability with long lifetime T90 of 188 hours at the current density of 25 mA cm-2, which presents the best result for solution-processed NIR LEDs.

In the present work, we have numerically demonstrated that spatial shaping of nanoscale temperature fields can be achieved by plasmonic heating of a single titanium nitride (TiN) nanostructure. A key feature of TiN is its low thermal conductivity (k_TiN = 29 [W m\u22121K\u22121]) compared with ordinary plasmonic metals such as Au (k_Au = 314 [W m\u22121K\u22121]). When localized surface plasmon resonance of a metal nanostructure is excited, light intensity will be converted to heat power density in the nanostructure via the Joule heating effect. For a gold nanoparticle, nonuniform spatial distributions of the heat power density will be disappeared due to the high thermal conductivity of Au; the nanoparticle surface will be entirely isothermal. In contrast, the spatial distributions of the heat power density can be clearly transcribed into temperature fields on a TiN nanostructure because heat dissipation is suppressed. In fact, we have revealed that highly localized temperature distributions can be selectively controlled around the TiN nanostructure in the several tens of nm spatial resolution depending on excitation wavelength. The present results indicate that the arbitrary temperature shaping at the nanometer scale can be achieved by designing the heat power density in TiN nanostructures in plasmonic heating, leading to unconventional thermofluidics and thermal chemical biology.

Since the discovery that ionic liquids (ILs) can absorb CO2, various solvents composed of molecular ions have been developed and their CO2 solubility has been studied. However, it is challenging to optimize these materials to realize targeted properties as the number of candidate ion combinations for designing novel ILs is of the order of 1018. In this study, electronic- structure informatics was applied as an interdisciplinary approach to quantum chemistry calculations, and combined with machine learning to search 402,114 IL candidates to identify those with better CO2 solubility than known materials. Guided by the machine-learning results, trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium perfluorooctanesulfonate was synthesized and it was experimentally confirmed that this IL has higher CO2 solubility than trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, which is the previous best IL for CO2 absorption. The method developed in this study could be transferable to gas-absorbing liquids in general, such as deep eutectic solvents (hydrogen-bonded mixed organic solvents in a broad sense), which also have numerous practical applications.

Chemical solvent scrubbing is now considered the most mature carbon capture, utilisation and storage technology. Yet, its integration with fossil fuel power plants is forecasted to reduce the net efficiency of the entire process by at least 7% points, resulting in the avoided CO2 cost of 35\u201375 \u20ac/tCO2. Carbonate looping has been demonstrated to be an emerging technology for decarbonisation of the power sector with lower efficiency (>5% points) and economic penalties (10\u201330 \u20ac/tCO2). The key challenge that may influence the viability of carbonate looping is the decay in the sorbent CO2 uptake. Such a deterioration in sorbent performance is usually accounted for in the techno-economic assessments via semi-empirical correlations. Yet, such correlations include fitting parameters based on experimental data that is, in turn, associated with \u00b120% measurement error. This study employed a stochastic approach to quantify the impact of such uncertainty in the sorbent characteristics on the techno-economic performance of a 580 MWel coal-fired power plant with carbonate looping retrofit. The stochastic assessment showed that the most likely figures for the efficiency penalty would fall between 7.7% points and 8.7% points, with a median of 8.08% points. Such a figure was higher than the one determined using the deterministic approach (7.85% points). Moreover, the estimated CO2 avoided cost was between 29.74 \u20ac/tCO2 and 46.50 \u20ac/tCO2, with a median of 35.94 \u20ac/tCO2. Such a figure was higher than that obtained in the deterministic assessment (32.40 \u20ac/tCO2). It implied that the economic assessment using the deterministic approach could underestimate the costs associated with the carbonate looping retrofits. This study, therefore, revealed that the uncertainty in the sorbent characteristics would influence the techno-economic viability of the carbonate looping retrofits. \n\n", "date": "2022-06-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Thermodynamics (Chem.

However, even with advanced techniques such as mass spectrometry it is hard to detect the fluctuations in AA sequences and optical/geometrical isomers, and cannot provide wide access to ex-novo sequencing of low quantities of proteins. We are presenting a new and disruptive method based on FET sensors for AA/polypeptide detection. We show unique signals (fingerprints) of every single AA and polypeptide mutations by solving the site-binding model self-consistently with the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model. The surface potential (\u03a8o), 2nd gradient of the surface potential (\u03b4\u03a8o2/\u03b4pH2) and total surface capacitance (CT) are used as fingerprint signals to differentiate between the amino acids including the drain current variation as the signal transduction. These fingerprints are based on orthogonal properties of the AAs, which are the different proton affinities of each of the radicals, their dielectric constant and effective length, which is sensitive to the relative positions of the radicals to distinguish between isomers. We studied the generation of signals and proposed a novel noise-filtering technique based on the Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) and the significantly improved analytical model which is solved iteratively to reduce data loss. The minimum combined fingerprint resolution is 0.1 units of pH for the separation of singularities found in \u03b4\u03a8o2/\u03b4pH2, linked to the minimum capacitance of the AAs with a needed resolution of 0.01mF/m2 for surface densities of 1014cm-2, and which can be normalized to lower densities. The effect of noise (>SNR=10dB) and silanol sites can be negated by correlating the AAs signatures from \u03b4\u03a8o2/\u03b4pH2 and capacitance.

However, atomic smoothness of their basal planes and hence the ability to change the NPL thickness only in discrete steps prevent precise tuning of absorption and photoluminescence spectra unlike in the case of quantum dots. Preparation of alloyed NCs provides a potential solution to this problem, but it is complicated by the different reactivity of chalcogenide sources, which becomes even more restrictive in the case of NPLs, since they are more sensitive to alterations of reaction conditions.

Despite growing interest in the development of aqueous metal hydride catalysis, BDFE measurements of transition metal hydrides in water are rare. Herein, we report two nickel hydride complexes with one or two cationic ligands that enable the measurement of BDFE values in both aqueous and organic solvents using their reduction potential and pKa values.

The BDFE of the nickel hydride bond in 2-Ni(II)\u2013H was measured to be 53.8 kcal/mol in water, and between 50.9-56.2 kcal/mol in acetonitrile, consistent with prior work that indicates minimal solvent dependence for BDFEs of O-H and N-H bonds.  These results indicate transition metal hydride BDFEs do not change drastically in water and inform future studies on highly cationic transition metal hydride complexes.

Comprehensive understanding of the transport and fate of PFAS in the vadose-zone, a type of water-unsaturated porous media, is key to determination of the risks of the PFAS contamination in the subsurface and to the development of the effective remediation strategies. Accurate modeling of the PFAS transport in the unsaturated porous media is still a challenge due to the variable surface tension induced by the adsorption of PFAS to the air-water interfaces. In an effort to address this challenge, we propose a multidimensional modeling framework for the transient PFAS transport in the unsaturated porous media based on the second order accuracy finite volume method. In the modeling, the adsorption of PFAS to the solid surfaces and to the air-water interfaces is described by the two-domain sorption kinetics model, i.e., both the instantaneous and the rate limited PFAS adsorptions are taken into account. The diffusive and convective terms in the governing equations for the PFAS transport and the water flow are discretized by the central difference and the quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinetics schemes, respectively. Both of these two schemes have the second order accuracy. We investigate the effects of the convergent criteria, coupling method, and variation of the surface tension on the average and the local PFAS concentration and water content in the computational domain. We find that the convergent criteria should be chosen carefully so as to get the accurate results. The differences between the different coupling methods are affected by the boundary conditions. The variation in the surface tension due to the variation of the PFAS concentration cannot be neglected. These studies not only guide the numerical schemes used in the modeling but also provide the insights into the transport of PFAS in unsaturated porous media. The multidimensional modeling framework presented in this work can be further extended to explore in detail the transport of PFAS in the vadose-zone.", "date": "2023-07-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Hydrology and Water Chemistry; Soil Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The applicability of an alloy as a hydrogen storage media is governed by its thermodynamic properties, which can be represented by pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) diagrams. Therefore, the prediction of PCT diagrams for multicomponent alloys is fundamental to design alloys with optimized properties for hydrogen storage applications. In this work, a strategy to design C14-type Laves phase multicomponent alloys for hydrogen storage assisted by computational thermodynamic is presented. Since electronic and geometrical factors play an important role in the formation and stability of multicomponent Laves phase, valence electron concentration (VEC), atomic radius ratio (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34/\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35), and atomic size mismatch (\u03b4) are initially considered to screen a high number of compositions and find alloy systems prone to form Laves phase structure. Then, CALPHAD method was employed to investigate the phase stability of alloys of the (Ti, Zr or Nb)(V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, or Zn)2 system, resulting in 440 alloys prone to solidify as C14 Laves phase structure. In addition, we present a thermodynamic model, which allowed calculating the PCT diagrams of the suggested C14 Laves phase alloys based solely on the alloy\u2019s composition. For these calculations, the entropy and enthalpy of hydrogen solution in the C14 Laves phase were modelled considering that hydrogen solid solution occurs only at the A2B2-type interstitial sites of the C14 Laves phase structure. Therefore, the room temperature PCI diagrams of 440 C14 Laves phase multicomponent alloys were calculated. Experimental pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) diagrams of six C14 Laves phase alloys were compared against the calculated ones. Although the PCI curve shapes were not perfectly predicted for some alloys, the order of magnitude of the equilibrium pressure for all the tested alloys were well predicted. The results show that C14 Laves phase multicomponent alloys within a wide range of equilibrium pressure at room temperature can be obtained, being promising candidates for different hydrogen storage applications, such as room temperature tanks, hybrid tanks and Ni-metal hydrides batteries.", "date": "2022-06-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Hydrogen Storage Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For instance, photolability of the catalyst as well as insufficient light penetration into the reaction vessel may be further exacerbated by a heterogeneously dispersed substrate. Light penetration may be addressed by performing the reaction in continuous flow, which allows two modes of applying the catalyst: (i) heterogenously, immobilized on a carrier, which requires light-permeable supports, or (ii) homogenously, dissolved in the reaction mixture. Taking the light-dependent photodecarboxylation of palmitic acid catalyzed by the fatty-acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) as a showcase, strategies for the transfer of a photoenzyme-catalyzed reaction into continuous flow were identified. A range of different supports was evaluated for the immobilization of CvFAP, whereby Eupergit C250 L was the carrier of choice. As the photostability of the catalyst was a limiting factor, a homogeneous system was preferred instead of employing the heterogenized enzyme. This implied that photolabile enzymes may preferably be applied in solution if repair mechanisms cannot be provided. Furthermore, when comparing different wavelengths and light intensities, extinction coefficients may be considered to ensure comparable absorption at each wavelength. Employing homogenous conditions in the CvFAP-catalyzed photodecarboxylation of palmitic acid afforded a space-time yield unsurpassed by any reported batch process (5.7 g/L\u00b7h, 26.9 mmol/L\u00b7h) for this reaction, demonstrating the advantage of continuous flow in attaining higher productivity of photobiocatalytic processes.

We report results and inferences derived from a Random \nforest classifier with an average accuracy of 93%, and an F1 score of 0.96 for the 'Pass' class. 'Pass' refers \nto one of the two classes (Pass/ Fail) of all clinical trials and the model performed well in predicting the \n'Pass' category. An analysis of the features demonstrates that bioactivity plays an important role in \npredicting the outcome of a clinical trial. A significant effort has gone into the production of the dataset \nthat, for the first time, integrates clinical trial information with protein targets. All code to map these entities \nis available through this study, and all data are from publicly available sources.

Like phthalates, these OPFRs are used as additives in many materials without being chemically bound and can therefore easily be released into the environment by abrasion and/or volatilization. Exposure to these substances can be assessed indirectly via their measurement in different environmental matrices or directly via the measurement of the population impregnation.\nIn this context, a method for the determination of selected OPFRs but also PBDEs and PCBs in human hair samples was developed. The protocol includes a pulverization step of the hair sample followed by an automated pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) step, and finally by a targeted quantitative analysis by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS). The proposed analytical method allows the determination of 37 substances among which 8 PBDEs, 11 PCBs and 15 OPFRs including tributyl phosphate (TBP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP), with limits of quantification, for a 25-mg hair sample, ranging from 2 ng/g for triisopropyl phosphate (TiPP) to 400 ng/g for TCPP.\nThe performance of the method was then assessed (several operators and days of analysis) on an inert material (Celite\u00ae 545) unspiked and spiked at the LOQ level and at a level 10 times higher than the LOQ, on a non-contaminated real human hair sample unspiked and spiked at a level 10 times higher than the LOQ, and via replicate analysis of the standard reference material SRM 2585 (Organic Contaminants in House Dust), for which indicative, reference or certified concentrations are available for some PBDEs, PCBs and OPFRs.

Glover", "abstract": "A hybrid QM/MM study with the integral-exact direct reaction field (IEDRF) polarizable embedding scheme developed in the companion paper is performed on the purple bacteria reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides in order to investigate how polarization induced in the protein matrix helps to stabilize the primary charge-transfer state relative to the exciton states of the special pair. The protein environment is represented by point charges and induced dipoles that are coupled to the QM region via the integral-exact direct reaction field Hamiltonian, which can simultaneously describe differential solvation of multiple electronic states of different polarities.\nTreating the special pair, $P=P_L P_M$, and one of the bacteriopheophytins ($H_L$ or $H_M$) quantum-mechanically, we compare excitation energies computed at the $\\omega$PBEh time-dependent density functional theory level for charge-transfer states along the active and inactive branches. Thermal fluctuations on the electronic-state energies are included by extracting snapshots from a molecular dynamics trajectory. With IEDRF embedding, the reaction field induced in the protein matrix stabilizes long-range charge-transfer (CT) states by over 1.0 eV, shifting them below the exciton states. The protein environment favors charge separation along the active $L$ branch. With only electrostatic embedding, the CT states are found $>$0.5 eV above the exciton states, and asymmetry between the branches is diminished. The polarization in the protein is largely dictated by the secondary structure, with induced dipoles pointing along the axes of $\\alpha$-helices. The relaxation of dipoles on the excited state provides similar stabilization of both branches, however the ground state polarization, captured by IEDRF, screens $P^+ H_L^-$ more than $P^+ H_M^-$ and is thus key to directing the CT towards the active branch. The different ground-state dielectric environment of the two branches is confirmed by computing relative local fields at key carbonyl probes. With IEDRF embedding, we find the local fields to be in near quantitative agreement with the interpretations of recent vibrational Stark-effect experiments, while the agreement is diminished for electrostatically embedded QM/MM calculations. These results caution against QM/MM calculations with electrostatic embedding alone, because CT states in a rigid, dense protein matrix are mostly stabilized by the fast electronic polarization of the surrounding medium.", "date": "2022-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Consequently, the redox chemistry of atmospheric mercury strongly influences its fate and its global biogeochemical cycling. Here we report on the oxidation and reduction of Hg(I) (BrHg and HOHg radicals) in reactions with ozone, and how the electronic structure of these Hg(I) species affects the kinetics of these reactions. The oxidation reactions lead to XHgO\u2022 + O2 (X=Br and OH), while the reduction reaction produces Hg(0), HOX, and O2. According to our calculations with CCSD(T), NEVPT2, and CAM-B3LYP-D3BJ, the kinetics of both oxidation reactions are very similar. These two oxidation reactions are much faster than their reduction counterparts, and this effect is remarkably stronger for the oxidation of HOHg(I) by ozone. Modeling of field data supports the idea that OH and/or O3 (rather than Br) dominates Hg(II) production in the continental boundary layer. Almost all models invoking OH- and ozone-initiated oxidation of Hg(0) assume that these reactions directly produces Hg(II), despite the lack of plausible mechanism for these oxidation reactions.

Calculated average electron energies are close to experimental ionization potentials in one-electron systems, demonstrating a surprisingly small effect of self-interaction and other exchange-correlation errors in established DFT methods. Remarkable agreement with ab initio quantum mechanical calculations of multi-electron systems is demonstrated using several flavors of DFT, and we argue for the use of the average electron energy as a design criterion for density functional approximations.

These designed solvents such as ionic liquids are often highly charged species, which pose a problem for molecular modelling with classical fixed-charge force fields. Simulation outcomes with atomic charges derived from ab initio calculations often show significant deviations from the experimental reference, and charge scaling is widely applied as a simple yet efficient solution to achieve satisfactory experiment-simulation accordance. Although the massive emphasis on the reproduction of bulk properties such as density of the liquids as charge scaling criteria, a more crucial thermodynamic observable is the solvation behavior of external agents in these green solvents. Astonishingly, our recent large-scale benchmark calculation on solvation thermodynamics suggests that the solvation-free-energy-derived scaling factor is generally slightly larger (~0.1) than the bulk-property-derived estimate. This phenomenon is rather not unexpected, as the density-matching estimate only considers the solvent-solvent interaction (overfitting), while accurate calculations of solvation free energies require balanced descriptions of solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. A more interesting observation is that different solute-solvent pairs exhibit different responses to the variation of the scaling parameter, which arises from the competing electrostatic and vdW contributions. Another perspective provided in our previous extensive benchmark is about the suitability of general-purpose force fields for bonded and vdW interactions in the modelling of ionic liquids. The bond stretching and angle bending terms in pre-fitted GAFF derivatives are often problematic, while the torsional potential shows satisfactory reproduction of ab initio results. In the current work, we expect to accumulate more experiences from large-scale fast-growth solvation free energy simulations in ionic liquids with compositions different from our previous benchmark. The obtained new results are combined with our previous dataset to form a large solvation set (and also partition or water-ionic-liquids transfer set), from which a universally applicable charge scaling factor with at least half-optimal performance is derived. Aside from the force-field issue, another extremely important modelling detail considered in the current work is the finite-size effect. It is observed that the finite-size artifacts in solvation thermodynamics are much more severe than mass density, which emphasizes the use of a sufficiently large ionic solvent box in molecular simulations of ionic liquids derivatives. Finally, combining the extensive computational perspectives accumulated in our series works, general guidelines for molecular modelling of ionic liquids with fixed-charge force fields are summarized.

Conversely, non-directed methods typically suffer from regioselectivity issues, especially for unbiased substrates. Herein, we report a unique approach to address these challenges in palladium catalysis that employs weak charge-charge and charge-dipole interactions to enable the meta-selective activation/olefination of arenes.

Hence, it is crucial to understand and reenact some of these functions in wholly synthetic cell-like entities (protocells) to envision designing soft-materials with life-like traits. Herein, we report on a programmable all-DNA protocell (PC) composed of a liquid DNA interior and a hydrogel-like shell, harboring DNAzyme active sites in the interior whose catalytic bond-cleaving activity leads to a downstream phenotype change in the protocells, as well as triggers prototissue formation. In this regard, we coupled several tools of DNA nanoscience, such as RNA cleavage, dynamic strand displacement reactions, and multivalent palindromic interactions, in a synchronize pathway so that the input signal can be processed inside the protocells and generate downstream cues giving rise to metabolic adaptive behavior. For example, the compartmentalized DNAzyme catalyzes the bond-cleavage of a substrate that releases a DNA strand in situ to trigger a strand displacement reaction at the shell of the protocells leading to a change in color resembling a \u201cphenotype-like\u201d change in cells, and finally to establish communication with other protocells via multivalent interactions.", "date": "2022-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Biopolymers; Hydrogels; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this context, the identification of new classes of reactive groups are particularly important as these can expose novel reactivity modes and, consequently, expand the ligandable proteome. Here, we investigated the electrophilic reactivity of the 3-acyl-5-hydroxy-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrole-2-one (AHPO) scaffold, a heterocyclic motif that is e.g. present in various bioactive natural products. Our investigations were focused on the compound MT-21 - a simplified structural analogue of the natural product epolactaene - which is known to have both neurotrophic activity and ability to trigger apoptotic cell death. We found that the central N-acyl hemiaminal group of MT-21 can function as an electrophilic centre enabling divergent reactivity with both amine- and thiol-based nucleophiles, which furthermore translated to reactivity with proteins in both cell lysates and live cells. We found that in live cells MT-21 strongly engaged the lipid transport protein fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) by direct binding to a cysteine residue in the bottom of the ligand binding pocket. Through preparation of a series of MT-21 derivatives, we probed the specificity of this interaction which was found to be strongly dependent on subtle structural changes. Our study suggests that MT-21 may be employed as a tool compound in future studies of the biology of FABP5, which remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, our study has also made clear that other natural products containing the AHPO-motif may likewise possess covalent reactivity and that this property may underlie their biological activity.

Energy decomposition and various real-space function analyses of host-guest interaction revealed the characteristic and nature of the non-covalent interaction in this supramolecule. The scanning results of the potential energy surface (PES) showed that the rotational barrier of C18 in OPP is extremely small, implying the possibility of the supramolecular complex as an ultrafast molecular rotator. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed that C18 and OPP can spontaneously assemble into up to 1:2 ring-in-ring host-guest complexes, and C18 can rotate at an ultrahigh speed in OPP at ambient temperature. The thermodynamic parameters of the nanorotator at different temperatures were also investigated to determine the thermal stability of 2C18@OPP.

Much of the existing work investigating the effect of flow has been phenomenological, lacking a direct and quantitative connection between the flow gradients and measurable quantities of the conformation or alignment of the conjugated polymers in solution. Furthermore, while aggregation of conjugated polymers in solution has been demonstrated to result in highly aligned thin-films, there are few studies that probe the interplay between the structures that form during aggregation and flow-induced alignment during processing. Here, we explore in detail the influence of flow type, solution aggregation, and concentration on the flow-induced alignment of conjugated polymers. We apply a microfluidic platform to systematically subject the conjugated polymer solution to large and controllable shear and extensional strain rates and use flow-induced retardance (birefringence) measurements to characterize the degree of alignment. By using flow-induced retardance in combination with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy of freeze-dried solutions we are able to determine the solution state structure and clearly demonstrate the interplay between solution aggregation and fluid flow. We determine the overall relaxation time of the material and the strengths of shear and extensional flows required to align conjugated polymer aggregates. Furthermore, we find that although enhanced aggregation can facilitate flow-induced alignment, the type of aggregation and the presence of interparticle interactions at higher concentrations can diminish the effectiveness of flow. The results here demonstrate that there is a complex interplay between the conjugated polymer solution state and fluid flow and that simply increasing the conjugated polymer\u2019s aggregation, concentration, or the strength of flow does not necessarily lead to better or more effective alignment in solution. A careful understanding of the synergy between these two aspects can help to establish design rules in solution processing for improving conjugated polymer film morphology.", "date": "2022-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Aggregates and Assemblies; Materials Processing; Conducting polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of the relationship between their diverse structures and biological functions. While HS syntheses have advanced significantly in recent years, preparation of HS libraries remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulties in achieving high yields in glycosylation and sulfation reactions especially with longer glycans and the need to prepare multiple compounds. A new strategy to synthesize a library of HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharides has been developed to expedite library preparation.  HS disaccharides were linked in a \u201chead-to-tail\u201d fashion from the reducing end of a module to the non-reducing end of a neighboring module to mimic native HS. Three differentially sulfated HS disaccharides were designed and prepared from a common intermediate. Conjugation of these modules using amide chemistry bypassed the need for challenging glycosylation reactions to extend the HS backbone. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharides were achieved using these three HS modules. This new class of compounds mimicked well the native HS with their binding to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) exhibiting similar structure-activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mimic natural HS suggest the new head-to-tail linked pseudo-hexasaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

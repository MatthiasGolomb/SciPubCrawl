Beyond all doubt, the most striking therapeutic target for antibody development is the spike (S) protein on the surface of virus. In contrast with an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, little is known about neutralizing antibodies binding mechanisms of N-terminal domain (NTD), let alone the effect of NTD mutation on antibody binding and risk of immune evasion. Employing various computational approaches in this study, we investigated critical residues for NTD-antibody bindings and their detailed mechanism. The results showed that some residues on NTD including Y144, K147, R246 and Y248 are critically involved in the direct interaction of NTD with many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), indicating that the viruses harboring these residue mutations may have high risk of immune evasion. Binding free energy calculations and the interaction mechanism study revealed that R246I, which is present in Beta (B.1.351) variant, may decrease or even abrogate the efficacies of many antibodies. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the mutations of the 4 residues for future antibody design and development.

Here, we describe a new pathway for SQ degradation that involves oxidative desulfurization to release sulfite and enable utilization of the entire carbon skeleton of the sugar to support the growth of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. SQ or its glycoside sulfoquinovosyl glycerol (SQGro) are imported into the cell by an ABC transporter system with an associated SQ binding protein. A sulfoquinovosidase hydrolyses the SQ glycoside and the liberated SQ is acted on by a flavin mononucleotide-dependent sulfoquinovose monooxygenase, in concert with an NADH-dependent flavin reductase, to release sulfite and 6-oxo-glucose. An NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase reduces the 6-oxo-glucose to glucose, enabling entry into primary metabolic pathways. Structural and biochemical studies provide detailed insights into the recognition of key metabolites by proteins in this pathway. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that the sulfoquinovose monooxygenase (smo) pathway is distributed across Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria and is especially prevalent within the Rhizobiales order. This strategy for SQ catabolism is distinct from previously described pathways as it enables the complete utilization of all carbons within SQ by a single organism with concomitant production of inorganic sulfite.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Biology; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, there is a paucity of automated formula assignment algorithm applicable to halogenated disinfection byproducts (Xn-DBPs), particurally for iodinated organic compounds, and deuterated DOM . Herein, for the first time, we have developed a novel formula assignment algorithm based on deuterium-labeled UHR-MS, namely FTMSDeu, and the algorithm was applied to determine precursor molecules of Xn-DBPs and evaluate the relative contribution of electrophilic addition and electrophilic substitution reactions in Xn-DBPs formation according to the hydrogen/deuterium exchange of DOM molecules. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry with homologous-based network analysis was employed to validate the formula assignment accuracy (41%) of FTMSDeu for iodinated disinfection byproducts (In-DBPs). And the remaining In-DBPs compounds were assigned with the empirical rule of minimum number of non-oxygen heteratoms. The electrophilic substitution accounted for 82%-98%, 71%-89%, and 43%-45% of Xn-DBPs formation for Xn-DBPs containing chlorine, bromine, and iodine, respectively, manifesting the dominant role of electrophilic substitution in chlorine disinfection under conditions of low bromine and iodine concentrations. The absence of presumed Xn-DBPs precursors in some treatments in this study also suggests that Xn-DBPs formation include secondary reactions (e.g., oxidation, hydrolysis) in addition to electrophilic addition and/or substitution of halogens.

The results show that the trend in the near-surface vacancy formation energies for comparable vacancy spacings, i.e. (110) < (100) < (111), does not follow that in the surface stability of the facets, i.e. (111) < (110) < (100). The results also revealed that the preference of vacancies for surface or subsurface sites, as well as the preferred location of the associated Ce3+ polarons, are facet and concentration-dependent. At the higher vacancy concentration, the VA is more stable than the VB at the (110) facet whereas, at the (111), it is the other way around, and at the (100) facet, both the VA and the VB have similar stability. The stability of the VA vacancies, compared to that of the VB, is accentuated as the concentration decreases. Nearest neighbor polarons to the vacant sites are only observed for the less densely packed (110) and (100) facets.

In this paper, a new homogeneous model system that constructs carbon chains from CO is reported. The system exploits the cooperative effect of a transition metal complex and main group reductant. An entire reaction sequence from C1 to C2 to C3 to C4 has been synthetically verified. The scope of reactivity is broad and includes a variety of transition metals (M = Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Co), including those found in industrial heterogeneous F-T catalysts. Variation of the transition metal fragment impacts the relative rate of the steps of chain growth, allowing isolation and structural characterisation of a rare C2 intermediate. The selectivity of carbon chain growth is also impacted by this variable; two distinct isomers of the C3 carbon chain were observed to form in different ratios with different transition metal reagents.

PAH molecules reach a strong affinity with phosphorene by forming well-ordered domains, whose interaction strength decreases 13-21% compared to the interaction onto carbonaceous surfaces, e.g., graphene. The adsorption energies are in linear relation with the NH:NC ratio of PAHs, where NH and NC are the numbers of H and C atoms; consequently, the cohesive energy of phosphorene-graphene heterostructures is estimated in 44 meV/atom. Energy decomposition (ALMO-EDA) and electron-density-based analyses support the major role of electrostatics driving forces in the interaction mechanism, which is balanced with dispersion effects for larger PAHs. In addition, phosphorene-PAH complexes display outstanding stability in solution under polar/non-polar solvents, which is due to the high polarity of the complexes and strong overcompensation of destabilizing solvation energies with stabilizing electrostatic effects. Moreover, PAHs behave as n-dopants for phosphorene, inducing small bandgap opening and weak effects on the photophysical fingerprint of phosphorene. Nevertheless, strong electron acceptor/donor and larger PAHs (NH:NC<0.5) lead to major effects on the bandgap control, acting as active sites for orbital-controlled interactions. These findings serve as a framework for further investigation of phosphorene-based materials for remediation of PAH pollutants in water treatment technologies and uses of PAHs for phosphorene surface passivation or bandgap engineering for sensing.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Nanoscience; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study, we systematically explore the influence of incorporating graphite powder (GP) into a polymer-encapsulated CoPc on the system\u2019s activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.  We report a protocol for incorporating GP into CoPc/polymer/GP catalyst films that facilitates physisorption of CoPc to GP, leading to increased activity for CO2 reduction.  We show that the activity for CO2 reduction increases with GP loading at low GP loadings, but at sufficiently high GP loadings the activity plateaus as charge transfer is sufficiently fast to no longer be rate limiting.  We also demonstrate that axial coordination is still important even in the presence of GP, suggesting that CoPc does not fully coordinate to heteroatoms on the GP surface.  We develop a set of optimized conditions under which the CoPc/polymer/GP catalyst systems reduce CO2 with higher activity and similar selectivity to previously reported CoPc/polymer films on edge-plane graphite electrodes.

However, all catalysts presented a ~50% decrease in surface area due to partial mesopore blocking reflected by a ~30% increase in the average pore diameter. On the other hand, NaVO3 microcrystals and particles constituted \uf061-NaVO3 and \uf062-NaVO3 were formed at acidic pH, whereas Na metavanadate nanoparticles were formed at pH=9.0. These nanoparticles transformed into an \uf061-NaVO3 type phase upon dehydration. The reducibility of the catalysts was a function of the impregnation pH, where the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8 and 9.0 displayed similar reduction patterns but lower reducibility than those synthesized at pH=1.5. The produced patterns were correlated to the existence of a mixture of V5+ and V4+ species among which V4+ was prevalent for the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8 and 9.0. Consequently, the basicity of the catalysts decreased with the increase in pH. The surface concentration of vanadium increased with the increase in the concentration of vanadium in solution, while the pH had a weak negative effect over the former. On the other hand, it was established that chemical surface state of oxygen in the synthesized catalysts was influenced weakly by the synthesis pH and, more importantly, by non-additive effects between the pH and the concentration of vanadium in solution. The latter was coherent with the detection of surface oxygen species related to the partial dissolution of the Na-SiO2 support; a phenomenon that seemed to be favored at acidic pH. The latter properties were correlated to changes in basicity. Concerning the catalytic performance, the catalysts synthesized at pH=9.0 displayed the best steady state performance in terms of the selectivity to propene and oxygen consumption. The collected evidence allowed corroborating that both the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and its combustion to CO and CO2 are kinetically controlled by the initial activation of one of the C-H bonds of propane. But, the production of CO2 depended on the level of consumption of O2; where, a surplus of the latter compared to the conversion of propane combusted the hydrocarbon into CO2. Such a finding agreed with what has already been established for supported vanadium oxides for hydrocarbon oxidation. An analysis of the Raman spectra of the spent catalysts suggested that under the applied reaction conditions, all catalysts were provided of an active phase mostly constituted by \uf061-NaVO3 type structures. Therefore, the observed differences in catalytic behavior were rather associated to changes in particle size, reducibility, and acidity.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Petrochemicals; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 5895-5898). To uncover the mechanism of the reaction and the origins of the high enantioselectivity, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B97D3 / 6-311+G(2d,2p) / SMD(toluene) // B97D3 / 6-31G(d,p) / CPCM(toluene) level of theory. Comparison of four possible activation modes confirms that this reaction proceeds through the bifunctional activation of the azetidine nitrogen and the thione tautomer of the 2-mercaptobenzothiazole nucleophile. Upon thorough conformational sampling of the enantiodetermining transition structures (TSs), a free energy difference of 2.0 kcal mol-1 is obtained, accurately reproducing the experimentally measured 88% e.e. at 80 \u00b0C. This energy difference is due to both decreased distortion and increased non-covalent interactions in the pro-(S) TS. To uncover the true origins of selectivity, the TSs optimized with the full catalyst were compared to those optimized with a model catalyst through steric maps. It is found that the arrangements displayed by the substrates are controlled by strict primary orbital interaction requirements at the transition complex, and their ability to fit into the catalyst pocket drives the selectivity. A general model of selectivity for phosphoric acid-catalyzed azetidine desymmetrizations is proposed, which is based on the preference of the nucleophile and benzoyl group to occupy empty quadrants of the chiral catalyst pocket.", "date": "2021-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Stereochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although C2+ products higher economic value, only the formation of C1 products was investigated thoroughly. For the electrochemical reduction of CO2, a supporting material is needed for small copper clusters. Graphene is a promising candidate, as is exhibits good mechanical and electrical properties however, the weak interaction of copper and graphene needs to be addressed.

We explored thermal properties (degradation, melting and crystallisation temperatures) of these novel SAILs and their electrochemical properties (ionic conductivity and electrochemical potential window, ECW). These SAILs were tested as electrolytes in a multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-based supercapacitor at various temperatures from 253 to 373 K and their electrochemical performance as a function of temperature was compared. We found that the supercapacitor cell with [C6C1Im][EHS] as an electrolyte has shown a higher specific capacitance (Celec in F g-1), a higher energy density (E in W h kg-1), and a higher power density (P in kW kg-1) as compared to the other studied SAILs, [P4,4,4,4][EHS], [P6,6,6,14][EHS] and [N8,8,8,8][EHS] (from previous our study) at a temperature range from 253 to 373 K.

Samet Varol; Stefan  Seeger", "abstract": "Performance of engineered surfaces can be enhanced by making them hydrophobic or superhydrophobic via coating them with low-surface-energy micro-and nano-patterns. However, the wetting phenomena of particularly irregular shape and spacing (super)hydrophobic patterns such as polysiloxane coatings are not yet fully understood from a microscopic perspective. Here, we show a new method to collect 3D confocal images from irregular polysiloxane micro-and nanorods from a single rod resolution to discuss their wetting response over long liquid/solid interaction times and quantify the length and diameter of these rods. To collect such 3D confocal images, fluorescent dye containing water droplets were left on our superhydrophobic and hydrophobic polysiloxane coated surfaces. Then their liquid/solid interfaces were imaged at different staining scenarios: (i) using different fluorescent dyes, (ii) when the droplets were in contact with surfaces, or (iii) after the droplets were taken away from the surface at the end of staining. Using such staining strategies, we could resolve the micro-and nanorods from root to top and determine their length and diameter, which were then found to be in good agreement with those obtained from their electron microscopy images. 3D confocal images in this paper, for the first time, present the long-time existence of more than one wetting state under the same droplet in contact with surfaces, as well as external and internal three-phase contact lines shifting and pinning.

The Membrane attack complex component of the S protein formed fusion pores on the red blood cell membrane. Then it injected viral genetic material into the mature red blood cell. ORF3a used a thiol-activated cytolysin domain to create hemolytic pores in the red blood cell membrane. The coagulation factor calcium ions were involved in the red blood cell invasion process.

Many synthetic catalysts have been inspired by these enzymes and are similarly proposed to use transition metal-oxo intermediates. However, most examples of well-characterized transition metal-oxo species are not capable of reacting with strong, aliphatic C\u2013H bonds, resulting in a lack of understanding of what factors facilitate this reactivity. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new terminal CoIII-oxo complex, PhB(AdIm)3CoIIIO. Upon oxidation a transient CoIV-oxo intermediate is generated that is capable of hydroxylating aliphatic C\u2013H bonds with an extrapolated k1 for C\u2013H activation >130 s\u20131 at 4 \u00b0C, comparable to values observed in cytochrome P450 enzymes.

In this study, we present a unique tri-layered, partially-degradable hydrogel scaffold that mimics the multi-layered structure of the VF lamina propria.

Here, we adopted a repositioning approach using in silico molecular modeling to screen FDA-approved drugs with established safety profiles for potential inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2. We used structure-based drug design to screen more than 2000 FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme (Mpro) substrate-binding pocket. We additionally screened the top hits from both sites for potential covalent binding via nucleophilic thiol attack of Cys 145. High-scoring candidates were then screened for antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-based viral replication assay, and counter screened for toxicity. Promising candidates included atovaquone, mebendazole, ouabain, dronedarone, and entacapone, although atovaquone and mebendazole were the only two candidates with IC50s that fall within their therapeutic plasma concentration. In addition, we performed Mpro assays on the top hits, which demonstrated inhibition of Mpro by dronedarone (IC50 18 \uf06dM), mebendazole (IC50 19 \uf06dM) and entacapone (IC50 9 \uf06dM). Atovaquone showed only modest Mpro inhibition, and thus we explored other potential antiviral mechanisms. Although atovaquone is a known DHODH inhibitor, we did not observe inhibition of DHODH by atovaquone at concentrations relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 IC50. Interestingly, metabolomic profiling of atovaquone treated cells demonstrated marked dysregulation of metabolites in the purine metabolism pathway. In summary, a number of our top hits from the in-silico screen demonstrated Mpro inhibitory activity associated with antiviral effects. Atovaquone and mebendazole are the most promising candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 from our screen, however atovaquone did not significantly inhibit Mpro at therapeutically meaningful concentrations but may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication by targeting host purine metabolism.", "date": "2021-09-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

By introducing the chlorine functionalities in the acridinium precursor, positions complementary to those previously accessed by electrophilic aromatic substitution of the final dyes can be accesed. The chlorination is selective, giving only one regioisomer for both mono- and dichlorination products. For the monochlorinated acridinium compound a highly selective ring-closing reaction was discovered to generate only a single regioisomer of the cationic [4]helicene product. This discovery aspired further investigations into the mechanism of [4]helicene formation and to the first isolation of the previously proposed intermediate of the two-step SNAr reaction, key to all aza-bridged triangulenium and helicenium systems. A late stage functionalization of DAOTA+ with NCS gave rise to a different dichlorinated compound (2).

The dynamics after the 2\u03c0\u03c0* \u2190 S0 excitation are instead nonadiabatic, and the n\u03c0* state plays a major role in the relaxation process. The simulations suggest a mainly active role of the proton in the isomerization, rather than a passive migration assisted by the vibrations of the benzoquinoline backbone.", "date": "2021-09-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Carbamoyl phosphate (CP) is the first high-energy building block that intervenes in the in vivo synthesis of the uracil ring of UMP. Thus, the likelihood of its occurrence in prebiotic conditions is investigated herein. The evolution of carbamoyl phosphate in water and in ammonia aqueous solutions without enzymes was characterised using ATR-IR, 31P and 13C spectroscopies. Carbamoyl phosphate initially appears stable in water at ambient conditions before transforming to cyanate and carbamate/hydrogenocarbonate species within a matter of hours. Cyanate, less labile than CP, remains a potential carbamoylating agent. In the presence of ammonia, CP decomposition occurs more rapidly and generates urea. We conclude that CP is not a likely prebiotic reagent by itself. Alternatively, cyanate and urea may be more promising substitutes for CP, because they are both \u201cenergy-rich\u201d (high free enthalpy molecules in aqueous solutions) and kinetically inert regarding hydrolysis.

Proline is mainly incorporated from the extracellular medium by amino acid transport systems. Different proline analogues proved to interact with the proline permease TcAAAP069 and inhibit the proline uptake by T. cruzi.\nMethods: Decyl- (1), oleyl- (2) and farnesyl- (3) substituted proline analogues were evaluated on six T. cruzi DTUs. Cell death type was determined by flow cytometry, and the effect on the parasite metabolism was analysed by directed NMR exometabolomics.

Compound 3 at high concentration (116 \u00b5M) induced necrosis. The removal of the triazole from 1 proved to be important for the activity. Compounds 1 and 2 induced deep changes in the exometabolome, diminishing the amounts of succinate, lactate, acetate, and ethanol excreted.

The biosynthetic pathway engineered in E. coli produced citramalic acid intermediate with a high yield (91% of theoretical maximum) from glucose by overexpressing citramalate synthase, removing downstream degradation enzyme 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, and optimizing the fermentation medium. Thermal heterogeneous catalysis converted the citramalate intermediate to methacrylic acid (MAA) via decarboxylation and dehydration.

Here, we characterise the structure of burnettiene A as a polyene-decalin polyketide. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of A. burnettii identified a putative biosynthetic gene cluster for burnettiene A (bue), consisting of eight genes and sharing similarity to the fusarielin gene cluster. Introduction of the reassembled bue gene cluster into Aspergillus nidulans for heterologous expression resulted in the production of burnettiene A under native promoters. Omission of bueE encoding a cytochrome P450 led to the production of preburnettiene A, confirming that BueE is responsible for catalysing the regiospecific multi-oxidation of terminal methyl groups to carboxylic acids. Similarly, bueF was shown to encode an ester-forming methyltransferase, with its omission resulting in the production of the tricarboxylic acid, preburnettiene B. Introduction of an additional copy of the transcription factor bueR under the regulation of the gpdA promoter significantly improved the heterologous production of the burnettienes. Burnettiene A displayed strong in vitro cytotoxicity against mouse myeloma NS-1 cells (MIC 0.8 \u00b5g/mL).

This work employs a chelating strategy to form stable coordination on the PNC surface. Through screening a series of heterocyclic aromatic carboxylates, we found the best ligand, picolinate (PIC), with exceptional passivation effect to the surface traps of CsPbBr3 PNCs in the strongly quantum confined regime, resulting in > 0.8 photoluminescence quantum yields. The exciton lifetime in the passivated PNC approaches the radiative decay limit in various solvents. From an NMR titration experiment, the binding affinity of PIC is estimated to be at least 15 to 30 folds stronger than the original ligand from synthesis. The NMR and FTIR spectroscopic data and first-principles calculations elucidate the bidentate nature of the PIC coordination at the surface Pb site and the coadsorption of the ammonium-PIC ion pair. In apolar solvents, such as cyclohexane, the binding of PIC is stoichiometric to the available surface sites, suggesting the structure as a potent candidate for anchoring functional molecular structures to the PNC surface. In polar solvents, the strong affinity of PIC on the PNC surface provides protection for carrying out the precipitation-redissolution purification procedure that removes synthetic residual from the as-synthetic PNC samples. By modifying the purification procedure, we also develop a cation exchange procedure to replace the original oleylammonium cation with desired structures that consist of an ammonium anchoring group. Our results provide a direction for constructing strong interactions to protect the vulnerable surface of PNCs and pave the road for developing surface engineering strategies to functionalize these nanoparticles.", "date": "2021-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The basis set quality is assessed using a test set of 70 molecules containing the lanthanides in their common oxidation states and f electron occupations. 5d orbital occupation turns out to be the determining factor for the basis set convergence of polarizabilities in lanthanide atoms and the molecular test set. Therefore, two series of property-optimized basis sets are defined. The augmented def2-SVPD, def2-TZVPPD, and def2-QZVPPD basis sets balance the accuracy of polarizabilities across lanthanide oxidation states. The relative errors in atomic and molecular polarizability calculations are \u22648% for augmented split-valence basis sets, \u22642.5% for augmented triple-zeta valence basis sets, and \u22641% for augmented quadruple-zeta valence basis sets.

Methylammonium-free perovskites thus represent a possible direction for more stable photo-absorbers that are also compatible with multijunction solar cells. However, most work on methylammonium-free perovskites involves cesium and formamidinium as the A-site cations, which are thermodynamically less stable than the methylammonium-based materials. In this work we systematically explore the crystallographic and optical properties of the compositional space of mixed cation and mixed halide lead perovskites, where formamidinium (FA+) is gradually replaced by cesium (Cs+), and iodide (I-) is substituted by bromide (Br-), i.e., CsyFA1\u2013yPb(BrxI1\u2013x)3. The crystal phases, which could be tuned by changing the tolerance factor for mixed perovskite alloys, are qualitatively determined and the composition\u2013structure relationship is established in the CsyFA1\u2013yPb(BrxI1\u2013x)3 compositional space. We find that higher tolerance factors lead to more cubic structures, whereas lower tolerance factors lead to more orthorhombic. We also find that while some correlation exists between tolerance factor and structure, tolerance factor does not provide a holistic understanding of whether a perovskite structure will fully form. Given the wide range of bandgaps produced by this compositional space, an empirical expression is devised to predict the optical bandgap of CsyFA1\u2013yPb(BrxI1\u2013x)3 perovskites \u2013 which changes as a function of composition \u2013, conducive to the design of absorbers with bandgaps tailor-made for specific tandem and single-junction applications. By screening 26 solar cells with different compositions, we find that Cs1/6FA5/6PbI3 delivers the highest efficiency and long-term stability among I-rich compositions. This work sheds light on the fundamental structure-property relationships in the CsyFA1\u2013yPb(BrxI1\u2013x)3 compositional space, providing vital insight to the design of durable perovskite materials.

Herein, we report the development and an in-depth evaluation of a tetrafluoroalkyl benziodoxole as a cysteine-selective chemoproteomic probe. We show that this probe features numerous key improvements compared to the traditionally used cysteine-reactive probes, including a superior target occupancy, faster labeling kinetics, and broader proteomic coverage thus enabling profiling of cysteines directly in live cells. Further, the fluorine \u2018signature\u2019 of probe 7 constitutes an additional advantage resulting in a more confident adduct-amino acid site assignment in mass spectrometry-based identification workflows. We demonstrate the utility of our new probe for proteome-wide target profiling by identifying the cellular targets of (-)-myrocin G, an antiproliferative fungal natural product with a to-date unknown mechanism of action. We show that this natural product and its simplified analog target the X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 5 (XRCC5), an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that primes DNA repair machinery for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) upon DNA double strand breaks, making them the first reported inhibitors of this biomedically highly important protein. We further demonstrate that myrocins disrupt the interaction of XRCC5 with DNA leading to sensitization of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide as well as UV-light induced DNA damage.

These studies reveal that Ru(DMBD)(CO)3 produces high-quality Ru films with excellent nucleation properties. This results in smooth, coalesced films even at low film thicknesses, all important traits for device applications. However, Ru deposition follows a kinetically limited decarbonylation reaction scheme, akin to typical CVD processes, with a strong dependence on both temperature and reaction timescale. The non-self-limiting nature of the kinetically driven mechanism presents both challenges for ALD implementation and opportunities for process tuning.

In this work, through first-principles calculation from geometric structures to electronic structures, we try to understand the basic physical and chemical properties and HER performance of nanoclusters composed of transition metals Co and Ni. We optimize the electronic structure and promote effective charge transfer by adjusting the size of nanoclusters and constructing core-shell alloying. First-principles studies reveal that the geometric size and electronic structures of Co-Ni nanoclusters can significantly affect the performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction. We found that Co@Ni12 (|\u0394GH*|=0.01eV) shows the best HER performance. The Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption of Co-Ni nanoclusters is positively related to the size of the clusters, and the \u0394GH* can be adjusted within a certain range by changing the electronic structures of the clusters.

A deep neural network was trained to predict the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps for a chemical library of NIR-II backbone structures. Hundreds of new NIR-II cores with low energy gap were discovered, and eight of them across different acceptor cores are found to have relatively rigid conjugated backbones.

Generally, it is assumed that these molecularly modified electrodes operate by the same redox mediation mechanisms observed for soluble molecules, in which electron transfer and substrate activation occur in separate elementary steps. Here, we uncover that, depending on the solvent, carbon-bound cobalt porphyrin can carry out electrolysis by the non-mediated mechanisms of metal surfaces in which electron transfer and substrate activation are concerted. We chemically modify glassy carbon electrodes with cobalt tetraphenylpor-phyrin units that are anchored by flexible aliphatic linkages to form CH-CoTPP. In acetonitrile, CH-CoTPP dis-plays a clear outer-sphere Co(II/I) process which catalyzes the H2 evolution reaction by a step-wise, redox-mediated reaction sequence. In contrast, clear surface redox waves are not observed for CH-CoTPP in aqueous media and H2 evolution proceeds via a non-mediated, concerted proton-electron transfer reaction sequence over a wide pH range. The data suggest that, in aqueous electrolyte, the CoTPP fragments reside inside the electro-chemical double layer and are electrostatically coupled to the surface. This coupling allows CH-CoTPP to carry out catalysis without being pinned to the redox potential of the molecular fragment. These studies highlight that the simple adsorption of molecules can lead to reaction mechanisms typically reserved for metal surfaces, ex-posing new principles for the design of molecularly-modified electrodes.", "date": "2021-09-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The accuracy of computed dipole moments depends strongly on the quality of the calculated electron density, and the breakdown of single-reference methods for strongly correlated systems can lead to poor predictions of the dipole moments in those cases. Here, we derive the analytical expression for obtaining the electric dipole moment by multiconfiguration pair density functional theory (MC-PDFT), and we assess the accuracy of MC-PDFT for predicting dipole moments at equilibrium and nonequilibrium geometries. We show that MC-PDFT dipole moment curves have reasonable behavior even for stretched geometries, and they significantly improve upon the CASSCF results by capturing more electron correlation. The analysis of a dataset consisting of 18 first-row transition metal diatomics and 6 main-group polyatomic molecules with multireference character suggests that MC-PDFT and its hybrid extension (HMC-PDFT) perform comparably to CASPT2 and MRCISD+Q methods and have a mean unsigned deviation of 0.2\u20130.3 D with respect to the best available dipole moment reference values. We explored the dependence of the predicted dipole moments upon the choice of the on-top density functional and active space, and we recommend the tPBE and hybrid tPBE0 on-top choices for the functionals combined with the moderate correlated participating orbital scheme for selecting the active space. With these choices, the mean unsigned deviations (in debyes) of the calculated equilibrium dipole moments from the best estimates are 0.77 for CASSCF, 0.29 for MC-PDFT, 0.24 for HMC-PDFT, 0.28 for CASPT2, and 0.25 for MRCISD+Q.

We introduce water-solubilizing groups linked to anthraquinone by C=C bonds via Heck cross-coupling reactions and convert C=C bonds to C\uf02dC bonds through hydrogenation. The anthraquinone and the ending groups are connected via branched or straight chains with either unsaturated or saturated bonds. We investigate the influence of water-solubilizing chains and ionic ending groups on redox potentials of molecules and identify three important trends.

This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6-6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub-lattice.\nThe tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.\nHere, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed via variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature.

The different experimental parameters that affect the performance of this reaction such as: temperature, contact time, initial dye concentration and mass of adsorbent were investigated. The point of zero charge pH (pHPZC) was determined for the two adsorbents. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were employed to provide a description of the equilibrium isotherms. Adsorption tests showed that the equilibrium time is a function of the initial concentration of dye. The adsorption kinetic study indicated that the equilibrium adsorption is established after 300 minutes for Mg-doped bismuth ferrite, while it is established after 180 minutes for Mg-doped bismuth ferrite-bentonite composite. Furthermore, this suggests that the adsorption of MO on both adsorbents can be perfectly described by pseudo-second order kinetics. The maximum adsorption capacity determined by the mathematical model of Langmuir is equal to 181.8 mg.g-1 for Mg-doped bismuth ferrite and to 188.7 mg.g-1 for its composite, at 298 K.

Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) suggested a reaction mechanism that involves trapping of the DCB radical anion by cyclohexene with HAT occurring as the final step via a cooperative HAT step. Kinetic modeling of the reaction, using rate constants derived from TAS, demonstrates that the efficiency of the reaction is limited by parasitic absorption and unproductive quenching between excited Ir(ppy)3 and the cyanohydrin photoproduct.", "date": "2021-09-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Photochemistry (Org.); Physical Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A conventional understanding is that fragment ions generated in low-energy CID should follow the even-electron rule. As such, (de)protonated precursor ions should predominately generate (de)protonated fragment ions with very few radical fragment ions (RFIs). However, the extent to which RFIs present in MS2 spectra has not been comprehensively investigated. This work uses the latest NIST 20 tandem mass spectral library to investigate of the occurrence of RFIs in CID MS2 experiments. In particular, RFIs were recognized using their integer double bond equivalent (DBE) values calculated from their annotated molecular formulas. Our study shows unexpected results as 65.4% and 68.8% of MS2 spectra contain at least 10% RFIs by ion-count (total number of ions) in positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes, respectively. Furthermore, we classified chemicals based on their compound classes and chemical substructures, and calculated the percentages of RFIs in each class.

We also found four possible patterns of change in RFI percentages as a function of CID collision energy. Finally, we demonstrate that the inadequate consideration of RFIs in most conventional bioinformatic tools might cause problems during in silico fragmentation and de novo annotation of MS2 spectra.

While changes in crystallographic structure can be detected with diffraction-based methods, probing the chemistry of the disordered, heterogeneous CEI layer is challenging. In this work, we use a combination of ex situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) to provide chemical and spatial information on the CEI deposited on LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) composite cathode films.

If substantial amounts of CO2 from natural gas reforming are captured and permanently stored, such hydrogen could be a low-carbon energy carrier. However, recent research raises questions about the effective climate impacts of blue hydrogen from a life cycle perspective. Our analysis sheds light on the relevant issues and provides a balanced perspective on the impacts on climate change associated with blue hydrogen. We show that such impacts may indeed vary over large ranges and depend on only a few key parameters: the methane emission rate of the natural gas supply chain, the CO2 removal rate at the hydrogen production plant, and the global warming metric applied. State-of-the-art reforming with high CO2 capture rates combined with natural gas supply featuring low methane emissions does indeed allow for substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to both conventional natural gas reforming and direct combustion of natural gas. Under such conditions, blue hydrogen is compatible with low-carbon economies and features climate change impacts in line with green hydrogen from electrolysis supplied with renewable electricity.

However, attempts to tune the spin-spin interaction between the SAC and its microenvironment have remained rather scarce. Some interesting questions can be raised, among which a fundamental one is: can the surrounding environment influence the local spin state of an SAC, and if so, can such influence be utilized to enhance the catalytic activity?\n\nIn this work, we explore such a possibility by investigating the thermochemical effect of Kondo screening of a local atomic spin by free electrons in the metal support. Inspired by the exothermicity of the spin-screening interaction, a novel approach to heterogeneous catalysis -- reaction on a rink (ROAR) -- is proposed. In contrast to the conventional notion of thermal catalytic reaction, lowering the temperature of metal support is predicted to result in a reduced reaction barrier. As a proof of concept, CO oxidation catalyzed by the Co@CoPc/Au(111) composite is scrutinized. By combining the density functional theory and a hierarchical equations of motion approach, it predicts that the existing s-d hybridization between the magnetic d orbital of Co adatom and the substrate metallic states in the transition state will lower the free energy barrier and accelerate the reaction rate. Furthermore, if the strength of s-d hybridization is enlarged, a more appreciable speedup will be achieved.\n\nThis work highlights the potential usefulness of the spin degrees of freedom to heterogeneous single-atom catalysis, and our proposed ROAR approach could open up a new horizon for exploiting the role of atomic spin in chemical reactions.", "date": "2021-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This soluble two-domain protein undergoes profound conformational changes upon photoactivation, involving translocation of the ketocarotenoid inside the cavity followed by domain separation. Domain separation is a critical step in the photocycle of OCP because it exposes the N-terminal domain (NTD) to perform quenching of the phycobilisomes. Many details regarding the mechanism and energetics of OCP domain separation remain unknown. In this work, we apply metadynamics to elucidate the protein rearrangements that lead to the active, domain-separated, form of OCP. We find that translocation of the ketocarotenoid canthaxanthin has a profound effect on the energetic landscape and that domain separation only becomes favorable following translocation. We further explore, characterize, and validate the free energy surface (FES) using equilibrium simulations initiated from different states on the FES. Through pathway optimization methods, we characterize the most probable path to domain separation and reveal the barriers along that pathway. We find that the free energy barriers are relatively small (<5 kcal/mol), but the overall estimated kinetic rate is consistent with experimental measurements (>1 ms).

In addition, not only the spectral function but also the excited states and eigen energies can be directly calculated, which is usually impossible for other MPS-based methods such as time-dependent formalism or correction vector. The remarkable accuracy and efficiency of coCheMPS over other methods are demonstrated by calculating the spectral functions of spin chain and ab initio hydrogen chain.

Molecular Layer Deposition (MLD) is a suitable thin film deposition technique for the controlled growth of thin, conformal hybrid films. Despite the great interest in these materials, a detailed understanding of the atomistic mechanism of MLD film growth is still lacking. This paper presents a first principles investigation of the detailed mechanism of the growth of hybrid organic-inorganic thin films of aluminium oxide and aromatic molecules with different terminal groups deposited by MLD. We investigate the chemistry of the MLD process between the post-TMA pulse methyl-terminated Al2O3 surface and the homo- or hetero- bifunctional aromatic compounds with hydroxy (OH) and/or amino (NH2) terminal groups: hydroquinone (HQ), p-phenylenediamine (PD) and 4-aminophenol (AP). Double reactions of aromatic molecules with the alumina surface are also explored. We show that all aromatic precursor molecules bind favourably to the methyl terminated Al2O3, via formation of Al-O and Al-N bonds and CH4 elimination. While reaction energetics suggest a higher reactivity of the OH group with TMA in comparison to the NH2 group, which could enable the double reaction phenomenon for HQ we propose that the upright configuration will be present so that the organic molecules are self-assembled in an upright configuration, which leads to thicker hybrid films. Interactions between the methyl-terminated Al2O3 with substituted phenyls are investigated to examine the influence of phenyl functionalisation on the chemistry of the terminal groups. Reaction energetics show that phenyl functionalization actually promotes an upright configuration of the molecule, which leads to thicker and more flexible films, as well as tuning the properties of the aromatic components of the hybrid films. We also investigate the interactions between methyl-terminated Al2O3 with new possible MLD organic precursors, hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ether and 1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine. DFT shows that both aromatic molecules react favourably with TMA and are worthy of further experimental investigation.", "date": "2021-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Reaction (Inorg.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Plasmons can be found in bulk and nanomaterials, and in recent years, plasmons have also been identified in molecules and these molecules have been utilized to build plasmonic devices. As molecular plasmons can no longer be described by classical electrodynamics, a description using quantum mechanics is necessary. Many methods have been developed to identify and quantify molecular plasmons based on the properties of plasmonic excitations. However, there is not currently a method that is widely accepted, connects to collectivity and coherence, and is computationally practical.  Here we develop a metric to accurately and efficiently identify and quantify plasmons in molecules. A number, which we call plasmon character index (PCI), can be calculated for each electronic excited state and describes the plasmonicity of the excitation. PCI is developed from the collective and coherent excitation picture in orbitals and shows excellent agreement with the predictions from scaled time-dependent density functional theory but is vastly more computationally efficient.  Therefore, PCI can be a useful tool in identifying and quantifying plasmons and will inform the rational design of plasmonic molecules and small nanomaterials.

Although some success has been achieved using CNT-based approaches, the efficiency, batch reproducibility, and the limits of their applicability remain to be assessed. Here, we provide a mechanistic understanding of plasmid DNA-loaded CNTs based transfection of plant cells, and factors affecting the expression of the transformed plasmid. We show that transfection is inherently limited by the presence of the cell wall, Coulomb interactions between DNA and polymer coated CNT, and DNA size, whereas expression of the transformed plasmid is limited by relative gene-to-plasmid size and the intracellular accessibility of DNA. We further show that the formation of partially condensed DNA on the CNT surface is a prerequisite for successful transfection and expression. Furthermore, DNA does not detach completely from the CNT, so the accessibility of the transcription machinery to DNA is the key for transformation efficiency. This irreversible DNA plasmid binding and partial condensation limit the length of DNA that can be expressed, thus negatively affecting efficiency and reproducibility. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and limitations of CNT-mediated delivery of DNA through the plant cell wall is of considerable importance in guiding efforts to design nanomaterials for efficient transformation, trait engineering, and synthetic biology applications.", "date": "2021-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In the present study, the impact of Ta doping on the anatase to rutile transition (ART), structural characteristics, anion and cation vacancy formation were investigated in detail using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and experimental characterisation including, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The average crystallite size of TiO2 decreases with an increase in the Ta concentration. At high temperatures, more oxygen atoms entered the crystal lattice and occupy the vacancies, leading to lattice expansion. Importantly, we find that Ta doping preserved the anatase content of TiO2 up to annealing temperatures of 850 \u00b0C which allows anatase stability to be maintained at typical ceramic processing temperatures. The substitution of Ti4+ by the Ta5+ ions increased the electron concentration in the crystal lattice through formation of Ti3+ defect states. Raman studies revealed the formation of new Ta bonds via disturbing the Ti-O-Ti bonds in the crystal lattice. It is concluded that under the oxidising conditions, Ta5+ ions could be enhanced on Ta-TiO2 surface due to the slow diffusion kinetics.", "date": "2021-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysts; Materials Processing; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

We have found that annealing palladium-based core@shell catalysts in air at elevated temperature (800\u00b0C) promotes the redispersion of active metal into highly dispersed sites, which we refer to as halo sites. Here, we examine the restructuring of Pd@SiO2 and Pd@CeO2 core@shell catalysts over successive 800\u00b0C aging cycles to understand the formation, activity, nanoscale structure and stability of these palladium halo sites. While encapsulation generally improves metal utilization by providing a physical barrier that promotes redispersion over agglomeration, our cycled aging experiments demonstrate that halo sites are not stable in all catalysts. Halo sites continue to migrate in Pd@SiO2 due to poor metal-support bonding, which leads to palladium agglomeration. In contrast, halo sites formed in Pd@CeO2 remain stable. The dispersed palladium also synergistically stabilizes the ceria from agglomerating. We attribute this stability, in addition to an observed improvement in catalytic activity, to the coordination between palladium and reducible ceria that arises during the formation of halo sites. We probe the importance of ceria oxidation state on the stability of halo sites by aging Pd@CeO2 after it has been reduced. While some halo sites agglomerate, we find that returning to air aging mitigates the loss of these sites and catalytic activity. Our findings illustrate how nanoscale catalyst structures can be designed to promote the formation of highly stable and dispersed metal sites.", "date": "2021-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Nanoscience; Core-Shell Materials; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The elevated concentrations of these compounds cause adverse effects in humans and animals. In this contribution, the protective effects of the synthesized starch-stabilized selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs@starch) on melamine-induced hepato-renal toxicity have been systematically investigated. The Se-NPs@starch were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis, TEM, and FT-IR. Starch plays a crucial role in the stabilization and dispersion of Se NPs, as noticed from the TEM and EDS investigations. Furthermore, the atomic ratio of Se distribution over the starch surface is approximately 1.67%. The current study was conducted on four groups of adult male rats, and the oral daily treatments for 28 days were as follows: group I served as control, group II received Se-NPs@starch, group III was exposed to melamine, while group IV was treated with melamine and Se-NPs@starch. The results reveal a significant alteration in the histoarchitecture of both hepatic and renal tissues induced by melamine. Furthermore, elevated liver and kidney function markers, high malondialdehyde, and increased expression levels of apoptosis-related genes besides a reduction in GSH and expression levels of antioxidant genes were observed in the melamine-exposed group. Interestingly, the administration of the Se-NPs@starch resulted in remarkable protection of rats against melamine-induced toxicity through increasing the antioxidant capacity and inhibiting oxidative damage. Collectively, this study provides affordable starch-stabilized Se-NPs with potent biological activity, making them auspicious candidates for prospective biomedical applications.

Two methods were investigated to improve its adsorption performance: decreasing synthesis temperature below the LCST and copolymerizing with the optimum amount of quaternary ammonium salt (QAS). We found these two methods can effectively improve the water vapor uptake.

As fuel cell catalyst, a bimodal Pt/C catalyst was chosen that consists of two distinguishable particle size populations. The presence of the two different sizes should favor and uncover electrochemical Ostwald ripening as the major degradation mechanism, i.e., it is expected that the size of the larger particles in the Pt/C catalyst grows at the expense of the smaller particles. The grazing incidence mode performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at the ID31 beamline revealed an intertwinement of the depth dependent degradation. While the larger particles show the same particle size changes close to the electrolyte-catalyst interface and within the catalyst layer, for the smaller Pt nanoparticles a different degradation scenario is observed. At the electrolyte-catalyst interface, the smaller particles increase in size while their phase fraction decreases during the AST.

However in condensed phase processes, the non-meaningful motions of bulk solvent often overpower the ability of dimensionality reduction methods to identify correlated motions that underpin collective variables. Yet solvent can play important indirect or direct roles in reactivity and much can be lost through treatments that remove or dampen solvent motion. This has been amply demonstrated within principal component analysis, although less is known about the behavior of  nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, e.g., UMAP, that have become more popular recently. The latter presents an interesting alternative to linear methods though often at the expense of interpretability. This work presents distance attenuated projection methods of atomic coordinates that facilitate the application of both PCA and UMAP to identify collective variables in solution, and further the specific identity of solvent molecules that participate in chemical reactions. The performance of both methods is examined in detail for two reactions where the explicit solvent plays very different roles within the collective variables. The first reaction consists of the dynamic exchange of a cation about a polyhydroxy anion that is facilitated by waters of solvation, while the second reaction consists of a nucleophilic attack of water upon ethylene to initiate cis/trans isomerization.\n When applied to raw data, both PCA and UMAP representations are dominated by bulk solvent motions.\n On the other hand, when applied to data preprocessed by our attenuated projection methods, both PCA and UMAP identify the appropriate collective variables in solution.", "date": "2021-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The puzzling experimental observation of the more than one-order of magnitude difference of the EFISHG intensity between the fully charged silica/water interface and the charged molecular covered air/water interface was generally overlooked in the EFISHG literature. Nevertheless, this significant signal difference suggests additional source for the Chi(3) contribution at the fully charged silica/water interface other than the polarized water molecules as in the case of charged monolayer covered air/water interface. In this report, we re-examine the treatment of the Chi(3) mechanism at the charged silica/water interface by including the contributions from the bulk silica using proper boundary condition and image charge distributions for the change screening effects inside bulk silica phase. We show that the Chi(3) contribution from the bulk silica is in similar form as that of the aqueous bulk phase, and it is with more than one-order of magnitude and with opposite sign. The treatment reported here can be extended to other charged interfaces.", "date": "2021-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Tetrahydrofuran, a cyclic ether, is an experimentally common and promising solvent for the preparation of stable and efficient calcium electrolytes. However, insights into the reasons why are lacking, which could unveil key principles to electrolyte design. In this report, we provide a theoretical study employing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of the interactions of Ca metal with the cyclic ether tetrahydrofuran (THF). The results show that the electrochemical breakdown and decomposition of THF at the Ca surface is highly orientation- and surface-site dependent, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of its instability in a randomly organized bulk solvent. Likewise, in bulk electrolytes, its likelihood for breakdown is further diminished, in preference for coordination Ca2+ to form solvated structure. Hence, the finding that molecules require such strict conditions for their decomposition is an important selection and design principle for any solvent to prepare suitable calcium electrolytes. These findings are critical to the advancement of the calcium batteries.

Hosein", "abstract": "Calcium (ion) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage systems, owing to their numerous benefits in terms of performance metrics, low-cost, mineral abundance, and economic sustainability. A central and critical area to the advancement of the technology is the development of suitable eletrolytes that allow for good salt solubility, ion mobility, electrochemical stability, and reversible redox activity. At this time, the study of different solvent-salt combinations is very limited. Here, we present a computational study on the coordination environment, solvation energetics, and diffusivity of calcium ions over a range of pertinent ionic liquids, cyclic and acylic alkyl carbonates, and specific alkyl nitriles and alkyl formamides, using the salts calcium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Ca(TFSI)2) and calcium perchlorate (Ca(ClO4)2). Key findings are that several solvents from different solvent classes present comparable solvation environments and mobilities. Ca(TFSI)2 is prefered over Ca(ClO4)2 owing to the former\u2019s mix coordination of Ca2+ to O and N atoms. Ionic liquids with alkyl sulfonate anions provide better coordation over TFSI, which leads to greater diffusivity. Binary organic mixtures (carbonates) provide the best solvation of Ca2+, however, single organic solvents also provide good solvation, such as EC, THF and DMF, as well as some acyclic carbonates. Ion pairing with the salt anion is always present, but can be mitigated through solvent selection, which also correlates to greater mobility; however, there are examples in which strong ion pairing is not significantly adverse to diffusivity. The solvent incorporate into the solvation structure with binary organic mixtures correlates well with the solvation capabilities of the individual solvents. Finally, we show that ionic liquids (specifically alkyl imidazole (cation) alkyl sulfonate (anion) ionic liquids) do not decompose when coordinating at a Ca metal interface, which indicates its promising stability. Overall, this study contributes further generalized understanding of the correlation between solvent and salt and the resultant Ca2+ complexes and Ca2+ mobility in a range of electrolytes, and reveals a range of possible solvents suitable for exploration in calcium (ion) batteries.", "date": "2021-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Physical and Chemical Processes; Physical and Chemical Properties; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we established novel in silico approaches and applied to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). First, we identified six potential allosteric modulators (SANC00302, SANC00303, SANC00467, SANC00468, SANC00469, SANC00630) from the South African Natural Compounds Database (SANCDB) bound to the allosteric pocket of Mpro that we determined in our previous work. We also checked the stability of these compounds against Mpro of laboratory strain HCoV-OC43 and identified differences due to residue changes between the two proteins. Next, we focused on understanding the allosteric effects of these modulators on each protomer of the reference Mpro protein, while incorporating the symmetry problem in the functional homodimer. In general, asymmetric behavior of multimeric proteins is not commonly considered in computational analysis. We introduced a novel combinatorial approach and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis algorithms to examine patterns of change and conservation of critical nodes, according to five independent criteria of network centrality (betweenness centrality (BC), closeness centrality (CC), degree centrality (DC), eigencentrality (EC) and katz centrality (KC)). The relationships and effectiveness of each metric in characterizing allosteric behavior were also investigated. We observed highly conserved network hubs for each averaged DRN metric on the basis of their existence in both protomers in the absence and presence of all ligands, and we called them persistent hubs (residues 17, 111, 112 and 128 for averaged BC; 6, 7, 113, 114, 115, 124, 125, 126, 127 and 128 for averaged CC; 36, 91, 146, 150 and 206 for averaged DC; 7, 115 and 125 for EC; 36, 125 and 146 for KC). We also detected ligand specific signal changes some of which were in or around functional residues (i.e. chameleon switch PHE140). Using EC persistent hubs and ligand introduced hubs we identified a residue communication path between allosteric binding site and catalytic site. Finally, we examined the effects of the mutations on the behavior of the protein in the presence of selected potential allosteric modulators and investigated the ligand stability. The hit compounds showed various levels of stability in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutations, being most stable in A173V, N274D and R279C, and least stable in R60C, N151D V157I, C160S and A255V. SANC00468 was the most stable compound in the 43 mutant protein systems. We further used DRN metric analysis to define cold spots as being those regions that are least impacted, or not impacted, by mutations. One crucial outcome of this study was to show that EC centrality hubs form an allosteric communication path between the allosteric ligand binding site to the active site going through the interface residues of Domain I and II; and this path was either weakened or lost in the presence of some of the mutations. Overall, the results of this study revealed crucial aspects that need to be considered in drug discovery in COVID-19 specifically and in general for rational computational drug design purposes.", "date": "2021-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The wrong conversion of isobaric isochoric heat capacity also caused about 40 % error but in the other direction. We have introduced the concept of anharmonic correction (AC) which is simply the deviation of the classical heat capacity from that of the harmonic oscillator model. This anharmonic contribution is around +30-40 J/mol/K for water depending on the water model and -8-10 J/mol/K for hydrocarbons and halocarbons. AC is unrealistically large, +40 J/K/mol for alcohols and amines indicating some deficiency of the OPLS force field. The accuracy of the computations was also assessed with the determination of the self-diffusion coefficients.", "date": "2021-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Statistical Mechanics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As compared to the state-of-the-art in fundamental research, i.e., rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, GDE measurements offer several advantages. Most importantly mass transport limitations, inherent to RDE measurements are avoided. In a GDE setup the reactant, e.g., oxygen gas, is not dissolved into a liquid electrolyte but distributed through a gas diffusion layer (GDL), as it is actually the case in fuel cells. Consequently, much higher current densities can be achieved, and the catalysts can be studied in a wider and more relevant potential range. Furthermore, direct contact to a liquid electrolyte can be avoided and elevated temperatures can be employed in a straight-forward manner. However, the use of GDE setups also comes with some challenges. The determined performance is not strictly related to the catalyst itself (intrinsic activity), but also to the quality of the catalyst film preparation. Therefore, it might be even more important than in RDE testing to develop standardized procedures to prepare catalysts inks and films that can be reproduced effortlessly in research laboratories for fundamental and applied experimentation. To develop such standardized testing protocols, we present a comparative RDE \u2013 GDE study, where we investigate several commercial standard Pt/C fuel cell catalysts with respect to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

In this work, we focus on the prospect of using single metal atoms to increase the reducibility of a prototypical irreducible oxide, zirconia. Based on extensive self-consistent DFT+U calculations, we demonstrate that single metal atoms significantly improve and tune the surface reducibility of zirconia. Detailed analysis of the observed single atom induced reducibility allows us to attribute the enhanced reducibility to strong interactions between the metal atom and the electrons trapped in the vacancy, and d-p orbital interactions between the metal atom and oxygen.

Currently missing, however, is a clear elucidation of the inevitable trade-offs that exist between CO2 utilization and electrolyzer performance, specifically how the Faradaic Efficiency of a system varies with CO2 availability. Such information is needed to properly assess the viability of the technology. In this work, we provide a combined experimental and 3D modelling assessment of the trade-offs between CO2 utilization and selectivity at 200 mA/cm2 within a membrane-electrode assembly CO2 electrolyzer. Using varying inlet flow rates we demonstrate that the variation in spatial concentration of CO2 leads to spatial variations in Faradaic Efficiency that cannot be captured using common \u2018black box\u2019 measurement procedures. Specifically, losses of Faradaic efficiency are observed to occur even at incomplete CO2 consumption (80%).

Here, we report the validation of a well-known luciferase-based assay for the detection of NK activity in 96-well plate format. The assay was semi-automated using a liquid handling robot. A good linearity was demonstrated (r\u00b2 >0.98) in the range of 0 to 500 \u00b5M ATP, and it was shown that also alternative phosphate donors like dATP or CTP were accepted by the luciferase.

Herein, we describe the one-pot synthesis of oxidation-sensitive supramolecular micelles and vesicles. This was achieved by polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) of the N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) precursor of methionine using polyethylene oxide as stabilizing and hydrophilic block in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Remarkably, the secondary structure of polypeptides greatly influenced the final morphology of the assemblies. Surprisingly, worm-like micellar morphologies were obtained for a wide range of methionine block lengths and solid contents, with spherical micelles restricted to very short hydrophobic lengths. Worm-like micelles further assembled into oxidation-sensitive, self-standing gels in the reaction pot.

This CRN produces transient quaternization of tertiary amine-functionalised block copolymers, which can then form the complex coacervate phase.

First, we synthesise an atomically dispersed platinum complex with aniline and chloride ligands onto graphene and characterise it with ex-situ electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). Then, by operando EXAFS and XANES, we show that as a negatively biased potential is applied, the Pt-N bonds break first followed by the Pt-Cl bonds. The platinum is reduced from platinum(II) to metallic platinum(0) by the onset of the hydrogen-evolution reaction at 0 V. Furthermore, we observe an increase in Pt-Pt bonding, indicating the formation of platinum agglomerates. Together, these results indicate that while aniline is used to prepare platinum SSCs, the single-site complexes are decomposed and platinum agglomerates at operating potentials.

The sensor allows parts to be easily changed, washed and cleaned, its simplicity and versatility allows components from existing nanopore fabrication techniques such as silicon nitride, polyurethane and glass pipettes to be integrated into a single device. This creates a multi-nanopore sensor that can simultaneously measure particles from 0.1 to 30 \uf06dm in diameter. The orientation and controlled fluid flow in the device allows the sensors to be placed in series, whereby smaller particles can be measured in the presence of larger ones without the risk of being blocked.

Fuchsonarenes containing two hemiquinonoid substituents at diagonally-opposed meso-positions with two electron rich phenol groups at the remaining meso-positions between the hemiquinonoid groups. All meso-substituents are in proximity at one side of the resorcinarene macrocycle (so-called rccc-type isomer) with rotational activity of the phenol meso-substituents. Rotation rates of the phenol moieties can be controlled by varying temperature, solvent polarity and acidity of the medium of study with rotation being thermally activated in neutral and acidic media and tunable in the range from 2 s-1 to 20,000 s-1. Experimental and computational data indicate that rotation of the mobile phenol meso-substituents is remotely affected by interactions with acidic solvents at the carbonyl C=O groups of macrocyclic acetyloxy groups, which occurs with the emergence of a lower energy electronic absorption band whose intensity is correlated with both the acidity of the medium and the rotation rate of the phenol substituents. Time-dependent DFT calculations suggest that the low energy band is due to a molecular conformational adjustment affecting electronic conjugation caused by strong interaction of macrocyclic acetyloxy carbonyl groups with the acid medium. The work presents a molecular mechanical model for estimating solution acidity and also gives insight into a possible method for modulating rotor activity in molecular machines.", "date": "2021-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Physical Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The density matrix is specified as a function of a few time-independent observables where their coefficients are time-dependent. The key mathematical step is the vectorization of the surprisal, the logarithm of the density matrix, at each time point of interest. The time span used depends on the required spectral resolution. The entire course of the system evolution is represented as a matrix where each\ncolumn is the vectorized surprisal at the given time point. Using singular value decomposition, SVD, of this matrix we generate realistic approximations for the time-independent\nobservables and their respective time dependent coefficients. This allows a simplification of the algebraic procedure for determining the dominant constraints (the\ntime-independent observables) in the sense of the maximal entropy approach. A nonstationary coherent initial state of a Morse oscillator is used to introduce the approach. We derive analytical exact expression for the surprisal as a function of time and this offers a benchmark for comparison with the accurate but approximate SVD results. We discuss two examples of a Morse potential of different anharmonicities, the H2 and I2 molecules. We further demonstrate the approach for a two coupled electronic states problem, the well studied non radiative decay of pyrazine from its bright state. Five constraints are found to\nbe enough to capture the ultrafast electronic population exchange and to recover the dynamics of the wave packet in both electronic states.", "date": "2021-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Quantum Computing; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The PFN channel is a \u03b2 barrel formed from multiple monomers, for example a ~14 nm diameter channel is formed from 22 monomers. Coincidentally the wide canopy of S (which has three identical chains) has an enclosing diameter of ~14 nm. While inside the channel peripheral residues in the canopy may bind with residues on the pore side of the barrel. If there are no adverse cross-reactions this would effectively prevent S from interacting with a target cell. Calculations with data obtained from PDB and other sources show that there are ~12 peripheral residue triples in S within a circle of diameter ~14 nm that can potentially bind with 22 exposed residues in each barrel monomer. The revised Miyazawa-Jernighan matrix is used to calculate the binding energy of canopy-PFN barrel residue pairs. The results show a large number of binding pairs over distances of up to 38 \u00c5 into the pore. This geometric view of capture and containment points to the possibility of using biological pores to neutralize SARS-Cov-2 in its many variant forms. Some necessary conditions that must be satisfied for such neutralization to occur are noted. A wide pore (such as PFN or SLO) can also be used in an electrolytic cell to detect the presence of SARS-Cov-2, which would cause a large-sized blockade of the base current (the ionic current in a fully open pore). It can further be used to quantify the virus level in the sample. Solid-state pores, which have several advantages over biological ones, can be used instead; immune rejection is not an issue and there is no need for the spike or the virus to bind to the pore.", "date": "2021-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The presence of loosely bounded PS-aggregates at temperatures higher than the rheologically determined gelation temperature (Tgel) captures the progressive gelation process spanning over a broad temperature range. However, the microstructure fully develops at temperatures sufficiently lower than Tgel. The microstructure orients in the stretching direction with the applied strain. In an oscillation strain cycle, such oriented structure has been observed at low-strain. But, at large-strain, because of strain-localization the oriented structure splits, and only a fraction of midblock participates in load-bearing. Both microstructure recovery and time-dependent moduli during the stress-relaxation process after the application of a step-strain have been captured using a stretched-exponential model. However, the microstructure recovery time has been found to be two orders of magnitude slower than the stress-relaxation time at room temperature, indicating a complex nature of stress-relaxation and microstructure recovery processes involving midblock relaxation, endblock pullout and reassociation. Due to their viscoelastic nature, these gels' mechanical responses are sensitive to strain, temperature, and rate of deformation. Therefore, insights into the microstructural information as a function of these parameters will assist these gels' real-life applications and design new gels with improved properties.\n", "date": "2021-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Aggregates and Assemblies; Organic Polymers; Polymer morphology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the present work, we report a series of air-stable seven coordinate Dy(III) SIMs {[L2Dy(H2O)5][X]3\u00b7L2\u00b7n(H2O), n = 0, X = Cl (1), n = 1, X = Br (2), I (3)} possessing pseudo-D5h symmetry or pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry with high anisotropy energy barrier (Ueff) and blocking temperature (TB). While the strong axial coordination from the sterically encumbered phosphonamide, tBuPO(NHiPr)2 (L), increases the overall anisotropy of the system, the presence of high symmetry significantly quenches quantum tunnelling of magnetization, which is the prominent deactivating factor encountered in SIMs. Although the local coordination geometry and the symmetry around the Dy(III) in all the three complexes are similar and display only slight deviations, the variation of halide anions in the secondary coordination sphere which is hydrogen-bonded to the coordinated equatorial water molecules, show subtle alteration in the magnetic properties. The energy barrier (Ueff) and the blocking temperature (TB) decrease in the order 3 > 2 > 1 with the change of anions from larger iodide to smaller strongly hydrogen-bonded chloride in the secondary coordination sphere. Ab initio CASSCF/RASSI-SO/SINGLE_ANISO calculations further provide deeper insights into the dynamics of magnetic relaxation in addition to the role of the secondary coordination sphere in modulating the anisotropy of the D5h systems, using diverse models. Thus, in addition to the importance of the crystal field and the symmetry to obtain high-temperature SIMs, this study also probes the significance of the secondary coordination sphere that can be tailored to accomplish novel SIMs.", "date": "2021-09-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Magnetism; Theory - Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However battery rate performance still suffers from increased impedance attributed to the interfacial reactions between thiophosphate electrolyte and oxide electrodes. Stabilizing the interfaces with a protective coating layer has been proposed as a solution to the interfacial problem, but it is rare for a material to simultaneously exhibit fast ionic conductivity and chemical stability at battery interfaces.

However, no direct comparison or underlying physical relationship has been shown between the two. Here we establish that ionic transport can be varied independent of thermal transport in Ag+ superionic conductors, even though both phenomena arise from atomic vibrations. Thermal conductivity measurements, in conjunction with two-channel lattice dynamics modeling, reveals that the vast majority of Ag+ vibrations have non-propagating diffuson-like character, which provides a rational for how these two transport properties can be independent.

Unlike the endogenously synthesized D-serine in animals, D-Ala may be from exogenous sources, e.g., diet and intestinal microorganisms. However, it is unclear if the capability to produce D-Ala and other D-AAs varies among different microbial strains in the gut. We isolated individual microorganisms of rat gut microbiota and profiled their D-AA secretion in vitro, focusing on D-Ala. Serial dilutions of intestinal content from adult male rats were plated on agar to obtain clonal cultures. Using MALDI-TOF MS for rapid strain typing, we identified 38 unique isolates, grouped into 11 species based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. We then used two-tier screening to profile bacterial D-AA secretion, combining a D-amino acid oxidase-based enzymatic assay for rapid assessment of overall D-AA amount, followed by chiral LC-MS/MS to quantify individual D-AAs, revealing 19 out of the 38 isolated strains as D-AA producers. LC-MS/MS analysis of the eight top D-AA producers showed high levels of D-Ala in all strains tested, with substantial inter- and intra-species variations. Though results from enzymatic assay and LC-MS/MS analysis aligned well, LC-MS/MS further revealed the existence of D-glutamate and D-aspartate, which are poor substrates for enzymatic assay.

It has been postulated that TMCs polarise the electron density of adsorbed metal particles in such a way that their catalytic activity ends up being superior to those dispersed on more traditional metal oxide supports. Herein, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of small clusters of precious metals (Rh, Pd, Pt and Au) and more affordable metals (Co, Ni and Cu) supported on TMCs with 1:1 stoichiometry (TiC, ZrC, HfC, VC, NbC, TaC, MoC and WC) by means of periodic Density Functional Theory calculations. Our high-throughput screening studies indicate that it is possible not only to have strongly bonded and stably dispersed metal nanoparticles on TMC surfaces, but also to manipulate their charge by carefully selecting elements with desired electronegativity for the host TMC and the metal cluster. By doing so, it is possible to tune the amount of charge density on the cluster hollow sites, which can facilitate the bonding of certain molecules. Moreover, we identify Pt, Pd and Rh clusters supported on hexagonal TMC (001) facets as the candidates with the highest potential catalytic activity -as estimated by the significant polarisation of the cluster electron density- and stability -as quantified by the strongly negative values of adsorption energy per atom and formation energy-.", "date": "2021-09-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Carbon-based Materials; Catalysts; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Exemplary of this challenge is the reversible conversion of formate into CO2 by formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzymes with Mo/W centers in large molybdopterin cofactors. Despite numerous efforts to synthesize Mo/W-containing molecular complexes, none have been demonstrated to reproduce the full reactivity of FDH. Here, we carry out a large-scale, high-throughput screening study on all mononuclear Mo/W complexes currently deposited in Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Using density functional theory, we systematically investigate the individual effects of metal identity, ligand identity, oxidation state, and coordination number on structural, electronic and catalytic properties. We compare our results on molecular complexes with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations on a representative FDH enzyme to further elucidate the influence of the enzyme environment. These comparisons reveal that the enzyme environment primarily influences the metal-local geometry, and these metal-local structural variations can improve catalysis. Through a series of computational mutations on molecular complexes, we extend beyond the CSD structures to further identify the limits of varied chalcogen and metal identity. This broad set and comparison reveal relatively little variation of electronic properties of the metal center due to the presence of the enzyme environment or changes in metal-distant ligand chemistry. Instead, these properties are found to be much more sensitive to the identity of the metal and the nature of the bound terminal chalcogen.

In addition, reversible partial dearomatization of the ligand\u2019s naphthyridine core enables both heterolytic metal-ligand cooperativity (MLC) and chemical non-innocence through CPET steps. Thermochemical and computational studies show how a change in ligand binding mode can lower the bond dissociation free energy of ligand C(sp3)\u2013H bonds by ~25 kcal mol-1. H-atom abstraction enabled trapping of an unstable intermediate, which undergoes facile loss of two carbonyl ligands to form an unusual paramagnetic (S = 1/2) complex containing a mixed-valent iron(0)-iron(I) core bound within a partially dearomatized PNNP ligand. Finally, cyclic voltammetry experiments showed that these diiron complexes show catalytic activity for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. This work presents the first example of a ligand system that enables MMC, heterolytic MLC and chemical non-innocence, thereby providing important insights and opportunities for the development of bimetallic systems that exploit these features to enable new (catalytic) reactivity.

Once structure activity relationship trends become well established, identifying new analogs with better properties is important. Synthesizing these new compounds is a logical next step, and is key to research groups that have a synthetic chemistry team or external collaborators. Generative machine learning models have become widely adopted to generate new molecules and explore molecular space, with the goal of discovering novel compounds with desires properties. These generative models have been composed from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and are often combined with transfer learning or scoring of physicochemical properties to steer generative design. While these generative models have proven useful in generating new molecular libraries, often they are not capable of addressing a wide variety of potential problems, and often converge into similar molecular space when combined with a scoring function for desired properties. In addition, generated compounds are often not synthetically feasible, reducing their capabilities outside of virtual composition and limiting their usefulness in real-world scenarios. Here we introduce a suite of automated tools called MegaSyn representing 3 components: a new hill-climb algorithm which makes use of SMILES-based RNN generative models, analog generation software, and retrosynthetic analysis coupled with fragment analysis to score molecules for their synthetic feasibility. We now describe the development and testing of this suite of tools and propose how they might be used to optimize molecules or prioritize promising lead compounds using test case examples.

These enzymes all contain a conserved second-sphere Trp residue that is essential for enzymatic turnover. Previous studies have revealed several important roles for the conserved second-sphere Trp in Staphylococcus aureus IsdG, S. aureus IsdI, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MhuD. However, a general model for the geometric, electronic, and functional role of the second-sphere Trp had not been deduced prior to this work. Here, UV/Vis absorption (Abs) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies were employed to show that the W67F variant of IsdG perturbs the heme substrate conformation without altering the protein secondary structure. In general, it can now be stated that a dynamic equilibrium between \u201cplanar\u201d and \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformations exists within non-canonical heme oxygenases, and that the second-sphere Trp favors population of the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic CD spectroscopies were used to characterize the electronic structures of IsdG and IsdI variants with different substrate conformational distributions. These data revealed that the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation promotes partial porphyrin-to-iron electron transfer, which makes the meso carbons of the porphyrin ring susceptible to radical attack. Finally, UV/Vis Abs spectroscopy was utilized to quantify the enzymatic rates, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to identify the product distributions, for variants of IsdG with altered substrate conformational distributions. In general, the rate of heme oxygenation by non-canonical heme oxygenases depends upon the population of the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation. Also, the production of staphylobilin or mycobilin by these enzymes is correlated with the population of the \u201cruffled\u201d substrate conformation, since variants that favor population of the \u201cplanar\u201d substrate conformation yield significant amounts of biliverdin. These data can be understood within the framework of a concerted rearrangement mechanism for the monooxygenation of heme to meso-hydroxyheme by non-canonical heme oxygenases. However, the mechanisms of IsdG/IsdI and MhuD must diverge following this intermediate in order to generate distinct staphylobilin and mycobilin products, respectively.", "date": "2021-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recent simulations predict that detonation-like shocks produce highly reactive nanoscale shear bands in the layered crystalline explosive TATB (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene), but the thresholds leading to this response are poorly understood. We utilize molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate the high-rate compressive stress-strain response of TATB, with a focus on understanding flow behavior. The dependence of strength on pressure and loading axis (crystal orientation) is explored. The deformation mechanisms fall broadly into two categories, with compression along crystal layers activating a buckling/twinning mode and compression normal to the layers producing nanoscale shear bands. Despite the complexity of the underlying mechanisms, the crystal exhibits relatively straightforward stress-strain curves. Most of the crystal orientations studied show rapid strain softening following the onset of yielding, which settles to a steady flow state. Trajectories are analyzed using five metrics for local states and structural order, but most of these metrics yield similar distributions for these deformation mechanisms.

Taking CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface as the illustrative model catalytic system, we demonstrated that our NN-PES-based MD simulations can efficiently generate the reliable smooth two-dimensional potential-of-mean-force (2-D PMF) surfaces in a wide range of temperatures (from 300 to 900 K), and thus temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties can be obtained in a comprehensive investigation on the whole PMF surface rather than a rough estimation using ideal models based on a few optimized geometries. Moreover, MD simulations offer an effective way to describe the surface kinetics such as the CO adsorbate on-surface movement, which goes beyond the most popular static estimation based on calculated free energy barrier and transition state theory (TST). By comparing the results obtained in the dynamic and static approaches, we further revealed that the dynamic strategy significantly improves the predictions of both thermodynamic and kinetic properties as compared to the popular ideal statistic mechanics approaches such as harmonic analysis and TST. It is expected that this accurate yet efficient dynamic strategy can be a powerful tool in understanding reaction mechanisms and reactivity of a catalytic surface system, and further guides the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts.\n", "date": "2021-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemical Kinetics; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Assessment of the effectiveness of quiz games in learning is conducted via a proposed novel chemistry achievement test, Freshman Engineering Chemistry Aptitude Test and an attitude questionnaire. The findings contribute to our understanding of the role of game-based learning in students\u2019 achievement in chemistry and their motivation and attitudes towards learning general chemistry at a university within an ESL environment, while the computer games developed are useful in all English based Chemistry classes.

Here we introduce a mass spectrometry-based approach that integrates untargeted metabolomics with multistage, high-resolution native mass spectrometry to rapidly identify natural products that bind to therapeutically relevant protein targets. By directly screening crude natural product extracts containing thousands of drug-like small molecules using a single, rapid measurement, novel natural product ligands of human drug targets could be identified without fractionation. This method should significantly increase the efficiency of target-based natural product drug discovery workflows.

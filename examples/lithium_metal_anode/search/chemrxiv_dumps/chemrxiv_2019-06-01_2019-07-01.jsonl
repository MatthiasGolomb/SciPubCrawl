However, to translate the natural\nstrategy into advanced digital manufacturing like three-dimensional (3D)\nprinting remains a tremendous technical and theoretical challenge. This work\npresents a 3D printing technique of a particular protein, silk fibroin, by\nrationally designing an<i> de novo </i>aqueous\nsalt bath capable of directing the hierarchical assembly of the protein\nmolecules. This technique, conducted under aqueous and ambient conditions,\nresults in 3D proteinaceous architectures characterized by intrinsic\nbiocompatibility/biodegradability and remarkable mechanical performance. The\nversatility of this method is shown in a diversity of 3D shapes and a range of functional\ncomponents integrated into the 3D prints. Exceptional manufacturing capability\nand one promising application is exemplified by the single-step construction of\nperfusable microfluidic chips, also an analogy of small-diameter vascular grafts,\nwhich eliminates the use of supporting or sacrificial materials owing to optimized\ncrosslinking dynamics and compartmentalized printing parameters.

Improving the water-solubility of BODIPY dyes remains an outstanding challenge. The development of water-soluble BODIPY dyes usually involves direct modification of the BODIPY fluorophore core with ionizable groups or substitution at the boron center. While these strategies are effective for the generation of water-soluble fluorophores, they are challenging to implement when developing BODIPY-based indicators: direct modification of BODIPY core can disrupt the electronics of the dye, complicating the design of functional indicators; and substitution at the boron center often renders the resultant BODIPY incompatible with the chemical transformations required to generate fluorescent sensors. In this study, we show that BODIPYs bearing a sulfonated aromatic group at the meso position provide a general solution for water-soluble BODIPYs. We outline the route to a suite of 5 new sulfonated BODIPYs with 2,6-disubstitution patterns spanning a range of electron-donating and -withdrawing propensities. To highlight the utility of these new, sulfonated BODIPYs, we further functionalize them to access 13 new, BODIPY-based voltage-sensitive fluorophores. The most sensitive of these BODIPY VF dyes displays a 48% \u0394F/F per 100 mV in mammalian cells. Two additional BODIPY VFs show good voltage sensitivity (\u226524% \u0394F/F) and excellent brightness in cells.

The quantum light-matter interactions between the molecule and the quantized\nradiation mode inside an optical cavity create a set\nof hybridized electronic-photonic states, so-called polaritons. The polaritonic states adapt the curvatures\nfrom both the ground and the excited electronic states,\nopening up new possibilities to control photochemical\nreactions by exploiting intrinsic quantum behaviors of\nlight-matter interactions. With direct quantum dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the selectivity of\na model photo-isomerization reaction can be controlled\nby tuning the photon frequency of the cavity mode\nor the light-matter coupling strength, providing new\nways to manipulate chemical reactions via light-matter\ninteraction. We further investigate collective quantum\neffects enabled by coupling quantized radiation mode\nto multiple molecules.

In the non-resonance case,\nmolecules emit and absorb virtual photons to initiate\nexcited state reactions through fundamental quantum\nelectrodynamics processes.

A systematic understanding of cellular systems requires methods that activate multiple signaling molecules or pathways in single cells. However, the construction of tools for such multiplexed signal control is challenging. Here we present orthogonal chemogenetic systems that allow control of multiple signaling pathways in living mammalian cells based on self-localizing ligand-induced protein translocation (SLIPT). Two orthogonal SLIPT systems were constructed to enable chemically inducible, individual translocation of two proteins from the cytoplasm to the inner-leaflet of the plasma membrane in the same cell. The SLIPT systems combined with fluorescent reporters achieved simultaneous multiplexed activation and monitoring of endogenous Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in single cells. Thus, orthogonal SLIPT systems provide a powerful platform for multiplexed chemical signal control in single cells, offering new opportunities for dissecting cell signaling networks and synthetic cell manipulation.<br />", "date": "2019-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we incorporated anthracene-based building blocks into the MOF-74 topology with five different divalent metal ions, that is, Zn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and Mn2+, resulting in a series of highly crystalline MOFs, coined ANMOF-74(M).

To this end, we apply text-mining with named entity recognition (NER), along with entity normalization, for large-scale information extraction from the published materials science literature. The NER is based on supervised machine learning with a recurrent neural network architecture, and the model is trained to extract summary-level information from materials science documents, including: inorganic material mentions, sample descriptors, phase labels, material properties and applications, as well as any synthesis and characterization methods used.

The size of these nanoparticles affects delivery, retention, degradation rate, and sometimes the radiological properties of the particles. For many optically active nanoparticles (such as gold, silver, and quantum dots), the optical properties are directly dependent on the size and shape of the nanoparticles. While this provides a simplistic outlet for modifying the optical properties of those nanoparticles, it is limiting in that their applications are also dependent on morphology. In these works, we aim to determine if the optical properties of fluorescent carbon nanoparticles are dependent on size through variations in synthetic parameters. Fluorescent carbon nanoparticles with hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 10 \u2013 500 nm were prepared through variations of sugar source, concentration of agave (as a sugar source) and incubation time. Through comparisons made between these nanoparticles, we found no change in the local absorbance maxima and refractive index, with < 5 nm shifting in fluorescence maxima location.

The G-quadruplex structures formed by telomeric DNA and RNA (TTAGGG and UUAGGG repeats, respectively) are key to this process. However, because these sequences are particularly polymorphic, solving high-resolution structures is not always possible, and there is a need for new methodologies to characterize the multiple structures coexisting in solution. In this context, we evaluated whether ion mobility spectrometry coupled to native mass spectrometry could help separate and assign the G-quadruplex topologies. We explored the circular dichroism spectra, multimer formation, cation binding, and ion mobility spectra of several 4-repeat and 8-repeat telomeric DNA and RNA sequences, both in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and in K<sup>+</sup>. In 1 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 100 mM trimethylammonium acetate, all RNAs fold intramolecularly (no multimer). In 8-repeat sequences, the subunits are not independent: in DNA the first subunit disfavors the folding of the second one, whereas in RNA the two subunits fold cooperatively via cation-mediated stacking. Ion mobility spectrometry shows that gas-phase structures keep a memory of the solution ones, but not identical. At the native charge states, the loops can rearrange in a variety of ways (unless they are constrained by pre-formed hydrogen bonds), thereby wrapping the core and masking the strand arrangements. Our study highlights that, to progress towards structural assignment from IM-MS experiments, deeper understanding of the solution-to-gas-phase rearrangement mechanisms is warranted. <br />", "date": "2019-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Biophysical Chemistry; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An anthracene-based zinc ion probe named APA is chosen as the model compound, whose weak fluorescence in solution is ascribed to the easy access from the bright (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state to the closelying dark (n,\u03c0*) state caused by the strong vibronic coupling of the two excited states. By either metal complexation or aggregation, the dark state is less accessible due to the restriction of the molecular motion leading to the dark state and elevation of the dark state energy, thus the emission of the bright state is restored. RADS is found to be powerful in elucidating the photophysics of AIE materials with excited states which favor non-radiative decay, including overlap-forbidden states such as (n,\u03c0*) and CT states, spin-forbidden triplet states, which commonly exist in heteroatom-containing molecules.", "date": "2019-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Optical Materials; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Physical and Chemical Processes; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Due to the\nproven existence of Al-O-Al linkages in this material, it constitutes an ideal\nmodel system to study the acidity and mobility of protons associated with such\nunusual linkages. In addition, their properties can be directly compared to\nthose of protons associated with more common Si-O-Al linkages, which are also\npresent in ECR-40. In this work, static density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations including a dispersion correction were employed to study the\npreferred proton sites as well as the Br\u00f8nsted acidity of the framework\nprotons, followed by DFT-based ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to\ninvestigate the proton mobility in guest-free and hydrated ECR-40. Initially,\ntwo different proton arrangements were compared, one containing both H[O6] protons\nassociated with Al-O-Al linkages and H[O10] protons at Si-O-Al linkages, the\nother one containing only H[O10] protons. The former model was found to be\nthermodynamically favoured, as a removal of protons from the Al-O-Al linkages causes\na local accumulation of negative charge. Calculations of the deprotonation\nenergy showed a moderately higher Br\u00f8nsted acidity of the H[O10] protons, at\nvariance with previous empirical explanations, which attributed the exceptional\nperformance of ECR-40 as acid catalyst to the presence of Al\u2011O\u2011Al linkages. The\nAIMD simulations (<i>T</i> = 298 K)\ndelivered no appreciable proton mobility for guest-free ECR-40 and for low\nlevels of hydration (one H<sub>2</sub>O per framework proton). Under saturation\nconditions, framework deprotonation occurred, leading to the formation of\nprotonated water clusters in the pores. Pronounced differences between the two\ntypes of framework protons were observed: While the H[O10] protons were always\nremoved from the Si-O-Al linkages, the Al-O-Al linkages remained mostly\nprotonated, but deprotonation did occur to a minor extent. The observation of a\ndegree of framework deprotonation of Al-O-Al linkages differs from the findings\nreported in a recent computational study of hydrated aluminosilicate zeolites\nwith such linkages (Heard et al., <i>Chem. Sci.</i> <b>2019</b>, <i>10</i>, 5705), pointing to an influence of the overall\nframework composition. Further inspection of the AIMD results showed that a\ncoordination of water molecules to framework Al atoms occurred in many cases,\nespecially in the vicinity of the Al-O-Al linkages, sometimes resulting in a\npronounced modification of the linkages through additional bridging oxygen\natoms. Given the changes in the local structure, it can be expected that such\nmodified linkages are especially prone to break upon dehydration. Thus, in addition to elucidating the deprotonation\nbehaviour of protons associated with different types of linkages, the calculations\nalso provide insights into possible reasons for the instability of Al-O-Al\nlinkages, clarifying why L\u00f6wenstein\u2019s rule is mostly obeyed in materials that\nare formed via a hydrothermal route.</p>", "date": "2019-06-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Solid State Chemistry; Theory - Inorganic; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To reduce the computational cost associated with the calculation of embedding-potential parameters, we developed a set of amino-acid-specific transferable parameters tailored for large-scale polarizable embedding calculations that include proteins. The amino-acid-based parameters are obtained by simultaneously fitting to a set of reference electric potentials based on structures derived from a backbone-dependent rotamer library.

In this perspective, we decided to take part in Stage 2 in the Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) Grand Challenge 4 (GC4) to compare the performance of a quick scoring function, Autodock4, to that of MM-GBSA in predicting the binding affinities of a set of Beta-Amyloid Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE-1) ligands.

Relatedly, biosensors that transduce measured input signals into outputs that influence the host system are key components of engineered gene circuits for synthetic biology applications. While small molecule-based imaging agents are widely used in biological studies, and small molecule-based drugs and chemical probes can target a range of biological processes, a general method for generating a target small molecule in a biological system based on a measured input signal is lacking. Here, we develop a proximity-dependent split esterase that selectively unmasks ester-protected small molecules in an interaction-dependent manner. Exploiting the versatility of an ester-protected small molecule output, we demonstrate fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and pharmacological probe generation, each created by masking key alcohol functional groups on a target small molecule. We show the split esterase system can be used in combination with ester-masked fluorescent or luminescent probes to measure a protein-protein interactions and protein-protein interaction inhibitor engagement. We demonstrate the esterase-based reporter system is compatible with other commonly-used split reporter imaging systems for the simultaneous detection of multiple protein-protein interactions. Finally, we develop a system for selective small molecule-dependent cell killing by unmasking a cytotoxic molecule using an inducible split esterase. Presaging utility in future synthetic biology-based therapeutic applications, we also show the system can be used for intercellular cell killing via a bystander effect, where one activated cell unmasks a cytotoxic molecule and kills cells physically adjacent to the activated cells.  Collectively, this work illustrates that the split esterase system is a valuable new addition to the split protein toolbox, with particularly exciting potential in synthetic biology applications.", "date": "2019-06-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study describes novel 15 isomerization reactions of the ISOPNs, identified through the application of computational 16 chemistry techniques. These reactions produce saturated polycyclic orthonitrite compounds 17 via attack of the R\u2013NO2 group on the vinyl moiety. For the \u03b4-hydroxy nitrates, low-energy 18 isomerization pathways exist to six-membered ring compounds that are around 5 kcal mol-1 19 exothermic. These reactions proceed with barriers around 15 kcal mol-1 below the 20 respective peroxyl radical + NO reactants and yield orthonitrites that can further isomerize 21 to \u03b2-hydroxy ISOPNs. Moreover, the \u03b4-hydroxy nitrates can directly interconvert with their \u03b2 22 substituted counterparts via NO3 group migration, with barriers that are lower yet. It follows 23 that \u03b2-hydroxy nitrates may be stabilized in the \u03b4-hydroxy form, and vice versa. Moreover, 24 the lowest-energy pathway for dissociation of the \u03b4-hydroxy ISOPNs is for the formation of 25 \u03b2-hydroxy alkoxyl radicals, and because of this established branching fractions between the 26 various isoprene peroxyl radicals may require re-evaluation.

Like its predecessors GFN-xTB and GFN2-xTB, the new method termed GFN0-xTB is parameterized for all elements up to radon (Z = 86) and mostly shares well-known density functional tight-binding approximations as well as basis set and integral approximations. The main new feature is the avoidance of the self-consistent charge iterations leading to speed-ups of a factor of 2-20 depending on the size and electronic complexity of the system. This is achieved by including only quantum mechanical contributions up to first-order which are incorporated similar to the previous versions without any pair-specific parameterization. The essential electrostatic electronic interaction is treated by a classical electronegativity equilibration charge model yielding atomic partial charges that enter the electronic Hamiltonian indirectly. Furthermore, the atomic charge-dependent D4 dispersion correction is included to account for long range London correlation effects. Formulas for analytical total energy gradients with respect to nuclear displacements are derived and implemented in the <i>xtb </i>code allowing numerically very precise structure optimizations. The neglect of self-consistent energy terms not only leads to a large gain in computational speed but also can increase robustness in electronically difficult situations because ill-convergence or artificial charge-transfer (CT) is avoided. The comparison of GFN0-xTB and GFN/GFN2-xTB allows dissection of quantum electronic polarization and CT effects thereby improving our understanding of chemical bonding. Compared to the most sophisticated multipole-based GFN2-xTB model (which approaches DFT accuracy for the target properties closely), GFN0-xTB performs slightly worse for non-covalent interactions and molecular structures, while very good results are observed for conformational energies. Vibrational frequencies are obtained less accurately than with GFN/GFN2-xTB but they may still be useful for various purposes like estimating relative thermostatistical reaction energies. Most exceptional is the fact that even relatively complicated transition metal complex structures can be accurately optimized with a non-self-consistent quantum approach. The new method bridges the gap between force-fields and traditional semiempirical methods with its excellent computational cost to accuracy ratio and is intended to explore the chemical space of large molecular systems and solids.<br />", "date": "2019-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we report the design, synthesis, and antibacterial evaluation of group A streptogramin antibiotics\nwith unprecedented structural variability. Using cryo-electron microscopy and forcefield-based\nrefinement, we characterize the binding of eight analogs to the bacterial ribosome at high resolution\n(2.4-2.8 A\u030a), revealing new binding interactions that extend into the peptidyl tRNA binding site and\ntowards synergistic binders that occupy the nascent peptide exit tunnel. Two of these analogs have excellent activity against a streptogramin-resistant strain of S. aureus expressing VatA and exhibit\ndecreased acetylation rates in vitro. Our results demonstrate that the combination of rational design\nand modular chemical synthesis can revitalize classes of antibiotics that are limited by naturally arising resistance mechanisms.</p></div></div>", "date": "2019-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Natural Products; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Through the construction of well-defined Cu<sub>2</sub>O-Pt, Cu<sub>2</sub>O-Ag, Cu<sub>2</sub>O-Au interfaces, we found that Cu<sub>2</sub>O Nanostructures (NSs) on Pt exhibit much lower thermal stability than on Ag and Au, although they show the same surface and edge structures, as identified by element-specific scanning tunneling microscopy (ES-STM) images. The activities of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O-Pt and Cu<sub>2</sub>O-Au interfaces for CO oxidation were further compared at the atomic scale and showed in general that the interface with Cu<sub>2</sub>O NSs could annihilate the CO-poisoning problem suffered by Pt group metals and enhance the interaction with O<sub>2</sub>, which is a limiting step for CO oxidation catalysis on group IB metals. While both interfaces could react with CO at room temperature, the OMI was found to determine the reactivity of supported Cu<sub>2</sub>O NSs by 1) tuning the activity of interfacial oxygen atoms and 2) stabilizing oxygen vacancies or vice versa, the dissociated oxygen atoms at the interface.

The identi\ufb01ed pathways are ranked based on their length.

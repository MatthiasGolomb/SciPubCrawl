The chronic activation of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) is considered as the primary causative factor for the inception of hypertension in geriatric population. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is a highly explored druggable target in the context of hypertension since this enzyme catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. But clinical trials conducted on ACE inhibitors reported their incompetence in the effective treatment of hypertension. Hence, recent studies are focussing on renin, which is a central component of RAS in the regulation of blood pressure. The present study focuses on the elucidation of physicochemical properties of chemical compounds essential for renin inhibition and identification of novel renin inhibitors possessing enhanced potency as well as bioavailability. We have employed Molecular Field Topology Analysis (MFTA) as well as Structure Based Drug Design (SBDD) approaches for the accomplishment of above-mentioned objectives.

However, there is currently no simple, universal, and robust way to measure molecular planarity. In order to fill this evident gap, we propose two metrics of molecular planarity, namely molecular planarity parameter (MPP) and span of deviation from plane (SDP), to quantitatively characterize planarity of molecules. MPP reflects the overall degree of deviation of the structure from a plane, while SDP represents the span of the structural deviation relative to the fitting plane, respectively, they are complementary to each other. The examples in this article demonstrate that these metrics have strong rationality and practicality. They can not only be used to investigate the planarity of the entire molecule, but can also measure the planarity of local structures, and they can even be employed to study variation of molecular planarity during a dynamic process. In addition, we also proposes a new representation, namely coloring atoms according to their signed deviation distance to the fitting plane. This kind of map allows researchers to intuitively and quickly recognize position of the atoms in the system relative to the fitting plane. It can be seen from the examples that this representation is very useful in graphically exhibiting molecular planarity.

In open shell transition metal complexes (TMCs) that are promising for challenging reactions (e.g., C\u2013H activation), the predictive power of DFT has been challenged, and properties are known to be strongly dependent on the admixture of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange. We carry out a large-scale study of the effect of HF exchange on the predicted catalytic properties of over 1,200 mid-row (i.e., Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) 3<i>d </i>TMCs for direct methane-to-methanol conversion. Reaction energetic sensitivities across this set depend both on the catalytic rearrangement and ligand chemistry of the catalyst. These differences in sensitivities change both the absolute energetics predicted for a catalyst and its relative performance. Previous observations of the poor performance of global linear free energy relationships (LFERs) hold with both semi-local DFT widely employed in heterogeneous catalysis and hybrid DFT. Narrower metal/oxidation/spin-state specific LFERs perform better and are less sensitive to HF exchange than absolute reaction energetics, except in the case of some intermediate/high-spin states. Importantly, the interplay between spin-state dependent reaction energetics and exchange effects on spin-state ordering means that the choice of DFT functional strongly influences whether the minimum energy pathway is spin-conserved. Despite these caveats, LFERs involving catalysts that can be expected to have closed shell intermediates and low-spin ground states retain significant predictive power.</p>", "date": "2021-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinorganic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Despite the importance of organic nanoparticle capping ligands in these processes, the effect of electron beam irradiation on surface bound and soluble capping ligands during LP-TEM imaging has not been investigated. Here we use correlative LP-TEM and fluorescence microscopy (FM) to demonstrate that polymeric nanoparticle ligands undergo competing crosslinking and chain scission reactions that non-monotonically modify ligand coverage over time. Branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) coated silver nanoparticles were imaged with dose-controlled LP-TEM followed by labeling their primary amine groups with fluorophores to visualize the local thickness of adsorbed capping ligands. FM images showed that free ligands crosslinked in the LP-TEM image area over imaging times of tens of seconds, enhancing local capping ligand coverage on nanoparticles and silicon nitride membranes. Nanoparticle surface ligands underwent chain scission over irradiation times of minutes to tens of minutes, which depleted surface ligands from the nanoparticle and silicon nitride surface. Conversely, solutions of only soluble capping ligand underwent successive crosslinking reactions with no chain scission, suggesting nanoparticles enhanced the chain scission reactions by acting as radiolysis hotspots. The addition of a hydroxyl radical scavenger, tert-butanol, eliminated chain scission reactions and slowed the progression of crosslinking reactions. These experiments have important implications for performing controlled and reproducible LP-TEM nanoparticle imaging as they demonstrate the electron beam can significantly alter ligand coverage on nanoparticles in a non-intuitive manner. They emphasize the need to understand and control the electron beam radiation chemistry of a given sample to avoid significant perturbations to the nanoparticle capping ligand chemistry, which are invisible in electron micrographs.<br />", "date": "2021-06-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

They change their fluorescence when they interact with analytes. Despite the progress in engineering of these sensors the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. Here, we identify processes and rate constants that explain the photophysical signal transduction by exploiting sp3 quantum defects in the sp2 carbon lattice of SWCNTs. As a model system we use ssDNA coated (6,5)-SWCNTs, which increase their NIR emission (E11, 990 nm) up to + 250 % in response to the important neurotransmitter dopamine. In contrast, SWCNTs coated with DNA but with a low number of NO2-Aryl sp3 quantum defects decrease both their E11 (-35%) and defect related E11* emission (- 50%) at 1130 nm. Consequently, the interaction with the analyte does not change the radiative exciton decay pathway alone. Furthermore, the fluorescence response of pristine SWCNTs increases with SWCNT length, suggesting that exciton diffusion is affected. The quantum yield of pristine (6,5)-SWCNTs increases in response to the analyte from 0.6 % to 1.3 % and points to a change in non-radiative rate constants. These experimental results are explained by a Monte Carlo simulation of exciton diffusion, which supports a change of two non-radiative decay pathways together with an increase of exciton diffusion (3 rate constant model). The combination of such SWCNTs with defects and without defects enables the assembly of ratiometric sensors with opposing responses at different wavelengths.

To some, it is intuitively reasonable that relaxation to truly Brownian motion after passing an activation barrier can be slow, but to others the notion is so intuitively unphysical that they suspect the supporting experiments to be artifact. Here we study a chemical reaction according to whose mechanism some intermediate species should speed up while others slow down in predictable ways, if the boosted diffusion interpretation holds. Experimental artifacts would do not know organic chemistry mechanism, however. Accordingly, we scrutinize the absolute diffusion coefficient (D) during intermediate stages of the CuAAC reaction (coppercatalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction), using proton pulsed field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) to discriminate between the diffusion of various reaction intermediates. For the azide reactant, its D increases during reaction, peaks at the same time as peak reaction rate, then returns to its initial value. For the alkyne reagent, its D decreases consistent with presence of the intermediate large complexes formed from copper catalyst and its ligand, except for the 2Cu-alk complex whose more rapid D may signify that this species is the real reactive complex. For the product of this reaction, its D increases slowly as it detaches from the triazolide catalyst complex. These examples of enhanced diffusion for some molecular species and depressed diffusion for others causes us to conclude that diffusion coefficients during these elementary reactions are influenced by two components: hydrodynamic radius increase from complex formation, which slows diffusion, and energy release rate during the chemical reaction, which speeds it up. We discuss possible mechanisms and highlight that too little is yet understood about slow solvent reorganization during chemical reactions.<br />", "date": "2021-06-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Kinetics; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The compound 1 is characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, 1H, and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray crystallographic techniques. At room temperature, 1 emits luminescence light of wavelength 460 nm in the solid state upon excitation by UV light of wavelength 280 nm. The average emission lifetime indicates that, both the ligand and complex emission is fluorescence in nature and involves mainly ligand centers \u03c0-\u03c0* deexcitation. It also shows good catalytic activity towards Mizoroki-Heck and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl bromides with tert-butyl acrylate and p-tolylboronic acid respectively. For both type of reactions, more than 99% conversion of the substrates is found to occur for electronically activated p-nitro bromobenzene using 1 mol % of 1. Further, modern DFT calculations are performed to decipher the mechanistic insight on the preferable pathways of the Mizoroki-Heck cross-coupling reaction. Stepwise free energy of reactions for various probable reaction pathways suggest that the catalytic route has profound preference for Pd(0)-Pd(II) over Pd(II)-Pd(IV) pathway.<br />", "date": "2021-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Organometallic Compounds; Homogeneous Catalysis; Catalysis; Coordination Chemistry (Organomet.); Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report a protocol for performing machine learning assisted free energy simulation of solution-phase and enzyme reactions at an ab initio quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) level of accuracy. Within our protocol, the MLP is built to reproduce the ai-QM/MM energy as well as forces on both QM (reactive) and MM (solvent/enzyme) atoms. As an alternative strategy, a delta machine learning potential (DMLP) is trained to reproduce the differences between ai-QM/MM and semiempirical (se) QM/MM energy and forces. To account for the effect of the condensed\u2013phase environment in both MLP and DMLP, the DeePMD representation of a molecular system is extended to incorporate external electrostatic potential and field on each QM atom. Using the Menshutkin and chorismate mutase reactions as examples, we show that the developed MLP and DMLP reproduce the ai-QM/MM energy and forces with an error on average less than 1.0 kcal/mol and 1.0 kcal/mol/\u00c5 for representative configurations along the reaction pathway. For both reactions, MLP/DMLP-based simulations yielded free energy profiles that differed by less than 1.0 kcal/mol from the reference ai-QM/MM results, but only at a fractional computational cost.<br />", "date": "2021-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As such, these lipids are often a key part of molecular dynamics simulation studies of biological membranes, in particular of those employing coarse-grain models because of the potential long times and sizes of the involved membrane processes. Version 3 of the widely used Martini coarse grain force field has been recently published, greatly refining many aspects of biomolecular interactions. In order to properly use it for lipid membrane simulations with phosphoinositides, we put forth the Martini 3-specific parameterization of inositol, phosphatidylinositol, the seven physiologically relevant phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol. Compared to parameterizations for earlier Martini versions, focus was put on a more accurate reproduction of the behavior seen in both atomistic simulations and experimental studies, including the signaling relevant phosphoinositide interaction with divalent cations.

Direct tuning of the microstructure and morphology of the CL is non-trivial; hence catalyst inks as CL precursors need to be modulated, which are then applied onto a membrane to form the CCM. Obtaining favorable dispersion characteristics forms an important prerequisite in engineering catalyst inks for large scale manufacturing. In order to facilitate a knowledge-based approach for developing fuel cell inks, this work introduces new tools and methods to study both the dispersion state and stability characteristics, simultaneously. Catalyst inks were prepared using different processing methods, which include stirring and ultrasonication. The proposed tools are used to characterize and elucidate the effects of the processing method. Structural characterization of the dispersed particles and their assemblages was carried out by means of transmission electron microscopy. Analytical centrifugation (AC) was used to study the state and stability of the inks. Herein, we introduce new concepts, S score, and stability trajectory, for a time-resolved assessment of inks in their native state using AC. The findings were validated and rationalized using transmittograms as a direct visualization technique. The flowability of inks was investigated by rheological measurements.

Lithium metal anodes are an important step in the development of high energy density batteries owing to the high theoretical specific capacity of lithium metal. However, most lithium metal battery research has used a conventional lithium-ion formation protocol; this is time consuming, costly and does not account for the different properties of the lithium metal electrode. Here, we have used a recently reported promising phosphonium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ionic liquid electrolyte coupled with an NMC622 high areal capacity cathode (>3.5 mAh/cm2) to investigate the effect of cell formation rates. A faster formation protocol comprised of a pulsed 1.25C current decreased the formation time by 56 % and gave a 38 % greater capacity retention after 50 cycles when compared to formation at C/20. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that the fast formation gave rise to a lower-resistance SEI. Column-like lithium deposits with reduced porous lithium domains between the particles were observed using scanning electron microscope imaging. To underline the excellent performance of these high energy-density cells, a 56 % greater stack specific energy was achieved compared to the analogous graphite-based lithium-ion cell chemistries. </p>", "date": "2021-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate nature and strength of the interaction between NPs and hydrophobic environments. Specifically, NPs were simulated with different hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used to mimic surface and confinement effects of hydrophobic building blocks occurring in a soil environment. The hydrophobicity of CNTs was modified by introducing different hydrophobic and hydrophilic functional groups at their inner surfaces. The results show that hydrophobic polymers have a strong affinity to adsorb at the outer surface and to be captured inside the CNT. The accumulation within the CNT is even increased in presence of hydrophobic functional groups. This contribution is a first step towards a mechanistic understanding of a variety of processes connected to interaction of nanoscale material with environmental systems. Regarding the fate of NPs in soil, the results point to the critical role of the hydrophobicity of NPs and soil organic matter (SOM) as well as of the chemical nature of functionalized SOM cavities/voids in controlling the accumulation of NPs in soil. Moreover, the results can be related to water treatment technologies as it is shown that the hydrophobicity of CNTs and functionalization of their surfaces may play a crucial role in enhancing the adsorption capacity of CNTs with respect to organic compounds and thus their removal efficiency from wastewater.</p><p><br /></p></div></div></div>", "date": "2021-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Environmental Science; Soil Science; Wastes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We demonstrate that various convolutional neural networks can be trained and used as droplet detectors in a wide variety of microfluidic systems.

The solid\u2013electrolyte interphase (SEI), critical to the operation of Li-ion batteries (LIB), exemplifies such a surface film and despite decades of work, considerable controversy remains regarding the major components of the SEI as well as their formation mechanisms. In this work, we present pioneering results of a newly developed data-driven reaction network addressing the recent question whether lithium ethylene monocarbonate (LEMC) or lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) is the major organic component of the LIB SEI. Our data-driven, automated methodology is based on a systematic generation of relevant species using a general fragmentation/recombination procedure which provides the basis for our vast thermodynamic reaction landscape, calculated with density functional theory (DFT). The graph implementation of the reaction landscape is subsequently explored using shortest pathfinding algorithms, identifying reactions to LEMC from EC, Li+ and H2O under the electron chemical potential of Li metal. Confirming the viability of our approach, the reaction network automatically recovers previously-proposed formation mechanisms of LEMC from EC and LEDC through hydrolysis, among which the direct hydrolysis of EC under basic conditions is found to be the most kinetically favorable. We also identify several other new reaction pathways to LEMC, illustrating the complex and competitive landscape of possible electrochemical electrolyte decomposition reactions. For example, we recover a LEMC formation mechanism that generates lithium hydride as a by-product and a radical mechanism through breaking the (CH2)O\u2013C(\u2013O)OLi bond in LEDC, neither of which has been proposed previously. Most importantly, we find that all identified paths, which are also kinetically favorable under the explored conditions, require water as a reactant. This condition severely limits the amount of LEMC that can form, as compared to LEDC, a conclusion that has direct impact on our understanding of SEI formation in Li-ion energy storage systems. Finally, we emphasize that our framework demonstrates robust, automated, data-driven predictions of novel interfacial reaction mechanisms and this framework is generally applicable to other reactive systems.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2021-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we evaluate the transferability of the CHARMM36m (C36m) protein force field at varied pressures compared with NMR data using ubiquitin as a model protein. The pressure dependences of J couplings for hydrogen bonds and order parameters for internal motion are in good agreement with experiment. We demonstrate that the C36m FF combined with the LJ-PME method is suitable for simulations in a wide range of temperature and pressure. As the ubiquitin remains stable up to 2500 bar, we identify the mobility and stability of different hydrogen bonds in response to pressure.

Multiensemble Markov Model (MEMM) estimators can provide estimates of both binding rates and affinities from collections of short trajectories, but have not been systematically explored for situations when a ligand is decoupled through scaling of non-bonded interactions. In this work, we compare the performance of two MEMM approaches for estimating ligand binding affinities and rates: (1) the transition-based reweighting analysis method (TRAM) and (2) a Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) based method.  As a test system, we construct a small host-guest system where the ligand is a single uncharged Lennard-Jones (LJ) particle, and the receptor is an 11-particle icosahedral pocket made from the same atom type.  To realistically mimic a protein-ligand binding system, the LJ \u03b5 parameter was tuned, and the system placed in a periodic box with 860 TIP3P water molecules. A benchmark was performed using over 80 \u03bcs of unbiased simulation, and an 18-state Markov state model used to estimate reference binding affinities and rates.   We then tested the performance of TRAM and MaxCal when challenged with limited data. Both TRAM and MaxCal approaches perform better than conventional MSMs, with TRAM showing better convergence and accuracy.  We find that subsampling of trajectories to remove time correlation improves the accuracy of both TRAM and MaxCal, and that in most cases only a single biased ensemble to enhance sampled transitions is required to make accurate estimates.", "date": "2021-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For systems that show strong polarization effects such as water clusters, this can render the energy-based many-body expansion infeasible. Here, we establish a density-based many-body expansion as a promising alternative approach. By performing the many-body expansion for the electron density instead of the total energy and inserting the resulting total electron density into the total energy functional of density-functional theory, one can derive a density-based energy correction, which in principle accounts for all higher order polarization effects. Here, we systematically assess the accuracy of such a density-based many-body expansion for test sets of water clusters.

The biosensor offers a rapid -less than 15 min- identification and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directly in clinical samples, without the need of any signal amplification. The portable plasmonic biosensor device employs a custom-designed multi-antigen sensor biochip, combining the two main viral antigens (RBD peptide and N protein), for simultaneous detection of human antibodies targeting both antigens. The SPR serology assay reaches detection limits in the low ng mL-1 range employing polyclonal antibodies as standard, which are well below the commonly detected antibody levels in COVID-19 patients. The assay has also been implemented employing the first WHO approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin standard. We have carried out a clinical validation with COVID-19 positive and negative samples (n=120) that demonstrates the excellent diagnostic sensitivity (99%) and specificity (100%). This positions our biosensor device as an accurate, robust, and easy-to-use diagnostics tool for rapid and reliable COVID-19 serology to be employed both at laboratory and decentralized settings for the management of COVID-19 patients and for the evaluation of immunological status during vaccination, treatment or in front of emerging variants.<br />", "date": "2021-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices; Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Therefore, computational methods have been developed to predict kinetic rates and to derive quantitative structure-kinetic relationships (QSKRs).

Thus, understanding the effect of phase transition on the thermal transport in SPCs becomes extremely crucial, because the latent heat generated in aforementioned applications is needed to be effectively removed. In this paper, taking the isorecticular DUT series as an example, the thermal transport property of SPCs during the phase transition from the large pore (lp) phase to the narrow pore (np) phase is comprehensively investigated by molecular dynamics simulations together with the Green-Kubo method. According to our calculations, all DUT structures exhibit an ultralow thermal conductivity smaller than 0.2 Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, we find that the effect of phase transition on the thermal transport property of different DUT materials considered here strongly depends on their porosity. As for DUT-48, its lp phase has a thermal conductivity larger than that of its np phase. However, in other DUT materials, i.e, DUT-47, DUT-49, DUT-50, and DUT-151 the thermal transport property of their lp phase is found to be weaker than that of their np phase. This complicated effect of phase transition on the thermal transport in SPCs can be explained by a porosity-dominated competition mechanism between the increased volumetric heat capacity and the aggravated phonon scattering during the phase transition process.</p><p></p>", "date": "2021-06-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This as-prepared catalysts were fabricated via one-pot pyrolysis by using mixture of citrate acid and cobalt acetate as C source and Co source, respectively. First of all, structural features of catalyst were characterized by a series of analytic techniques involving XPS, SEM/EDS, TEM as well as elemental mapping, to reveal its unique properties in relation to the catalytic mechanisms; in simple terms, the outer graphitic shell could be activated by the electronic interaction between the inner metallic nanoparticles and the outer graphene layer.

We performed untargeted metabolomics on plasma from 152 adolescent girls participating in the Growing Up Healthy Study in New York City, using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We then performed network analysis to link metabolites to environmental biomarkers including five trace elements (Cd, Mn, Pb, Se, and Hg) and five perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs; n-PFOS, Sm-PFOS, n-PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA) previously measured in the same samples. We defined any metabolite associated with at least one environmental biomarker and correlated with at least one other metabolite (Spearman rho > 0.9) as a \u2018molecular gatekeeper\u2019. Associations of gatekeepers with health outcomes (e.g., body mass index, age at menarche) were tested with linear models. After removing redundant peaks, 964 (positive mode) and 1784 (negative mode) metabolite features were used for network analysis. Of 95 and 138 metabolites, respectively, associated with at least one exposure, 28 and 43 were molecular gatekeepers. Further, lysophosphatidylcholine(16:0) and taurodeoxycholate were correlated with both n-PFOA and n-PFOS, suggesting a shared dysregulation from multiple xenobiotic exposures. One annotated gatekeeper, sphingomyelin(d18:2/14:0), was significantly associated with age at menarche; yet, no direct association was detected between any exposure biomarkers and age at menarche.

Spectroscopic detection and characterization of these reactive carbene radical intermediates has thus far been limited to a few scattered experiments, in part due to the fact that most studies have focused on mono-substituted carbene precursors. In this work, we demonstrate the unique formation of disubstituted cobalt(III)-carbene radicals in reactions between a cobalt(II)-porphyrin com-plex with acceptor-acceptor iodaneylidenes (iodonium ylides) as the carbene precursors. We report detailed spectroscopic characterization of the resulting reactive carbene radical species, and their application in styrene cyclopropanation. In particular, we demonstrate that iodonium ylides generate novel bis-carbenoid species leading to reversible substrate-promoted ligand modification of the commercially available [Co(TPP)]-catalyst. Two interconnected catalytic cycles are involved in the overall catalytic reaction with a mono-terminal carbene radical and an unprecedented N-enolate-carbene radical intermediate as the respective key species for the mono- and bis-carbene cycles. Notably, N-enolate formation is not a catalyst deactivation pathway, and both the N-enolate and the carbene radical moieties can be transferred as carbene units to styrene. The studies provide a detailed picture of the new [Co(TPP)]-catalyzed carbene transfer reactions from iodonium ylides. The findings are supported by detailed and unequivocal characterization of the reactive N-enolate & carbene radical intermediates and their deactivation products (EPR, UV-Vis, HR-MS, NMR, in-situ ATR-FT-IR, SC-XRD), Hammett analysis, mechanistic control experiments, DFT reaction pathway profiling and NEVPT2-CASSCF electronic structure calculations.<br />", "date": "2021-06-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The potential impact of deamidation on the structure and dynamics of Bcl-xL is directly\nlinked to the intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is the main site for post-translational\nmodifications (PTMs). In this study, we explored deamidation-induced conformational changes in Bcl-\nxL to gain insight into its loss of function by performing microsecond-long molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. MD simulation outcomes showed that the IDR motion and interaction patterns have\nchanged notably upon deamidation. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates significant\ndifferences between wild type and deamidated Bcl-xL and suggests that deamidation affects the\nstructure and dynamics of Bcl-xL. Differences in contact patterns and essential dynamics in the\nbinding groove (BG) are clear indications of deamidation-induced allosteric affects.\n", "date": "2021-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The ability to directly analyze viral particles in real time is essential to understand their pathological functions. In this work, we developed a strategy for fluorogenic labeling of live viruses by using an optimal tetrazolate-functionalized AIEgen (Aggregation-induced emission luminogen), named PBET. Due to its AIE activities, this dye fluoresces weakly when dissolved in aqueous solution, thus providing dark fluorescence background. The fluorescence turn-on labeling is achieved by binding of PBET molecules into the outmost viral proteins (e.g., structural Capsid protein VP1), which triggers protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) of PBET. Probably due to this PIFE/AIE-based sensing strategy, these PBET-labeled viruses can retain infectivity to a large extent, which is a great advantage for biologically friendly labeling. This fluorogenic labeling may find uses in imaging studies to combat virus-associated infectious diseases, especially those associated with previously unknown wild-type viruses.", "date": "2021-06-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the relatively low capacities of glass anodes severely limit their practical application for large energy storage devices. Here we show an unconventional novel approach, which significantly enhances the electrochemical performances of glass anodes for LIBs. Specifically, we incorporated water into an electrochemically active glass system, i.e., TeO2-V2O5-P2O5 (TVP) glass powder via humidity treatment, and then mix the hydrated powder with additives to fabricate anode. The optimized humidity treatment led to the structural modification of the TVP glass powder, which boosted the capacity of the TVP anode by more than 200%, and maintained the reversible capacity for extra-long cycles. The boosted performances are associated both with the depolymerized structural network for Li+ diffusion and with the hydration-induced nanocrystals.

Efficient emission, however, requires maintaining a good oscillator strength, which is itself based on sufficient overlap of the wavefunctions between donor and acceptor moieties. We demonstrate an approach to subtly fine-tune the required wavefunction overlap by employing donor-dendrons of changing functionality. We use a carbazolyl-phthalonitrile based donor-acceptor core, 2CzPN, as a reference emitter, and progressively localize the hole density through substitution at the 3,6-positions of the carbazole donors (Cz) with further carbazole, (4-tert-butylphenyl)amine (tBuDPA) and phenoxazine (PXZ). Using detailed photoluminescence studies, complemented with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we show that this approach permits a gradual decrease of the singlet-triplet gap, \u0394EST, from 300 meV to around 10 meV in toluene, yet we also demonstrate why a small \u0394EST alone is not enough. While sufficient oscillator strength is maintained with the Cz- and tBuDPA-based donor dendrons, this is not the case for the PXZ-based donor dendron, where the wavefunction overlap is reduced too strongly. Overall, we find the donor-dendron extension approach allows successful fine-tuning of the emitter photoluminescence properties.", "date": "2021-06-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

A combination of Ni K edge and L edge XAS with supporting TD-DFT/DFT calculations reveals an unconventional covalent agostic interaction with limited contributions from the valence Ni 3d orbitals. The agostic interaction is driven via the empty Ni 4p orbitals. The surprisingly strong Ni 4p-derived agostic interaction is dominated by \u03c3 contributions with minor \u03c0 contributions. The resulting ligand-metal donation occurs directly along the C-Ni bond axis, reflecting a novel mode of bis- agostic bonding.", "date": "2021-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bonding; Spectroscopy (Organomet.); Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this work, Al2O3-coated Ni/SiO2 catalysts have been developed by employing atomic layer deposition (ALD). The structure of the catalyst at each individual preparation step was characterized in detail through a combination of in situ XAS-XRD, ex situ 27Al NMR and Raman spectroscopy. Specifically, in the calcination step, the ALD-grown Al2O3 layer reacts with the SiO2 support and Ni, forming aluminosilicate and NiAl2O4. The Al2O3-coated Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits an improved stability for DRM when compared to the benchmark Ni/SiO2 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. In situ XAS-XRD during DRM together with ex situ Raman spectroscopy and TEM of the spent catalysts confirm that the ALD-grown Al2O3 layer suppresses the sintering of Ni, in turn reducing also coke formation significantly. In addition, the formation of an amorphous aluminosilicate phase by the reaction of the ALD-grown Al2O3 layer with the SiO2 support inhibited catalysts deactivation via NiAl2O4 formation, in contrast to the reference Ni/Al2O3 system. The in-depth structural characterization of the catalysts provided an insight into the structural dynamics of the ALD-grown Al2O3 layer, which reacts both with the support and the active metal, allowing to rationalize the high stability of the catalyst under the harsh DRM conditions.

We present here a computer simulation study, based on quantum mechanical calculations, of the incorporation of bromine as BrO3- oxyanions in CaCO3 polymorphs calcite and aragonite. We discuss how the relative distribution of bromate anions and charge-compensating alkali-metal cations is determined by the interplay between an impurity binding effect (which is stronger for aragonite than for calcite, and changes in the order Li<Na<K) and a configurational entropic effect that tends to disassociate the impurities.

Bromate substitution, compensated by sodium or potassium cations, is predicted to be metastable with respect to phase separation of the impurities as solid NaBrO3 or KBrO3 phases, respectively, but the solubility limits of BrO3- in calcite and aragonite are still higher than those calculated for tetrahedral oxyanions (SO4)2- and (MoO4)2- that are used as alternative volcanic records in speleothems.

While cationic tetrylium Lewis acids, being isolobal and iso(valence)electronic, are a natural replacement to boranes, neutral tetrel Lewis acids allude as less trivial options due to the absence of a formally empty p orbital on the acceptor centre. Recently a series of intramolecular geminal FLPs (C2F5)3E-CH2-P(tBu)2 (E= Si, Ge, Sn) featuring neutral tetrel atoms as acceptor site, were reported for activation of small molecules including H2. In this work, through density functional theory computations, we elucidate the general mechanistic picture of H2 activation by this family of FLPs. Our findings reveal that the acceptor atom derives the required Lewis acidity utilizing the antibonding orbitals of its adjacent bonds with the individual contributions depending on the identity of the acceptor and the donor atoms. By varying the identity of the Lewis acid and Lewis base atoms and attached substituents, we unravel their interplay on the energetics of the H2 activation. We find that switching the donor site from P to N significantly affects the synchronous nature of the bond breaking/formations along the reaction pathway and as a result, N-bearing FLPs have a more favourable H2 activation profile than those with P. Our results are quantitatively discussed in detail within the framework of Activation Strain Model of reactivity along with the Energy Decomposition Analysis method. Finally, the reductive elimination decomposition route pertinent to the plausible extension of the H2 activation to catalytic hydrogenation by these FLPs is also examined", "date": "2021-06-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With the advent of the field of lanthanide dependent bacterial metabolism, bio-inspired applications are in reach. Here, we utilize the natural lanthanide chelator Lanmodulin and the luminescent probes Eu3+ and Cm3+ to investigate the inter-metal competition behavior of all lanthanides (except Pm) and four actinides (Np, Pu, Am, Cm) to Lanmodulin. Using time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy we show that Lanmodulin has the highest relative binding affinity to Nd3+ and Eu3+ among the lanthanide series. When equimolar mixtures of Cm3+ and Am3+ are added to Lanmodulin, Lanmodulin preferentially binds to Am3+ over Cm3+ whilst Nd3+ and Cm3+ bind with similar relative affinity. The results presented show that a natural lanthanide binding protein can bind various actinides with high relative affinity, paving the way to bio inspired separation applications.

However, significant questions remain regarding the influences of biological activity and seawater chemistry on the flux, chemical composition, and climate-relevant properties of marine aerosols and gases. Wave channels, a traditional tool of physical oceanography, have been adapted for large-scale ocean-atmosphere mesocosm experiments in the laboratory. These experiments enable the study of aerosols under controlled conditions which isolate the marine system from atmospheric anthropogenic and terrestrial influences. Here, we present an overview of the 2019 Sea Spray Chemistry and Particle Evolution (SeaSCAPE) study, which was conducted in an 11,800 L wave channel which was modified to facilitate atmospheric measurements. The SeaSCAPE campaign sought to determine the influence of biological activity in seawater on the production of primary sea spray aerosols, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and secondary marine aerosols. Notably, the SeaSCAPE experiment also focused on understanding how photooxidative aging processes transform the composition of marine aerosols. In addition to a broad range of aerosol, gas, and seawater measurements, we present key results which highlight the experimental capabilities during the campaign, including the phytoplankton bloom dynamics, VOC production, and the effects of photochemical aging on aerosol production, morphology, and chemical composition. Additionally, we discuss the modifications made to the wave channel to improve aerosol production and reduce background contamination, as well as subsequent characterization experiments. The SeaSCAPE experiment provides unique insight into the connections between marine biology, atmospheric chemistry, and climate-relevant aerosol properties, and demonstrates how an ocean-atmosphere-interaction facility can be used to isolate and study reactions in the marine atmosphere in the laboratory under more controlled conditions.

Recently, the Arnold group achieved this feat using an engineered CYP411 enzyme, which further undergoes a random directed evolution which increases its efficiency and selectivity. The present study provides the mechanistic insight and the root cause of the success of these mutations to enhance the reactivity and selectivity of the mutant enzyme. This is achieved by means of comprehensive MD simulations and hybrid QM/MM calculations. The study shows that the efficient C-H amination by the so-engineered CYP411 is a combined outcome of electronic and steric effects. The mutation of axial cysteine ligand to serine relays electron density to the Fe ion in the heme, and thereby enhances the bonding capability of the heme-iron to the nitrogen atom of the tosyl azide. By comparison, the native cysteine-ligated P450, cannot bind the tosyl azide.

Among the peroxygenases, P450 OleT uniquely performs decarboxylation of fatty acids and production of terminal olefins. This root taken by P450 OleT is intriguing, and its importance is augmented by the practical importance of olefin production. As such, this mechanistic choice merits elucidation. To address this puzzle we use hybrid QM/MM calculations and MD  simulations for the OleT enzyme as well as for the structurally analogous enzyme, P450 BS\u03b2 . The study of P450 OleT reveals that the protonated His85 in the wild-type P450 OleT , plays a crucial role in steering decarboxylation activity by stabilizing the corresponding hydroxoiron(IV) intermediate (Cpd II). In contrast, for P450 BS\u03b2 in which Q85 replaces H85, the respective Cpd II species is unstable and it reacts readily with the substrate radical by rebound, producing hydroxylation products. As we show, this single-site difference creates in P450 OleT a local electric field (LEF), which is significantly higher than that in P450 BS\u03b2 . In turn, these LEF differences are responsible for the different stabilities of the respective Cpd II/radical intermediates, and hence for different functions of the two enzymes. P450 BS\u03b2 uses the common rebound mechanism and leads to hydroxylation, whereas P450 OleT proceeds via decarboxylation and generates terminal olefins. Olefin production projects the power of a single residue to alter the LEF and the enzyme\u2019s function!", "date": "2021-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biocatalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Many factors combine to influence the overall efficiency of TTA-UC, the most fundamental of which is the spin statistical factor, \u03b7, that gives the probability that a bright singlet state is formed from a pair of annihilating triplet states. Using solid rubrene as a model system, we reiterate why experimentally measured magnetic field effects prove that annihilating triplets first form weakly exchange-coupled triplet-pair states. This is contrary to conventional discussions of TTA-UC that implicitly assume strong exchange coupling and we show that it has profound implications for the spin statistical factor \u03b7. For example, variations in intermolecular orientation tune \u03b7 from 2/5 to 2/3 through spin mixing of the triplet-pair wavefunctions. Since the fate of spin-1 triplet-pair states is particularly crucial in determining \u03b7, we investigate it in rubrene using pump-push-probe spectroscopy and find additional evidence for the recently reported high-level reverse intersystem crossing channel. We incorporate all of these factors into an updated model framework in which to understand the spin statistics of TTA-UC, and use it to rationalise the differences in reported values of \u03b7 amongst different common annihilator systems.

In this work, we developed polarizable force fields for redox-active species anthraquinone (AQ) and 2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in their oxidized and reduced states, as well as for acetonitrile. We validate structural properties of AQ, AQ$^{\\bullet-}$, AQ$^{2-}$, TEMPO$^{\\bullet}$ and TEMPO$^{+}$ in acetonitrile against density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations and we study the solvation of these redox molecules in acetonitrile. This work is a first step toward the characterization of the role played by AQ and TEMPO in electrochemical and catalytic devices.", "date": "2021-06-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this paper, we develop a method that enables us to compute the helical curvature of MOs based on their nodal planes.

The role of SSA in ice nucleation extends to cirrus clouds, due to processes that loft SSA to the upper troposphere. This is of special relevance because of the frequent occurrence of cirrus in the atmosphere, their role in the Earth\u2019s radiative balance, and uncertainties regarding how aerosols may affect their formation and evolution. In this study, a continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) is used to investigate the ice nucleating ability of size-selected particle distributions of SSA and its primary constituent sodium chloride (NaCl) at temperatures < 235 K. Results show that above ~220 K, the majority of SSA and NaCl particles fully deliquesce and freeze via homogeneous nucleation at or below water relative humidities, RHw, of ~ 95%. However, below 220 K, the onset RHw of freezing for NaCl and SSA is much lower, at ~75%, where strong heterogeneous freezing of 10% of the aerosol population occurs. Similar heterogeneous freezing behavior for NaCl and SSA aerosols, occurring near their predicted deliquescence RHw, points towards SSA freezing at the lowest temperatures being controlled by the crystalline salts. Finally, calculations of ice nucleation active surface site densities show that particle size does not dictate the efficiency of freezing for NaCl and SSA. These results indicate SSA as a potentially significant source of ice nucleating particles at cirrus temperatures, with the ability to contribute to cirrus-mediated climate impacts if sea spray emission and transport scenarios change in the future.", "date": "2021-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

De novo design was carried out on an existing fragment series that exhibited moderate sub-micromolar activity against FGFRs 1\u20133. Subsequent synthesis, biological evaluation, and iterative rounds of SBDD led to an inhibitor with nM potency that exhibited moderate selectivity for FGFR2 over FGFR1/3.

The functionality of biological iron-sulfur clusters extends beyond simple electron transfer, relying primarily on the redox activity of the clusters, with a remarkable diversity for different enzymes. The active site structure and the electrostatic environment in which the cluster resides direct this redox reactivity. Orientated electric fields in enzymatic active sites can be significantly strong and to understand the extent of their effect on iron-sulfur cluster reactivity can inform first steps towards rationally engineering their reactivity. An extensive systematic density functional theory based screening approach using OPBE/TZP has afforded a simple electric field effect representation. The results demonstrate that the orientation of an external electric field of strength 0.288 MV cm-1 at the centre of the cluster can have a significant effect on its relative stability in the order of 35 kJ mol\u02d71. This shows clear implications for the reactivity of iron-sulfur clusters in enzymes. The results also demonstrate that the orientation of the electric field can alter the most stable broken symmetry state, which further has implications on the directionality of initiated electron transfer reactions.

This approach is inherently subjective and not ideal when rapid assessment of several samples is necessary.

Finally, we also described the influence of electronic and steric of different molecular fragments/groups on the stabilities of the carbamates.\n", "date": "2021-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

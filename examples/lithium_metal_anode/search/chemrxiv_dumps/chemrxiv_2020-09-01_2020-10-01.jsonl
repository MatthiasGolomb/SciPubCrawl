The ongoing pandemic of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus\nis affecting global health. Despite the recent success in vaccination on a trial basis, there is no treatment\nof the infection. Thus, establishing an effective therapeutic measure is of apex priority among biologists\nand healthcare professionals. Re-purposing Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that inhibits\nviral RNA polymerase, has been found effective for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study,\nmodification of the existing drug Remdesivir was done. In logical drug designing and development,\nmolecular recognition plays a central role in this sphere. The anti viral function of Remdesivir is achieved\nby binding to RNA polymerase enzyme. The protein 7BTF is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that\nplays a crucial role in coronavirus replication and transcription machinery and it appears to be the primary\ntarget of the antiviral drug Remdesivir. The study intend to design derivative compounds form\nRemdesivir to screen out the a better drug against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by inhibiting the targeted\nprotein. The efficacy of these new drugs was also tested by molecular docking calculations. The drug\nderivatives were docked for binding affinity and non-bond interactions. Pharmacokinetic activities of the\ndesigned drugs are also predicted. All the drugs are non-carcinogenic and chemically reactive. In our\nstudy, modified compound D-I has exhibited the best performance among Remdesivir and it\u2019s\nderivatives.

This approach requires that all the considered geometries have the same molecular orbitals within the active space. However, the different geometrical features and/or the different influence of the solvent or biological environments along the sample geometries makes the preservation of the active space a challenging task, which is usually ignored. In this work, we present an algorithm to correct for the active space of geometry ensembles in CASSCF calculations. The algorithm is based on the calculation of the molecular orbital overlap matrix between a previously selected reference geometry, with the desired active space, and each of the sampled geometries. Depending on the value of the overlap matrix elements, the algorithm determines whether one or more pairs of molecular orbitals of the sampled geometry have to be swapped for a subsequent CASSCF calculation. We have applied the developed algorithm to quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics CASSCF/MM and CASPT2/MM calculations for sets of geometries of the five canonical nucleobases in aqueous solution obtained from classical molecular dynamics simulations. The algorithm shows a very good efficacy since it recovered the correct active space for 76\\% of the geometries which presented undesired molecular orbitals in the active space after the first CASSCF wavefunction optimization. In addition, the importance of having the same orbitals within the active space for all the geometries is discussed based on the computed density of states for the solvated nucleobases.", "date": "2020-09-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Since non-proline amino acids weaken the triple helix, the cyclic structure of proline has been considered necessary, and functional collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) with diverse sidechains have been difficult to produce. Here we show that N-substituted glycines (N-glys), also known as peptoid residues, exhibit a general triple-helical propensity similar to or greater than proline, allowing synthesis of thermally stable triple-helical CMPs with unprecedented sidechain diversity. We found that the N-glys stabilize the triple helix by sterically promoting the preorganization of individual CMP chains into the polyproline-II helix conformation. Our findings were supported by the crystal structures of two atomic-resolution N-gly-containing CMPs, as well as experimental and computational studies spanning more than 30 N-gly-containing peptides. We demonstrated that N-gly sidechains with diverse exotic moieties including a \u2018click\u2019-able alkyne and a photo-sensitive sidechain can be incorporated into stable triple helices, enabling functional applications such spatio-temporal control of cell adhesion and migration on a gelatin matrix.

This is also the true for halide perovskites, in the hope of further enhancing their stabilities and reducing the toxicities in lead-containing compounds. Replacement of lead with tin, even partially, is a route to achieve the latter goal. However, this has to be compromised with reduction in band gaps as well as structural stabilities. High-throughput statistical samplings over different configurations for random solid solutions have played pivotal roles in guiding the chemical designs of halide perovskite with better stabilities while retaining high photovoltaic efficiencies, but it remains challenging to intuitively and comprehensively understand the intriguing energy-structure-property (ESP) relationships in solid solutions encompassing multiple degrees-of-freedoms. In this work, first--principle dynamic and electronic structure calculations are performed across 51 different compositions of  Cs(Pb$_{x}$Sn$_{1-x}$)X$_{3}$ (X=Cl, Br and I), to systematically reveal the compositional and temperature dependent stabilities, vibrational anharmonicities and band gaps in solid solutions of  halide perovskites. This is enabled, in particular, by applying a recently proposed `anharmonicity score' that provides a single numerical metric to characterise the structural dynamics in a multi-atomic system. Further combination with unsupervised machine-learning enable us to produce an ESP map to visually correlate the anharmonicity score with structural distortions and energies. However, temperature-dependent variations in band gap energies, which strongly depend on orbital interactions in metal-halide octrahedra, do not necessarily follow the same trend as anharmonicity scores. This work represents our latest developments in applying data--driven approach to establish ESP relationships for guiding the future designs of functional perovskites.", "date": "2020-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we show that in nanoporous carbons electrochemical oxidation of iodide forms persistent solid iodine deposits.

Here, we experimentally studied the motion of a model system of gold nanoparticles dispersed in water and moving adjacent to the silicon nitride membrane of a commercial liquid cell in a broad range of electron beam dose rates. We find that the nanoparticles exhibit anomalous diffusive behavior modulated by the electron beam dose rate. We characterized the anomalous diffusion of nanoparticles in LCTEM using a convolutional deep neural network model and canonical statistical tests. The results demonstrate that the nanoparticle motion is governed by fractional Brownian motion at low dose rates, resembling diffusion in a viscoelastic medium, and continuous time random walk at high dose rates, resembling diffusion on an energy landscape with pinning sites.

We propose and validate a hybrid scheme that combines the adsorption free energies obtained in gas phase at the DFT level with the variation in solvation from the bulk phase to the interface evaluated using a molecular mechanics based alchemical transformation, denoted MMsolv. Using the GAL17 force field for the platinum/water interaction, we retrieve a qualitatively correct interaction energy of the water solvent at the interface. This interaction is of near chemisorption character and thus challenging, both  for the alchemical transformation, but also for the fixed point-charge electrostatics. Our scheme passes through a state characterized by a well-behaved physisorption potential for the Pt(111)/H<sub>2</sub>O interaction to converge the free energy difference. The workflow is implemented in the freely available SolvHybrid package. We first assess the adsorption of a water molecule at the Pt/water interface, which turns out to be a stringent test. The intrinsic error of our QM-MM hybrid scheme is limited to 6 kcal/mol through the introduction of a correction term to attenuate the electrostatic interaction between near-chemisorbed water molecules and the underlying Pt atoms. Next, we show that the MMsolv solvation free energy of Pt (-0.46 J/m<sup>2</sup>)  is in good agreement with the experimental estimate (-0.32 J/m<sup>2</sup>). Furthermore, we show that the entropy contribution at room temperature is roughly of equal magnitude as the free energy, but with opposite sign. Finally, we compute the adsorption energy of benzene and phenol at the Pt(111)/water interface, one of the rare systems for which experimental data are available. In qualitative agreement with experiment, but in stark contrast with a standard implicit solvent model, the adsorption of these aromatic molecules is strongly reduced (i.e., less exothermic by ~30 and 40 kcal/mol for our QM/MM hybrid scheme and  experiment, respectively, but ~0  with the implicit solvent) at the solid/liquid compared to the solid/gas interface. This reduction is mainly due to the competition between the organic adsorbate and the solvent for adsorption on the metallic surface. The semi-quantitative agreement with experimental estimates for the adsorption energy of aromatic molecules thus validates the soundness of our hybrid QM-MM scheme.", "date": "2020-09-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Central to the method is the potential energy surface (PES) that can describe the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The development of PES of both accurate and efficent has attracted significant effort in the past two decades. Recently developed Deep Potential (DP) model has the promise to bring ab initio accuracy to large-scale reactive MD simulations. However, for complex chemical reaction processes like pyrolysis, it remains challenging to generate reliable DP models with an optimal training dataset. In this work, a dataset construction scheme for such a purpose was established. The employment of a concurrent learning algorithm allows us to maximize the exploration of the chemical space while minimize the redundancy of the dataset. This greatly reduces the cost of computational resources required by ab initio calculations. Based on this method, we constructed a dataset for the pyrolysis of n-dodecane, which contains 35,496 structures. The reactive MD simulation with the DP model trained based on this dataset revealed the pyrolysis mechanism of n-dodecane in detail, and the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, this dataset shows excellent transferability to different long-chain alkanes.

With the development of advanced simulation techniques and increasing computing power, large amounts of data are being generated from these simulations. Various enhanced sampling techniques are currently being used, that are able to capture rare events and generate simulation data in the form of multiple trajectories. Analyzing the simulation trajectory data and extracting meaningful information using the traditional sequential post-simulation data analysis methods are becoming increasingly untenable. Currently, molecular dynamics simulation algorithms that are scalable on high-performance computing clusters are available which generate a huge amount of MD data in short span of time. The need of the hour lies in developing a advanced and high-performance analytics platform based tool that can analyze this huge simulation data in a faster and more efficient way. The Hadoop Spark framework, provides an excellent platform that meets these requirements of handling large amounts of data parallely and perform analytics with high scalability. In this study, a tool name H-BAT has been developed using the Hadoop Spark platform to calculate hydrogen bonding within all solute-solute, solute-solvent and solvent-solvent molecules in large MD simulation trajectories. Vector geometry has been used for calculation of angle and distance between the atoms which are present in the form of triplets of filtered atoms taking part in hydrogen bond formation. The benchmarking was performed up to a data size of 48 GB which showed linear scalability. Additionally, the tool is capable of handling multiple similar trajectories simultaneously.

In this paper, we combine solution NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to shed light on the structural and dynamical features of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) in solution, and on their role in pABA crystals nucleation. pABA is known to yield different crystal forms (\u03b1, and \u03b2) depending on solvent choice and su- persaturation conditions. NMR reveals that dominant interactions stabilising pABA oligomers are markedly solvent-dependent: in organic solvents, hydrogen bonds dominate, while water promotes \u03c0 - \u03c0 stacking. Despite this clear preference, both types of interactions contribute to the variety of self-associated species in all solvents considered. MD simulations support this observation and show that pABA oligomers are short-lived and display a fluxional character, therefore indicating that the growth unit involved in pABA crystallisation is likely to be a single molecule. Nevertheless, we note that the interactions dominating in pABA oligomers are indicative of the polymorph obtained from precipitation. In water, at low pABA concen- trations - conditions that are known to yield crystals of the \u03b2 form - carboxylic-carboxylic hydrogen bonds are exclusively asymmetric.

Numerous amino acid sidechains contain functional groups (i.e., hydroxyls in Ser/Thr or Tyr and amides in Asn/Gln) that can act as either HB acceptors or donors (HBA/HBD) and even form simultaneous, ambifunctional HB interactions. To understand the relative energetic benefit of each interaction, we characterize the potential energy surfaces of representative model systems with accurate coupled cluster theory calculations. To reveal the relationship of these energetics to the balance of these interactions in proteins, we curate a set of 4,000 HBs, of which > 500 are ambifunctional HBs, in high-resolution protein structures. We show that our model systems accurately predict the favored HB structural properties.

Herein, a size-selective preparation of Au nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by F-CAC is described. By modifying the conditions of trans-deposition method, established in our group previously, a transfer of Au NPs from poly(<i>N</i>-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP) to F-CAC proceeded up to 96% transfer efficiency with retaining its cluster sizes in EtOH.

A shift of binding energy at Au 4f core level X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) from 82.0 eV to 83.3 eV indicated that the NPs were stabilized on a F-CAC surface rather than by PVP matrix. The reproducible particle size growth was observed when 2-propanol was used as a solvent instead of EtOH, expanding the range of the available particle size with simple manipulation.

Herein, we investigated the influence of QI on spin transport in the molecular junctions containing organic radicals as magnetic centres. The role of the localized spins on the QI as well as on spin filtering capability is investigated employing density functional theory in combination with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF-DFT) techniques. Various organic radicals including nitroxide (NO), phenoxy (PO) and methyl (CH2) radicals attached to the central benzene ring of pentacene with different terminal connections (para and meta) to gold electrodes are examined. Due to more obvious QI effects, para connected pentacene is found to be more conductive than meta one. Surprisingly, on incorporating a radical centre, along with spin filtering, a significant quenching of QI effects is observed which manifests itself in such a way that the conductance of meta coupled radicals is found to be more than para by two orders of magnitude. The decoherence induced by radical centre is analysed and discussed in terms of spin-spin coupling of radical's unpaired electron with the tunneling electrons.<br />", "date": "2020-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Along this line, in this work we propose the interface of the EOM-CCSD method with the recently developed quantum mechanics / extremely localized molecular orbital (QM/ELMO) strategy, an approach where the chemically relevant region of the investigated system is treated at fully quantum chemical level (QM region), while the remaining part (namely, the chemical environment) is described through transferred and frozen extremely localized molecular orbitals (ELMO subsystem). In order to determine capabilities and limitations of the novel EOM-CCSD/ELMO approach, some validation tests were properly designed and carried out. They indicated that the new approach is particularly useful and efficient in describing local electronic transitions in relatively large systems, for both covalently and non-covalently bonded QM and ELMO regions. In particular, it has been shown that, including only a limited number of atoms in the chemically active subunit, the ELMO-embedded computations enable the reproduction of excitation energies and oscillator strengths resulting from full EOM-CCSD calculations within the limit of chemical accuracy, but with a significantly reduced computational cost. Furthermore, despite the approximation of an embedding potential given by frozen extremely localized molecular orbitals, it was observed that the new strategy is able to satisfactorily account for the effects of the environment.", "date": "2020-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The proposed TDDFT/ELMO strategy has been subjected to a series of preliminary tests that were already considered for the validations of other embedding TDDFT methods. The obtained results show that the novel technique allows the accurate description of local excitations in large systems by only including a relatively small group of atoms in the region treated at fully quantum chemical level. Furthermore, it was observed that, even using functionals that do not take into account long-range corrections, the method enables to avoid the presence of artificial low-lying charge-transfer states that may affect traditional TDDFT calculations. Finally, through the application to a reduced model of the Green Fluorescent Protein, it was proved that the TDDFT/ELMO approach can be also successfully exploited to investigate local electronic transitions in large systems and that the accuracy of the results can be improved by including a sufficient number of fragments/residues that are chemically crucial in the quantum mechanical region.

MOF-808, a metal-organic framework based on Zr6 nodes, can hydrolyze peptide bonds efficiently under biologically relevant conditions. However, the details of the catalyst structure and of the underlying catalytic reaction mechanism are challenging to establish.  By means of DFT calculations we first investigate the speciation of the Zr6 nodes and identify the nature of ligands that bind to the Zr6O8H4-x core in aqueous conditions. The core is predicted to strongly prefer a Zr6O8H4 protonation state and to be predominantly decorated by bridging formate ligands, giving Zr6(\u03bc3-O)4(\u03bc3-OH)4(BTC)2(HCOO)6 and Zr6(\u03bc3-O)4(\u03bc3-OH)4(BTC)2(HCOO)5(OH)(H2O) as the most favorable structures at physiological pH.  The GlyGly peptide can bind MOF in several different ways, with the preferred structure involving coordination through the terminal carboxylate analogously to the binding mode of formate ligand. The pre-reactive binding mode in which the amide carbonyl oxygen coordinates the metal core lies 7 kcal higher in free energy. The preferred reaction pathway is predicted to have two close-lying transition states, either of which could be the rate-determining step: nucleophilic attack on the amide carbon atom and C-N bond breaking, with calculated relative free energies of 31 and 32 kcal/mol, respectively. Replacement of formate by water and hydroxide at the Zr6 node is predicted to be possible, but does not appear to play a role in the hydrolysis mechanism.", "date": "2020-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Evaluation of all  candidates experimentally is typically infeasible as it requires great amounts of effort, time, expertise, and money. The ability to predict reaction outcomes without performing extensive experiments is, therefore, important. Towards that goal, we report an approach that uses context-free grammar (CFG) based representations of molecules in a neural machine translation framework. We formulate the reaction-prediction task as a machine translation problem that involves discovering the transformations from the source sequence (comprising the reactants and agents) to the target sequence (comprising the major product) in the reaction. The grammar ontology-based representation of molecules hierarchically incorporates rich molecular structure information that, in principle, should be valuable for modeling chemical reactions. We achieve an accuracy of 80.1% on a standard reaction dataset using a model characterized by only a fraction of the number of training parameters in other sequence-to-sequence models based works in this area. Moreover, 99% of the predictions made on the same reaction dataset were found to be syntactically valid. We conclude that CFGs-based ontological representations could be an efficient way of incorporating structural information, ensuring chemically valid predictions, and overcoming overfitting in complex machine learning architectures employed in reaction prediction tasks.<br /></p>", "date": "2020-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nonetheless, the application of compartmentalization and its quantitative analysis in non-biochemical reactions is seldomly performed, leaving much uncertainty about whether compartmentalization remains effective for non-biochemical, such as organometallic, cascade reactions. Here, we report our exemplary efficacy analysis of compartmentalization in our previously reported cascade reaction for ambient CH4-to-CH3OH conversion, mediated by O2-deactivating RhII metalloradical with O2 as the terminal oxidant in Si nanowire array electrode. We experimentally identified and quantified the productivity of key reaction intermediates, including RhII metalloradical and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from O2. We subsequently determined that the nanowire array enables about 81 % of the generated ephemeral intermediate in air, RhII metalloradical, to be utilized towards CH3OH formation, which is 0% in homogenous solution. Such an experimentally determined value was satisfactorily consistent with the results from our semi-quantitative kinetic model. The consistency suggests that the reported CH4-to-CH3OH conversion surprisingly possesses minimal unforeseen side reactions, and is favorably efficient as a compartmentalized cascade reaction.

We used Cremer-Pople puckering coordinates to study the trends of the ring conformation across a set of 140,000 diverse small molecules, including small rings, macrocycles and cyclic peptides. By standardizing using key atoms, we show that the ring conformations can be classified into relatively few conformational clusters, based on their canonical forms. The number of such canonical clusters increases slowly with ring size. Ring puckering motions, especially pseudo-rotations, are generally restricted, and differ between clusters. More importantly, we propose models to map puckering preferences to torsion space, which allows us to understand the interrelated changes in torsion angles during pseudo-rotation and other puckering motions. Beyond ring puckers, our models also explain the change in substituent orientation upon puckering.

Asphaltene, the most resistant component of bitumen, contain Vanadyl porphyrins and carbonaceous radicals which can be used as paramagnetic probes to investigate embalming materials without sample preparation. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) at X-band, combining in-phase and out-of-phase detection schemes, provides new information in a non-destructive way about the presence, the origin, and the evolution of bitumen in these complex materials. It is found that the relative EPR intensity of radicals and vanadyl porphyrins is sensitive to the origin of the bitumen. The presence of non-porphyrinic vanadyl complexes in historical samples is likely due to the complexation of VO2+ ions by carboxylic functions at the interface between bitumen and other biological components of the embalming matter. The absence of such oxygenated vanadyl complex in natural bitumen and in one case of historical human mummy acquired by a museum in the 19th century reveals a possible, non-documented, ancient restoration of this mummy by pure bitumen. The linear correlation between in-phase and out-of phase EPR intensities of radicals and vanadyl porphyrins in balms and in natural bitumen, reveals a nanostructuration of radicals and vanadyl porphyrin complexes, which was not affected by the preparation of the balm.

Despite extensive research since the outset of the pandemic, definitive therapeutic agents for the treatment of the disease are yet to be identified. The main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an enzyme essential for virus replication through viral proteolytic activity and subsequent generation of infectious virus particles. Current computational efforts towards SARS-CoV-2 MPro inhibitor design have generally neglected an allosteric mechanism linked to His41-Cys145 catalytic dyad disruption and thus fail to target the open conformational state. We identify the rare event associated with the allosteric regulation of MPro activity in the orientation of the His41 imidazole side chain away from Cys145.

We calculate a 4.2 \u00b1 1.9 kJ/mol free energy difference between the open and closed states of the SARS-CoV-2 MPro active site, indicating that favourable ligand interactions with His41 over the Cys145-His41 dyad interaction can stabilise the open state.", "date": "2020-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we disrupted and reconstituted\nApPrx QS via amino acid mutations and chemical modifications targeting hot\nspots for protein assembly. The decameric QS of an ApPrx* mutant, wherein all\ncysteine residues in wild-type ApPrx were mutated to serine, was destructed to\ndimers via an F80C mutation.

Simulations of the DD generation are usually carried out with classical molecular dynamics (MD), but classical MD does not account for all the effects in DD, as demonstrated by <i>ab initio</i> calculations of model systems in literature. A fully <i>ab initio</i> simulation of the DD generation is impractical due to the large number of atoms involved. In my previous paper [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 22, 19307 (2020)], I developed an adaptive-center (AC) method for adaptive-partitioning (AP) quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, allowing the active region centers and the QM/MM partition to be determined on-the-fly for energy-conserving AP-QM/MM methods. I demonstrated that the AC-AP-QM/MM is applicable to the simulation of the DD generation, so that the active regions can be treated with an <i>ab initio</i> method. The AC method was unable to identify the fast-moving recoil ions in the DD generation as active region centers, however, and the accuracy is negatively affected by the rapid change in QM/MM partition of the system. In this paper, I extend the AC method and develop a speed-dependent adaptive-center (SDAC) method for proper AP-QM/MM simulations of DD. The SDAC method is applicable to general problems with speed-dependent active regions, and is compatible with all existing energy-conserving partition-by-distance AP-QM/MM methods. The artifact due to the speed-dependent potential energy surface can be made small by choosing proper criteria.

In this context, a fundamental thermodynamic property of interest is the bond dissociation energy (BDE) which measures the strength of a chemical bond. Fast and accurate prediction of BDEs for arbitrary molecules would lay the groundwork for data-driven projections of complex reaction cascades and hence a deeper understanding of these critical chemical processes and, ultimately, how to reverse design them. In this paper, we propose a chemically inspired graph neural network machine learning model, BonDNet, for the rapid and accurate prediction of BDEs. BonDNet maps the difference between the molecular representations of the reactants and products to the reaction BDE. Because of the use of this difference representation and the introduction of global features, including molecular charge, it is the first machine learning model capable of predicting both homolytic and heterolytic BDEs for molecules of any charge. To test the model, we have constructed a dataset of both homolytic and heterolytic BDEs for neutral and charged (1 and +1) molecules. BonDNet achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.022 eV for unseen test data, significantly below chemical accuracy (0.043 eV). Besides the ability to handle complex bond dissociation reactions that no previous model could con- sider, BonDNet distinguishes itself even in only predicting homolytic BDEs for neutral molecules; it achieves an MAE of 0.020 eV on the PubChem BDE dataset, a 20% improvement over the previous best performing model. We gain additional insight into the model\u2019s predictions by analyzing the patterns in the features representing the molecules and the bond dissociation reactions, which are qualitatively consistent with chemical rules and intuition. BonDNet is just one application of our general approach to representing and learning chemical reactivity, and it could be easily extended to the prediction of other reaction properties in the future.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2020-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In cyanobacteria, the photoprotective role is played by a specialized complex, the Orange Carotenoid Protein which is activated by strong blue-green light. This photoactivation involves a unique series of structural changes which terminate with an opening of the complex into two separated domains, one of which acts as a quencher for the light-harvesting complexes. Many experimental studies have tried to reveal the molecular mechanisms through which the energy absorbed by the carotenoid finally leads to the large conformational change of the complex. Here for the first time, these mechanisms are revealed by simulating at atomistic level the whole dynamics of the complex through an effective combination of enhanced sampling techniques. On the basis of our findings, we can conclude that the carotenoid does not act as a spring that, releasing its internal strain, induces the dissociation, as it was previously proposed but as a \"latch\" locking together the two domains. The photochemically triggered displacement of the carotenoid breaks this balance, allowing the complex to dissociate. <br />", "date": "2020-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thus far, reaction networks have been limited in size by chemically inconsistent graph representations of multi-reactant reactions (e.g. A + B reacts to C) that cannot enforce stoichiometric constraints, precluding the use of optimized shortest-path algorithms. Here, we report a chemically consistent graph architecture that overcomes these limitations using a novel multi-reactant representation and iterative cost-solving procedure. Our approach enables the identification of all low-cost pathways to desired products in massive reaction networks containing reactions of any stoichiometry, allowing for the investigation of vastly more complex systems than previously possible. Leveraging our architecture, we construct the first ever electrochemical reaction network from first-principles thermodynamic calculations to describe the formation of the Li-ion solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is critical for passivation of the negative electrode. Using this network comprised of nearly 6,000 species and 4.5 million reactions, we interrogate the formation of a key SEI component, lithium ethylene dicarbonate.

For eventual deployment as viable sub-nanoscale components that are compatible with current electronic device technology, conformational switching should controllable by a local electric field (i.e. E-field gateable) and accompanied by a rapid change in conduction. In organic chemical systems the degree of \u03c0-conjugation is linked to the degree of electronic delocalisation, and thus largely determines the conductivity. Here, by means of accurate first principles calculations, we study the prototypical biphenyl based molecular system in which the dihedral angle between the two rings determines the degree of conjugation. In order to make this a gateable system we create a net dipole by asymmetrically functionalising one ring with electronegative substituents (F, Br and CN) with different polarisabilities. In this way, the application of an E-field interacts with the dipolar system to influence the dihedral angle, thus controlling the conjugation. For all three considered substituents we consider a range of E-fields, and in each case extract conformational energy profiles. Using this data we obtain the minimum E-field required to induce a barrierless switching event for each system. We further extract the estimated switching speeds, the conformational probabliities at finite temperatures, and the effect of applied E-field on electronic structure.

Modular and adjustable NPMs, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), offer a vast materials space to sample for combinations to comprise a sensor array that produces a response pattern rich with information about the gas composition.<br /><br />Herein, we frame quantitative gas sensing, using arrays of NPMs, as an inverse problem, which equips us with a method to evaluate the fitness of a proposed combination of NPMs in a sensor array. While the (routine) forward problem is to use an adsorption model to predict the mass of gas adsorbed in the NPMs when immersed in a gas mixture of a given composition, the inverse problem is to predict the gas composition from the observed mass of adsorbed gas in each NPM. The fitness of a given combination of NPMs for gas sensing is then determined by the conditioning of its inverse problem: the prediction of the gas composition provided by a fit (unfit) combination of NPMs is insensitive (sensitive) to inevitable errors in the measurements of the mass of gas adsorbed in the NPMs. For illustration, we use experimentally measured adsorption data to analyze the conditioning of the inverse problem associated with a [IRMOF-1, HKUST-1] CH<sub>4</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> sensor array.", "date": "2020-09-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Sensors", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the unit cell of an RMS-MOF, a macrocyclic wheel is mechanically interlocked with a strut of the MOF scaffold. The wheel shuttles between stations on the strut that are also gas adsorption sites. At a level of abstraction similar to the seminal Langmuir adsorption model, we pose and analyze a simple statistical mechanical model of gas adsorption in an RMS-MOF that accounts for (i) wheel/gas competition for sites on the strut and (ii) gas-induced changes in the configurational entropy of the shuttling wheel. We determine how the amount of gas adsorbed, position of the wheel, and differential energy of adsorption depend on temperature, pressure, and the interactions of the gas/wheel with the stations. Our model reveals that, compared to a rigid, Langmuir material, the chemistry of the RMS-MOF can be tuned to render gas adsorption more or less temperature-sensitive and to release more or less heat upon adsorption. The model also uncovers a non-monotonic relationship between the temperature and the position of the wheel if gas out-competes the wheel for its preferable station.", "date": "2020-09-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Through varying the TMA\nreaction and purge times, we obtained new information on the surface chemistry\ncharacteristics and the chemisorption kinetics of this widely studied ALD process.\nWe propose new saturation profile related classifications and terminology. </p>", "date": "2020-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Thin Films; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Reaction Engineering", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using classical molecular dynamics with uniquely benchmarked forcefields, graph theoretical and cluster analysis, and Langevin dynamics, we reveal an elegant mechanism for the transport of the simplest solute, water. At equilibrium, small groups of octanol at the instantaneous interface bind water and swing like hinge of a door to bring water into a semi-organized second interfacial layer (octanol ``bilayer islands\"), where water can then diffuse into bulk octanol or be returned to the aqueous phase. The fundamental forces, collective, and reversible behavior, is well-described by a double well potential energy function, satisfying the basic principles of a simple molecular machine for solute transport. Unlike other transporting machines, this example leverages the interfacial surface fluctuations rather than circumventing them, imparting new design principles for hierarchically organized structures that transport solutes across liquid/liquid phase boundaries.", "date": "2020-09-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

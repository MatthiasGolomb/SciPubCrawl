We have recently proposed a basis set for peptide systems that only depends on the sequence of amino acids in the system. This basis set is not data- driven and can therefore be used to compare models for different MD simulations. Here we introduce an orthonormality condition for this basis set as a requirement for the variational models to remain directly interpretable. The orthonormality condi- tion naturally leads to a way of detecting correlations between the sampled marginal stationary probability distributions at each residue in the peptide sequence. We show how these correlations emerge from either undersampled transitions or from inher- ent dynamical dependencies between the residues. Our basis set relies on a tensor structure obtained from residue-centered ansatz functions. We demonstrate that this structure is sufficient to model both \u03b2-sheet and \u03b1-helix formation in peptides.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Clusters", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry (IM-MS) affords unique advantages for probing the conformational consequences of the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues because it measures and separates proteins electrosprayed from solution on the basis of charge and shape. Here, we use IM-MS to measure the conformational consequences of charge patterning on the C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (p27 IDR) of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. We report the range of charge states and accompanying collisional cross section distributions for wild-type p27 IDR and two variants with identical amino acid compositions, k14 and k56, distinguished by the extent of linear mixing versus segregation of oppositely charged residues. Wild-type p27 IDR (k31) and k14 where the oppositely charged residues are more evenly distributed, exhibit a broad distribution of charge states. This is concordant with high degrees of conformational heterogeneity in solution. By contrast, k56 with linear segregation of oppositely charged residues, leads to limited conformational heterogeneity and a narrow distribution of charged states. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the interplay between chain solvation and intra-chain interactions (self-solvation) leads to conformational distributions that are modulated by salt concentration, with the wild-type sequence showing the most sensitivity to changes in salt concentration. These results suggest that the charge patterning within the wild-type p27 IDR may be optimized to sample both highly solvated and self-solvated conformational states.", "date": "2018-11-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Mass Spectrometry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Thus, the development of methods for asymmetric indole alkylation is highly valuable in organic synthesis. Traditionally, achieving N-selectivity in indole alkylation reactions is a significant challenge, since there is an intrinsic preference for alkylation at C3, the most nucleophilic position. Furthermore, selective and predictable access to either N- and C3-alkylated chiral indoles using catalyst control has been a long-standing goal in indole functionalization. Herein, we report a ligand-controlled regiodivergent synthesis of N- and C3-alkylated chiral indoles that relies on a polarity reversal strategy. In contrast to conventional alkylation reactions in which indoles are employed as nucleophiles, this transformation employs electrophilic indole derivatives, N-(benzoyloxy)indoles, as coupling partners. N- or C3-alkylated indoles are prepared with high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity using a copper hydride catalyst. The regioselectivity is governed by the use of either DTBM-SEGPHOS or Ph-BPE as the supporting ligand.

We have used a laboratory sea spray chamber to study water-to-air transfer of 11 PFAAs via sea spray aerosol (SSA). We observed significant enrichment of all PFAAs relative to sodium in the SSA generated. The highest enrichment was observed in aerosols with aerodynamic diameter < 1:6 \u00b5m, which had aerosol PFAA concentrations up to ~ 62000 times higher than the PFAA water concentrations in the chamber. In surface microlayer samples collected from the sea spray chamber, the enrichment of the substances investigated was orders of magnitude smaller than the enrichment observed in the aerosols. In experiments with mixtures of structural isomers, a lower contribution of branched PFAA isomers was observed in the SML in relation to the bulk water. However, no clear trend was observed for the comparison of structural isomers in SSA and bulk water. Using the measured enrichment factors of perfluoroctanoic acid and perfluorooctance sulfonic acid versus sodium we have estimated global annual emissions of these substances to the atmosphere via SSA as well as their global annual deposition to land areas.

The MM region around it consists of a finite cluster of explicit MM atoms, represented by point charges and Lennard-Jones potentials, with additional background charges to mimic periodic electrostatics. Cluster charges are QM-derived and calculated self-consistently to ensure a polarizable embedding. We have also considered the extension to many-body QM corrections, calculating the interactions of a central molecule to neighbouring units in the crystal.

The modelling of such processes is, however, hindered by the lack of excited state methodologies tailored for these systems. Embedding approaches based on the Ewald sum can be used in conjunction with excited state electronic structure methods to model the localised excitations which characterise these materials. In this article, we describe the implementation of a two-level ONIOM(QM:QM') point charge embedding approach based on the Ewald method, the Ewald Embedded Cluster (EEC) model. An alternative self-consistent method is also considered to simulate the response of the environment to the excitation. Two molecular crystals with opposing photochemical behaviour were used to benchmark the results with single reference and multireference methods. We observed that the inclusion of an explicit ground state cluster surrounding the QM region was imperative for the exploration of the excited state potential energy surfaces. Using EEC, accurate absorption and emission energies as well as S1-S0 conical intersections were obtained for both crystals. We discuss the implications of the use of these embedding schemes considering the degree of localisation of the excitation.

Toward this end, we evaluated biopolymer microparticles using flow imaging microscopy. This technology is widely used in the biopharmaceutical industry but is not yet well-known among the materials community. Our polymer, a genetically engineered elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), self-assembles into micron-scale coacervates.

We validated flow imaging results by comparison with dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy analyses. We explored the effects of various solvent conditions on ELP coacervate size, morphology, and behavior, such as the dispersion of single particles versus aggregates.

Here, the interplay between intramolecular and formed inter-sheet hydrogen bonds and the effect of dispersion interactions on the formation of neutral, isolated, peptide dimers is studied by infrared action spectroscopy. Therefore, four different homo- and hetereogeneous dimers formed from three different alanine-based model peptides have been studied under controlled and isolated conditions. The peptides differ from one another in the presence and location of a UV chromophore containing cap on either the C- or N-terminus. Conformations of the monomers of the peptides direct the final dimer structure: strongly hydrogen bonded or folded structures result in weakly bound dimers. Here the intramolecular hydrogen bonds are favored over new intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions.

In general, the high school\u2019s chemistry teaching programs tend to illustrate the great historic discoveries and glorious past of chemical research. It is hoped that this historical perspective will help to provide students with the basic understanding necessary for the development of the chemistry of tomorrow. Unfortunately, in general, the emphasis on established chemical research and on the reassuringly solid-foundations of the field is ubiquitous not only in the theoretical classes, but also in more practical aspects of teach- ing, such as in student maturity work: these small, often laboratory-oriented research projects are often limited to reproducing the scientific literature often printed in black white- and/or adding minor modifications to estab- lished scientific protocols, instead of exploring the colourful world of current scientific discovery and the excitement of pushing back the boundaries of knowledge. Practicing innovative and original research with chemistry stu- dents is therefore a challenge for the mentor of any maturity work. Here, I describe the implementation of a practical program nicknamed La Chimie en Couleurs- for carrying out original research work in chemistry, making science live, colourful and vivid to students, i.e. not something that has already been done by others before, but something that one can pursue oneself and that is totally new and original. The program is taught during high-school courses and carried by students, using inexpensive equipment, easily-accessible, non- toxic chemicals and simple chemical concepts. Part of the research work was presented by students at the Swiss Chemical Society Annual Meeting and merited a Poster-Prize in the Inorganic Chemistry Runner-Up category. The La Chimie en Couleurs program presented here illustrates that up-to-date and socially-relevant chemistry (not just historically-relevant chemistry!) can be taught to teenagers in a creative way through the implementation of serious, albeit inexpensive, scientific research at highschool level.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2018-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The presence of a particle-dependent varying dielectrics produces the appearance of mesoscopic polarization forces, which are dependent on the local fluctuations of the permittivity, as well as of the electrostatic field.

The reactions of phosphates with Fe-hydroxides and especially goethite have been studied extensively. But a molecular-level picture about the phosphate binding mechanism at the goethite-water interface is still lacking. Therefore, in the current contribution we have explored the molecular binding mechanism for the adsorbed phosphate at the goethite\u2013water interface by performing sorption kinetics experiments for orthophosphate and characterizing the adsorbed species by FT-IR spectroscopy. In parallel, periodic DFT calculations have been performed to explore the interaction mechanism as well as to calculate the IR spectra for monodentate (M) and bidentate (B) orthophosphate complexes at two different goethite surface planes (010 and 100) in the presence of water. In general, our interaction energy results give evidence that the mono-protonated B phosphate complex is more favored to be formed at the goethite\u2013water interface although the M motif could exist as a minor fraction. Moreover, it was found that water plays an important role in controlling the phosphate adsorption process at the goethite surfaces. The interfacial water molecules form H-bonds (HBs) with the phosphate as well as with the goethite surface atoms. Further, some water molecules form covalent bonds with goethite Fe atoms while others dissociate at the surface to protons and hydroxyl groups. The present theoretical assignment of IR spectra introduces a benchmark for characterizing experimental IR data for the adsorbed KH2PO4 species at the goethite\u2013water interface. In particular, IR spectra of the mono-protonated (2O+1Fe) B complex at the 010 goethite surface plane and the M complex at the 100 goethite surface plane were found to be consistent with the experimental data. In order to explore the role of different abundancies of surface planes and binding motifs, IR spectra obtained from weighted averages have been analyzed.

By using suitable localized-mode coordinates obtained from an orthogonal transformation of the conventionally used normal-mode coordinates, anharmonic couplings between modescan be significantly reduced. However, such a transformation introduces harmonic couplings between the localized modes. To elucidate the role of these harmonic couplings, we consider vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) / vibrational configuration interaction (VCI) calculations for both few-mode model systems and for ethene as a molecular test case. We show that large harmonic couplings can result in significant errors in localized-mode L-VSCF/L-VCI calculations and study the convergence with respect to the size of the VCI excitation space. To further elucidate the errors introduced by harmonic couplings, we discuss the connection between L-VSCF/L-VCI and vibrational exciton models. With the help of our results, we propose an algorithm for the localization of normal modes in suitable subsets that are chosen to strictly limit the errors introduced by the harmonic couplings while still leading to maximally localized modes.<br /></div>", "date": "2018-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Diamine-appended metal\u2013organic frameworks of the type diamine\u2013M2(dobpdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn; dobpdc4\u2212 = 4,4\u2032-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3\u2032-dicarboxylate) have shown promise for carbon capture applications, although questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms of CO2 uptake in these materials. Here, we leverage the crystallinity and tunability of this class of frameworks to perform a comprehensive study of CO2 chemisorption. Using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments and van der Waals-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations for thirteen diamine\u2013M2(dobpdc) variants, we demonstrate that the canonical CO2 chemisorption products\u2014ammonium carbamate chains and carbamic acid pairs\u2014can be readily distinguished, and that ammonium carbamate chain formation dominates for diamine\u2013Mg2(dobpdc) materials. In addition, we elucidate a new chemisorption mechanism in the material dmpn Mg2(dobpdc) (dmpn = 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane), which involves formation of a 1:1 mixture of ammonium carbamate and carbamic acid and accounts for the unusual adsorption properties of this material. Finally, we show that the presence of water plays an important role in directing the mechanisms for CO2 uptake in diamine\u2013M2(dobpdc) materials. Overall, our combined NMR and DFT approach enables a thorough depiction and understanding of CO2 adsorption within diamine\u2013M2(dobpdc) compounds, which may aid similar studies in other amine-functionalized adsorbents in the future.", "date": "2018-11-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Separation Science; Solid State Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Computational; Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Starting from the concept of the definition of the measurand, we emphasize that (i) mobility values (K0) depend intrinsically on ion structure, the nature of the bath gas, temperature, and E/N, (ii) ion mobility does not measure surfaces directly, but collision cross section (CCS) values are derived from mobility values using a physical model, (iii) methods relying on calibration are empirical (and thus may provide method-dependent results) only if the gas nature, temperature or E/N cannot match those of the primary method. Our analysis highlights the urgency of a community effort towards establishing primary standards and reference materials for ion mobility, and provides recommendations to do so. <br /><br /><br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education - General; Analytical Chemistry - General; Analytical Apparatus; Biochemical Analysis; Chemoinformatics; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Chemical Biology; Quality Control; Physical and Chemical Properties; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

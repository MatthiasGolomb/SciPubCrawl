However, problems including electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and transition metal dissolution, especially at elevated temperatures, have limited its potential use in practical full cells. In this paper, a fundamental study for LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> || Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LTO) full cells has been performed to understand the effect of different capacity fading mechanisms contributing to overall cell failure. Electrochemical characterization of cells in different configurations (regular full cells, back-to-back pseudo-full cells and 3-electrode full cells) combined with an intermittent current interruption technique have been performed. Capacity fade in the full cell configuration was mainly due to progressively limited lithiation of electrodes caused by a more severe degree of parasitic reactions at the LTO electrode, while the contributions from active mass loss from LNMO or increases in internal cell resistance were minor. Comparison of cell formats constructed with and without the possibility of cross-talk indicate that the parasitic reactions on LTO occur because of the transfer of reaction products from the LNMO side. The efficiency of LTO is more sensitive to temperature causing a dramatic increase in the fading rate at 55 \u00b0C. These observations show how important the electrode interactions (cross-talk) can be for the overall cell behaviour. Additionally, internal resistance measurements showed that the positive electrode was mainly responsible for the increase of resistance over cycling, especially at 55 \u00b0C. Surface characterization showed that LNMO surface layers were relatively thin when compared to the SEI on LTO. The SEI on LTO does not contribute significantly to overall cell resistance even though these films are relatively thick. XANES measurements showed that the Mn and Ni observed on the anode were not in metallic state; the presence of elemental metals in the SEI is therefore not implicated in the observed fading mechanism through a simple reduction process of migrated metal cations.<br />", "date": "2018-03-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The total vSFG spectra calculated for different polarization combinations are then analyzed\nin terms of molecular auto-correlation and cross-correlation contributions. To provide\nmolecular-level insights into interfacial hydrogen-bonding topologies, which give rise to\nspecific spectroscopic features, the vSFG spectra are further investigated by separating\ncontributions associated with water molecules donating 0, 1, or 2 hydrogen bonds to\nneighboring water molecules. This analysis suggests that the low frequency shoulder\nof the free OH peak which appears at \u223c3600 cm\u22121 is primarily due to intermolecular\ncouplings between both singly and doubly hydrogen-bonded molecules.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>", "date": "2018-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Properties; Statistical Mechanics; Structure; Surface; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Solid-like insulating nanostructures of [BMIM][NTf2] spontaneously form on a variety of insulating substrates, at odd with the liquid and conductive nature of the same substances in the bulk phase. A systematic spatially-resolved investigation by atomic force microscopy of the morphological, mechanical and electrical properties of [BMIM][NTf2] nanostructures showed that this liquid substance rearranges into lamellar nanostructures with a high degree of vertical order and enhanced resistance to mechanical compressive stresses and very intense electric fields, denoting a solid-like character. The morphological and structural reorganization has a profound impact on the electric properties of supported [BMIM][NTf2] islands, which behave like insulator layers with a relative dielectric constant between 3 and 5, comparable to those of conventional ionic solids, and significantly smaller than those measured in the bulk ionic liquid. These results suggest that in the solid-like ordered domains confined either at surfaces or inside the pores of the nanoporous electrodes of photo-electrochemical devices, the ionic mobility and the overall electrical properties can be significantly perturbed with respect to the bulk liquid phase, which would likely influence the performance of the devices.<br />", "date": "2018-03-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Properties; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The multicomponent adsorption kinetic model was solved with ODE function of MATLAB and the kinetic parameters were estimated by the nonlinear least squares fitting. The results of nonlinear fitting to the previous experimental data show that the proposed kinetic model can be useful for kinetics modeling of multicomponent adsorption in batch systems.  <br />", "date": "2018-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this way, macrocycle synthesis is driven by supramolecular assembly, either into small aggregates supported by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, or high-aspect ratio nanotubes stabilized primarily by electrostatic and solvophobic interactions. For the latter, supramolecular polymerization into nanotubes restricts imine exchange, thereby conferring chemical stability to the assemblies and their constituent macrocycles. Competition in the formation and component exchange among macrocycles favored pyridine-2,6-diimine-linked species due to their rapid synthesis, thermodynamic stability, and assembly into high-aspect ratio nanotubes under the reaction conditions. In addition, the pyridine-containing nanotubes inhibit the formation of similar macrocycles containing benzene-1,3-diimine-linkages, presumably by disrupting their assembly and templation. Finally, we exploit rapid imine exchange within weak, low-aspect ratio macrocycle aggregates to carry out monomer exchange reactions to macrocycles bearing pyridine moieties. Once a pyridine-containing dialdehyde has exchanged into a macrocycle, the macrocycle becomes capable of nanotube formation, which dramatically slows further imine exchange. This kinetic trap provides chemically diverse macrocycles that are not attainable by direct synthetic methods. Together these findings provide new insights into coupling supramolecular polymerization and dynamic covalent bond-forming processes and leverages this opportunity to target asymmetric nanotubes. We envision these findings spurring further research efforts in the synthesis of nanostructures with designed and emergent properties.", "date": "2019-11-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Aggregates and Assemblies; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we develop an optimized synthetic CbA photoaffinity probe (photo-CbA) and use it to demonstrate that CbA directly targets the Sec61\u03b1 subunit of the trimeric Sec61 translocon. CbA binding to Sec61 results in broad substrate-nonselective inhibition of ER protein import and potent cytotoxicity against specific cancer cell lines. CbA targets a lumenal cavity of Sec61\u03b1 that is partially shared with known Sec61 inhibitors, yet profiling against resistance conferring Sec61\u03b1 mutations identified from human HCT116 cells suggests a distinct binding mode for CbA. Specifically, despite conferring strong resistance to all previously known Sec61 inhibitors, the Sec61\u03b1 mutant R66I remains sensitive to CbA. A further unbiased screen for Sec61\u03b1 resistance mutations identified the CbA-resistant mutation S71P, which confirms non-identical binding sites for CbA and apratoxin A and supports the susceptibility of the Sec61 plug region for channel inhibition.

In analyzing the physical origin of peaks in the spectral density, we identify vibrational modes that couple the electron and the hole as being particularly sensitive to the QM screening of the environment. For PYP, we reveal the need for a careful determination of the appropriate QM region to obtain reliable spectral densities.

Herein we report the first 3D printing of RAFT-based formulations that can be conducted fully open to air using standard digital light processing (DLP) 3D printer and under mild conditions of visible light at blue (\u03bb <sub>max</sub> = 483 nm, 4.16 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) or green (\u03bb <sub>max</sub> = 532 nm, 0.48 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) wavelength.

Re-activation of the TTCs present within the polymer networks enables post-printing monomer insertion into the outer layers of an already printed dormant object under second RAFT process, which provides a new pathway to design a more complex 3D printing. To our best knowledge, this is the first example of open-to-air PET-RAFT facilitated 3D printing of polymeric materials.

These materials are also interesting as supports for low dimensional metals for catalysis, while recent work has shown increased interest in using 2D materials in the electronics industry as a Cu diffusion barrier in semiconductor device interconnects. The interaction between different metal structures and MoS2 monolayers is therefore of significant importance and first principle simulations can probe aspects of this interaction not easily accessible to experiment. Previous theoretical studies have focused particularly on the adsorption of a range of metallic elements, including first row transition metals, as well as Ag and Au. However, most studies have examined single atom adsorption or adsorb nanoparticles of noble metals. This means there is a knowledge gap in terms of thin film nucleation on 2D materials. To begin addressing this issue, we present in this paper a first principles density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption of small Cu_n structures, where n = 1-4, on 2D MoS2 as a model system. We find on a perfect MoS2 monolayer that a single Cu atom prefers an adsorption site above the Mo atom. With increasing nanocluster size the nanocluster binds more strongly when Cu atoms adsorb atop the S atom. Stability is driven by the number of Cu-Cu interactions and the distance between adsorption sites, with no obvious preference towards 2D or 3D structures. The introduction of a single S vacancy in the monolayer enhances copper binding energy, although some Cu_n nanoclusters are actually unstable. The effect of the vacancy is localised around the vacancy site. Finally on both the pristine and defective MoS2 monolayer, the density of states analysis shows that the adsorption of Cu introduces new electronic states as a result of partial Cu oxidation, but the metallic character of Cu nanoclusters is preserved.  </div><div><br /></div>", "date": "2019-11-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, this versatility is limited by the stability of the perovskite phase, related to the relative size of the different cations and anions. The most emblematic case is that of formamidinium lead iodine (FAPI) black phase, which has the lowest band gap among all 3D lead halide perovskites, but quickly transforms into the non-perovskite yellow phase at room temperature. Efforts to optimize perovskite solar cells have largely focused on the stabilization of FAPI based perovskite structures, often introducing alternative anions and cations. However, these approaches commonly result in a blue-shift of the band gap, which limits the maximum photo-conversion efficiency. Here, we report the use of PbS colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as stabilizing agent for the FAPI perovskite black phase. The surface chemistry of PbS plays a pivotal role, by developing strong bonds with the black phase but weak ones with the yellow phase. As a result, stable FAPI black phase can be formed at temperatures as low as 85\u00b0C in just 10 minutes, setting a record of concomitantly fast and low temperature formation for FAPI, with important consequences for industrialization. FAPI thin films obtained through this procedure preserve the original low band gap of 1.5 eV, reach a record open circuit potential (V<sub>oc</sub>) of 1.105 V -91% of the maximum theoretical V<sub>oc</sub>- and preserve high efficiency for more than 700 hours.

We employ bio-compatible click chemistry to induce triazole formation between azido- and alkynyl-D-alanine residues that are metabolically installed in the cell walls of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Synthetic triazole cross-links can be visualized by substituting azido-D-alanine with azidocoumarin-D-alanine, an amino acid derivative that undergoes fluorescent enhancement upon reaction with terminal alkynes.

The applied oscillation amplitude and frequency can accelerate reactions orders of magnitude above the catalytic rates of static systems, provided the active site dynamics are tuned to the natural frequencies of the surface chemistry. In this work, differences in the characteristics of parallel reactions are exploited via selective application of active site dynamics (0 < \u0394U < 1.0 eV amplitude, 10<sup>-6</sup> < f < 10<sup>4</sup> Hz frequency) to control the extent of competing reactions occurring on the shared catalytic surface. Simulation of multiple parallel reaction systems with broad range of variation in chemical parameters revealed that parallel chemistries are highly tunable in selectivity between either pure product, even when specific products are not selectively produced under static conditions. Two mechanisms leading to dynamic selectivity control were identified: (i) surface thermodynamic control of one product species under strong binding conditions, or (ii) catalytic resonance of the kinetics of one reaction over the other. These dynamic parallel pathway control strategies applied to a host of chemical conditions indicate significant potential for improving the catalytic performance of many important industrial chemical reactions beyond their existing static performance.", "date": "2019-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We find that mechanical contributions to energy of the interacting species (i.e., metal and cation) relate to respective molar volumes. The stresses at the electrodepositing interface are correlated, and consequently, localized deposition is energetically favored for larger cationic molar volumes. Electrolyte stresses cause a stress-driven ionic flux away from compressed locations, which proves to be a stabilizing influence.

Recent instrumental advances for compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) now make it possible to monitor such processes based on the isotope fractionation of multiple elements as changes of 13C/12C, 37Cl/35Cl, and 2H/1H ratios in the residual HCH contamination. However, metabolic constraints from the expression of enzymes that can compete with the primary metabolic reactions leading to HCH biodegradation and thus alter the observable contaminant isotope fractionation through co metabolic side reactions have largely been overlooked. Here, we developed activity-based assays to assess the competitive behaviour of mixtures of lindane dehydrochlorinase LinA and haloalkane dehydrochlorinase LinB which catalyze the dehydrochlorination and hydrolytic dechlorination of several HCH isomers. Using X-HCH as model contaminant that can be transformed by both enzymes in mixtures of different LinA2/LinB activity, we observed preferential formation of products from hydrolytic dechlorination. This observation suggests that LinB was more reactive than predicted from the nominal enzyme activities. The C and H isotope fractionation of X-HCH in LinA2/LinB mixtures can be rationalized by a combination of isotope enrichment factors from independent dehydrochlorination and hydrolytic dechlorination reactions where LinA2 contributed more to H isotope fractionation than LinB, thus contrasting the assessment of competitive enzyme activity. Our study shows that metabolic constraints associated with the expression of multiple enzymes can potentially compromise inferences of extent and pathways of contaminant biodegradation from CSIA.</div>", "date": "2019-11-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

More in detail, we chose catechols carrying either electron-donating or electronwithdrawing groups EDG or EWG and investigated the physico-chemical and biological properties of their complexes. Several pieces of experimental evidences demonstrated that the coordination of catechols bearing EDGs led to deep red positively charged complexes 1\u20134 in which the preferred oxidation state of the dioxoligand is the uninegatively charged semiquinonate.

Apart from its remarkably high cytotoxicity (IC50 = 0.07\u20130.7 \u03bcM in different cancerous cell lines) complex 1 was taken up by HeLa cells very efficiently by a passive transportation mechanism. Moreover, its moderate accumulation in several cellular compartments (i.e. nucleus, lysosomes, mitochondria and cytoplasm) is extremely advantageous in the search of a potential drug with multiple modes of action. Further DNA metalation and metabolic studies pointed to the direct interaction of complex 1 with DNA and to the severe impairment of the mitochondrial function. Multiple targets, together with its outstanding cytotoxicity, make complex 1 a valuable candidate in the field of chemotherapy research.</div>", "date": "2019-11-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinorganic Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Computational studies on the high coverage and mixed coverages of reaction intermediates are still challenging, especially for transition-metal compounds. In this work, we present a framework to predict differential adsorption energies and identify low-energy structures under high- and mixed-adsorbate coverages on oxide materials. The approach uses Gaussian process machine-learning models with quantified uncertainty in conjunction with an iterative training algorithm to actively identify the training set. The framework is demonstrated for the mixed adsorption of CH<sub>x</sub>, NH<sub>x</sub> and OH<sub>x</sub> species on the oxygen vacancy and pristine rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface sites.

The algorithm is also used to identify 76% of the low-energy structures based on <30% of the total DFT data, enabling construction of surface phase diagrams that account for high and mixed coverage as a function of the chemical potential of C, H, O, and N. Furthermore, the computational scaling indicates the algorithm scales nearly linearly (N<sup>1.12</sup>) as the number of adsorbates increases.

Each droplet acts as microreactor for a reaction between decamethylferrocene (DmFc) within the hexane and metal salts (Ag+/ Pd2+) in the aqueous phase. The hypothesis was that a spontaneous, interfacial reaction would lead to the assembly of nanomaterials creating a Pickering emulsion. The subsequent removal of the solvents showed how the Ag nanoparticles were trapped at the interface and retain the shape of the droplet, however the Pd nanoparticles were dispersed with no tertiary structure. To further exploit this, a one-step process where the particles are synthesised and then assembled into core-shell materials was proposed. The same reactions were performed in the presence of oleic acid stabilise Iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed within the hexane. It was shown that by changing the reaction rate and ratio between palladium and iron oxide a continuous coating of palladium onto iron oxide microspheres can be created. The same reaction with silver, was unsuccessful and resulted in the silver particles being shed into solution, or incorporated within the iron oxide micro particle.

These interferometric techniques involve the nonlinear interaction between three\nshort laser pulses with the sample. In order\nto obtain accurate phase information, the relative phases between the pulses must be stabilized and their timings precisely controlled.\nDespite much progress made, fulfilling both requirements remains a formidable experimental\nchallenge.

The main new ingredient are better computed reference polarizabilities for high coordination numbers (including alkaline metals, earth alkaline metals, and d-metals of group 3-5), which are consistently derived from periodic electrostatically embedded cluster calculations. Some technical extensions have been added concerning the coordination number, the partial charges, and the dispersion energy expression. To demonstrate the performance of the improved scheme, several test cases are considered, for which we compare D4 results to those of its predecessor D3(BJ) as well as to several other dispersion corrected methods. The largest improvements are observed for solid state polarizabilities of 16 inorganic salts, where the new D4 model achieves an unprecedented accuracy, surpassing its predecessor as well as other, computationally much more demanding approaches. For cell volumes and lattice energies of two sets of chemically diverse molecular crystals, the accuracy gain is less pronounced compared to the already excellently performing D3(BJ) method. For the challenging adsorption energies of small organic molecules on metallic as well as on ionic surfaces, DFT-D4 provides high accuracy similar to MBD/HI or uncorrected DFT/SCAN approaches.

With a large dataset, we use Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) as the model evidence to select the best linear regression model that are derived from non-informative priors.

Krylov", "abstract": "Natural orbitals are often used in quantum chemistry to achieve a more compact representation of correlated wave-functions. Using natural orbitals computed as eigenstates of the virtual-virtual block of the state density matrix instead of the canonical Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals results in smaller errors when the same fraction of virtual orbitals is frozen. This strategy, termed frozen natural orbitals (FNO) approach, has been successfully used to reduce the cost of state-specific coupled-cluster (CC) calculations, such as ground-state CC, as well as some multi-state methods, i.e., EOM-IP-CC (equation-of-motion CC method for ionization potentials). This contribution extends the FNO approach to the EOM-SF-CC ansatz (EOM-CC with spin-flip), which has been developed to describe certain multi-configurational wave-functions within the single-reference framework. In contrast to EOM-IP-CCSD, which describes open-shell target states by using a closed-shell reference, EOM-SF-CCSD relies on high-spin open-shell references (triplets, quartets, etc). Consequently, straightforward application of FNOs computed for an open-shell reference leads to an erratic behavior of the EOM-SF-CC energies and properties, which can be attributed to an inconsistent truncation of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 orbital spaces. A general solution to problems arising in the EOM-CC calculations utilizing open-shell references, termed OSFNO (open-shell FNO), is proposed. The OSFNO algo-rithm first identifies corresponding orbitals by means of singular value decomposition (SVD) of the overlap matrix of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 molecular orbitals and determines virtual orbitals corresponding to the singly occupied space. This is followed by SVD of the singlet part of the state density matrix in the remaining virtual orbital subspace. The so-computed FNOs preserve the spin purity of the open-shell orbital subspace to the extent allowed by the original reference thus facilitating a safe truncation of the virtual space. The performance of the OSFNO approximation in combination with different choices of reference orbitals is benchmarked for a set of diradicals and triradicals. For a set of di-copper single-molecule magnets, a conservative truncation criterion corresponding to a two-fold reduction of the virtual space in a triple-zeta basis leads to errors of 5\u201318 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the singlet\u2013triplet gaps and errors of \u223c2-3 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the spin\u2013orbit coupling constants.", "date": "2019-11-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This paper describes a pioneering work on the adsorption of an organic pollutant, 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) by two MOFs with high surface area and water stability; MIL-101 and its amino-derivative, MIL-101-NH<sub>2</sub>. Although MOFs have higher surface area than AC, the latter was proven better having the highest equilibrium 2-CP uptake (345 mg.g<sup>-1</sup>), followed by MIL-101 (121 mg.g<sup>-1</sup>) and MIL-101-NH<sub>2</sub> (84 mg.g<sup>-1</sup>). Used MIL-101 could be easily regenerated multiple times by washing with ethanol and even showed improved adsorption capacity after each washing cycle. These results can open the doors to meticulous adsorbent selection for treating 2-CP-contaminated water", "date": "2019-11-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Taking into account its size and huge conformational flexibility, DFT remains the workhorse for modeling such extended macrocycles. Nevertheless, the stability of H\u00fcckel and M\u00f6bius conformers depends on a complex interplay of different factors, such as hydrogen bonding, p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7p stacking, steric effects, ring strain and electron delocalization. As a consequence, the selection of an exchange-correlation functional for describing the energy profile of topological switches is very difficult. For these reasons, we have examined the performance of a variety of wavefunction methods and density functionals for describing the thermochemistry and kinetics of topology interconversions across a wide range of macrocycles. Especially for hexa- and heptaphyrins, the M\u00f6bius structures have a pronouncedly stronger degree of static correlation than the H\u00fcckel and figure-eight structures, and as a result the relative energies of singly-twisted structures are a challenging test for electronic structure methods. Comparison of limited orbital space full CI calculations with CCSD(T) calculations within the same active spaces shows that post-CCSD(T) correlation contributions to relative energies are very minor. At the same time, relative energies are weakly sensitive to further basis set expansion, as proven by the minor energy differences between MP2/cc-pVDZ and explicitly correlated MP2-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12 calculations. Hence, our CCSD(T) reference values are reasonably well-converged in both 1-particle and n-particle spaces. While conventional MP2 and MP3 yield very poor results, SCS-MP2 and particularly SOS-MP2 and SCS-MP3 agree to better than 1 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> with the CCSD(T) relative energies. Regarding DFT methods, only M06-2X provides relative errors close to chemical accuracy with a RMSD of 1.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. While the original DSD-PBEP86 double hybrid performs fairly poorly for these extended p-systems, the errors drop down to 2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> for the revised revDSD-PBEP86-NL, again showing that same-spin MP2-like correlation has a detrimental impact on performance like the SOS-MP2 results. </p>", "date": "2019-11-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Optical Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Machine learning has allowed the development of highly-accurate neural-network potentials (NNPs), which are capable of predicting the stability of molecular conformations with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations but at a billionth of the computational cost.

Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of improved luminescent materials free of rare earths. Luminescent metal-organic framework (LMOF) materials have emerged as promising candidates for photonics devices. Most of the MOF-LEDs reported hitherto are of the down-converter type, where UV or blue LED are coated with LMOFs, however there is very limited progress in the development of LED using LMOFs as the electroluminescent layer.

If crystalline, however, solid-state phenomena can be observed, such as electrical conductivity, substantial dispersion of electronic bands, broadened absorption bands, formation of excimer states, mobile charge carriers, and indirect band gaps. These effects emerge often by the proximity effect caused by the van-der-Waals interactions between stacked aromatic building blocks.

The applicability of this strategy is hampered by the high computational cost required to calculate scattering intensities from three-dimensional structures. We previously presented a hybrid resolution method that makes atomistic SAXS-restrained MD simulation feasible by adopting a coarse-grained approach to efficiently back-calculate scattering intensities; here, we extend this technique, applying it in the framework of metainference with the aim to investigate the dynamical behavior of flexible biomolecules.

Some popular fixed-charge MM force fields use partial atomic charges derived from gas phase electronic structure calculations using the Hartree-Fock method with the relatively small 6-31G* basis set (HF/6-31G*).  It is generally believed that HF/6-31G* generates fortuitously overpolarized electron distributions, as would be expected in the higher dielectric environment of the condensed phase.  Using a benchmark set of 47 molecules we show that HF/6-31G* overpolarizes molecules by just under 10% on average with respect to experimental gas phase dipole moments. The overpolarization of this method/basis set combination varies significantly though and, in some cases, even leads to molecular dipole moments that are lower than experimental gas phase measurements.  We further demonstrate that using computationally inexpensive density functional theory (DFT) methods, together with appropriate augmented basis sets and a continuum solvent model, can yield molecular dipole moments that are both more strongly and more uniformly overpolarized.  These data suggest that these methods \u2013 or ones similar to them \u2013 should be adopted for the derivation of accurate partial atomic charges for next-generation MM force fields.<br /></p>", "date": "2019-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, the large number of synthetically tunable parameters makes it difficult to identify optimal design ``sweet spots'' without rational guiding principles. Here we address this problem combining super-selectivity theory (SST) with analytical models from soft matter and polymer physics into a unified theoretical framework. Starting from an archetypal system, a polymersome functionalized with targeting ligands, we use our model to identify the most selective combination of parameters in terms of particle size, brush polymerization degree and grafting density, as well as tether length, binding affinity and ligands number. We further show how to combine multivalent interactions into multiplexed systems which act holistically as a function of the density of more than one receptor type, so as to achieve binding only when multiple receptors are expressed above a threshold density. We show that theory can be used to effectively fit experimental data and, hence confirming its suitability. We thus propose the design of \u201cbar-coding\" targeting approach that can be tailor-made to unique cell populations enabling personalized therapies.                                                                                    </p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>", "date": "2019-11-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

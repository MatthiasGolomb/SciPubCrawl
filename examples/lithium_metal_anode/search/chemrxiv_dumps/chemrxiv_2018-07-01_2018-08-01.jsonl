Our first-principles study on realistic QD models reveals large surface-dependent reactivity for all elementary growth process steps including In-ligand bond cleavage and P precursor addition. These thermodynamic trends correlate well to kinetic properties at all stages of growth, indicating the presence of labile and stable spots on cluster and QD surfaces. Correlation of electronic or geometric properties to energetics identifies surprising sources for these variations: short In...In separation on the surface produces the most reactive sites, at odds with conventional understanding of strain (i.e., separation) in bulk metallic surfaces increasing reactivity and models for ionic II-VI QD growth. These differences are rationalized by the covalent, directional nature of bonding in III-V QDs and explained by bond order metrics derived directly from the In-O bond density. The unique constraints of carboxylate and P precursor bonding to In atoms rationalizes why all sizes of InP clusters and QDs are In-rich but become less so as QDs mature.

We synthesized silver nanocrystals using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) electron beam induced synthesis and systematically varied the electron dose rate, a parameter solely thought to regulate nanocrystal formation kinetics via the rate of metal precursor reduction. Rationally modifying the solution chemistry with tertiary butanol to scavenge radical oxidizing species established a strongly reducing environment and enabled repeatable LCEM experiments. Interestingly, nanocrystal growth rate decreased with increasing electron dose rate despite the predicted increase in reductant concentration. We present evidence that this counterintuitive trend stems from increased oxidizing radical concentration and radical recombination at high magnifications, which together decrease rate of precursor reduction. Nucleation rate was proportional only to imaging magnification, which we rationalized based on local radical accumulation at high magnification causing increased supersaturation and fast nucleation. Radiation chemistry and reactant diffusion scaling models yielded new scaling laws that quantitatively explained the observed effects of electron dose rate on nucleation and growth kinetics. Finally, we introduce a new reaction kinetic model that enables unraveling nucleation and growth kinetics to probe nucleation kinetics occurring at sub-nanometer length scales, which are typically not accessible with LCEM. Our systematic investigation of nanocrystal formation kinetics with LCEM indicates that the intricacies of radiation chemistry and reactant transport must be accounted for to effectively harness radical scavengers and electron beam induced growth to systematically probe nanocrystal formation kinetics.

Sobolewski", "abstract": "The photocatalytic splitting of water into molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen with sunlight is the dream reaction for solar energy conversion. Since decades, transition-metal-oxide semiconductors and supramolecular organometallic structures have been extensively explored as photocatalysts for solar water splitting. More recently, polymeric carbon nitride materials consisting of triazine or heptazine building blocks have attracted considerable attention as hydrogen-evolution photocatalysts. The mechanism of hydrogen evolution with polymeric carbon nitrides is discussed throughout the current literature in terms of the familiar concepts developed for photoelectrochemical water splitting with semiconductors since the 1970s. We discuss in this perspective an alternative mechanistic paradigm for photoinduced water splitting with carbon nitrides, which focusses on the specific features of the photochemistry of aromatic N-heterocycles in aqueous environments. It is shown that a water molecule which is hydrogen-bonded to an N-heterocycle can be decomposed into hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals by two simple sequential photochemical reactions. This concept is illustrated by first-principles calculations of excited-state reaction paths and their energy profiles for hydrogen-bonded complexes of pyridine, triazine and heptazine with a water molecule. It is shown that the excited-state hydrogen-transfer and hydrogen-detachment reactions are essentially barrierless, in sharp contrast to water oxidation in the electronic ground state, where high barriers prevail. We also discuss in some detail the products of possible reactions of the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals with the chromophores. We hypothesize that the challenge of efficient solar hydrogen generation with carbon-nitride materials is less the decomposition of water as such, but rather the controlled recombination of the photogenerated radicals to the closed-shell products H2 and H2O2.", "date": "2018-07-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It was recently shown, that sampling of tissues with the novel picosecond infrared laser (PIRL) offers higher yields of proteins with respect to the total amount and total number of individual proteins in comparison to mechanical homogenization. Furthermore, proteins obtained from tissues by homogenization with PIRL are significantly less enzymatically degraded, giving improved access to the original composition of proteoforms. The effective cold vaporization of tissue with PIRL is very soft, which is responsible for the phenomenon, that even enzymatic activities of proteins in the tissue aerosol are maintained. In contrast, the energy following irradiation of tissue with microsecond infrared laser (MIRL) pulses is not thermally and acoustically confined to the ablated volume. In this study, PIRL (1 J\u00b7cm-2) and MIRL (40-60 J\u00b7cm-2) were compared for sampling different tissue types for bottom-up proteomics. We showed that PIRL at low fluence is optimal for soft tissue and desired in scenarios were enzymatic activities of proteins must be maintained as well as were no residual tissue damage is a requirement. MIRL could be well suited for scenarios were enzymatic activities must be suppressed within the intact tissue and thermal and acoustic damage is not a concern.<br />", "date": "2018-07-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups. We present a number of tests of different complexity, ranging from simple post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional simulations. These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests.</p>\n<p>The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major releases passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely.

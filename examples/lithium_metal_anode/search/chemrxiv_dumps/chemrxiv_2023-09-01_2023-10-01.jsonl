This failure occurs because the reduction of O2 is thermodynamically favored over the reduction of CO2. Consequently, O2 must be removed from the CO2 feed prior to entering an electrolyzer, which is an expensive process. Here, we show the use of liquid bicarbonate feedstocks (e.g., aqueous 3.0 M KHCO3), rather than gaseous CO2 feedstocks, enables efficient and selective CO2 reduction without additional procedures for removing O2. This advance is made possible because liquid bicarbonate solutions deliver high concentrations of captured CO2 to the cathode, while the low solubility of O2 in aqueous media maintains a low O2 concentration at the same cathode surface. Consequently, electrolyzers fed with liquid bicarbonate feedstocks create an environment at the cathode that favors the reduction of CO2 over O2. We validate this claim by electrochemically converting CO2 into CO with reaction selectivities of ~65% at 100 mA cm-2 using 3.0 M KHCO3 solution bubbled with 100% CO2 or 100% O2. Similar experiments performed with a gaseous CO2 feedstock showed that merely 1% of O2 in the feedstock reduced CO selectivity to 11 \u00b1 3.7%. Our findings demonstrate that a liquid bicarbonate feedstock enables efficient CO2 reduction without the need for expensive O2 removal steps.", "date": "2023-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We identified a mixing position where two different solutions mixed uniformly and evaluated a corresponding mixing time in the liquid-sheet jets with homogeneous combination (water and water) and heterogeneous combination (ethanol and water). Both combinations could produce the liquid-sheet jet with a length of 3-4 mm, which corresponds to a time-range of longer than 100 \u03bcs. By observing a quenching reaction of N-Acetyl-L-tryptophan amide by N-Bromosuccinimide, the mixing times were evaluated to be 36 \u03bcs for the homogeneous combination (H2O/H2O), and 46 \u03bcs for the heterogeneous combination (C2H5OH/H2O). To clarify the mixing mechanism in the liquid-sheet jet, the theoretical mixing times were calculated by two different models assuming laminar and turbulence flows. Simulations based on molecular diffusion across a well-defined interface for the laminar flow showed a large discrepancy with the experimental results. The calculated mixing times based on energy dissipation in the turbulence flow are in great agreement with the observed mixing times for both H2O/H2O and C2H5OH/H2O combinations. These results indicate that turbulent mixing is a dominant mixing mechanism in the liquid-sheet jet, and that no clear interface is formed between H2O solutions and between C2H5OH and H2O solutions. The liquid-sheet jet technique provides a windowless and ultra-thin target, ideal for applications with X-ray or intense laser pulses, and would be useful to investigate intermediates in mixing-driven chemical reactions such as an oxidation in solution and a folding reaction of proteins proceeding in a microsecond time scale.", "date": "2023-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Solution Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Understanding how to overcome the Coulomb potential energy barrier is the central challenge. The recently-published magnetic \u2018Coulomb\u2019 barrier apparatus provides a pre-university classroom demonstration of an analogous magnetic potential energy barrier. The goal of this follow-on manuscript is to extend and transform the simplistic magnetic model into a representational electrostatic model useful to undergraduate and graduate students drawn to the challenge of controlled nuclear fusion. In light of Maxwell\u2019s unification of electricity and magnetism, this paper first presents an electrostatic analog of the magnetic \u201cCoulomb\u201d barrier.  This establishes a causal link between alternating/unequal charge and the manifestation of a force barrier similar to the barrier demonstrated by the magnet model. Then, using the method described in US Patent 11,087,920 B2, a potential barrier is shown to arise quite naturally from opposing sequences of equally spaced, alternating -1/3e and +2/3e charge (the equivalents of quark charge) when these charges occur at regular intervals equal to the proton\u2019s radius. These surprising findings support the hypothesis that quarks alternate in average positions within the nucleus. The average quark position hypothesis is then applied to deuteron-deuteron\u2019 fusion, which demonstrates how the Coulomb barrier height depends on the orientation of each reactant as they approach one another. An antiparallel approach indicates a Coulomb barrier height less than half that of the axial approach.  Given that the deuteron is an electric dipole, conducting fusion within a strong magnetic or electric field may control reactant orientation and lead to higher fusion efficiency.

Full water solubility of the synthesized polymers was confirmed using fluorescence spectroscopy. Highly concentrated CB dispersions were prepared in acidic, neutral and basic media, which we identified to strongly affect the interactions between polymer and CB.

Here, we report a new AI-guided approach, dubbed Closed-Loop Transfer (CLT), that integrates closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning to yield new scientific knowledge in parallel with optimization of objective functions. CLT surprisingly revealed that high-energy regions of the triplet state manifold are paramount in dictating molecular photostability in solution across a diverse chemical library of light-harvesting donor-bridge-acceptor oligomers. Remarkably, this insight emerged after automated modular synthesis and experimental characterization of only ~1.5% of the theoretical chemical space. Supervised learning models considering millions of combinations of 100+ physics-based descriptors further showed that high energy triplet states most strongly correlate with photostability, while excluding more commonly considered predictors such as the lowest energy triplet state. The physics-informed model for photostability was even further confirmed and then strengthened using an explicit experimental test set, validating the substantial power of the CLT method.

The reaction involves the replacement of oxide ions with fluoride ions as well as the insertion of fluoride ions at interstitial sites. From the characterization via powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld analysis as well as automated electron diffraction tomography (ADT) it is deduced that the fluorination results in a symmetry lowering from I4/mmm (139) to monoclinic C2/c (15) with an expansion perpendicular to the perovskite layers and a strong tilting of the octahedra in the ab plane. Disorder of the anions on the apical and the interstitial sites seems to be favored. The most stable configuration for the anion ordering is estimated based on an evaluation of bond distances from the ADT measurements via bond valence sums (BVSs). The observed disordering of the anions in the oxyfluoride results in changes of the optical properties and thus shows that the topochemical anion modification can present a viable route to alter optical properties. Partial densities of states (PDOSs) obtained from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a bandgap modification upon fluoride-ion introduction which originates from the presence of the oxide anions on the interstitial sites.

This catalyst requirement hinders their large-scale implementation. Single atom Fe in N-doped C (Fe-N-C) electrocatalysts offer the best non-Pt-based ORR activities to date, but their environmental impacts have not been studied and their production costs are rarely quantified. Herein, we report a comparative life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis of replacing Pt/C with Fe-N-C at the cathode of an 80 kW PEMFC stack. In the baseline scenario (20 gPt/C vs. 690 gFe-N-C), we estimate that Fe-N-C could reduce damages on ecosystems and human health by 88-90% and 30-44%, respectively, while causing a comparable impact on resource depletion. The environmental impacts of Pt/C predominantly arise from the Pt precursor while those of Fe-N-C are presently dominated by the electricity consumption. The monetized costs of environmental externalities for both Fe-N-C and Pt/C catalysts exceed their respective direct production costs. Based on catalyst performance with learning curve analysis at 500,000 PEMFC stacks per annum, we estimate replacing Pt/C with Fe-N-C would increase PEMFC stack cost from 13.8 to 41.6 USD kW-1. The cost increases despite a reduction in cathode catalyst production cost from 3.41 to 0.79 USD kW-1 (excluding environmental externalities). To be cost-competitive with a Pt-based PEMFC stack delivering 2020 US Department of Energy target of 1,160 mW cm-2 (at 0.657 V), the same stack with an Fe-N-C cathode would need to reach 874 mW cm-2, equivalent to a 200% performance improvement. These findings demonstrate the need for continued Fe-N-C activity development with sustainable synthesis routes in mind to replace Pt-based cathode catalyst in PEMFCs. Based on forecasting scenarios of fuel cell vehicle deployment targets, we find that Pt consumption would be constrained by Pt supply.", "date": "2023-09-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The light emission from adamantyl-phenoxy-1,2-dioxetanes can glow from minutes to hours, depending on the specific substituent present on the dioxetane molecule. In order to improve the light emission properties produced by these chemiluminescent luminophores, it is necessary to induce the chemiexcitation rate to a flash mode wherein the bulk of light is emitted instantly rather than slowly over time. We report the realization of this goal through the incorporation of spirostrain release into decomposition of 1,2-dioxetane luminophores. DFT computational simulations provided support for the hypothesis that the spiro-cyclobutyl accelerates chemiexcitation as compared to the unstrained adamantyl substituent. Spiro-linking of cyclobutane and oxetane units led to greater than 100-fold and 1000-fold emission enhancement, respectively. This accelerated chemiexcitation rate increases the detection sensitivity for known chemiluminescent probes to the highest signal-to-noise ratio documented to date. A turn-ON probe, containing a spiro-cyclobutyl unit, for detecting the enzyme \u03b2-galactosidase, exhibited a Limit-of-Detection value that is 125-fold more sensitive than the previously described adamantyl analogue.

The ability to enhance the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) by several state-of-the-art design techniques, including the structural modification in materials, has been a long sought-after goal in solid-state physics and materials science. Very recently, the experimental realization of potential room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductivity was reported for Cu-substituted lead apatite, Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO4)6O (x~0.9-1.0), so-called LK-99 material. Nonetheless, important questions remain unresolved, particularly, understanding how the arrangements of substituted Cu on Pb sites in the LK-99 structure would minimize system's energy and might affect its electronic structure. We address these relevant questions by enumerating possible configurations of Cu in Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO4)6O at 10% Cu substitution and performing density functional theory with Hubbard  U correction (DFT+U) calculations of structural and electronic properties of selected configurations. We find that for (1x1x2) supercell, the most energetically favorable substitution sites are the nearest Pb(1) and Pb(2). The partially filled electronic state calculated at the Brillouin zone center is spatially localized around the Cu atom. For the low-energy configuration of single Cu substitution, we find that one electronic band is very flat with a narrow bandwidth of 0.06 eV.

This drive for material innovation continues to captivate a burgeoning community of early-career researchers with backgrounds in chemistry and material science. However, new to the field, they are often equipped only with the insight provided by the original Bychkov-Rashba model. Furthermore, daunted by the tight-binding perspective on the non-vanishing orbital angular momentum (OAM), they struggle to accurately account for the atomic spin-orbit iteration (SOI) in the formation of GSS. To address these challenges and equip young chemists with better-suited tools, this review aims to provide a more intuitive perspective on atomic interactions (orbital hybridization), structure symmetry, and atomic SOI in the formation of GSS. In pursuit of this goal, the review explores the Bychkov-Rashba model, its advantages, and limitations. Subsequently, it introduces the orbital framework, wherein GSS is modulated by atomic SOI and the interplay of OAM with the surface electrostatic field. Given the explicit dependence of both these factors on OAM, the review examines why OAM is typically quenched in crystal structures and how chemical bonds involving different orbital types can lead to its non-zero values in the presence of inversion symmetry breaking. Finally, with this chemistry-focused perspective, the review examines the rise of GSS in selected examples in selected materials.", "date": "2023-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study, we evaluated how four characteristics of influent wastewaters (electrolyte pH, composition, sulfide concentration, and buffer strength) affect sulfide removal metrics (sulfide removal rate, sulfide removal efficiency) and sulfate production metrics (sulfate production rate, sulfate production selectivity). We identified that electrolyte pH (3x differences in sulfide removal rate within the studied pH range) and sulfide concentration (16x difference in removal rate) were the most influential factors for electrochemical sulfide removal. Sulfate production was most sensitive to buffer strength (6x difference in sulfate production rate) and insensitive to electrolyte composition. Together, these results provide recommendations for the design of wastewater treatment trains and the feasibility of applying electrochemical methods to varying sulfide-containing wastewaters.

However, experimental determination of the crystal structure of intermediate species formed during the discharge/charge cycle can often be challenging. Incomplete X-ray diffraction patterns can also lead to difficulties in crystal structure determination for ROMs used in batteries. Use of a semiempirical electronic structure method for CSP helps to avoid force field reparameterization for different species, sometimes with complex electronic structure, formed during battery operation.

A broad variety of methods, including thermogravimetry analysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, low energy ion scattering, X-ray absorption near edge structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy-mass spectrometry, and density functional theory calculations were used to analyze the reactant and the resulting samples. The factors affecting the zinc loading (wt%) on ZrO2 were investigated by varying the ALD reaction temperature (160 \u00b0C\u2013240 \u00b0C), the calcination temperature of zirconium oxide (400 \u00b0C\u20131000 \u00b0C) and the ALD cycle number (up to three). The studied process showed self-terminating behavior, with the areal number density of zinc of approximately two atoms per square nanometer per cycle. Zinc was distributed throughout ZrO2. After the Zn(acac)2 reaction, acac ligands were removed using synthetic air at 500 \u00b0C. In the following cycles, the already-deposited ZnO acted as nuclei for further ZnO growth. This study demonstrates the potential of Zn(acac)2 as an ALD reactant and provides an initial understanding of ZnO growth via ALD on high surface area porous particles as an example for catalytic applications.

To reach these goals at all, let alone efficiently, requires thoughtful, strategic, and creative problem solving. Often this means bold and unprecedented disconnections that would simplify access, if only the methods existed to bridge these theoretical gaps. Whereas biological interrogations provide long-term intellectual value and impetus, methods come as attractive fringe benefits of natural product synthesis. This Account describes methodological solutions to the syntheses of natural  1 products\u2014(\u2013)-eugenial C, Galbulimima alkaloids GB18, GB22, GB13, and himgaline\u2014 featuring new, convergent disconnections as important problem-solving steps, which themselves were inspired by recent methods that arose from our group. Each target required the invention of first row transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling procedures to satisfy the biological goals of the project. In these cases, synthetic strategy identified the methodological gap\u2014the absence of stereo- and chemoselective couplings of appropriate fragments\u2014but the tactical advantage conferred by first row metals met the challenge. These methods were competent to handle the dense, sterically encumbered motifs common to natural products, due to, in many cases, elementary steps that did not require bond formation between the hindered substrate and the metal center (i.e. inner-sphere steps), instead engaging metal ligands (i.e. outer-sphere steps). Optimized access to bioactive natural product space led to an accelerated timeline of biological characterization, fulfilling a common promise of natural products research. The integration of complex natural product synthesis, diversification and bioassay into a single PhD dissertation would have been unmanageable in a prior era. The unique ability of first row transition metals to effect Csp3- Csp3 cross-coupling with high chemo- and stereoselectivity has significantly lowered the barrier to reach the avowed goal of natural product synthesis and reduced the burden (real or perceived) of integrating natural products into functional campaigns.

In this work we report on peri-anthracenethioindigo (PAT) as molecular scaffold for highly efficient all-red-light photoswitching with outstanding performance and property profile. The PAT photoswitch provides NIR absorption up to 850 nm, large negative photochromism with more than 140 nm maxima shifts and changes color from green to blue upon irradiation with two shades of red light. Thermal stability of the metastable Z isomer is high with a corresponding half-life of several days at 20 \u00b0C. Application for red-light responsive polymers undergoing pronounced and reversible green to blue color changes is demonstrated evidencing spatially resolved photoswitching.

However, despite some promising solutions, little to no attempts have targeted the full heterogeneous catalyst discovery workflow, with most chemistry laboratories continuing to perform research with a traditional one-at-a-time experiment approach and limited digitization. In this work, we present a closed-loop data-driven approach targeting the optimization of catalysts\u2019 composition for the direct transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into methanol, by combining Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, automated synthesis by incipient wetness impregnation and high-throughput catalytic performance evaluation in fixed bed mode. The BO algorithm optimized a four-objective function simultaneously (high CO2 conversion, high methanol selectivity, low methane selectivity, and low metal cost) with a total of 11 parameters (4 supports, 6 metals salts, and one promoter). In 6 weeks, 144 catalysts were synthesized and tested, with limited manual laboratory activity. The results show a significant improvement in the objectives at the end of each iteration. Between the first and fifth catalyst generation, the average CO2 conversion and methanol formation rates have been multiplied by 5.7 and 12.6 respectively, while simultaneously reducing the methane production rate by 3.2 and dividing the metal cost by 6.3 times. Notably, through the exploration process, the BO algorithm rapidly focuses on copper-based catalysts supported on zirconia doped with Zinc and/or Cerium, with the best catalysts, according to the model, showing an optimized composition of 1.85wt% Cu, 0.69wt% Zn, and 0.05wt% Ce supported on ZrO2. When changing the objective, i.e. removing the metal cost as a constrain, the BO algorithm suggests compositions centered on Indium-based catalysts, highlighting an alternative family of catalysts, testifying of the algorithm adaptability and the reusability of the data when targeting different objectives. In only 30 days, the BO, coupled with automated synthesis and high-throughput testing, has been able to replicate the major development stages in the field of heterogeneous catalysts research for CO2 conversion to methanol, made over of the last 100 years with a conventional experimental approach. This data-driven approach proves to be very efficient in exploring and optimizing catalyst composition from the vast multi-parameter space towards multiple performance objectives simultaneously and could be easily extrapolated to different parameter spaces, objectives, and be transposed to other applications.", "date": "2023-09-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The U(II) compounds unexpectedly display similar two-line axial signals with g|| = 2.04 and g\u22a5 = 2.00 at 77 K and U(III)-like spectra at 5 K.

The Ce(II) complex with a 4f15d1 configuration is also EPR silent, but a signal is observed for the Pr(II) complex, which has a 4f25d1 configuration.  Whether or not an EPR signal is expected for these complexes depends on the coupling between f and d electrons.  If the coupling is sufficiently strong, no signal is expected for ions with an even number of electrons, which is the observation for the lanthanide species.  If the coupling is very weak, separate EPR signals for the f and d systems might be observed even in systems with an even number of electrons.  The Coulomb interaction between 5f and 6d electrons is strong in trivalent uranium systems, which results in strong coupling between the 5f and 6d electrons.  This coupling will be weaker in divalent uranium systems, but it is still expected to be sufficiently strong to preclude an EPR signal from compounds with a 5f36d1 configuration.

Recent literature has brought an array of evidence that rotation around the central C=C bond constitutes main route of deexcitation in solution, and that its restriction in solid-state leads to aggregation-induced emission (AIE) in this family of derivatives. However, the influence of substitution on the dynamics of TPEs in solution has so far received little attention, probably because of the difficulty in efficiently separating (E) and (Z) isomers. Here we report the photophysical properties in solution of extended stereopure TPE derivatives. The introduction of triphenylamine (TPA) substituent results in differences in the spectral properties between the (E) and (Z) isomers, thereby allowing modulation of the photostationary state (PSS) and thus switching in the equilibrium between these two forms depending on the irradiation wavelength. Importantly, we show that this photochromism is observed with a very marked decrease in the photoisomerization quantum yields (\u03a6iso) of TPE-TPA, compared to non-extended TPE derivatives, which we attribute to the so called \u201camino conjugation effect\u201d already reported for several stilbene derivatives.

The set of MS/MS spectra automatically assigned to proteolytic type 2 peptides with a thiosuccinimide linker and its stabilized products (thiazine and hydrolyzed species), contains valuable information on the conjugation sites. Sample processing before LC-MS/MS analysis transforms the thiosuccinimide linker into its stabilized products. The MS/MS spectra of type 2 peptides must be validated based on objective criteria. The extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) has not been considered previously for this purpose. In the LC-MS/MS analysis, linear peptides eluted in a one-fraction XIC as expected. On the contrary, depending on the analyzed proteolytic digestion, the type 2 peptides with a thiazine linker were detected in 77-100 % of the cases with a two-fraction XIC pattern, probably composed by a mixture of diastereomers. Type 2 peptides with the hydrolyzed thiosuccinimide linker were detected with a mixed-pattern XIC in two, three and four elution fractions in 77 %, 15 % and 8 % of the cases, respectively. The four-fraction XIC pattern is probably composed by the full-chromatographic separation of type 2 peptides cross-linked by two positional isomers of the thiosuccinamic acid linker containing a chiral carbon. Tandem digestions increased the number of type 2 peptides detected with a multiple-fractions XIC pattern.

Tierney; Kim C. Williamson; V. Ann Stewart; Charles R. Mace", "abstract": "The accurate and efficient measurement of white blood cell (WBC) counts is vital for monitoring general patient health and can aid in diagnosing a range of possible infections or diseases. Even with their importance universally acknowledged, access to WBC counts is largely limited to those with access to phlebotomists and centralized clinical laboratories, which house the instrumentation that perform the tests. As a result, large populations of people (e.g., those that are home-bound or live in remote locations) lack facile access to testing. Dried blood spot (DBS) cards are often used to bridge these gaps in access to testing by offering the ability to collect blood at home for ambient shipping to laboratories. However, it is well understood that these cards, which are prepared from cellulose cardstocks without further modification, suffer from variabilities in accuracy and precision due to uncontrolled sample spreading and hematocrit effects, which has hindered their use to determine WBC counts. In this manuscript, we present a method to obtain an accurate WBC count using a patterned dried blood spot (pDBS) card, which comprises collection zones that meter volumes of dried blood. We demonstrate that, unlike the gold standard DBS card (Whatman 903), our pDBS design allows for the collection of a reproducible, average volume of blood volume over the range of hematocrits from 25\u201355%. We then used qPCR to quantify the 18S rRNA gene to determine WBC counts from the volumes of blood that are metered in pDBS zones. We observe that WBC counts generated from our method are comparable to those measured by a HemoCue point-of-care WBC analyzer. Our approach to using pDBS cards as a blood collection device has the potential to support at-home sampling and other patient populations that need WBC counts but lack access to clinical facilities.

Yet, the accuracy needs to be improved with more structural data from high throughput experiments, which are challenging to generate, especially for dynamic and weak associations. Herein, we applied native mass spectrometry (native MS) to rapidly characterize ligand binding of an allosteric heterodimeric complex of SARS-CoV-2 two nonstructural proteins (nsp) nsp10 and nsp16 (nsp10/16). Native MS showed that the dimer is in equilibrium with monomeric states in solution. Consistent with literature, well characterized small co-substrate, RNA substrate and product bind with high specificity and affinity to the dimer but not the free monomers. Unsuccessfully designed ligands bind indiscriminately to all forms. Using neutral gas collision, the nsp16 monomer with bound co-substrate can be released from the holo dimer complex, confirming the binding to nsp16 as revealed by the crystal structure. However, an unusual migration of the endogenous zinc ions bound to nsp10 to nsp16 after collisional dissociation was observed, and can be suppressed using an alternative surface collision method at reduced precursor charge states. This highlighted the importance of careful optimization of experimental techniques. Overall, with minimal sample input (~\u00b5g), native MS can rapidly detect ligand binding affinities and locations in dynamic multi-subunit protein complexes, demonstrating the potential of an \u201call-in-one\u201d native MS assay for rapid structural profiling of protein-to-AI-based compound systems to expedite drug discovery.", "date": "2023-09-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To overcome these hurdles and promote the widespread use of SERS, novel approaches for the synthesis of efficient and reproducible SERS probes are still needed. Here, we introduce \"LipoGold Tags\", an innovative and extremely simple platform where gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) clusters are formed by exploiting the self-assembly of AuNPs on the lipid membrane of synthetic vesicles. We show that citrate-stabilized AuNPs spontaneously associate with the membrane of synthetic vesicles forming controlled clusters. Raman-active molecules embedded in the lipid bilayer experience a high enhancement of the electromagnetic field due to the AuNP plasmon coupling, increasing their Raman signals of several orders of magnitude. We optimize SERS enhancement by systematic exploration of RRs and lipid vesicle concentrations and provide a robust structural characterization through techniques like Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). We further explore the versatility of this approach by functionalizing LipoGold tags with specific targeting antibodies.

We benchmarked the binding energies and structures and found the B97-3c method to be a good com- promise between accuracy and computational cost for studying large cluster systems. Further, we carefully assessed configurational sampling procedures for targeting large atmospheric molecular clusters containing up to 30 molecules (approx. 2 nm in diameter) and propose a funneling approach with highly improved accuracy. We find that several parallel ABCluster explorations lead to better guesses for the cluster global energy minimum structures than one long exploration.

Consistent results from the XRD analysis demonstrate the Al2O3 and MoO3 artificial CEI can reduce the Li-Ni mixing. To shed light on the oxidation-reduction kinetic. The modified NMC811 structures with Al2O3 and MoO3 represented a remarkable improvement in terms of capacity retention. The coated cathode with Al2O3 clearly outperformed the modified configuration with MoO3 with reference to ionic conductivity, charge/discharge reversibility, and capacity retention. The promising results obtained in this study opened possibilities to synthesize the Ni-rich cathodes with boosted electrochemical performance.

The molecular structure and energy in low-spin singlet, high-spin quintet as well as intermediate spin triplet is calculated.  It is found that the molecule is stable in its LS state but can undergo spin crossover upon irradiation of UV-vis light via triplet excited states. The singlet excited states are close-lying, forming a band structure. The detailed mechanism of LISCO is proposed based on the calculated potential energy cuts and spin-orbit coupling values.  While the LS state of the complex has Ms=0 and diamagnetic, the HS state  has Ms=\u00b12 and paramagnetic. The calculations suggest a positive zero field splitting parameter and  a reasonably small E/D value with a high magnetic relaxation barrier of 96 cm-1. Therefore, for a good SMM, the complex has to be trapped in its HS state after the SCO and reverse spin-crossover (rSCO) has to be stopped.

Nonetheless, the reactivity of adsorbed water and hydroxyl groups is rarely considered. We demonstrate that water and hydroxyl groups can not only directly participate in the catalytic oxidation processes but are also able to generate and stabilize the catalytically active metal-oxide interface. We show that the reduction of Pt-Fe-supported catalysts with hydrogen in the presence of adsorbed water or steam allows for achieving one of the highest preferential carbon monoxide oxidation activities at ambient temperature. These conditions create active iron-associated hydroxyl groups next to platinum nanoparticles with enhanced reactivity towards carbon mon-oxide oxidation. Density functional theory calculations suggest that hydroxylation of oxidic iron species stabilizes the FeOx(OH)y/Pt interface, via strong metal-support interaction, which is confirmed by chemisorption measurements.

Variants with 50% and 69% Hartree--Fock exchange (HFX) are empirically optimized (Pr\u00b2SCAN50 and Pr\u00b2SCAN69), and the effect of MP2-regularization (\u03baPr\u00b2SCAN50) and range-separated HFX (\u03c9Pr\u00b2SCAN50) is evaluated.  All optimized functionals are combined with the state-of-the-art London dispersion corrections D4 and NL. The resulting functionals are assessed comprehensively for their performance on main-group and metal-organic thermochemistry on 90 different benchmark sets containing 25800 data points.  These include the extensive GMTKN55 database, additional sets for main-group chemistry, and multiple sets for transition-metal complexes including the ROST61, the MOR41, and the MOBH35 sets. As the main target of this study is the development of a broadly applicable, robust functional with low empiricism, special focus is put on variants with moderate amounts of HFX (50%) which are compared to the so far successful PWPB95-D4 (50% HFX, 20% MP2 correlation) functional.  The overall best variant, \u03c9Pr\u00b2SCAN50-D4, performs well on main-group and metal-organic thermochemistry, followed by the Pr\u00b2SCAN69-D4 that offers a slight edge for metal-organic thermochemistry, and by the low HFX global double-hybrid Pr\u00b2SCAN50-D4 that performs robustly across all tested sets. All four optimized functionals, Pr\u00b2SCAN69-D4, Pr\u00b2SCAN50-D4, \u03baPr\u00b2SCAN50-D4, and \u03c9Pr\u00b2SCAN50-D4 outperform the PWPB95-D4 functional.", "date": "2023-09-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This article describes a nickel-catalyzed electrochemical method for producing alkyl carboxylic acids via carboxylation of unactivated alkyl chlorides with CO2. The development of a Ni pincer complex (complex 1) with a redox-active ligand as an electrocatalyst to convert unactivated alkyl chlorides to the corresponding acids over less desirable homocoupling products is presented. Electronic structure calculations revealed that CO2 binding occurs in a resting state to yield an 2-CO2 adduct and that the C-Cl bond activation step is the TOF-determining transition state, which has an activation energy of 19.3 kcal/mol. A combination of electroanalytical methods, control experiments, and computational studies revealed the mechanism of the electrocarboxylation reaction.

We traced the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Au-coated JNPs to both increased light absorption due to Au acting as an optical antenna, and inhibited recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. These two effects increase the production of hydroxyl radicals, accelerating the degradation of 1,4-dioxane. The reduced electron/hole recombination is due to two factors: the Schottky barrier that forms between Au and TiO2 (which drives photogenerated electrons from TiO2 into the metal), and stoichiometric changes in the TiO2 that accompany gold sputtering which facilitate electron sequestration by the metal. In contrast, self-propulsion and surface plasmon resonance play at most a minor role.

An open question is whether simplified synthetic cells can gain similar complex functionality by being driven away from equilibrium. Here we describe a dynamic synthetic cell system assembled using artificial lipids responsive to both light and chemical stimuli. Irradiation of disordered aggregates of lipids leads to the spontaneous emergence of giant cell-like vesicles, which revert to aggregates when illumination is turned off. Under irradiation, the synthetic cell membranes can interact with chemical building blocks, remodeling their composition and forming new structures that prevent the membranes from undergoing retrograde aggregation processes. The remodeled light-responsive synthetic cells reversibly alter their shape under irradiation, transitioning from spheres to rod-like shapes, mimicking energy dependent functions normally restricted to living materials. In the presence of non-covalently interacting multivalent polymers, light-driven shape changes can be used to trigger vesicle crosslinking, leading to the formation of functional synthetic tissues. By controlling light and chemical inputs, the stepwise one-pot transformation of lipid aggregates to multivesicular synthetic tissues is feasible.

Numerous compounds are known to deracemize, including many of biological relevance, which suggests the existence of a general governing mechanism. Yet pinning down such mechanism has been difficult, controversial, and not conclusive. Here we use a simplified formulation of the classical population balance model of deracemization through temperature cycles that includes neither agglomeration, nor breakage, nor ripening, to prove an exact condition under which deracemization occurs: crystal dissolution must be faster than crystal growth. Such kinetic asymmetry is a fundamental principle of crystallization, which explains the general success of deracemization experiments in the literature. Our theoretical analysis allows predicting that deracemization occurs for any amplitude of the temperature cycles, however small, and even for random temperature fluctuations. Here we demonstrate through ad hoc experiments that these predictions are correct.

Here, we introduce an original microfluidic concept for constrain-free confinement of individual GUVs in microchambers with a dynamically exchangeable outer medium. With this method, GUVs self-confine in an array of laterally separated microchambers by sedimentation, avoiding any mechanical constrain and membrane deformation while allowing time-resolved microscopy observation.  A microfluidic channel above the chambers allows a diffusion-based exchange of the GUV outer medium that can be completed in a few seconds for fast-diffusing molecules to about one minute for large proteins in a viscous medium. We numerically establish the geometric and flow parameters optimizing medium exchange while preventing GUV from lifting out. We experimentally demonstrate that different aqueous solutions separated by air plugs can be flowed into the channel by taking advantage of a polydimethylsiloxane-based hydrophilic channel wall.

We find in particular that the membrane-targeting sequence of Bacillus subtilis MinD binds to GUVs and induces extensive membrane tubulation.

Yet, the effective delivery of hydrophobic drugs via the oral route is often hindered by their limited water solubility and first-pass metabolism. To mitigate these challenges, advanced delivery systems such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been developed to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs and enhance their bioavailability. However, traditional design methodologies for these complex formulations often present intricate challenges because they are restricted to a relatively narrow design space. Here, we present a data-driven approach for the accelerated design of SLNs/NLCs encapsulating a model hydrophobic drug, cannabidiol, that combines experimental automation and machine learning. A small subset of formulations, comprising 10% of all formulations in the design space, was prepared in-house, leveraging miniaturized experimental automation to improve throughput and decrease the quantity of drug and materials required. Machine learning models were then trained on the data generated from these formulations and used to predict properties of all SLNs/NLCs within this design space (i.e., estimated to be more than 1200 formulations). Notably, formulations predicted to be high-performers via this approach were confirmed to significantly enhance the solubility of the drug by up to 3000-fold and prevent drug degradation.  Moreover, our high-performance formulations significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of the drug compared to both its free form and an over-the-counter version. Furthermore, this bioavailability matched that of a formulation equivalent in composition to the FDA-approved product, Epidiolex\u00ae.", "date": "2023-09-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

This inflation in search space leads to an increase in random high-scoring matches, resulting in fewer identifications at a given false discovery rate. Peptide-spectrum match rescoring has emerged as a machine learning-based solution to address challenges in mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics data analysis. It involves post-processing unfiltered spectrum annotations to better distinguish between correct and incorrect peptide-spectrum matches.

Heterologous expression can help realize bioinformatics predictions into products. However, challenges remain such as gene cluster prioritization, cloning of the complete gene cluster, appropriate expression, product identification, and isolation of products in practical yields. Here we reviewed the literature from the past five years (January 2018 to June 2023) to identify studies that discovered natural products by heterologous expression. From the 50 studies identified, we present analyses of the rationale for gene cluster prioritization, cloning methods, biosynthetic class, source taxa, and host choice.

The prototypical molecule-surface system is CO adsorbed on MgO, but despite intense scrutiny from theory and experiment, there is still no consensus on its adsorption energy. In particular, the large cost of accurate many-body methods makes reaching converged theoretical estimates difficult, generating a wide range of values. In this work, we address this challenge, leveraging the latest advances in diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory [CCSD(T)], to obtain accurate predictions for CO on MgO. These reliable theoretical estimates allow us to evaluate the inconsistencies in published temperature programmed desorption experiments, revealing that they arise from variations in employed pre-exponential factors. Utilizing this insight, we derive new experimental estimates of the (electronic) adsorption energy with a (more) precise pre-exponential factor. As a culmination of all this effort, we are able to reach consensus between multiple theoretical calculations and multiple experiments for the first time. In addition, we show that our recently developed cluster-based CCSD(T) approach provides a low cost route towards achieving accurate adsorption energies.

The performance of the SMMs is measured generally via the barrier height for magnetization reversal (Ueff) and blocking temperature (TB), below which the magnetization is fully frozen. To enhance the Ueff and TB values in lanthanide-based SMMs, the static crystal field splitting of mJ levels has been effectively adjusted through ligand design, leveraging the oblate/prolate ground state 4f electron density shape. However, the maximum fine-tuning that can be achieved via ligand design called the axial limit is already reached in this class of compounds and demand new design principle to enhance the SMM characteristics to suit end-user applications. Among other avenues that can be explored to improve the SMM characteristics, a deeper understanding of spin-phonon coupling, critical to advancing TB values, offers numerous advantages. However, there are only a  handful of examples where this is deciphered. In this work, using a combination of DFT and ab initio CASSCF calculations, we have performed spin-phonon calculations of five classes of pseudo D5h Dy(III) SIMs exhibiting TB value in the range of 4.5 K to 36 K ([Dy(bbpen)Br] (1, H2bbpen=N,N\u2032-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-N,N\u2032-bis(2-methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine), [Dy(OCMe3)Br(THF)5][BPh4] (2)  [Dy(OSiMe3)Br(THF)5] [BPh4] (3), [Dy(LN5)(Ph3SiO)2](BPh4).CH2Cl2 (4) and [L2Dy(H2O)5][I]3.L2.H2O (5, L = tBuPO(NHiPr)2)). The approach provided here not only reduces the computational cost but also suggests chemical intuition to improve the performance of this class of compounds. Our calculations reveal that low-energy vibrational modes govern the magnetization relaxation in these SIMs. A flexible first coordination sphere found on some of the complexes was found to be responsible for low-energy vibrations that flip the magnetization reducing the TB values drastically (complexes 2 and 3).On the other hand, a rigid first coordination sphere and a stiff ligand framework move the spin-vibrational coupling that causes the relaxation to lie beyond the secondary coordination sphere resulting in the increase of TB values. Learning from this exercise, we have undertaken several in silico models based on these vibrations to improvise the TB values. Some of these predictions were correlated to literature precedents, offering confidence in the methodology employed. To this end, our comprehensive investigation, involving twenty-three molecules/models and five sets of geometries for the pseudo D5h Dy(III) single-ion magnets (SIMs), unveils a treasure trove of chemically sound design clues, poised to enhance the TB values in this fascinating molecular realm.\n\u2003\n", "date": "2023-09-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

(M,Sn)F2 fluorites have previously been proposed to exhibit two forms of disorder within their cationic host frameworks: occupational disorder from randomly distributed M and Sn cations, and orientational disorder from Sn(II) stereoactive lone pairs. Here, we characterise the structure and fluoride-ion\u2013dynamics of cubic-BaSnF4, using a combination of experimental and computational techniques. Rietveld refinement of XRD data confirms an average fluorite structure with {Ba,Sn} cation disorder, and the 119Sn Mo \u0308ssbauer spectrum demonstrates the presence of stereoactive Sn(II) lone pairs. X-ray total-scattering PDF analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal a complex local structure with a high degree of intrinsic fluoride-ion disorder, where 1/3 of fluoride ions occupy octahedral \u201cinterstitial\u201d sites: this fluoride-ion disorder is a consequence of repulsion between Sn lone pairs and fluoride ions that destabilises Sn-coordinated tetrahedral fluoride-ion sites. Variable-temperature 19F NMR experiments and analysis of our molecular dynamics simulations reveal highly inhomogeneous fluoride-ion dynamics, with fluoride ions in Sn-rich local environments significantly more mobile than those in Ba-rich environments. Our simulations also reveal dynamical reorientation of the Sn lone pairs that is biased by the local cation configuration and is coupled to the local fluoride-ion dynamics.

The effects of various parameters, including reaction time, reaction temperature, and the type of metal halide employed during synthesis, on the properties of the AgNWs are systematically investigated. The kinetics of AgNW formation are analyzed by temporal UV-Vis spectroscopy and TEM. To elaborate on the complexity of the metal halide employed during the production of silver nanowires, we have conducted various sets of experiments revealing the role of the metal in classical polyol synthesis. We have demonstrated that even though the stoichiometric ratio of Ag+/Cl- is kept constant, the type of halide source is directly related to the formation of high-yield silver nanowires. The optimized synthesis conditions are found to result in AgNWs with high aspect ratios to prepare a conductive ink with desired viscoelastic properties for direct writing applications. The AgNW ink prepared with a 4 wt.% PEO mixture can automatically level itself at the specified frequency, while the 5 wt.% solution requires an external force to spread out. The frequency sweep experiments revealed that both mixtures have a crossover point where their behavior changes. The crossover point for the 4 wt.% mixture is approximately 12 rad/s, whereas for the 5 wt.% mixture, it is 2.5 rad/s. As a result, the 5 wt.% mixture takes longer to spread out than the 4 wt.% mixture.

A prominent example is the recognition of histone trimethyllysine (Kme3) by the conserved aromatic cage of reader proteins, dictating gene expression. However, two proteins have recently been sug-gested as possible exceptions to conventional understanding of tetraalkylammonium recognition. To broadly interrogate the role of cation\u2212\u03c0 interactions in protein binding interactions, we report the first large-scale comparative evaluation of reader proteins for a neutral Kme3 isostere, experimental and computational mechanistic studies, and structural analysis. We find unexpected widespread binding of readers to a neutral isostere, with no single factor dictating charge selectivity, demonstrat-ing the challenge to predict such interactions. Further, readers that bind both cationic and neutral ligands display an unprece-dented change in mechanism: binding Kme3 via cation\u2212\u03c0 interactions and the neutral isostere through the hydrophobic effect in the same aromatic cage.

Thus, the microcapsules can be dried and rehydrated multiple times or shrunken in sodium chloride salt solutions without getting damaged. Moreover, the APCNs are semipermeable for hydrophilic organic compounds, while being impermeable for macromolecules and colloids. Thus, they can be loaded with macromolecules or nanoparticles during microfluidic formation, and with organic molecules after capsule synthesis.

To broaden the scope of organogold complexes for covalent protein post-translational modification in cancer cells, an oxime-containing C^N-cyclometalated gold(III) compound was synthesised featuring a carboxylic acid group for either immobilisation on amine-bearing solid support (Au), or functionalisation with a fluorescent tag (Au-Fluo). Live-cell imaging revealed that Au-Fluo distributed evenly into SW480 colon carcinoma cells, with a slight preference for the nuclear and nucleolar compartments. Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) was observed as the major interactor of Au from SW480 cell lysates in chemoproteomic approaches and a 2 : 1 binding stoichiometry resulted from titration-dependent pull-downs. Direct interactions confirmed a high reactivity of Au towards the catalytic CysSec-dyad at the C-terminus of TXNRD1 and revealed double arylation events at this motif.

In turn, honeycomb layered frameworks manifesting metallophilic bilayer arrangements of cations sandwiched between the transition metal cation slabs have recently garnered attention due to the presence of anomalous fractional valency state of the cations always accompanied by metallophilic interactions constituting the cationic bonds within the bilayered structure. The concepts needed to characterise the aforementioned peculiarities and other phenomena such as conductor-semiconductor-insulator phase transition and magnetoresistance in these materials cut across multi-disciplines ranging from materials science and solid-state chemistry to condensed matter physics, suggesting applications that fall beyond energy storage. This Review highlights the exciting advancements in the science of honeycomb layered frameworks with metallophilic bilayers. First, the latest tactics and techniques including but not limited to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) particularly necessary for characterising recent honeycomb layered frameworks with metallophilic bilayers are described, with emphasis on silver-based oxides. Second, new strategies and concepts related to topochemically- or temperature-induced cationic-deficient phases expanding the compositional space of honeycomb layered frameworks focused on cationic bilayer architectures are also accentuated.  Third, the latest condensed matter theoretic advances towards a full, atomistic description of the bilayered structure in such frameworks are detailed, especially related to critical phenomena at the cusp of the monolayer-bilayer phase transition. This entails, in part, describing honeycomb layered frameworks as optimised lattices within the congruent sphere packing problem, equivalent to a particular two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory. Within this picture, the monolayer-bilayer phase transition represents the bifurcation of the honeycomb lattice into its bipartite constituents, related to a 2D-to-3D crossover. Altogether, it is hoped that this Review will give the reader a panoramic view of the honeycomb layered frameworks with important applications within the emerging field of quantum matter, potentially redefining their frontier. Thus, the scope of this Review is expected to be worthwhile for recent graduates and emerging experts alike not only in the materials science and chemistry community but also in other diverse fields of interest.", "date": "2023-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Multilayers; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Theoretical spectroscopy is required to reveal the structure- spectroscopy relationship. Existing methods to compute theoretical spectra are restricted to the use of time- correlation functions evaluated from accurate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, often at the ab-initio level. The interpretation of the computed spectra requires additional steps to deconvolve the spectroscopic contributions from local water and surface structural populations at the interface. The lack of a standard procedure to do this often hampers rationalization. To overcome these challenges, we rewrite the equations for spectra calculation into a sum of partial contributions from interfacial populations, weighted by their abundance at the interface. We show that SFG signatures from each population can be parameterized into a minimum dataset of reference partial spectra. Accurate spectra can then be predicted by just evaluating the statistics of interfacial populations, which can be done even with force field simulations as well as with analytic models. This approach broadens the range of simulation techniques from which theoretical spectra can be calculated, opening toward non-atomistic and Monte Carlo simulation approaches. Most notably, it allows constructing accurate theoretical spectra for interfacial conditions that can not even be simulated, as we demonstrate for the pH-dependent SFG spectra of silica/water interfaces.", "date": "2023-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The effect of stereoselectivity of H2 addition to acetylene on the imbalance of ethylene NSIMs was experimentally demonstrated by using different heterogeneous catalysts (an immobilized Ir complex and two supported Pd catalysts). The interconversion of NSIMs with time during ethylene storage was studied with NMR spectroscopy by reacting ethylene with bromine water which renders the p-H2-derived protons in the produced 2-bromoethan(2H)ol (BrEtOD) magnetically inequivalent, thereby revealing the non-equilibrium nuclear spin order of ethylene. A thorough analysis of the shape and transformation of the 1H NMR spectra of hyperpolarized BrEtOD allowed us to reveal the initial distribution of produced ethylene NSIMs and their equilibration processes.

In this paper, we focus on investigating the impact of many factors such as the deformability of the channel-wall, yield stress, shear-thinning, and shear-thickening index in the presence of slip and compared it with flow dynamics with no-slips as predicted by Garg and Prasad [12]. Using lubrication theory, we have derived a model for the velocity profiles and flow rate using the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model in rigid and deformable shallow channels with slip-walls. To model deformable walls, we have utilized small displacement structural mechanics and perturbation theory presented by Gervais et al. [13] and Christov et al. [14], respectively. Our newly developed model encompasses the flow characteristics of Newtonian fluids, power-law fluids, and Bingham fluids, both with and without wall-slip, as observed in previous literature [13-16]. We find that the deformability increases the same effective channel height with and without wall-slip but the flow rate is increased more when slips are present within the channel. We find many scalings for the flow rate under different regimes of applied pressure and the deformability parameter. A threshold inlet pressure is required for the onset of yield-stress fluid flow in the channels unlike in the case of the Newtonian or power-law fluids. Garg and Prasad [12] finds that below this threshold, the flow is choked in the channels with plug height the same as the channel height: we find the same observations in the presence of slips. Although in case of deformable channels an early onset of flow with the pressure is found in comparison to the rigid channel.  We observe the back flow due to deformability in the channel when the yield surface is between $H_o/2 < H_p < (H_o+\\delta)/2$, where $H_o$ and $H_p$  represents the initial height of the channel without deformability and the yield surface\u2019s height, respectively. $\\delta$ is the increase in channel's height due to deformability. Beyond choked flow, the plug height decreases for both the rigid and the deformable channels with the pressure. We also observe that for any given applied pressure and yield stress, the $(H_p)_{\\text{deformable}} < (H_p)_{\\text{rigid}}$. This suggests that deformable walls decrease the plug region in comparison to the rigid channel. We also find that the wall-slip has no effect on the plug region and the onset of flow. In the presences of wall-slip, we also find that increasing the yield stress leads to a decrease in the velocity in the plug flow as well as in the non-plug flow regions. Increasing yield stress also leads to increasing the yield surface height and the solid plug in the central region due to which there is decrease in the flow rate similar to as found by Garg and Prasad [12]. Further, we also find that the shear thinning/thickening index does not affect the plug height, although as the index increases, the flow rate starts to decrease due to the corresponding increase in shear thickening of the material.", "date": "2023-09-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Nanofluidics; Fluid Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The different metrics target different properties and we show how to interpret them, but we generally find the best overall validation to be done based on the error-based calibration plot introduced by Levi et al.

Here, we present two cationic organic scaffolds viz. DADAB.TFA and DATzTz.TFA that exhibit rapid Anilinium-to-Azonium (Ano-Azo) ESIPT resulting in unique photophysical and photochemical outcomes. Strong 5-membered and 6-membered intramolecular hydrogen bonding (IHB) in DADAB.TFA and DATzTz.TFA, respectively, ensured the structural rigidity and planarity necessary for ESIPT. It also rendered DADAB.TFA emissive, with a moderate Stokes shift of 6597 cm-1 in H2O along with Anti-Kasha behaviour of excitation-dependent (Ex-De) emission. On the other hand, the DATzTz.TFA showed a large Stokes shift of 10209 cm-1 (in acetone). The emission of DADABH2+2 from its tautomeric azonium state gained prominence with the acidity of the protonating species. This was employed to achieve single-component white light emission (WLE) using DATzTz.TFA. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) provided the lifetime of excited state absorption (ESA) as 0.85 ps for DADAB.TFA, whereas the lifetime of 1.2 ps was observed for stimulated emission (SE).

In this report, we describe the development of native ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and collision induced unfolding (CIU) for the structural characterization of a variety of RNAs. We evaluate the ability of these techniques to preserve native structural features into the gas-phase across a wide range of functional RNAs.

Our data demonstrate that our experimentally determined conditions preserve some solution-state memory of RNA via the increasing complexity of CIU fingerprints by RNA HOS and the retention of predicted magnesium binding events. Relating to the role of MELAS-inducing mutations in mitochondrial trans-fer RNA (mt-tRNAs), significant differences in collision cross-section (CCS) and stability are observed as a function of the A3243G mutation across a subset of the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) maturation pathway.

We measured the capacity of the PLL-coated channels to resist changes in pH in flow using a pH-sensitive indicator, phenol red, and showed that this capacity can be increased by employing polyelectrolyte multilayers.

The compaction of DNA in vivo is mediated by cationic proteins; histone in somatic nuclei and protamines in sperm chromatin. The extreme, near-crystalline packaging of DNA by protamines in spermatozoa is thought essential for both efficient genetic delivery as well as DNA protection against damage by mutagens and oxidative species. The protective role of protamine is required in sperm as they are sensitive to ROS damage due to the progressive loss of DNA repair mechanisms during maturation. The degree to how DNA packaging directly relates to DNA protection in the condensed state, however, is poorly understood. Here, we utilized different polycation condensing agents to achieve varying DNA packaging densities and quantify DNA damage by free radical oxidation within the condensates. Although we see that tighter DNA packaging generally leads to better protection, the length of the polycation also plays a significant role. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that longer polyarginine chains offer increased protection by occupying more space on the DNA surface and forming more stable interactions. Taken together, our results suggest a complex interplay between polycation properties, DNA packaging density, and DNA protection against free radical damage within condensed states.", "date": "2023-09-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Polymer Science; Biophysics; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Bacterial INs consist of extended protein units that aggregate to achieve superior functionality. Despite decades of research, the nature and identity of fungal INs remain elusive.

We demonstrate that fungal INs are composed of small 5.3 kDa protein subunits which assemble into ice nucleating complexes that can contain more than 100 subunits. Fusarium INs retain high ice-nucleation activity even when only the ~12 kDa fraction of size-excluded proteins are initially present, suggesting robust pathways for their functional aggregation in cell-free aqueous environments.

Some combinations of protons and neutrons induce the nucleus to behave like a microscopic magnet, possessing a unique magnitude and orientation known as the nuclear magnetic moment (\u00b5). When the numbers of protons and neutrons are both even then \u00b5=0, but otherwise each nuclide nuclear magnetic moment is unique. A second unique nuclear physical property relates to the nucleon binding energy (BE), which can be thought of as the energy between protons and neutrons bound within the nucleus. The sequence of stable nuclides increases one nucleon at a time through 36Ar. The binding energy associated with the addition of each successive nucleon (\u2206BE) through this progression is unique. The hypothesis here is that the unique non-zero magnetic moment and \u2206 binding energy of each nuclide derive from its respective microscopic nuclear structure, analogous to the way that the atomic physical properties of an element ultimately derive from its unique electron orbital structure. By extension, the identification of nuclear periodic patterns might eventually inform a theory of nuclear structure. The light, stable nuclides through 36Ar were arranged in ascending order according to atomic mass, and their nuclear magnetic moments and binding energies were evaluated for periodic patterns. Fixed-period lengths from 4 through 18 nuclides per period were considered. These fixed periods, each of equal length, were stacked one upon the other and analyzed for vertical trends.

However, their mechanical properties have not been systematically studied yet. Here, the machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) was developed to study the elastic properties of representative 2D COFs, e.g., COF-1 and COF-5. The trained NEP enables one to study the mechanical properties of 2D COFs in realistic situations (e.g., finite size and temperature) and enjoys greatly improved computational efficiency as compared with density functional theory calculations. With the aid of the obtained NEP, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations together with the strain fluctuation method were employed to evaluate the elastic constants of the considered 2D COFs at different temperatures. The elastic constants of COF-1 and COF-5 monolayers are found to decrease with growing temperature, though they are almost isotropic, irrespective of the temperature. The thermally induced softening of 2D COFs below a critical temperature is majorly attributed to their inherent ripple configurations at finite temperatures, while, above the critical temperature, the damping effect of anharmonic vibrations becomes the dominant factor. Based on the proposed mechanisms, analytical models were developed for capturing the temperature dependence of the elastic constants, which were found to agree with MD simulation results well.

Inappropriate regulation of CDKs has been implicated in driving several different forms of cancer.

Cyclins are overexpressed in several different cancers, hence activating their relevant CDK. Hyperactive CDK2 in particular is implicated in many cancers, and while many drugs have shown preclinical promise, none have successfully passed through clinical development. Among the complications of targeting CDK2 is the fact that non-classical cyclin partners from the Speedy/RINGO family of proteins can alter the conformation of the kinase. Using computational approaches, we provide data supporting that the active site of CDK2 differs when bound to Spy1 as compared to classical cyclins. Furthermore, combining computational models with experimental techniques we provide data that many small molecule inhibitors have reduced activity against Spy1-bound CDKs.

However, the computational tools that predict the favorable enzyme scaffolds for separating racemic substrate mixture are underdeveloped. To address this challenge, we trained a deep learning framework, EnzyKR, to automate the selection of hydrolases for stereoselective biocatalysis. EnzyKR adopts a classifier-regressor architecture that first identifies the reactive binding conformer of an enantiomer-hydrolase complex, and then predicts its activation free energy. A structure-based encoding strategy was used to depict the chiral interactions between hydrolases and enantiomers. Different from existing models trained on protein sequence and substrate SMILES strings, EnzyKR was trained using 204 enantiomer-hydrolase complexes, which were constructed by docking based on the enzyme and substrate structures curated from IntEnzyDB. EnzyKR was tested using a held-out dataset of 20 complexes on the task of active free energy prediction. EnzyKR achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.72, a Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Spearman R) of 0.72, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.54 kcal/mol in its active free energy prediction task. Furthermore, EnzyKR was tested on the task of predicting enantiomeric excess ratios for 28 hydrolytic kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by fluoroacetate dehalogenase RPA1163, halohydrin HheC, A. mediolanus epoxide hydrolase, and P. fluorescens esterase. The performance of EnzyKR was compared against a recently developed kinetic predictor, DLKcat.

The optimum conditions for the efficient production of bassanite in a short time (< 5 min) involve the use of  brines with [NaCl]  > 4 M and maintaining a temperature, T > 80 \u00b0C. When  the solution containing bassanite crystals is cooled down to around room temperature, eventually gypsum is formed. When the temperature is raised again to T > 80 \u00b0C,  bassanite is rapidly re-precipitated. This contrasts with the typical behaviour of the bassanite phase in low salt environments. Traditionally, hemihydrate is obtained from gypsum through a solid state thermal treatment at 150 \u00b0C < T <  200 \u00b0C, to remove some of the structural water. This is because, bassanite is considered to be metastable  with respect to gypsum and anhydrite in aqueous solutions, and therefore gypsum-to-bassanite conversion should not occur in water. Interestingly, the high-salinity transformation of gypsum-to-bassanite has been reported by many authors and used in practice for several decades, although its very occurrence actually contradicts numerical thermodynamic predictions regarding solubility of calcium sulfate phases. By following the evolution of crystalline phases with in situ and time-resolved X-ray diffraction/scattering and Raman spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the phase stability in brines at elevated temperatures is inaccurately represented in the thermodynamic databases. Most notably for [NaCl] > 4 M, and T > 80 \u00b0C gypsum becomes readily more soluble than bassanite, which induces the direct precipitation of the latter from gypsum. The fact that these transformations are controlled by the solution provides extensive opportunities for precise manipulation of crystal formation. Our experiments confirmed that bassanite remained the sole crystalline structure for many hours before reverting into gypsum. This property is extremely advantageous for practical processing and efficient crystal extraction in industrial scenarios.", "date": "2023-09-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Geochemistry; Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Minerals", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Recently, PtGe alloys were proposed to be an excellent alternative to reduce CO poisoning. In this work we investigate the impact of Ge content on the CO oxidation kinetics of P4Gen subnanoclusters supported on MgO. A Ge concentration dependence of the reaction kinetics is found due to a strong synergy between Pt and Ge. Pt\u2212Ge nanoalloys act as a bifunctional catalyst by displaying dual adsorption sites; i.e., CO is adsorbed on Pt whereas oxygen binds to Ge, forming an alternative oxygen source GeOx. Besides, Ge alloying modifies the electronic structure of Pt (ligand effects) and reduces the affinity to CO. In this way, the competition between CO and O2 adsorption and the overbinding of CO is alleviated, achieving a CO poisoning\u2212free kinetic regime.

In this work, we demonstrate the coupling of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the colloidal phase via click chemistry. This conjugated Pc-AuNPs colloidal system is shown to enhance the photocatalytic singlet oxygen (1O2) production over non-conjugated Pcs and hence improve the photoelectrochemical detection of phenols. The plasmonic enhancement of the 1O2 generation by Pcs was clearly elucidated by complementary experimental and computational classical electromagnetic models. The dependence of plasmonic enhancement on the spectral position of the excitation laser wavelength and the absorbance of the Pc molecules with respect to the wavelength specific near-field enhancement is clearly demonstrated. A high \u223c 8 times enhancement is obtained with green laser (532 nm) at the LSPR due to the maximum near-field enhancement at the resonance wavelength.

PLA NPs with different PLA-Bodipy loading (from 2.5% to 50% by weight) were studied using a calibrated photoacoustic spectrophotometer. We demonstrate the presence of two photoacoustic emission regimes thanks to the determination of the Global PhotoAcoustic Efficiency (GPAE) which represents the averaged Photoacoustic Generation Efficiency (PGE) over the whole studied band (680-870 nm). In the monomer regime, below 10% by weight of PLA-Bodipy, the fluorescence emission from the Bodipy monomer limits the GPAE. Above 10% of PLA-Bodipy, in the ACQ regime, non-radiative deactivations from the aggregates are predominant and GPAE reaches a high value of 93%. We also introduce the photoacoustic brightness BPA, as the produce of the GPAE by the molar extinction coefficient of NPs. When Bodipy is aggregated, high nanoparticular extinction coefficients (2.4 x 108 L.mol-1.cm-1 for NP-50%) and high GPAE values are reached leading to ultrabright NPs (22 x 107 L.mol-1.cm-1). Finally, we show that high laser fluences (1-3.5 mJ.cm-2) can significantly reduce the photoacoustic signal by ground state depopulation at the band maximum excitation (-20% for NP-2.5%). This non-linear effect can be highly reduced with NPs in the ACQ regime. Above 10% PLA-Bodipy, NPs exhibit intense photoacoustic brightness and low signal loss by nonlinear effects. A mathematical fit of the absorption and photoacoustic excitation spectra allowed to introduce the Band PhotoAcoustic Efficiency (BPAE) to spectrally differentiate the averaged photoacoustic efficiency at the band maximum BPAEred and in the vibrational shoulder BPAEblue. The BPAEred highly depends on the laser fluence due to high ground state depopulation, whereas the BPAEblue does not change with the fluence thanks to a lower laser fluence saturation.", "date": "2023-09-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Therefore, strategies to limit fungicide usage have gained paramount importance. Trichoderma fungi, owing to their antagonistic activity against various pathogenic fungi, have emerged as prospective candidates for enhancing both the effectiveness and sustainability of plant protection. Nevertheless, the utilization of bio-control agents like Trichoderma has unveiled new challenges, notably their vulnerability to physical stimuli and diminished efficacy during prolonged storage. \nTo overcome these drawbacks, we present a mild and scalable encapsulation method for Trichoderma spores, employing a layer-by-layer (LbL) encapsulation approach using biobased lignin derivates. Our investigations demonstrate that the LbL-encapsulation technique imparts remarkable improvements in spore stability, even under adverse conditions such as variable temperature and prolonged exposure to UV irradiation compared to unencapsulated spores. Notably, encapsulated Trichoderma spores exhibit increased efficiency in the cultivation of tomato plants when compared to their unencapsulated counterparts. Additionally, our findings reveal that the in planta efficacy of encapsulated spores is contingent upon the specific Trichoderma strain employed.\nThe results outlined herein suggest that Trichoderma spores, encapsulated within lignin through the LbL approach, exhibit potential as promising and sustainable alternative to chemical fungicides and potential commercialization.\n", "date": "2023-09-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Biopolymers; Polyelectrolytes - Polymers; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The snapshot data acquisition in SerialED can be realized both in transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopes (TEM/STEM). However, the current SerialED workflow based on STEM setups requires special external devices and software, which brings challenges for its broader adoption. Here, we present a simplified experimental implementation of STEM-based SerialED on Thermo Fisher Scientific STEMs using common proprietary software interfaced through Python scripts to automate data collection. Specifically, we utilize TEM Imaging and Analysis (TIA) scripting and TEM scripting to access the STEM functionalities of the microscope, and DigitalMicrograph (DM) scripting to control the camera for snapshot data acquisition. Data analysis adapts the existing workflow using the software CrystFEL developed for serial X-ray crystallography. Our workflow for SerialED can be used on any Gatan or Thermo Fisher Scientific camera. We apply this workflow to collect high-resolution STEM SerialED data from two aluminosilicate zeolites, Zeolite Y and ZSM-25, and demonstrate, for the first time, ab initio structure determination through direct methods using the STEM SerialED data. Zeolite Y is relatively stable under the electron beam, and SerialED data extend to 0.60 \u00c5. We show that the structural model obtained using SerialED data merged from 358 crystals is nearly identical to that using continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) data from one crystal. This demonstrates that accurate structures can be obtained from SerialED. Zeolite ZSM-25 is very beam-sensitive and has a complex structure. We show that SerialED greatly improves data resolution of ZSM-25, compared to serial rotation electron diffraction (SerialRED), from 1.50 \u00c5 to 0.90 \u00c5.

Though previous studies have quantified the canonical superconductivity descriptors of YB6\u2019s greater Fermi-level (Ef) density of states and higher electron-phonon coupling (EPC), the root of this difference has not been assessed with full detail of the electronic structure. Through chemical bonding, we determine low-lying, unoccupied 4f atomic orbitals in lanthanum to be the key difference between these superconductors. These orbitals, which are not accessible in YB6, hybridize with pi B-B bonds and bring this pi-system lower in energy than the  sigma B-B bonds otherwise at Ef. This inversion of bands is crucial: the phonon modes we show responsible for superconductivity cause the sigma-orbitals of YB6 to change drastically in overlap, but couple weakly to the pi-orbitals of LaB6. These phonons in YB6 even access an electronic-state crossing, indicating strong EPC. No such crossing in LaB6 is observed.

However, the accessibility of the pre-folded lasso architecture has limited this advance. To better understand the folding process de novo, simulations are used herein to characterize the folding propensity of microcin J25 (MccJ25), a lasso peptide known for its antimicrobial properties. New algorithms are developed to unambiguously distinguish threaded from non-threaded precursors and determine handedness, a key feature in natural lasso peptides. We find that MccJ25 indeed forms right-handed pre-lassos, in contrast to past predictions but consistent with all natural lasso peptides. Additionally, the native pre-lasso structure is shown to be metastable prior to ring formation but to readily transition to entropically-favored unfolded and non-threaded structures, suggesting de novo lasso folding is rare. However, by modifying the ring forming residues with the appendage of thiol and thioester functionalities, we are able to increase the stability of pre-lasso conformations.

F\u2013 detection and removal using organic molecules and hybrid materials are extensively reported in the literature, but very few reports discuss dual-purpose detection and removal. Functional nanomaterials (FNM) based on nanoparticles, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon dots conjugated with fluorophore moiety are largely used for these purposes. Functional groups on nanomaterial surfaces exhibited various interactions such as agglomeration, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, coordination and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, enabling dual-purpose detection and removal of F\u2013. These materials offer unique properties such as tunable pore structure, size, and morphology coupled with large surface area and high thermal/chemical stability. Further, this perspective review discusses prospects for sustainable technologies and describes the advantages and disadvantages of using FNM based on its optical properties for detection and removal efficiency.

The redox potential of the flavin is strongly affected by its (protein) environment, however the underlying molecular interactions of this effect are still unknown. Using hybrid Quantum Mechanics / Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) simulation techniques, we have studied the redox properties of flavin in the gas phase, aqueous solution and two different protein environments, in particular a BLUF and a LOV photoreceptor domain. By mapping the changes in electrostatic potential and solvent structure, we gain insight in how specific polarization of the flavin by its environment tunes the re- duction potential.

The objective of this study was to identify the biomarkers, including blood metabolites and genes, related to feline mammary carcinoma, study their relationships, and develop a machine-learning (ML) model for the early diagnosis of the disease. We analyzed blood metabolites of felines with mammary carcinoma using the pathway analysis feature in the MetaboAnalyst software. The metabolic pathways that were elucidated to be associated with this disease include Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, Glutamine and glutamate metabolism, Arginine biosynthesis, and Glycerophospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, we also elucidated several genes that play a significant role in the development of FMC, such as ERBB2, PDGFA, EGFR, FLT4, ERBB3, FIGF, PDGFC, PDGFB through STRINGdb, a database of known and predicted protein\u2013protein interactions, and MetaboAnalyst 5.0. We utilized ML methods to recognize FMC using blood metabolites of sick patients. The best-performing model was able to predict metabolite class with an accuracy of 85%.

In this paper, a deep neural network model based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) network is proposed to predict the B-factor profile of a protein by combining its sequence-based features and structure-based features. Based on a large dataset of high-resolution proteins, our method predicts the B-factor profiles with an average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.71, and 85% of the B-factor profiles have a PCC greater than 0.6, which indicates a strong correlation between predicted and experimental values.

Recent advances in experimental approaches may provide atomically resolved snapshots of the structure of NPs in relevant regimes, but limitations in experimental data acquisition hinder the reconstruction of the atomic dynamics present within them. Molecular simulations -- typically starting from ideal/perfect NP structures -- allow tracking the motion of atoms over time, but suffer from limited sampling and provide results that, being dependent on the initial (putative) structure, are often only indicative. Here, combining state-of-the-art experimental and computational approaches, we demonstrate how it is possible to tackle the inherent limitations of both methods and resolve the atomistic dynamics present in metal NPs under realistic conditions. Annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) enables the acquisition of a time series of ten high-resolution images of an Au NP. Each image is taken at intervals of 0.6 seconds, providing data on a second timescale during the experimental sampling. These are used to reconstruct atomistic 3D structures of the real NP that are then used as starting configurations for ten independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unsupervised machine learning analysis of the data extracted from the MD trajectories using advanced structural and dynamical descriptors allows tracking and resolving the real-time atomic dynamics present within the NP under relevant conditions. This provides new perspectives into the realistic atomic dynamics within such NPs. We expect that such integrated experimental/computational approaches will become fundamental in various fields where the dynamics of NPs plays a key role, from catalysis to, e.g., nanoelectronics and biomedicine.", "date": "2023-09-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Some argue that it represents two distinct structural motifs, while others suggest that it is evidence of ultrafast dissociation within the core-hole lifetime. In this study, we use a theoretical approach to provide a nearly quantitative description of both non-resonant and pre-edge resonant XES. Our theoretical predictions indicate that the 1b1 splitting arises due to ultrafast dissociation, with the dynamics of this process dependent on the X-ray absorption energy. For non-resonant radiation, hydrogen is ejected as H+, while for pre-edge resonant radiation it is ejected as a neutral atom. This leads to near-dissociation for non-resonant radiation, as ~ 20% of all core-ionized molecules do not dissociate and dissociated protons still remain in close proximity to the parent hydroxyl fragment. In contrast, for pre-edge radiation, all core-excited molecules dissociate and the neutral H atom moves further away from the hydroxyl fragment, completely leaving the first solvation shell in most cases. Our simulations also predict the observed isotope effects in both non-resonant and pre-edge resonant XES and reveal that the so-called lower-energy 1b1 peak in the non-resonant XES is primarily of 3a1 symmetry. Additionally, we found that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in explaining the XES behavior across different temperatures and phases.", "date": "2023-09-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While synthetic processes to achieve C\u2013H halogenation require harsh conditions, enzymes such as non-heme iron halogenases carry out some types of C\u2013H halogenation, i.e., chlorination or bromination, with ease while others, i.e., fluorination, have never been observed in natural or engineered non-heme iron enzymes. Using density functional theory and correlated wavefunction theory, we investigate the differences in structural and energetic preferences of the smaller fluoride and the larger chloride or bromide intermediates throughout the catalytic cycle. Although we find that the energetics of rate-limiting hydrogen atom transfer are not strongly impacted by fluoride substitution, the higher barriers observed during the radical rebound reaction for fluoride relative to chloride/bromide contribute to the difficulty of C\u2013H fluorination. We also investigate the possibility of isomerization playing a role in differences in reaction selectivity, and our calculations reveal crucial differences in terms of isomer energetics of the key ferryl intermediate between fluoride and chloride/bromide intermediates. While chloride and bromide intermediates show formation of monodentate isomers believed to be involved in selective catalysis, we find that formation of the fluoride monodentate intermediate is not possible in our calculations that lack additional stabilizing interactions with the greater protein environment. Furthermore, the shorter Fe\u2013F bonds are found to increase isomerization reaction barriers, suggesting that incorporation of residues that form a halogen bond with F and elongate Fe\u2013F bonds could make selective C\u2013H fluorination possible in non-heme iron halogenases.

Moreover, many developments to improve their accuracy are often complicated, impeding their general use. Luckily, several tools and guidelines are already in place to identify these shortcomings, but they are typically lacking in flexibility or fail to systematically determine how to improve the accuracy of the free energy calculation. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces OGRe--a python package for optimal grid refinement in an arbitrary number of dimensions. OGRe is based on three metrics which gauge the confinement, consistency, and overlap of each simulation in a series of umbrella sampling (US) simulations, an enhanced sampling technique ubiquitously adopted to construct free energy surfaces for hindered processes. As these three metrics are fundamentally linked to the accuracy of the weighted histogram analysis method, adopted to generate free energy surfaces from US simulations, they facilitate a systematic construction of accurate free energy profiles, where each metric is driven by a specific umbrella parameter. This allows for the derivation of a consistent and optimal collection of umbrellas for each simulation, largely independent of the initial values, thereby dramatically increasing the ease-of-use towards accurate free energy surfaces. As such, OGRe is particularly suited to determined complex free energy surfaces, with large activation barriers and shallow minima, which underpin many physical and chemical transformations, and hence to further our fundamental understanding of these processes.", "date": "2023-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this article, we report the development of a method based on SPPS and native chemical ligation/desulfurization chemistry that allows the rapid, reliable, and glyco-economical synthesis of long multi-O-GalNAcylated peptides. To facilitate access to the glycosyl donor required for the preparation of Fmoc-Ser/Thr(Ac3GalNAc)-OH we used an easily scalable azidophenylselenylation of galactal instead of azidonitration. The problem of low yield when coupling glycoamino acids in small excess was solved by carrying out the reactions in 2-MeTHF instead of DMF and using DIC/Oxyma. Remarkably, quantitative coupling was achieved within 10 minutes using only 1.5 equivalents of glycoamino acid. The method does not require (microwave) heating, thus avoiding side reactions such as acetyl transfer to the N-terminal amino acid. This method also improved the difficult coupling of glycoamino acid to the hydrazine-resin and furnished peptides carrying 10 GalNAc units in high purities (>95%) of crude products. Combined with a one-pot method involving native chemical ligation at a glycoamino acid junction and superfast desulfurization, the method yielded highly pure MUC5AC glycopeptides comprising 10 octapeptide tandem repeats with 20 -O-linked GalNAc residues within a week.", "date": "2023-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previous studies have indicated that hydroxyl-group chain-cluster formation is hindered in proportion to the branching number. Here, water mole-fractions up to x=0.2 are examined, i.e. up to the miscibility limit. It is found that water molecules within the hydroxyl-chain domains, participate to the chain formations in different manner for the 1-octanol and the branched octanols. The hydration of the octanol hydroxyl chains is confirmed by the shifting of the scattering pre-peak to low momentum transfer both from measured and simulated x-ray scattering intensities, which corresponds to an increased size of the clusters. Experimental x-ray scattering amplitudes are seen to increase with increasing water content for 1-octanol, while this trend is reversed in all branched octanols, with the amplitudes decreasing with the increase of branching number n. Conjecturing that amplitude of pre-peaks are related to the density of corresponding aggregates, these results interpreted as water breaking large OH hydroxyl chains in 1-octanol, hence increasing the density of aggregates, while enhancing hydroxyl aggregates in branched alcohols by inserting itself into the OH chains. Hence, water acts as a structure maker or breaker in inverse proportion to the hindering of OH hydroxyl chain structures arising from the topology of the alkyl tails (branched or not)", "date": "2023-09-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Properties; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nickel maleonitriledithiolate, an electrochemically-active organometallic complex, is dispersed in the ionogel binder of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). When exposed to propylene-propane gas mixtures, propylene is selectively captured during the oxidation of the complex and is then released when the complex is reduced.

However, these simulations omit the solvent and pressure, which could be a controlling factor for the [2+2]-photocycloaddition. We now extend our ML-photodynamics approach with a two-layer ONIOM scheme combining the neural network potential and GFN-xTB to understand effects of the solute-solvent interactions and external pressure on the [2+2]-photocycloadditions of octamethyl (1), octatrifluoromethyl (2), and octacyclopropyl (3) [3]-ladderdienes.

The synthesis of indium phosphide quantum dots from indium carboxylates and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine (P(SiMe3)3) is understood to proceed through the formation of magic-sized clusters, with In37P20(O2CR)51 being the key isolable intermediate. The reactivity of the In37P20(O2CR)51 cluster is a vital parameter in controlling conversion to quantum dots. Here, we report structural perturbations to In37P20(O2CR)51 clusters induced by tuning the steric properties of a series of substituted phenylacetate ligands. This approach allows for control over reactivity with P(SiMe3)3, where meta-substituents enhance the susceptibility to ligand displacement and para-substituents hinder phosphine diffusion to the core. Thermolysis studies show that with complete cluster dissolution, steric profile can modulate the nucleation period, whereas partial dissolution from indium carboxylate loss results in conversion to uniform InP cores with a narrow, 419 nm absorbance. The enhanced stability from ligand engineering also allows for the isolation and structural characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction of a new III-V magic-sized cluster with formula In26P13(O2CR)39.

As graphene sheets are flexible [3], we represent nanocapillaries with a deformable channel-wall model by using the small displacement structural-mechanics and perturbation theory presented by Gervais et al.[4], and Christov et al.[5], respectively. We assume the lubrication assumption in the shallow nanochannels, and using the microstructure of confined water along with slip at the capillary boundaries and disjoining pressure [2], we derive the model for deformable nanochannels. Our derived model also facilitates the flow dynamics of Newtonian fluids under different conditions as its limiting cases, which have been previously reported in literature [2,4-8]. We compare the experimental observations by Radha et al.[1] and MD-simulation results by Neek-Amal et al.[2] with our deformable-wall model. We find that for channel-height $H_o < 4$~\\AA, the flow-rate prediction by the deformable-wall model is 5-7~\\% more compared to [2] well-fitted rigid-wall model. These predictions are within the errorbar as shown by [1], which indicates that the derived deformable-wall model could be more accurate to model [1] experiments as compared to the rigid-wall model. Using the model, we study the effect of flexibility of graphene sheets on the flow rate. As the flexibility $\\alpha$ increases (corresponding thickness $\\mathcal{T}$ and elastic modulus $E$ of the wall decreases), the flow rate also increases. We find that the flow rate scales as $\\dot{m}_{\\text{flexible}}\\sim  \\alpha^0 $ for $\\Big (\\alpha  \\Delta pW/EH_o \\Big ) \\ll 1$; $\\dot{m}_{\\text{flexible}}\\sim  \\alpha $ for $\\Big (\\alpha  \\Delta pW/EH_o \\Big ) \\sim O(10^{-1})$; and $\\dot{m}_{\\text{flexible}}\\sim  \\alpha^3 $ for $\\Big (\\alpha  \\Delta pW/EH_o \\Big ) \\sim O(1)$, respectively. We also find that, for a given thickness $\\mathcal{T}$, the percentage change in flow rate in the smaller height of the channel is more than the larger height of the channels. As the channel height decreases for the given reservoir pressure and thickness, the $\\Delta \\dot{m}/\\dot{m}$ increases with $H_o^{-1}$ followed by $H_o^{-3}$ after a height-threshold. Further, we investigate how the applied pulsating pressure influences the flow rate. We find that due to the oscillatory pressure field, there is no change in the averaged mass flow rate in the rigid-wall channel, whereas the flow rate increases in the flexible channels with the increasing magnitude of the oscillatory pressure field.

This method is chemoselective for the semi-hydrogenation of terminal alkynes over internal alkynes or alkenes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the transformation is concerted and Z-selective.

These are finding numerous applications including in the biomedical field whereby nanoparticles are injected in vivo for medical imaging, theranostics and biosensing. However, interactions with proteins contained in biological fluids lead to the formation of a shell on the surface of the nanoparticles called \"protein corona\" (PC). PC plays a detrimental role for the intended applications as it may modify the interface of the nanoparticle and thereby block functional groups needed for recognition. It is therefore essential to understand the mechanisms of formation of these PCs in order to control the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles in complex biological fluids. Current characterization techniques can identify and quantify the composition of PCs using mass spectroscopy and electrophoresis. However, most of them do not enable real-time measurement in complex media because they require washing steps to remove excess protein. Finally, most techniques provide ensemble averages and are unable to access inter-particle heterogeneity.  Here, we demonstrate the use of single-particle scattering microscopy combined with a microfluidic system to study PC formation in real-time at the single-nanoparticle level.

Furthermore, it is found that the surface roughness of the nanoparticles  affects the kinetics of the PC formation.

The accumulation of pathogenic proteins is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, and removal of these species is a promising avenue for the development of novel therapies. Targeted protein degradation technologies are emerging as efficacious therapeutic strategies in a wide range of diseases. However, there are no existing methods for the degradation of extracellular proteins in the central nervous system (CNS).  Angiopep-2, a brain-targeting peptide derived from aprotinin, has previously been employed as a covalent tag to facilitate receptor-mediated transcytosis of therapeutics across the blood brain barrier (BBB). MoDEs/LyTACs consisting of Angiopep-2 modified with biotin or a chloroalkane ligand triggered endocytosis of streptavidin and HaloTag protein, respectively. Interestingly, uptake occurred independently of LRP-1, which is the reported receptor for Angiopep-2. MoDE-mediated endocytosis of streptavidin in a bEnd.3 BBB model resulted in two mechanisms of protein removal: both bi-directional transcytosis and lysosomal degradation.

The aim of this study was to generate student interest in research by developing a new MOF laboratory experience. Students were tasked with synthesizing, characterizing, and utilizing MOFs to capture a hazardous molecule, using an inquiry-based learning approach. Over three laboratory periods, undergraduate students received instructions for synthesizing four MOFs. They were given the freedom to choose which MOF to synthesize and use for capture of either methylene blue or iodine. This hands-on experience exposed students to techniques not typically explored in general chemistry, including the use of crystallographic information files to examine MOF structures, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. At the end of the term, students presented their work during a formal poster session where they received valuable feedback from faculty and graduate students at Oregon State University.

To recover ammonia/ammonium (TAN) from urine, we operated electrochemical stripping (ECS) for over a month, achieving 83.4% TAN removal and 73.0% TAN recovery. With two reactors, we recovered sixteen 500 mL batches (8 L total) of ammonium sulfate approaching commercial fertilizer concentrations and often having greater than 95% purity. While evaluating operation and maintenance needs, we identified pH, full-cell voltage, product volume, and water flux into the product as informative process monitoring parameters that can be inexpensively and rapidly measured. Characterization of fouled cation exchange and omniphobic membranes informs cleaning and reactor modifications to reduce fouling with organics and calcium/magnesium salts. To evaluate the impact of urine collection and storage on ECS, we conducted experiments with urine at different levels of dilution with flush water, extents of divalent cation precipitation, and degrees of hydrolysis. ECS effectively treated urine under all conditions, but minimizing flush water and ensuring storage until complete hydrolysis would enable energy-efficient TAN recovery. A preliminary cost assessment indicated that ECS-derived ammonium sulfate from urine was competitive with other nitrogen treatment technologies and commercially available fertilizer. Our experimental results and cost analysis motivate a multi-faceted approach to improving ECS\u2019s technical and economic viability by extending component lifetimes, decreasing component costs, and reducing energy consumption through material, reactor, and process engineering. In sum, we demonstrated urine treatment as a foothold for electrochemical nutrient recovery from wastewater while supporting applicability of ECS to seven other wastewaters with widely varying characteristics.

The binding of small molecules to these enzymes affects drug activity and half-life. Additionally, the inhibition or induction of a CYP isoform by a drug can lead to drug-drug interactions, which in turn can lead to toxicity. To predict CYP inhibition, a variety of computational methods have been used, with docking methods being less accurate than machine learning (ML) methods. However, the latter methods are sensitive to training data and show reduced accuracy on test sets outside of the chemical space represented in the training set. In contrast, docking methods do not have this generalization issue and allow for visual analysis. We hypothesize that combining ML methods with docking can improve CYP inhibition predictions. To test this hypothesis, we pair our in-house docking program FITTED with several ML techniques to investigate the accuracy and transferability of this hybrid methodology, which we term ML-augmented docking. We find that ML-augmented docking can significantly improve the accuracy of docking software while consistently surpassing the performance of ligand-only models. Additionally, we show that ML-augmented docking is more generalizable than machine learning models trained on ligand-only data.

Rapid gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a screening technique that can be utilized prior to confirmatory GC-MS analysis to provide an informative screening approach and reduce the need to further analyze negative samples. Though rapid GC-MS is fast (less than two minutes), extraction techniques such as passive headspace extraction remain a bottleneck for decreasing overall workflow times. In this work, solid phase microextraction (SPME) was implemented with rapid GC-MS for ignitable liquid analysis for a faster, more sensitive screening approach compared to extraction with passive headspace. Using optimized inlet conditions, limits of detection as low as 27 ng/mL per compound were achieved. Gasoline and diesel fuel were extracted and analyzed, and major compounds in each liquid were identified in the resulting chromatograms. Extracted ion profiles (EIPs) and deconvolution methods were useful for additional compound identifications. Lastly, the SPME-rapid GC-MS workflow was extended to the analysis of gasoline and diesel fuel in mock burn samples using carpet and wood substrates. From SPME sample extraction to rapid GC-MS instrumental analysis and data processing, the total workflow for a single sample was reduced to under 20 min.

At elevated concentration, strong electrostatic interactions between ROMs, solvent, and supporting electrolyte often result in high viscosity and low solution conductivity, both of which are deleterious to practical RFB operation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a class of 2,6-dimethylpyridinium-derived ROMs can achieve a broad range of solubilities in acetonitrile by fine-tuning unique intermolecular CH-pi interactions, which disrupt electrostatic solute-solute interactions. Here, we evaluate the electrochemical characteristics for a library of 23 N-substituted 4-aryl-2,6-dimethylpyridinium ROMs and measure solution viscosities and conductivities at variable concentrations for three representative species in acetonitrile.

Here, we report on non-adiabatic ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations of the hot exciton dynamics following photo-excitation for a series of donor-acceptor polymers. We provide detailed insights into Coulomb attractive energy and dynamical evolution of dipole moments in the excited states.

WJW with siderophores, which only occurs under iron-deficient conditions. No useful information is available on the degradation rates or long-term stability and continuity of the degradation reaction although several months or more are needed for CNT degradation. In this study, we investigated long-term continuous degradation of oxidized (carboxylated) single-walled CNTs (O-SWCNTs) using bacteria of the genus Shewanella. These bacteria are widely present in the environment and can drive the Fenton reaction by alternating anaerobic-aerobic growth conditions under more general environmental conditions. We first examined the effect of O-SWCNTs on the growth of S. oneidensis MR-1, and it was revealed that O-SWCNTs promote growth up to 30 \u03bcg/mL but inhibit growth at 40 \u03bcg/mL and above. Then, S. oneidensis MR-1 was subjected to incubation cycles consisting of 21-h anaerobic and 3-h aerobic periods in the presence of 30 \u03bcg/mL O-SWCNTs and 10 mM Fe(III) citrate. We determined key factors that help prolong the bacteria-driven Fenton reaction and finally achieved long-term continuous degradation of O-SWCNTs over 90 d. By maintaining a near neutral pH and replenishing Fe(III) citrate at 60 d, a degraded fraction of 56.3% was reached. S. oneidensis MR-1 produces Fe(II) from Fe(III) citrate, a final electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration during the anaerobic period. Then, \u00b7OH is generated through the Fenton reaction by Fe(II) and H2O2 produced by MR-1 during the aerobic period. \u00b7OH was responsible for O-SWCNT degradation, which was inhibited by scavengers of H2O2 and \u00b7OH. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the graphitic structure in O-SWCNTs was oxidized, and electron microscopy showed that long CNT fibers initially aggregated and became short and isolated during degradation. Since Shewanella spp. and iron are ubiquitous in the environment, this study suggests that a Fenton reaction driven by this genus is applicable to the degradation of CNTs under a wide range of conditions and will help researchers develop novel methods for waste treatment and environmental bioremediation against CNTs.", "date": "2023-09-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Wastes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In most cases, the activities of these enzymes also require the binding of divalent cations to catalytic sites. However, modeling divalent cations in MM simulations has been chal- lenging. The inclusion of explicit polarization was considered promising, but despite improvements over non-polarizable force fields and despite the inclusion of \u2018Nonbonded- fix (NB-fix)\u2019 corrections, errors in interaction energies of divalent cations with proteins remain large. Importantly, the application of these models fails to reproduce experimental structural data on Mg2+\u00b7Protein\u00b7ATP complexes.

Our key results are as follows. We first show that our recent revision of the AMOEBA protein model (AMOEBABIO18-HFC), which contains high field corrections (HFC) to induced dipoles, dramatically improves Mg2+-protein interaction energies, reducing mean absolute errors (MAE) from 17 to 10 kcal/mol. This further supports the general applicability of AMOEBABIO18-HFC. The inclusion of many-body NB-fix corrections further reduces MAE to 6 kcal/mol, which amounts to less than 2% error. The errors are estimated with respect to vdW-inclusive density functional theory that we bench- mark against CCSD(T) calculations and experiments. We also present a new model of ATP with revised polarization parameters to better capture its high field response, as well as new vdW and dihedral parameters.

Our previous experimental study (Guo et al., Nat.

As a first step towards understanding how liposomes\u2019 molecular structure and composition modulates their elasticity, we performed all-atom and coarse-grained classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lipid bilayers formed by mixing a long-tailed, unsaturated phospholipid with a short-tailed saturated lipid with the same head group. The former type of phospholipids considered were 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (termed here DPMPC). The shorter saturated lipids examined were 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC), 1,2-didecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DDPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). Several lipid concentrations and surface tensions were considered. Our results show that DOPC or DPMPC systems having 25-35 mol% of the shortest lipids DHPC or DDPC are the least rigid, having area compressibility moduli KA that are ~10% smaller than the values observed in pure DOPC or DPMPC bilayers. These results agree with experimental measurements of the stretching modulus and lysis tension in liposomes with the same compositions. These systems also have lower areas per lipid, form more uneven x-y interfaces with water, the tails of both primary and secondary lipids are more disordered, and the terminal methyl groups in the tails of the long lipids DOPC or DPMPC wriggle more in the vertical direction, compared to pure DOPC or DPMPC bilayers or their mixtures with the longer saturated lipids DLPC or DMPC. These observations confirm our hypothesis that adding increasing concentrations of the short unsaturated lipids DHPC or DDPC to DOPC or DPMPC bilayers, alters lipid packing and thus make the resulting liposomes more elastic and less rigid. No formation of lipid nanodomains was noted in our simulations, and no clear trends were observed in the lateral diffusivities of the lipids as concentration, type of secondary lipid and surface tension were varied.

After this phase, the melted crystals quickly return to their solid state in less than a minute while maintaining a balance between the two different photoisomers of the ATF molecule. In the presence of suspended silica microspheres, the star-shaped trans-ATF microcrystals undergo a similar melting process induced by visible light.

Nine different zwitterions were synthesized and fully characterized. Zwitterions with the poor Michael acceptors methyl methacrylate and methyl crotonate formed, but could not be isolated in pure form. The solid-state structures of two phosphonium phenolate molecules were determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.

Template-free methods, such as transformers, have recently been proposed as an alternative to template-based methods for single-step retrosynthetic predictions. Here, we trained and evaluated a transformer model, called Chemformer, for retrosynthesis predictions within drug discovery. The proprietary dataset used for training comprised ~18M reactions from literature, patents, and electronic lab notebooks. Chemformer was evaluated for the purpose of both single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis. We found that the single-step performance of Chemformer was especially good on reaction classes common in drug discovery, with most reaction classes showing a top-10 round-trip accuracy above 0.97. Moreover, Chemformer reached a higher round-trip accuracy compared to a template-based model. By analyzing multi-step retrosynthesis experiments, we observed that Chemformer found synthetic routes leading to commercial starting materials for 95% of the target compounds, an increase by more than 20% compared to the template-based model. In addition to this, we discovered that Chemformer suggested novel disconnections corresponding to reaction templates which are not included in the template-based model. The conclusions drawn from this work allow for designing a synthesis planning tool where template-based and template-free models work in harmony to optimize retrosynthetic recommendations.", "date": "2023-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The marinopyrroles, pentachloropseudilin, and pentabromopseudilin are densely halogenated, hybrid pyrrole-phenol natural products with potent activity against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus. However, the exact way in which they exert this antibacterial activity has not been established. In this study, we explore their structure-activity relationship, determine their spatial location in bacterial cells, and investigate their MoA. We show that the natural products share a common MoA based on membrane depolarization and dissipation of the proton motive force (PMF) that is essential for cell viability. The compounds show potent protonophore activity, but do not appear to destroy the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane via the formation of larger pores or interfere with the stability of the peptidoglycan sacculus. Thus, our current model for the antibacterial MoA of marinopyrrole, pentachloropseudilin, and pentabromopseudilin stipulates that the acidic compounds insert into the membrane and transport protons inside the cell. This MoA may explain many of the deleterious biological effects in mammalian cells, plants, phytoplankton, viruses, and protozoans that have been reported for these compounds.", "date": "2023-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

For this reason, we studied manganese(II) halides with compact organic cations such as formamidinium (FA+) and acetamidinium (Ac+).

Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence measurements demonstrated high PL quantum yields and reasonable scintillation light yields of acetamidinium-based compounds. In addition, unlike most known HMH-based scintillators, the discovered materials have a relatively high density, due to the small fraction of the volume occupied by organic cations, so their X-ray attenuation coefficients are comparable to the well-known oxide scintillators.", "date": "2023-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Among cathode materials, layered vanadium disulfide (VS2) has demonstrated good charge storage capability, as a result of its metallic character and large interlayer spacing. However, VS2 electrodes present fixed shapes and aspect ratios, and they are processed using toxic solvents, which hinders their integration in wearables. It is thus necessary to develop manufacturing methods that can meet the demand for shape customization and do not rely on toxic solvents. Here, we propose a flower-like VS2 architectures using a simple hydrothermal process to formulate an ink for extrusion 3D Printing (Direct Ink Writing). The 3D printing technique enables the fabrication of VS2 electrodes with porous micron-sized struts, high-mass loading of ~ 45 mg cm-2 and good conductivity. Using the 3D printed VS2 cathodes, zinc-ion microbatteries were assembled, achieving a capacity of ~ 1.98 mAh cm-2 and demonstrating a capacity retention of over 55% after 150 cycles. The choice of the electrolyte and processing of the cathode ensured good stability against dissolution, a no-torious challenge for VS2 in aqueous environment. In particular, the dissolution of VS2 cathodes for ZIBs was here prevented by the use of a water-in-salt electrolyte (WISE), enabling a long cycling life with higher capacity.

This contribution demonstrates that metallomimetic catalysis, involving facile redox cycling between the P(III) and P(V) oxidation states, is possible using only simple, cheap and readily available trialkylphosphines with no need for complex ligand architectures or external oxidising/reducing agents. Hydrodefluorination and aminodefluorination of a range of fluoroarenes was realised with good to very good yields under mild conditions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies show that the phosphines undergo oxidative addition of the fluoroaromatic substrate, via a Meisenheimer-like transition state, to form a fluorophosphorane. This undergoes a pseudo-transmetallation step with a silane, via initial fluoride transfer from P to Si, to give experimentally observed phosphonium ions. Hydride transfer from a hydridosilicate counterion then leads to a hydridophosphorane, which undergoes reductive elimination of the product to re-form the phosphine catalyst. This behaviour is analogous to many classical transition-metal catalysed reactions and so is a rare example of both functional and mechanistically metallomimetic behaviour in catalysis by a main-group element system. Crucially, the reagents used are cheap, readily available commercially and easy to handle, making these reactions a realistic prospect in a wide range of academic and industrial settings.", "date": "2023-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.); Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This competition results in distinct thermodynamic and dynamical behavior of H2O and CO2 molecules, depending on whether one or both guest species are present. Notably, the presence of CO2 molecules forces the H2O molecules to form more connected hydrogen-bond networks within smaller regions, slowing water reorien- tation dynamics and decreasing water entropy. Conversely, the presence of water speeds up the reorientation of CO2 molecules, decreases CO2 entropy, and increases the propensity for CO2 to be adsorbed within the framework due to stronger water-mediated interactions. Due to the competition for the same void spaces, both H2O and CO2 molecules exhibit slower diffusion when molecules of the other guest species are present.

Consequently, chiral self-sorting has been overlooked in the design of switchable and metastable discrete supramolecular structures. Here we report a benzo[h]quinoline-based iridi-um(III) complex (Ir) with helical chirality at its metal centre, which forms preferentially a homochiral dimer and exhibits thermo-/mechano-chromism based on a monomer-dimer transformation. While a five-coordinate monomer is formed in ra-cemic or enantiopure Ir solution at 25 \u00b0C, a six-coordinate homochiral dimer complex is formed almost exclusively at low temperatures, with a higher degree of dimerization in enantiopure Ir solution. Estimation of dimerization binding constants (K) and thermodynamic parameters (\u0394H and \u0394S) based on variable temperature UV-Vis and 1H NMR spectra reveal a strong preference for homochiral dimerization (largest known value for coordination complex, Khomo/Khetero > 50) as a result of steric repulsions of peripheral alkyl chains in Ir heterochiral dimers. Notably, crystals of homochiral dimer are metastable, under-going a distinct colour change upon grinding (from yellow to red) due to mechanical cleavage of coordination bonds (i.e., a dimer to monomer transformation). Ir dimerization involves both strong homochiral self-sorting preference and connected thermo-/mechano-chromic behaviour, leading to emergence of dynamic functionality based on the rational design of discrete chiral assemblies.", "date": "2023-09-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Self-Assembly; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The particle-size distribution is most effectively determined by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). When metal catalysts are supported by high-performance mesoporous carbon materials, however, their mesopores may lead to erroneous particle-size estimation if the sizes of the catalysts and mesopores are comparable. Here we propose a novel approach to particle-size determination by introducing contrast variation-SAXS (CV-SAXS). In CV-SAXS, a multi-component sample is immersed in an inert solvent with a density equal to that of one of the components, thereby rendering that particular component invisible to X-rays. We used a mixture of tetrabromoethane and dimethyl sulfoxide as a contrast-matching solvent for carbon. As a test sample, we prepared a mixture of a small amount of platinum (Pt) catalyst and a bulk of mesoporous carbon, and subjected it to SAXS measurement in the absence and presence of the solvent. In the absence of the solvent, the estimated Pt particle size was affected by the mesopores, but in the presence of the solvent, the Pt particle size was correctly estimated in spite of the low Pt content. The results demonstrate that the CV-SAXS technique is useful for correctly determining the particle-size distribution for low-Pt-content catalysts, for which demands are increasing to reduce the use of expensive Pt.", "date": "2023-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

While both dopants have a positive effect on the cycling stability, they are found to influence the properties in the high voltage regime in different ways. Through a combination of RIXS, XRD, XAS, PDF analysis, and DFT, we show that it is more than just suppression of the P2 to O2 phase transition that is critical for promoting the favorable properties, and that the interplay between Ni and O activity are also critical aspects that dictate the  performance. With Mg doping, we could enhance the Ni activity while simultaneously suppressing the O activity. This is surprising because it is in contrast to what has been reported in other Mn-based layered oxides where Mg is known to trigger oxygen redox. We address this contradiction by proposing a competing mechanism between Ni and Mg that impacts differences in O activity in Na0.67MgxNi0.33-xMn0.67O2 (x<0<0.33).

Hernandez; Paul S. Micus; Sean Alec Lois Sunga; Luca  Mazzei; Stefano Ciurli; Gabriele Meloni", "abstract": "Essential trace metals play key roles in the survival, replication, and virulence of bacterial pathogens. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the main bacterial cause of gastric ulcers, requires Ni(II) to colonize and persist in the acidic environment inside the stomach, exploiting the nickel-containing enzyme urease to catalyze the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate and create a pH-buffered microenvironment. Urease utilizes Ni(II) as a catalytic cofactor for its activity. In ureolytic bacteria, unique transmembrane (TM) transporters evolved to guarantee the selective uptake and efflux of Ni(II) across cellular membranes to meet the cellular requirements. NixA is an essential Ni(II) transporter expressed by H. pylori when the extracellular environment experiences a drop in pH. This Class I Nickel-Cobalt transporter of the NiCoT family catalyzes the uptake of Ni(II) across the inner membrane from the periplasm. In this study, we characterized NixA using a platform whereby, for the first time on a NiCoT transporter, recombinantly expressed and purified NixA, and key mutants in the translocation pathway, have been reconstituted in artificial lipid bilayer vesicles (proteoliposomes). Fluorescent sensors responsive to Ni(II) transport (Fluozin-3-Zn(II)), luminal pH changes (pyranine), and membrane potential (oxonol VI) were encapsulated in proteoliposome lumen to monitor, in real-time, NixA transport properties and translocation mechanism. Kinetic transport analysis revealed that NixA is highly selective for Ni(II) with no substrate promiscuity towards Co(II), the other putative metal substrate of the NiCoT family, nor Zn(II). NixA-mediated Ni(II) transport exhibited a Michaelis-Menten-type saturable substrate concentration dependence, with an experimental KM, Ni(II) = 30.97 +/- 1.20 uM. Moreover, Ni(II) transport by NixA was demonstrated to be electrogenic, and  metal translocation did not require a proton motive force, resulting in the generation of a positive-inside transmembrane potential in the proteoliposome lumen. Mutation analysis characterized key transmembrane residues for substrate recognition, binding, and/or transport, suggesting the presence of a three-step transmembrane translocation conduit. Taken together, these investigations reveal that NixA is a Ni(II)-selective Class I NiCoT electrogenic uniporter.

The CF+ di\u0002atomic molecule is one such molecule that has been observed spectroscopically in the ISM. Previous experimental and theoretical work have examined different spectroscopic aspects of the CF+ molecule but the development of newer, more complete potential energy curves and dipole moment functions allow for even greater insight. We constructed both potential energy curves and dipole moment functions for the ground X1\u03a3+ and first excited a3\u03a0 states of CF+ for both 12C and 13C isotopologues.

Significant multireference character was identified in\nthe electronic structure of CF+ which prompted the need for such high-level corrections to the PEC.

Gaining a fundamental understanding of these reaction mechanisms is a challenging goal that requires advanced computational and experimental approaches. However, important techniques such as molecular simulation have limitations in terms of scales of time, length and system complexity. Furthermore, among currently available solvation models, there are very few designed to describe the interaction between the molecular scale and mesoscale. To help address this challenge, here we establish a novel hybrid approach that couples first principle plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) with classical density functional theory (cDFT). In this approach, a region of interest described by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) interacts with the surrounding medium described using cDFT to arrive at a self-consistent ground state. cDFT is a robust but efficient mesoscopic approach to accurate thermodynamics of bulk electrolyte solutions over a wide concentration range (up to 2 molar concentrations). Benchmarking against commonly used continuum models of solvation such as SMD, as well as experiment, demonstrates that our hybrid AIMD/cDFT method is able to produce reasonable solvation energies for a variety of molecules and ions. With this model, we also examined solvent effects on a prototype S$_N$2 reaction of the nucleophilic attack of a chloride ion on methyl chloride in solution. The resulting reaction pathway profile and the solution phase barrier agree well with the experiment, showing that our AIMD/cDFT hybrid approach can provide insight into the specific role of solvent on the reaction coordinate.

With the emergence of the highly prevalent T790M and C797S drug-resistant mutations, a diverse arsenal of ATP-competitive molecules has led to the front-line drug AZD9291 (osimertinib) and several in clinical development. Several allosteric inhibitors bind a site adjacent to the ATP-binding site and exhibit synergy when dosed in combination with certain ATP-competitive inhibitors. Structure-guided design of molecules that anchor to both sites simultaneously, namely ATP-allosteric bivalent inhibitors, have been reported as proof-of-concept EGFR mutant-selective compounds, however their properties are underexplored and currently exhibit modest activity in human cancer cell lines. To better understand the structural and functional properties of such molecules, we have carried out structure-activity relationships (SAR) defining the groups of the allosteric pocket that are responsible for enabling mutant selectivity and potency of this series. We find that the back pocket phenol ring enables stronger binding while the methylisoindolinone is responsible for enabling selectivity for the oncogenic mutations. An optimized allosteric site-binding group and a C797-targeting ATP-site scaffold exhibit inhibitory effects in a variety of EGFR mutant cell lines, which is improved over earlier examples. Additionally, a closely related reversible-binding analogue exhibits mutant-selective activity and ~1 nM biochemical potency against L858R/T790M/C797S and promising antiproliferative effects in human cancer cells indicating that ATP-allosteric bivalent kinase inhibitors may serve as tool compounds in understanding overcoming these important resistance mechanisms.

The search for ideal linkers that can dexterously provide the dual functionalities of enhancing circulatory stability and facilitating the effective release of the tumor payload is a present and formidable challenge. The valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) linker, which is used in a wide range of ADCs, despite its approval by the Food and Drug Administration, is associated with several inherent drawbacks, including hydrophobicity-induced aggregation, limited payload capacity, and premature payload release. This study presents a paradigm shift from the conventional linear linker archetype by introducing an exo-linker avant-garde approach that repositions the cleavable peptide linker at the exo-position of the PAB moiety. This molecular refinement not only offered the possibility to overcome the intrinsic drawbacks of the Val-Cit platform, but also significantly improved ADC stability, therapeutic efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. In vitro and in vivo biological evaluations, confirmed that ADCs designed using the exo-linker blueprint significantly attenuated premature payload release, while increasing the drug-to-antibody ratio, even with hydrophobic payloads, and this without inducing pronounced aggregation. Therefore, the fabricated exo-linker represents a significant improvement with respect to traditional Val-Cit ADCs. Moreover, under the influence of enzymes, such as carboxylesterases and human neutrophil elastase, the payload remained stably conjugated to the ADC, underscoring a favorable safety profile and highlighting potential for clinical translatability. Thus, our findings also demonstrate the potential of the novel exo-linker paradigm as well as the profound implications of nuanced molecular modifications for reshaping ADC design and functionality.

The framework is divided into three main functionalities: (1) Jammy Key for Configurational Sampling (JKCS) to perform systematic configurational sampling of molecular clusters, (2) Jammy Key for Quantum Chemistry (JKQC) to analyze commonly used quantum chemistry output files and facilitate database construction, handling, and analysis, and (3) Jammy Key for Machine Learning (JKML) to manage machine learning methods in optimizing molecular cluster modeling.

The usual concept is then to condense data for interpretation into representations such as differential capacity, or dQ/dV, graphs. This is done to extract information related to phenomena such as the growth of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) or, more broadly, degradation. Typically, these measurements take several months because measurements for differential capacity analysis need to be performed at relatively low C-rates. An alternate charging schedule to CCCV is pulsed charging, where CC sections are interrupted by an open-circuit measurement on the second time scale. These and similar partially constant current strategies primarily target diffusive effects during charging and broadly fall into a linear charging category, where the time derivative for the actuated property is mostly zero. Herein, I explore nonlinear charging i.e., the process of actively applying a potential with a nontrivial time derivate and a resulting non-trivial current time derivative to engineer (dis)charge cycles with enhanced information density. This method of nonlinear charging is then used to charge a cell such that some potential ranges in the differential capacity diagram are omitted. This study is purely a simulative endeavor and not backed by experimentation, owing mainly to the lack of facile implementation of arbitrary function inputs for battery cyclers and might point to limitations of the underlying theory.

Continuously operating, fixed point methane monitoring systems provide a mechanism for narrowly constraining event durations, however even continuously operating monitoring systems do not detect releases from all emission sources at all times.  A method for using continuous monitoring system data to evaluate time to event detection was developed and demonstrated using data from a monitoring network operating in the Permian Basin of west Texas.

Herein, a facile but efficient approach is presented to achieve tunable multicolor afterglow and persistent NIR luminescence based on the direct phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) or sequential resonance energy transfer from the energy donor with ultralong room-temperature phosphorescence to the energy acceptors with red to NIR fluorescence. By simply regulating the doping compositions and concentrations of energy donor/acceptor pairs doped into the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix, the resulting PVA films exhibit persistent multicolor afterglow covering from visible to NIR regions. Notably, compared to the single-step PRET, the two-step sequential resonance energy transfer has the unique advantages of higher transfer efficiency of triplet excitons from the initial donor, a wider range of color-tunability mediated by the intermediary acceptor, and enhanced delayed fluorescence efficiency of the final acceptor. By preparing water-soluble PVA films with different doping compositions and concentrations, we demonstrate their great potential applications in advanced anti-counterfeiting and information encryption.

The development of TMCs enabling these technologies remains challenged by the need to optimize multiple properties within very large chemical spaces, in which the thirty transition metals can be combined with a virtually infinite number of ligands. In this work, we provide the open tmQMg-L dataset including 30K TMC ligands, which combines large chemical diversity with synthesizability. The charge and metal-coordination mode of the ligands were robustly defined with a novel algorithm based on graph and natural bond orbital theories. The tmQMg-L dataset was leveraged in the automated generation of 1.37M TMCs resulting from all possible combinations between a square planar palladium(II) scaffold and a pool of 50 different ligands. This TMC space was used to benchmark a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) that optimized two properties over a Pareto front; namely the polarizability (alpha) and the HOMO-LUMO gap (epsilon). The MOGA evolved 130 TMC hits with maximal (alpha, epsilon) values in a way that could be easily rationalized by analyzing the nature of the ligands selected. Instead of the traditional mutation and crossover of fragments within a single ligand, this MOGA implemented full-ligand genetic operations acting on all coordination sites, maximizing chemical diversity. Further, we extended this MOGA algorithm with the Pareto-Lighthouse functionality (PL-MOGA), which allows for controlling both the aim and scope of the multiobjective optimization over the Pareto front. In explicit spaces containing billions of TMCs, the PL-MOGA enabled the explainable generation of thousands of novel and highly diverse TMC hits.

Therefore, in this review, the latest Mg/Ca-biochar synthesis methods are evaluated, emphasizing the value of utilizing green/ waste materials and reagent-free fabrication methods leading to sustainable development. Among the loaded elements, Ca and Mg are employed to provide a prospect of high phosphate uptake as well as increased phosphate recovery. The spent Ca/Mg-biochar hybrids with large phosphate loadings can be implemented as safe slow-release phosphate fertilizers or can be recycled using practical methods; a recent study found that basification followed by tap water addition recovered over 82% phosphate, after reusing the absorbent for 4 cycles, without affecting its stability. At the end of the review, the real-time applications, and limitations of these biochars, important knowledge gaps in the literature, and future directions are summarized, aiming to promote the sustainable utilization of Ca/Mg-modified biochar in various environmental applications.

Due to the high stability of their C\u2013F bonds, PFAS or their transformation products (TPs) are persistent in the environment, leading to ubiquitous detection in various samples worldwide. Since PFAS are industrial chemicals, the availability of authentic PFAS reference standards is limited, making non-target screening (NTS) approaches based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) necessary for a more comprehensive characterization. NTS usually is a time-consuming process, since only a small fraction of the detected chemicals can be identified. Therefore, efficient prioritization of relevant HRMS signals is one of the most crucial steps. We developed PF\u0394Screen, a Python-based open-source tool with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to perform efficient feature prioritization by several PFAS specific techniques such as the highly promising MD/C-m/C approach, Kendrick mass defect analysis, diagnostic fragments (MS2), fragment mass differences (MS2) and suspect screening. Feature detection from vendor-independent MS raw data (mzML, data-dependent acquisition) is performed via pyOpenMS (or custom feature lists) with subsequent calculations for prioritization and identification of PFAS in both HPLC- and GC-HRMS data. The PF\u0394Screen workflow is presented on four PFAS-contaminated agricultural soil samples from south-western Germany. Over 15 classes of PFAS (more than 80 single compounds with several isomers) could be identified, including four novel classes, potentially TPs of the precursors fluorotelomer mercapto alkyl phosphates (FTMAPs). PF\u0394Screen can be used within the Python environment and is easily automatically installable and executable on Windows.

Meti; Srishti  Srivastava; Amar Srivastava; Timir Hajari; Mayank Dixit", "abstract": "Chloride-based ionic liquids, exemplified by 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM+ \u2212 Cl\u2212), possess the capacity to dissolve cellulose, a predominant constituent of biomass. However, their inherently high viscosity poses a hindrance to efficient biomass dissolution for biofuel production. An intriguing solution emerges through the utilization of chloride-based ionic liquids in combination with solvents like water and DMSO, offering a promising avenue to reduce ionic liquid viscosity and enhance the efficacy of biomass dissolution. Utilizing constrained molecular dynamics simulations, we have conducted an extensive exploration of the potentials of mean force (PMFs) governing the behavior of the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM+ \u2212 Cl\u2212) ion pair within dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-water mixtures. Analysis of the BMIM+ \u2212 Cl\u2212 ion pair PMFs has revealed a noteworthy trend: with increasing DMSO mole fraction, there is a conspicuous augmentation in the depths of the minima associated with both the contact ion pair (CIP) and the solvent-assisted ion pair (SAIP). Notably, the CIP minimum exhibits a more pronounced increment relative to the SAIP minimum. This compelling observation underscores the heightened thermodynamic favorability of ion pairing as the DMSO mole fraction elevates. The credibility of the PMFs is corroborated through the meticulous computation of ion pair residence times for various inter-ionic separations. Thermodynamic assessments discern an intriguing trend: within the range of DMSO mole fractions (xDMSO) spanning 0.10, 0.21, 0.35, and 0.48, the stabilization of both CIPs and SAIPs is driven by entropy. In contrast, for xDMSO values of 0.0, 0.91, and 1.00, enthalpy plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the CIP and SAIP states. Further insights emerge from the meticulous analysis of radial distribution functions (RDFs) characterizing the arrangement of water and DMSO molecules surrounding the BMIM+ \u2212 Cl\u2212 ion pair. This scrutiny reveals the propensity of water molecules to form hydrogen bonds with the chloride ion, while DMSO molecules preferentially engage in hydrogen bonding with the BMIM+ ion, both within the CIP and SAIP states. Re- markably, water emerges as the preferred solvent for the solvation of the BMIM+\u2212 Cl\u2212 ion pair, superseding the affinity of DMSO. A notable transition surfaces as the DMSO mole fraction transitions from 1.0 to 0.91, resulting in a pronounced diminishment in the stability of both CIP and SAIP states, attributed to a substantial amplification in the local water density. Significantly, the preferential binding coefficients (\u03b3) values for DMSO consistently show negativity, indicating its preferential exclusion from the BMIM+ \u2212 Cl\u2212 ion pair in DMSO-water mixtures.    The calculated decay times for the survival probabilities of water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) molecules in the vicinity of the BMIM+ \u2212 Cl\u2212 ion pair suggest that the water cluster surrounding the Cl\u2212 ion exhibits greater stability compared to the DMSO cluster around the Cl\u2212 ion, while conversely, the trend is reversed for the BMIM+ ion. These findings advance our understanding of ion pairing kinetics in DMSO-water mixtures, providing valuable insights applicable to a wide spectrum of endeavors, notably including the incorporation of BMIM+ \u2212 Cl\u2212 ionic liquids in the conversion of biomass into biofuels.", "date": "2023-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

By underscoring Thom\u2019s foundational work, we identify the parametric function characterizing bonding events along a reaction pathway through a three-step sequence to establish such association rigorously, namely: (a) computing the determinant of the Hessian matrix at all potentially degenerate critical points, (b) computing the relative distance between these points, and (c) assigning the unfolding based on these computations and considering the maximum number of critical points for each unfolding. In-depth examination of the ammonia inversion and the dissociation of ethane and ammonia borane molecules yields a striking discovery: no elliptic umbilic flag is detected along the reactive coordinate for any of the systems, contradicting previous reports. Our findings indicate that the core mechanisms of these chemical reactions can be understood using only two folds, the simplest polynomial of Thom's theory, leading to considerable simplification. In contrast to previous reports, no signatures of the elliptic umbilic unfolding were detected in any of the systems examined.

The detrimental effects of soil salinity on agricultural land are significant, resulting in substantial economic losses and diminished crop yields. Within this context, salinity disrupts the normal growth and development of Brassica sp. impacting crucial physiological and biochemical processes, particularly photosynthesis and water use efficiency. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these responses is critical for developing effective strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of salinity and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. Researchers have devoted considerable effort to studying salt-tolerant genotypes of Brassica sp, which exhibit improved resilience to saline environments. Through comprehensive investigations, they have elucidated the intricate molecular mechanisms responsible for conferring salt tolerance in these genotypes. These mechanisms involve the activation and/or regulation of specific salt-tolerant genes, playing a pivotal role in mitigating the harmful effects of salinity. In addition to molecular mechanisms, plants, including Brassica juncea, have evolved various morphological, physiological, and biochemical adaptations to cope with abiotic stresses like salinity. These adaptations include the deposition of organic compounds, the maintenance of ionic homeostasis, the scavenging of free radicals, and the induction of phytohormones. These complex responses collectively contribute to the plant's ability to tolerate and adapt to salinity, ultimately promoting its survival and productivity in challenging environments. By unravelling the intricacies of the response of Brassica sp. to saline conditions and understanding the underlying molecular and physiological processes, researchers and agricultural practitioners can develop targeted strategies to improve salt tolerance in this species and others facing similar challenges. Implementing these strategies can enhance long-term food production and ensure sustainable agricultural practices, even in the face of increasing global population and the adverse impacts of climate change.", "date": "2023-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The antiproliferative potential of the RuPCs and active Ru complexes was evaluated in four breast cancer cell lines with different FGFR expression levels (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-134-VI, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231) and in the normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) cell line, at pH 6.8 and 7.4 that mimics the tumor microenvironment and normal tissues/bloodstream, respectively.

In that regard we shed new light on an intriguing growth mode for electrodeposited lithium in this work, where lithium self-assembles in a compact columnar morphology. Such growth results in topographically smooth layers and a particular stripping behavior along the length of these nanorods, rather than from the top down. Here, we demonstrate the electroplating of smooth layers of columnar lithium using LiTFSI and LiClO4 salts, which rules out the commonly found explanation of a LiF interface layer directing growth. Rather, we find that the addition of water to these (non-hydrolising) electrolytes is key for the guided growth. We investigate its effect both during electrochemical formation (applied potentials > Li+/Li), and growth (applied potentials < Li+/Li), and observe that the presence of water is required during the whole process. We use a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) to study the process in-situ, and find that hydrogen is continuously generated. Notably, hydrogen is generally considered as a side-product in the LiF based mechanism, and we therefore suggest that the evolution of hydrogen is in fact the critical component for the directed growth.

In this work, we report on the formation of superlattices from aluminum oxide shelled CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals where the oxide shell is grown by colloidal atomic layer deposition. We demonstrate that the structural stability of these superlattices is preserved over 25 days and that colloidal atomic layer deposition yields structural protection and an enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yields and radiative lifetimes as opposed to gas phase atomic layer deposition or excess capping group addition. Structural analyses found that shelling resulted in smaller nanocrystals that pack more tightly within the superlattice forming uniform supercrystals due to the aluminum oxide layers that cause increasingly hard cube behavior leading to a higher packing density than superlattices assembled from softer cubes without aluminum oxide. These effects are in addition to the increasingly static capping group chemistry initiated when oleic acid is used to terminate atomic layer deposition and is subsequently installed as a capping ligand directly on aluminum oxide.

While there are a variety of techniques for methane detection and measurement, aircraft-mounted sensors have become popular for both academic studies and operators in onshore regions in North America due to their ability to screen many sites in a relatively short amount of time. Many traditional leak detection and repair techniques, like optical gas imaging, and emerging approaches like aircraft-based or satellite-based screenings are periodic, which means that they can provide information about the presence of emissions and approximate rates during the observation period. Scaling periodic observations to annual emission estimates needed for regulatory and corporate reporting requires information on emission duration, which is not generally provided by the same screening techniques. In the literature to-date, there have been several statistical approaches proposed for annualization of basin-level methane observations, but these techniques may struggle to downscale to individual operators, across which methane emission intensities are expected to vary. This paper proposes a novel, conceptual framework for using other sources of data, such as records from operator inspections and parametric monitoring, to help define the duration of detected methane emissions. Such information may prove to be a useful input to measurement-informed methane emission protocols that are under development by multi-stakeholder groups, like GTI Energy Veritas, and Federal agencies in the United States.", "date": "2023-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Often, various interfacial layers are used to overcome this issue. However, the origin of such quenching and the type of interactions between perovskites and HTLs are still ambiguous. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the luminescence quenching of CsPbBr3 by a commonly employed hole transport polymer, Poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)-diphenylamine) (TFB) in LEDs. Strong and weak quantum-confined CsPbBr3 (nanoplatelets (NPLs)/nanocrystals (NCs)) are rationally selected to study the quenching mechanism by considering the differences in their morphology, energy level alignments, and quantum confinement. The steady-state and time-resolved Stern-Volmer plots unravel the dominance of dynamic and static quenching at lower and higher concentrations of TFB, respectively, with maximum quenching efficiency of 98 %. The quenching rate in NCs is faster than in NPLs owing to their longer PL lifetimes and weak quantum confinement. The ultrafast transient absorption results support these dynamics and rule out the involvement of Forster or Dexter energy transfer. Finally, the 1D 1H and 2D NOESY NMR study confirms the exchange of native ligands at the NCs surface with TFB, leading to dark CsPbBr3-TFB ensemble formation accountable for luminescence quenching. This highlights the critical role of the triarylamine functional group on TFB (which is also the backbone of many HTLs) in the quenching process. These results shed light on the underlying reasons for the luminescence quenching in PeLEDs and will help to choose the interfacial layers rationally for developing efficient LEDs.

Solid-state lithium thin film batteries (TFB) fabricated on thin substrates and packaged in a multilayer stack offer these attributes, overcoming the limitations of lithium-ion batteries based on liquid electrolytes. To maximize the VED, an anodeless architecture fabricated using a roll-to-roll process on an ultrathin stainless-steel substrate (10-75 um in thickness) has been developed.

Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a rare electroneutral [2]catenane using a powerful, doubly charged sulfate template and a complementary diamidocarbazole-based hydrogen bonding precursor. Owing to the unique three-dimensional hydrogen bonding cavity and the embedded carbazole fluorophores, the resulting catenane receptor functions as a sensitive fluorescent turn-ON sensor for the highly hydrophilic sulfate, even in the presence of large excess of water. Importantly, the [2]catenane exhibits enhanced binding affinity and selectivity for sulfate over its parent macrocycle and other acyclic diamidocarbazole-based receptors. We demonstrate also, for the first time, that the co-conformation of the catenane may be controlled by reversible acid/base induced protonation and deprotonation of the sulfate anionic template.

To fabricate porous g-C3N4, soft templates are frequently employed, leading to structural modifications originating from heteroatoms. However, many recent reports have ignored the roles of trace quantity of heteroatoms. Hence, to understand the impacts of the mentioned factors, we fabricated g-C3N4 containing oxygen and halogen atoms in the structures for piezo-photosynthesis of H2O2. Based on our analyzed results, oxygen atoms might be inserted into g-C3N4 in-plane structures, while halogen atoms tend to become intercalated between g-C3N4 layers. Furthermore, the presence of ammonium molten salts during the synthesis alters the concentration of mono and cluster vacancies of carbon and nitrogen in the materials. These defective contributions would meaningfully accelerate catalytic performance by providing trapping states. From the mechanistic view, different reduction and oxidation channels would play a pivotal role in generating H2O2.

Despite the high performance of PM6:Y6 blends, many aspects of the photophysics of this material remain unclear. Here we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of bulk heterojunction PM6:Y6 nanoparticles for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over 11 orders of magnitude in time, ranging from tens of femtoseconds to hundreds of microseconds. We find that the excitation of Y6 primarily results in the formation of charges first in Y6 domains, followed by diffusion of Y6 holes to PM6 domains. Upon excitation of PM6, charges are generated through two mechanisms: (1) energy transfer to Y6 followed by exciton dissociation and back hole transfer to PM6, and (2) electron transfer to Y6 facilitated by an interfacial charge-transfer state. We use kinetic modelling to confirm these mechanisms and determine the rates of formation and recombination of charges. We also investigate the PM6:Y6 nanoparticles under photocatalytic conditions, and show that the Pt co-catalyst can accept both Y6 electrons and Y6 holes on relatively fast (<100 ps) timescales, and that the sacrificial electron donor ascorbic acid scavenges holes from both components on picosecond and microsecond timescales.

To produce a particular functional response, drugs need to regulate the targets\u2019 signal transduction pathways, either blocking the proteins\u2019 functions or modulating their activities by changing the conformational equilibrium. The routinely calculated binding free energy of a compound to its target is a good predictor of affinity but may not always predict efficacy. While the time scales for the protein conformational changes are prohibitively long to be routinely modeled via physics-based simulations, thermodynamic principles suggest that binding free energies of the ligands with different receptor conformations may infer their efficacy if the functional response of the receptor is determined by thermodynamics. However, while this hypothesis was proposed in the past, it has not been thoroughly validated and is seldom used in practice for ligand efficacy prediction. We present an actionable protocol and a comprehensive validation study to show that binding thermodynamics provides indeed a strong predictor for the efficacy of a ligand. We apply the absolute-binding free energy perturbation (ABFEP) method to ligands bound to active and inactive states of eight G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) and a nuclear receptor. By comparing the resulting binding free energies, we can determine with a very high accuracy whether a ligand acts as an agonist or an antagonist.

In this study, we investigate the CO2 reduction reaction on bimetallic Cu paddlewheel complexes, aiming to understand the impact metal doping has on bimetallic paddlewheel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Doping the paddlewheel with Mn results in a more catalytically active Cu center, poised to produce substantial quantities of formic acid (HCOOH) and minor quantities of methane (CH4) with a suppressed production of C2 products. Moreover, the presence of Mn as a dopant significantly reduces the limiting potential for CO2 reduction from 2.22 eV on the homo-bimetallic Cu paddlewheel complex to 1.19 eV, thereby necessitating a smaller applied potential. Conversely, within the Co-doped paddlewheel complex, the Co-site emerges as the primary catalytic center, selectively yielding CH4 as the sole reduced CO2 product, with a limiting potential of 1.22 eV. Notably, the Co site faces substantial competition from H2 production, attributed to a lower limiting potential of 0.81 eV for hydrogen reduction. Our examination of the Cu-Ni paddle-wheel complex, featuring a Ni dopant, reveals two catalytically active centers, each promoting distinct reductive processes. Both the Ni and Cu sites exhibit a propensity for HCOOH formation, with the Ni site favoring further reduction to CH4, while the Cu site directs the reaction towards methanol (CH3OH) production. This highlights the profound influence of metal dopant incorporations on the type and quantity of products generated during CO2 reduction.", "date": "2023-09-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Providing direct evidence of in situ transformation using concentrations and biogeochemical parameters alone is challenging. Compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) is a widely used tool to assess in situ transformation of contaminants based on changes in their stable isotope signatures. In this work, we evaluated the potential of CSIA to identify and possibly quantify the in situ transformation of six NO2- and NH2-chlorobenzenes in complex aqueous samples from a pilot constructed wetland system. No significant changes in \u03b413C, i.e., \u22642\u2030 were observed for any of the target compounds despite the contaminant concentration decreased by more than 99% between the inlet and outlet of the system. Using multi-element CSIA of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen and laboratory-derived isotope enrichment factors, we successfully identified and quantified the extent of in situ transformation of 2,3-dichloroaniline (2,3-DCA) in the pilot constructed wetlands. The isotopic trends provide evidence for aerobic biotransformation as a dominant pathway in the surface flow planted wetlands; whereas sorption was identified as the likely process in planted and unplanted upflow gravel bed wetlands during the initial wetland operation periods. Another major contaminant from the NO2-chlorobenzene group, i.e., 2-chloronitrobenzene (2-CNB), showed negligible \u03b413C, and small \u03b42H (\u00b120\u2030) and \u03b415N (\u00b12\u2030) isotope fractionation. No laboratory-controlled CSIA studies are yet available for 2-CNB biotransformation to characterize transfer and transformation processes.

We combined the high specificity of aptamer molecular recognition with the easy-to-detect properties of fluorescent proteins. We tested six different aptamer biosensors, showcasing the platform versatility. The biosensors display high sensitivity and specificity for detecting their specific drug target over related analogs. Furthermore, the biosensor responses were dose dependent and could be detected in individual live cells. We designed our platform for easy integration into animal genomes; thus, we incorporated one aptamer biosensor into zebrafish, an important model vertebrate.

In the present work, we numerically demonstrated that these high-order plasmonic modes can be used to switch nanoscale temperature distributions in plasmonic heating of a manganese (Mn) nanorod; the key feature of Mn is its low thermal conductivity. In general, when noble metal nanostructures are used for the plasmonic heating, nanostructure surface will be almost isothermal regardless of the order of the excited plasmonic modes, because of high thermal conductivities of noble metals: e.g. a themal conductivity of gold is 314 [W m\u22121K\u22121]. However, in contrast to noble metals, Mn possesses a significantly lower thermal conductivity of 7.8 [W m\u22121K\u22121]. Due to this lower thermal conductivity value, the distinct spatial characteristics of high-order plasmonic modes can be clearly transcribed into nanoscale temperature fields; this is achieved through the generation of polarization currents by the high-order plasmons within the nanorod. These findings strongly suggest that high-order plasmonic modes hold significant potential for advanced and precise manipulation of heat generation at the nanometer scale in the field of thermoplasmonics.

Despite their scarcity, natural products that modulate protein function through covalent interactions with lysine residues hold immense potential to unlock new therapeutic interventions and advance our understanding of the biological processes governed by these modifications. Phloroglucinol meroterpenoids constitute one of the most expansive classes of natural products, displaying a plethora of biological activities. However, their mechanism of action and cellular targets have, until now, remained elusive. In this study, we detail the concise biomimetic synthesis, computational mechanistic insights, physicochemical attributes, kinetic parameters, molecular mechanism of action, and functional cellular targets of several phloroglucinol meroterpenoids. We harness synthetic clickable analogues of natural products to probe their disparate proteome-wide reactivity and subcellular localization through in-gel fluorescence scanning and cell imaging. By implementing sample multiplexing and a redesigned lysine-targeting probe, we streamline a quantitative activity-based protein profiling, enabling the direct mapping of global reactivity and ligandability of proteinaceous lysines in human cells. Leveraging this framework, we identify numerous lysine-meroterpenoid interactions in breast cancer cells at tractable protein sites across diverse structural and functional classes, including those historically deemed undruggable. We validate that phloroglucinol meroterpenoids perturb biochemical functions through stereoselective and site-specific modification of lysines in proteins vital for breast cancer metabolism, including lipid signaling, mitochondrial respiration, and glycolysis. These findings underscore the broad potential of phloroglucinol meroterpenoids for targeting functional lysines in the human proteome.", "date": "2023-09-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Natural Products; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

First, an optimal ViT model was trained to predict metal organic frameworks (MOFs) from their XRD spectra.

The lattice-distortion localization of photoexcited carriers in the form of polarons plays a pivotal role in the photocatalysis. This investigation focuses on rutile TiO2, an important material extensively explored for solar energy conversion in artificial photosynthesis, specifically targeting the generation of green H2 through photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2O splitting. By employing Hubbard-U corrected and hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, we systematically probe the polaronic effects in the catalysis of  oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the (110) surface of rutile TiO2. Theoretical understanding of polarons within the surface, coupled with simulations of OER at distinct titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) active sites, reveals diverse polaron formation energies within the lattice sites with strong preference for bulk and surface bridge oxygen (Ob) sites. Moreover, we provide the evidence for the facilitative role of polarons in mitigating OER. We find that hole polarons situated at the equatorial positions near the Ti - active site, along with bridge hole polarons distal from the Ob active site yield a reduction in OER overpotential by (4.6-6.5)%.  We also find that having hole polarons stabilize the *OH, *O, and *OOH intermediate species when compared to case without hole polarons.

Herein, we use a recently developed combined computational and experimental approach that leverag-es ab-initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) and Metadynamics (MTD) in conjunction with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, chemisorption and CO-IR, to explore the dynamic structures and interactions with ad-sorbates under various CO2 hydrogenation conditions in well-defined state-of-the-art silica-supported PdGa NPs on an atomic level. We find that PdGa alloying generates isolated Pd sites at the NP surface, changing the dominant binding modes of relevant adsorbates compared to pure Pd NPs: CO molecules mainly adopt terminal binding modes and hydrides switch from mainly internal to terminal and \u03bc2-bridging in PdGa NPs. Under more oxidizing conditions, akin to CO2 hydrogenation for PdGa NPs, Ga is partially oxidised, forming a GaOX layer on the surface of the NP, with a partially dealloyed PdGa core, that retains some isolated Pd sites at the surface.

A careful interpretation of TA spectra is essential for the clarification of excitation energy transfer (EET) processes occurring during light-harvesting. However, even in the simplest LHCs, a physical model is needed to interpret transient spectra, as the number of EET processes occurring at the same time is too large to be disentangled from measurements alone. Physical EET models are commonly built by fittings of the microscopic exciton Hamiltonians and exciton-vibrational parameters, an approach that can lead to biases. Here we present a first-principles strategy to simulate EET and transient absorption spectra in LHCs, combining molecular dynamics and accurate multiscale quantum chemical calculations to obtain an independent estimate of the excitonic structure of the complex. The microscopic parameters thus obtained are then used in EET simulations to obtain the population dynamics and the related spectroscopic signature. We apply this approach to the CP29 minor antenna complex of plants, for which we follow the EET dynamics and transient spectra after excitation in the chlorophyll b region. Our calculations reproduce all the main features observed in the transient absorption spectra and provide independent insight on the excited-state dynamics of CP29.

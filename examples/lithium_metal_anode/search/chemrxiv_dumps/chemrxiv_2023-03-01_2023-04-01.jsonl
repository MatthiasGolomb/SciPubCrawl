Here, we use square wave voltammetry (SWV) to enable measurements of both types of electrochemical reactions using n-Si/Au NP LAE sensors. We demonstrated this approach for the oxidation of ferrocene methanol and the reductions of ruthenium hexamine and methylene blue. We found that for all molecules, SWV showed dramatic improvements in current under illumination in comparison with dark samples. We also demonstrate that this approach works for both fully illuminated and partially illuminated samples. Altogether, we hope these results open up new applications for LAE sensors, especially those based on semiconductor/metal junctions.", "date": "2023-03-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Currently zinc is widely used as a single element tracer to quantify tyre wear, however several authors have highlighted issues with this approach. To overcome this, tyre rubber tread was digested and has been analysed for 25 elements by ICP-MS to generate a multielement profile.  Additionally, to estimate the percentage of the tyre made up of inert fillers, thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a subset. Comparisons were made between passenger car and heavy goods vehicle tyre composition, and a subset of tyres had both tread and sidewall sampled for further comparison. Finds showed 19 of the 25 elements were detected in the analysis. The mean mass fraction of zinc detected was 11.17 g/kg, consistent with previous estimates of 1% of the tyre mass. Aluminium, iron, and magnesium were found to be the next most abundant elements, and barium, magnesium and tin were all detected at higher concentrations than have been reported previously. The analysis found significant differences in elemental composition of goods vehicle and passenger car tyres, which could potentially allow for separate source profiles for each type. Only one source profile for tyre wear exists in both the US and EU air pollution species profile databases, highlighting the need for more recent data with better coverage of tyre makes and models. This study provides data on new tyres which are currently operating on-road in Europe and is therefore relevant for ongoing atmospheric studies assessing the levels of tyre wear particles in urban areas.

This is illustrated by comparing Mo-based (pre)catalysts prepared by impregnation with different metal loadings (2.5-15.6 wt% Mo) and a well-defined model material (2.3 wt% Mo) prepared via a surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) synthetic approach. Analyses of FTIR, UV-vis, and Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectra provide strong evidence that all the (pre)catalysts are composed predominantly of similar isolated Mo dioxo sites; however, they exhibit very different proportions of reducible surface sites and catalytic reaction properties. Specifically, the SOMC-derived catalyst is more active for liquid and gas-phase olefin metathesis conditions than a classical catalyst of similar Mo loading by a factor of 1.5-1.9, depending on precise reaction conditions. Most notably, solid-state 95Mo NMR spectra of these catalysts show distinct features, particularly evident under state-of-the-art high-field (28.2 T) measurement conditions where at least four distinct types of surface Mo dioxo sites are resolved, the distribution of which depends on the preparation methods. In particular, the presence of Mo sites with a specific deshielded 95Mo NMR signal correlates with the catalysts reducibility and metathesis activity; such sites are most prominent in the SOMC-derived catalyst. First-principles calculations show that the 95Mo NMR parameters, specifically the isotropic chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constant, are good descriptors for local strain and coordination environment: acute (SiO-Mo(O)2-OSi) angles and low coordination numbers at the Mo sites leads to highly deshielded iso chemical shifts and small CQ values, respectively. Orbital and natural chemical shift analyses indicate that the deshielded 95Mo iso values of strained species are directly related to low LUMO energies, consistent with their higher reducibility and corresponding reactivity. Overall, this study shows that solid-state NMR is particularly powerful for the identification of distinct supported Mo dioxo species and that their 95Mo chemical shifts are related to their specific local electronic structures, providing a powerful descriptor for the propensity of Mo sites towards reduction and the formation of active sites.

Moreover, inclusion of FP fragments could lead to, for example, wrong identification further down the workflow. Commonly used methods for deconvolution of fragment signals rely on the presence of a time domain (e.g., peak apex retention time difference and correlation analysis). However, when there is no or insufficient MS2 information in the time domain, these methods are unusable and only the mass domain remains. A probability based cumulative neutral loss (CNL) model for fragment deconvolution using the mass domain information was thus developed to allow deconvolution for such cases. The optimized model, with a mass tolerance of 0.005 Da and a CNL score threshold of -0.95, was able to achieve true positive rate (TPr) of 95.0%, a false discovery rate (FDr) of 25.6%, and a reduction rate of 39.9%. Additionally, the CNL model was extensively tested on real samples containing predominantly pesticides at different concentration levels and with matrix effects. Overall, the model was able to obtain a TPr above 95% with FD rates between 45% and 77% and reduction rates between 10% and 24%. Finally, the CNL model was compared with the retention time difference method and peak shape correlation analysis, showing that a combination of correlation analysis and the CNL model was the most effective for fragment deconvolution, obtaining a TPr of 93.1%, a FDr of 57.2%, and a reduction rate of 42.6%.", "date": "2023-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Constant potential or grand canonical ensemble (GCE) simulations are indispensable for unraveling the properties of electrochemical processes as a function of the electrode potential. Currently, GCE calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level are carried out by fixing the Fermi level of the simulation cell. Here we show that this method is inadequate for modelling semiconductor electrodes, outer sphere reactions, and a biased two-electrode cell; for these systems the Fermi level obtained from DFT calculations does not reflect the experimentally controlled electrode potential or describe the thermodynamic independent variable in GCE-DFT. To remedy this deficiency, we developed and implemented a constant inner potential (CIP) method as a more robust and general approach to carry out GCE-DFT simulations of electrochemical systems under constant potential or bias conditions. In CIP-DFT the electrode inner potential and hence the thermodynamically relevant electron bath electrochemical are directly controlled which makes the method widely applicable in simulating electrochemical interfaces. We demonstrate that the CIP and Fermi level GCE-DFT approaches are equivalent for metallic electrodes and inner-sphere reactions but CIP is also applicable to systems for which the constant Fermi level approach fails. A key advantage of CIP is that, unlike the Fermi level method, it does not require any electronic structure information. This is because only the inner potential of the systems is needed, CIP is also more compatible with classical force field or machine learning potentials. Altogether, the CIP approach emerges as a general and efficient GCE-DFT method to simulate (photo)electrochemical interfaces from first principles.", "date": "2023-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Senile cataractous lenses have relatively high levels of metals, while some metal ions can directly induce aggregation of human -crystallins. Here we evaluated the impact of divalent metal ions in the aggregation of human B2-crystallin, one of the most abundant crystallins in the lens. Turbidity assays showed that Pb2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ ions induce the aggregation of B2-crystallin. Metal-induced aggregation is partially reverted by a chelating agent, indicating formation of metal-bridged species. Our study focused on the mechanism of copper-induced aggregation of B2-crystallin, finding that it involves metal-bridging, disulfide-bridging, and loss of protein stability. Circular dichroism (CD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed the presence of at least three Cu2+ binding sites in B2-crystallin; one of them with spectroscopic features typical of Cu2+ bound to an amino-terminal copper and nickel binding motif (ATCUN), a motif found in Cu transport proteins. The ATCUN-like Cu binding site is located at the unstructured N-terminus of B2-crystallin, and it could be modeled by a peptide with the first six residues in the protein sequence (NH2-ASDHQF-). Removal of the N-terminus yields an N-truncated form of B2-crystallin that is more susceptible to Cu-induced aggregation and loss of thermal stability, indicating a protective role for the ATCUN-like site. EPR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies reveal the presence of a copper redox active site in B2-crystallin that is associated to metal-induced aggregation and formation of disulfide-bridged oligomers. Our study demonstrates metal-induced aggregation of cataract-related B2-crystallin and the presence of putative copper binding sites in the protein. Whether the copper-transport ATCUN-like site in B2-crystallin plays a functional/protective role or constitute a vestige from its evolution as a lens structural protein, remains to be elucidated.

Cavitation caused by ultrasound fields cause local and transient increases in temperature and pressure sufficient to drive the decomposition of organometalic precursors to drive the chemical reaction leading to nanocrystal formation. A total of 625 unique sample conditions were prepared and analyzed in triplicate with an individual sample volume of as little as 0.5 mL, which drastically reduced chemical waste and experimental times. The rapid onset of cavitation and quick dissipation of energy results in fast nucleation with little nanocrystal growth leading to the formation of small nanocrystals or magic-size clusters (MSCs) depending on composition. Using the effective mass approximation, the calculated QDs diameters obtained in all our experimental conditions ranged between 1.3 and 2.1 nm, which was also validated with small angle xray scattering (SAXS).

While often successful, genetic modification of capsids can drastically reduce vector yield and often fails to produce vectors with properties that translate across species. Here, we describe a chemical bioconjugation strategy to modify tyrosine residues on AAV capsids using specific ligands, thereby circumventing the need to genetically engineer the capsid sequence. Aromatic electrophilic substitution of the phenol ring of tyrosine residues on AAV capsids improved the in vivo transduction efficiency of rAAV2 vectors in both liver and retinal targets. This tyrosine bioconjugation strategy represents an innovative technology for the engineering of rAAV vectors for human gene therapy.", "date": "2023-03-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Cell and Molecular Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Mesoporous silica materials have emerged as new biocompatible tools for drug delivery, as their pore size can be modulated for maximum surface area to volume ratio. In this contribution, we evaluate the ability of iron-modified mesoporous materials for morin loading and controlled delivery. Methods: The SBA-15 and MCM-41 sieves were synthesized and modified with iron. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy, XRD and UV-Vis revealed adequate pore size and agglomerates of very small metallic nanospecies (nanoclusters), without larger iron oxide nanoparticles. FT-IR spectra confirmed the presence of silanol groups in the solid hosts, which can interact with different groups present in the morin molecules. The incorporation of morin was also corroborated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Results: SBA-15 materials were more efficient in terms of morin loading capacity due to their larger pore diameter. Finally, biosafety studies using normal epithelial cells revealed that neither the loaded nor the unloaded materials exerted toxicity, even at doses of 1 mg/ml. Conclusions: these findings expand knowledge about mesoporous materials as suitable carriers of flavonoids with the aim of improving therapies for a wide range of pathologies.

DszC is one of the rate-limiting enzymes of the pathway and the one that most suffers from feedback inhibition. We have combined molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to identify binding sites through which two products of the 4S pathway, 2-hydroxybiphenyl, and 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate, induce DszC feedback inhibition. We have identified four potential binding sites: two adjacent binding sites close to the 280-295 lid loop proposed to contribute to DszC oligomerization and proper binding of the flavin mononucleotide cofactor, and two other close to the active site of DszC and the substrate binding site. By considering i) the occupancy of the binding sites and ii) the similar inhibitor poses, we propose that the mechanism of feedback inhibition of DszC occurs through disturbance of the DszC oligomerization and consequent binding of the flavin mononucleotide due to the weakening of the interactions between the 280-295 lid loop and both the 131-142 loop and the C-terminal tail. Nevertheless, inhibitor binding close to the active site or the substrate binding sites also compromises critical interactions within the active site of DszC.

We report the results of computational modeling of the reactions of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro ) with four potential covalent inhibitors. Two of them, carmofur and nirmatrelvir, have been shown experimentally the ability to inhibit MPro . Two other compounds, X77A and X77C, were designed computationally in this work, derived from the structure of X77, a non-covalent inhibitor forming a tight surface complex with MPro . We modified the X77 structure by introducing warheads capable of efficient chemical reactions with the catalytic cysteine residue in the M Pro active site. The reaction mechanisms of the four molecules with M Pro were investigated by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations using large quantum subsystems. First, at the QM/MM level, we optimized structures of stationary points on the potential energy surfaces corresponding to the reactants, products, intermediates, and transition states along the hypothesized reaction coordinates. Analysis of these structures has informed the selection of collective variables for the subsequent calculations of the Gibbs energy profiles using molecular dynamics simulations with QM/MM potentials (QM/MM MD). In these simulations, the QM part was treated by DFT with the PBE0 functional. The results show that all four compounds form covalent adducts with the catalytic cysteine Cys 145 of MPro . From the chemical perspective, the reactions of these four compounds with M Pro follow three distinct mechanisms. In all cases, the reaction is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of the thiolate group of the deprotonated cysteine residue from the catalytic dyad Cys145-His41 of MPro . In the case of carmofur and X77A, the covalent binding of the thiolate to the ligand is accompanied by the formation of the fluoro-uracil leaving group. The reaction with X77C follows the nucleophilic aromatic substitution SN Ar mechanism. The reaction of M Pro with nirmatrelvir, which has a reactive nitrile group, leads to the formation of the covalent thioimidate adduct with the thiolate of the Cys145 residue in the enzyme active site.", "date": "2023-03-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In particular, experiments with nerve agents are limited by the high risks involved in their handling.

In this work, for the first time, O-2-methoxyethyl N-[bis(dimethylamino)methylidene]-P-methylphosphonamidate, an analog of the Novichok nerve agent A-242, was synthesized employing a one-pot microscale synthesis. Electron ionization (EI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were measured to produce data for CWC verification purposes. Considering that ESI-MS/MS is a powerful method for analyzing non-volatile, highly polar, and very water-soluble compounds, such as degradation products of nerve agents, we extensively investigated for the first time the ESI-(collision-induced dissociation) CID fragmentation pathways of the selected molecule. For this purpose, molecular dynamics simulations using the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) method employing the semiempirical electronic structure method GFN2-xTB were compared with Triple Quadrupole electrospray ionization (ESI) experimental spectra in positive ion mode. The base peak of the EI spectrum for this molecule was found to be m/z 151, which strongly suggests a McLafferty +1 rearrangement involving the 2-methoxyethyl moiety. According to the simulations, the formation of the m/z 106 ion in the ESI-CID spectrum results from the rearrangement involving a transfer of one dimethylamino group to the phosphorus atom.

Our study not only deciphers the mechanism of a rare selective terpolymerisation but also helps answering open questions relevant to ring-opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) and alkali-metal catalysis in general, thus guiding the design of future polymerisation catalysis for degradable materials.", "date": "2023-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To lock the phenyl ring into a trans conformation, cyclic tertiary amides were prepared. Indoline and quinoline cholan-24-amides were both inhibitors of spore germination; however, the indoline analogs were most potent. Isoindoline and isoquinoline amides were inactive.

Recently, a model was proposed for the shear viscosity of liquid HMX (1,3,5,7- tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane) that was fit to pressures reaching 5 GPa, but this work uncovered uncertainties in the viscosity at 0 GPa and remains untested at higher pressures. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the Green-Kubo formalism to predict the temperature and pressure-dependent shear viscosity of HMX over the pressure interval 0 GPa <= P <= 40 GPa. Reassessment of the viscosity at 0 GPa rules out several potential explanations for discrepancies between earlier reports; we tentatively attribute these differences to details of MD trajectory integration and analysis protocols. The shear viscosity of HMX exhibits an Arrhenius temperature dependence at each pressure considered, with exponential prefactor and activation energy terms that are also strong functions of pressure. An analytic form for the viscosity is developed based on an extension of the well-known Andrade equation that simultaneously captures the temperature and pressure dependencies in the MD data up to 40 GPa. Comparison against a recently developed model for the viscosity of liquid RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane) shows that both materials exhibit similar functional dependencies with the viscosity of HMX being higher by roughly an order of magnitude at a given temperature-pressure state.", "date": "2023-03-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This is particularly pronounced in graphene FET (GFET) biosensors, where the bare graphene surface possesses a strongly negative charge, which impedes the high sensitivity of GFETs owing to nonlinear electrolytic screening at the interfaces between graphene and liquid. In this study, we counteracted the negative surface charge of graphene by decorating positively charged compounds and demonstrated the sensing of C-reactive protein (CRP) with surface-charge-modulated GFETs (SCM-GFETs). We integrated multiple SCM-GFETs with anti-CRP antibodies and non-functionalized GFETs into a chip, and measured differentials to eliminate background changes to improve measurement reliability. The FET response corresponded to the fluorescence images, which visualized the specific adsorption of CRP. The estimated dissociation constant was consistent with previously reported values; this supports the conclusion that the results are attributed to specific adsorption. Conversely, the signal in GFETs without decoration was obscured by noise because of nonlinear electrolytic screening, further emphasizing the significance of surface-charge modulation. The limit of detection (LOD) of the system was determined to be 2.9 nM. This value has the potential to be improved through further optimization of the surface charges to align with specific applications.

Baird; Jeet N. Parikh; Taylor D. Sparks", "abstract": "Benchmarks are crucial for driving progress in scientific disciplines. To be effective, benchmarks should closely mimic real-world tasks while being computationally efficient, allowing for accessibility and repeatability. Developing surrogate models that can be indistinguishable from the ground truth observation within the explored dataset bounds dramatically reduces the computational burden of running benchmarks without sacrificing quality, but this requires a large amount of initial data. In the fields of materials science and chemistry, relevant optimization tasks can be challenging due to their complexity, which includes hierarchical, noisy, multi-fidelity, multi-objective, high-dimensional, and non-linearly correlated variables. Additionally, they may include mixed numerical and categorical variables that are subject to linear and non-linear constraints. Simulating or experimentally verifying such tasks can be difficult, which is why benchmarks are essential. This study aimed to overcome these challenges by generating 173219 quasi-random hyperparameter combinations across 23 hyperparameters and using them to train CrabNet on the Matbench experimental band gap dataset (Computational runtime: 387 RTX-2080-Ti GPU days). The results were stored in a free-tier shared MongoDB Atlas dataset, creating a regression dataset that maps hyperparameter combinations to metrics such as MAE, RMSE, computational runtime, and model size for the CrabNet model trained on the Matbench experimental band gap benchmark task. To simulate the actual simulations, heteroskedastic noise was incorporated into the regression dataset, and bad hyperparameter combinations were excluded. Percentile ranks were computed within each group of identical parameter sets to capture heteroskedastic noise, rather than assuming Gaussian noise as is done in traditional approaches. This approach can be applied to other benchmark datasets, bridging the gap between optimization benchmarks with low computational overhead and realistically complex, real-world optimization scenarios.", "date": "2023-03-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

At present, it persists because the effort that would be required to re-write molecular modelling software and train new force fields has, until now, been prohibitive. Here, we present smirnoff-plugins as a flexible framework to extend the Open Force Field software stack to allow custom force field functional forms.

However, most of the studies on photocatalytic H2O2 production using PCN-based photocatalysts reported so far have used PCN powder suspensions and have been carried out in the presence of additional (sacrificial) electron donors, such as aliphatic or aromatic alcohols. Herein, we report the first multicomponent hybrid photocathode based on PCN that is capable of selective reduction of dioxygen to H2O2 under visible light irradiation (420 nm LED). A comparative analysis of various photocathode architectures is carried out using electronic absorption spectroscopy, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, open-circuit photopotential spectroscopy, and photocurrent measurements, including in-situ detection of formed H2O2 using microelectrodes. Notably, the ability of PCN-based photocathodes to catalyze the light-driven reduction of O2 to H2O2 in the absence of any additional electron donor is unambiguously demonstrated. Our study thus highlights the intrinsic nature of the photocatalytic activity of PCN in H2O2 production, and paves the way for the development of further PCN-based photocathodes in which PCN could be coupled with more effective light absorbers to increase the overall performance.

Traditionally, new sequences are discovered either from screening large libraries or by creating derivatives of known active peptides. However, the discovery of de novo peptides, which are sequence-wise not related to any known active peptides, is limited by the difficulty to rationally predict structureactivity relationships because their activities typically have multi-scale and multi-parameter dependencies. Here, we used a small library of 163 peptides to predict de novo sequences for viral infectivity enhancement using a machine learning (ML) approach based on natural language processing. Specifically, we trained an ML model using continuous vector representations of the peptides, which were previously shown to retain relevant information embedded in the sequences. We used the trained ML model to sample the sequence space of peptides with 6 amino acids to identify promising candidates. These 6-mers were then further screened for charge and aggregation propensity. The resulting 16 new 6-mers were tested and found to be active with a 25% hit rate. Strikingly, these de novo sequences are the shortest active peptides for infectivity enhancement reported so far and show no sequence relation to the training set. Moreover, by screening the chemical space, we discovered the first hydrophobic peptide fibrils with a moderately negative surface charge that can enhance infectivity. Hence, this ML strategy is a time- and cost-efficient way for expanding the chemical space of short functional self-assembling peptides exemplified for therapeutic viral gene delivery.

Methods for direct covalent ligation of these surfaces remain poorly reported, and mostly based on metabolic engineering for bacteria and cells functionalization. In the latter case, a tagged precursor must first be enzymatically metabolized and delivered to the outer cell membrane to become available for chemo-selective labeling. While effective, a faster method avoiding the bio-incorporation step would be highly complementary. This would also need to be compatible with organisms showing poor levels of precursor assimilation or lacking the metabolic function. Here, we used N-methylluminol (NML), a fully tyrosine-selective protein anchoring group after one-electron oxidation, to label the surface of viruses, living bacteria and cells. The functionalization was performed electrochemically and in situ by applying a 750 mV vs Ag/AgCl electric potential to aqueous buffered solutions of tagged NML containing the viruses, bacteria or cells. The electro-coupling was performed with NML anchors bearing a bioorthogonal azide, biotin, or carbohydrate (mannose and N-acetyl galactosamine) handles. The broad applicability of the click-electrochemistry method was explored on recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV2), E. coli (Gram-) and S. epidermis (Gram+) bacterial strains, and HEK293 and HeLa eukaryotic cell lines. Surface electro-conjugation was achieved in minutes to yield functionalized rAAV2 that conserved both structural integrity and infectivity properties, and living bacteria and cell lines that were still alive and able to divide. As NML activation immediately stops if there is no current, the method offers reproducible temporal control on the degree of surface functionalization.

Only a few transition metal complexes with earth-abundant metal ions have so far advanced to excited state oxidants, including chromium, iron and cobalt. All these photocatalysts require high energy light for excitation and their oxidizing power has not been fully exploited due to significant energy dissipation before reaching the photoactive state. Herein we demonstrate that the complex [Mn(dgpy)2]4+ based on earth-abundant manganese can be excited with low-energy NIR light (850 nm, 1.46 eV) to yield a luminescent mixed 2LMCT/2MC excited state (1435 nm, 0.86 eV) with a lifetime of 1.6 ns. The dissipated energy amounts to 0.60 eV. In spite of this energy loss, *[Mn(dgpy)2]4+ with its excited state redox potential Ered* of 1.80 V vs SCE outcompetes the strongest reported precious metal photooxidant (iridium(III)). *[Mn(dgpy)2]4+ oxidizes naphthalene (Eox  1.31  1.54 V vs. SCE) to its radical cation giving the manganese(III) complex [Mn(dgpy)2]3+ in a clean outer-sphere electron transfer process. Unexpectedly, mesitylene, toluene, benzene and nitriles with even extremely high oxidation potentials up to Eox = 2.4 V provoke the [Mn(dgpy)2]4+/3+ reduction under photolysis. A higher energy short-lived 4LMCT excited state with a lifetime of 0.78 ps is made responsible for these demanding oxidations, which proceed by static rather than dynamic quenching. This dual excited state reactivity from 2LMCT/2MC and 4LMCT states is linked to the 4LMCT  2LMCT/2MC intersystem crossing process. These unique findings demonstrate how the design of manganese complexes (i) expands the absorption cross section to 400  850 nm, (ii) increases the 2LMCT/2MC state lifetime to the nanosecond range allowing luminescence and classical dynamic photoredox processes and (iii) enables non-classical static quenching of an extremely oxidizing 4LMCT excited state by the solvent. This conceptually novel approach of static quenching by the solvent minimizes free energy losses, harnesses the full photooxidizing power and thus allows even oxidation of nitriles and benzene using earth-abundant elements and low-energy light.

Halide solid electrolytes have attracted significant attention due to their superior stability against oxide-based cathode active materials when compared to sulfide-based solid electrolytes. Nonetheless, the dynamicity of interparticle contact during cycling in ASSBs hinders their stability and performance. Therefore, inactive materials such as electronically conductive additives and polymer binders are needed to compensate the contact-loss reducing the energy density of the resulting cells.

The resulting composites combine the properties of a solid electrolyte with a conductive additive and a binder together with into a single hybrid material. Together with other analytical techniques, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) imaging showed a successful synthesis of the hybrid materials and revealed that the conductive polymer (CP), namely PEDOT:PSS, is located at the surface/grain of the Li3InCl6. Upon incorporation of such composites in sulfide solid-state half-cells with lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode active material (CAM) we observe an increase in the partial electronic transport of the catholytes with increasing CP content, which correlates an increase in the initial discharge capacities.

A defining characteristic of NSAIDs is their poor water solubility; therefore, in a practical setting this translates directly to poor systemic absorption in the body1.  The ability of a drug to effectively enter and carry out microscopic processes within cells depends on its ability to transverse the lipid membrane surrounding cells. The metric used to evaluate this capacity is called the partition coefficient, or the logP. The logP is the logarithm of concentration of a molecule between octanol and water partitions, where membrane permeability can be evaluated from this value as octanol is comparable to the cell membrane2. A logP above >0 indicates a preferential solubility in lipids, a high logP is correlated with poor solubility and absorption3.It is recommended that a drug must be overall lipophilic but still maintain aqueous solubility4. Naproxen is an NSAID that is used to treat inflammation found in many common illnesses. Naproxen has a logP value of 3.3; however a logP value <2.7 is best for traversing barriers in the body such as the blood brain barrier4. By adapting a novel synthesis method to perform the esterification of naproxen to polyethylene glycol, the aqueous solubility can be improved. Thin-layer chromatography studies confirmed an decrease in the logP value. Spectrophotography drug release and solubility tests of the conjugate form reveal a prolonged release time. This indicates the successful development and distribution of the novel molecule.

To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C-H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late-stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)-H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO).

In recent years, FRTP is increasingly deployed as an alternative to conventional thermoset carbon fibre reinforced epoxy (CF/epoxy) composites, for the purpose of reducing the carbon footprint and contributing to a sustainable manufacturing agenda. Machining of FRTP remains an indispensable process to achieve rapid parts assembly whilst meeting stringent geometric tolerances. However, due to the heterogeneous structure and high thermal sensitivity of FRTP, a range of machining-induced damages (such as matrix smearing, thermal degradation, delamination, burr and surface cavity) often occur, leading to concerns on machined parts quality and reliability. To date, composite machining studies have been mostly focused on conventional thermoset CF/epoxy and there is a lack of an up-to-date, in-depth review of the latest advancement concerning the machining of FRTP. This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview on the recent developments in FRTP machining over the past decade, with a particular emphasis on machining characteristics, damage mechanisms as well as the challenges facing such manufacturing process. The purpose is to present the composite manufacturing community with a timely update, which may guide and inspire further research and development for future FRTP manufacturing.", "date": "2023-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Composites", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this three decades, RTIL composition (i.e., cations and anions) have been developed aiming at electrochemical application and green chemistry. Accordingly, bulky quaternary-ammonium, pyridine, and imidazole have nowadays been the major cations of RTILs. Currently, novel applications using the matured series of RTILs are being highly explored, and one of the promising targets is an additive for hole transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, although design of RTIL should be modified along each application, RTILs for the PSCs application so far has remained conventional, which limits the function. Herein, a novel RTIL comprising the architype aliphatic-primary-ammonium (i.e., n-octyl-ammonium: OA) cation and a modern Bis(Trifluoromethylsulfonyl)Imide (TFSI) anion, which are designed as an additive for hole transport layer in PSCs, was successfully synthesized for the first time. The OA cation spontaneously and densely passivated perovskite layer taking advantage of the accessibility to its cationic moiety, and simultaneously TFSI anion most likely effectively stabilized cationic radical of HTM owing to the absence of the counter cation in HTM core regime, leading to effective hole correction and thereby power conversion efficiency of 22.9% in the best cell. This work sheds light on importance of RTIL design along each application, even out of the current trend, and will help further development of various material science fields including PSCs.", "date": "2023-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The pKa of a targetable cysteine residue in a disease-related protein is an important physiochemical parameter in covalent drug dis- covery, as it influences the fraction of nucleophilic thiolate amenable to chemical protein modification. Traditional structure-based in silico tools are limited in their predictive accuracy of cysteine pKas relative to other titratable residues. Additionally, there are limited comprehensive benchmark assessments for cysteine pKa predictive tools. This raises the need for extensive assessment and evaluation of methods for cysteine pKa prediction. Here, we report the performance of several computational pKa methods, including single structure and ensemble-based approaches, on a diverse test set of experimental cysteine pKas retrieved from the PKAD data- base. The dataset consisted of 16 wildtype and 10 mutant proteins with experimentally measured cysteine pKa values. Our results highlight that these methods are varied in their overall predictive accuracies. Among the test set of wildtype proteins evaluated, the best method yielded a mean absolute error of 2.3 pK units  highlighting the need for improvement of existing pKa methods for accurate cysteine pKa estimation.

These diblock oligomers feature strongly coupled, pi-conjugated F3 and TBT segments that have different bandgaps.  In F3-TBT, the two conjugated chromophores are directly linked whereas in F3-mP-TBT the chromophores are spaced by a meta-linked phenylene unit.  The oligomers excited state dynamics were probed by steady-state UV-visible absorption, fluorescence and excitation wavelength dependent ultrafast time resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to provide insight concerning the electronic structure of the oligomers.  The diblock oligomers feature distinct absorption bands due to transitions mainly localized on the F3 (high energy) and TBT (low energy) segments.  Time-dependent DFT calculations support the assignments of the electronic transitions.  Ultrafast TA spectroscopy with excitation corresponding to the low energy TBT unit reveals that the initial excitation is localized on TBT and does not vary with time.  By contrast, excitation corresponding to high energy F3 produces an excited state that evolves rapidly (200  300 fs) into the lower energy state that is localized on the TBT chromophore. The ultrafast process is attributed to relaxation of an excited state that is predominantly localized on F3 into a lower energy state that is localized on TBT.  The extent of delocalization of the initial state and the rate of relaxation depends on the extent of electronic coupling between the F3 and TBT segments.", "date": "2023-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

YAP binds to TEAD at a large flat binding interface (~3500 2) devoid of a well-defined druggable pocket, so it has been difficult to design low molecular weight compounds to abrogate this protein-protein interaction directly. Recently, work by Furet and coworkers (ChemMedChem 2022, DOI: 10.1002/cmdc.202200303) reported the discovery of the first class of small molecules able to efficiently disrupt the transcriptional activity of TEAD by binding to a specific interaction site of the YAP-TEAD binding interface. Using high-throughput in silico docking and structure-based drug design, they identified a virtual screening hit from a hot-spot derived from their previously rationally designed peptidic inhibitor. Given advances in rapid high-throughput screening and rational approaches to peptidic ligand discovery for challenging targets, we analyzed the pharmacophore features involved in transferring from their peptidic to small molecule inhibitor that could enable small molecule discovery for such targets. Here, we show that pharmacophore analysis augmented by solvation analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories can guide the designs while binding free energy calculations provide greater insight into the binding conformation and energetics accompanying the association event. The computed binding free energy estimates agree with experimental findings and offer useful insight into structural determinants that influence ligand binding to the TEAD interaction surface, even for such a shallow binding site.

Some amyloidogenic proteins, such as \u03b1-synuclein and amyloid \u03b2, can interact with lipids, and this interaction can strongly favor the formation of amyloid fibrils. In particular the primary nucleation step, i.e. the de novo formation of amyloid fibrils, has been shown to be accelerated by lipids. However, the exact mechanism of this acceleration is still mostly unclear. Here we use a range of scattering methods, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) to obtain structural information on the binding of \u03b1-synuclein to vesicles formed from negatively charged lipids and their co-assembly into amyloid fibrils. We find that the lipid vesicles do not simply act as a surface that catalyses the nucleation reaction, but that lipid molecules take an active role in the reaction. The binding of \u03b1-synuclein to the lipid vesicles immediately induces a major structural change in the lipid assembly, which leads to a break-up into small, cylindrical and disc-like lipid-protein\nparticles.

We show that simple modifications in the interlayer stacking arrangement have a profound impact on the transport properties, which can range from metallic behavior with vanishing band gap to highly localized states having completely flat bands. The extent of charge delocalization is found to be sensitive to the type of stacking arrangement and the precise arrangement of the donor and acceptor fragments within the COF structure. The results from the DFT calculations are consistent with MHF-based simulations, demonstrating that stacking-induced interlayer interac- tions facilitate better in-plane charge delocalization.

In this approach, the Cas9 endonuclease is guided towards its DNA target sequence by the guide RNA (gRNA). Chemical synthesis of a functional 97-nucleotide single gRNA (sgRNA) is non-trivial because of the length of the RNA strand. Recently, we demonstrated that a sgRNA can be stitched together from three smaller fragments through a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, making the process highly modular. Here, we further advance this approach by leveraging this modulator platform by incorporating chemically modified nucleotides at both ends of the modular sgRNA to increase resistance against RNases. Modified nucleotides consisted of a 2O-Me group and a phosphorothioate backbone in varying number at both the 5 and 3 ends of the sgRNA. It was observed that three modified nucleotides at both ends of the sgRNA significantly increased the success of Cas9 in knocking-out a gene of interest. Using these chemically stabilized sgRNAs facilitates multigene editing at the protein level, as demonstrated by successful knock-out of both Siglec-3 and Siglec-7, using two fluorophores in conjunction with fluorescence activated cell sorting.

The complex amphiphilic polymers are shown capable of stabilizing high energy water-hexane interfaces, often unfolding to maximize surface coverage. Despite drastic changes to polymer conformation, monomer presence in the water phase is generally maintained and most changes are due to increased hydrophobic solvent exposure towards the oil phase. These results are then compared to behavior at the water-graphene, where the macromolecules adsorb but do not remodel. The polymer behavior is shown to depend significantly upon both its own amphiphilic character and the deformability of the interface.", "date": "2023-03-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Surfactants; Polymerization kinetics; Polymer morphology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Zhang", "abstract": "HsDHODH is a target of the human dehydrogenase enzyme, and HsDHODH inhibitors have shown potential applications in treating autoimmune diseases and cancer. Specific inhibitors have demonstrated potential therapeutic efficacy in treating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the use of HsDHODH inhibitors may cause some side effects, such as interfering with DNA synthesis and causing apoptosis, which can be harmful to the body. In addition, drug resistance may occur during their use. Furthermore, the pharmacological mechanism of action of HsDHODH inhibitors is not fully understood, which may limit their use in treating specific diseases. Recently, the ASGBIE_ESS method was used to calculate the binding free energy between HsDHODH and ascofuranone derivatives. The results showed a correlation of 0.9066 with experimental data, indicating the method's reliability. The energy decomposition analysis identified several hot-spot residues, including M13, L16, Q17, H26, F32, F68, R106, Y326, and T330, that play crucial roles in the ligand-protein binding process based on the crystal structure. Combining virtual screening with the ASGBIE_ESS method, new compounds with unique backbones that have the potential to be valuable inhibitors of HsDHODH were identified. Remarkably, the computational predictions for the biological activity of these derivatives exceeded experimental results. The analysis showed that the identified compounds form stable hydrophobic interactions with residues around the pocket in the protein's hydrophobic region. Additionally, the binding ability of these derivatives is improved when they form hydrogen bonding interactions with specific residues in the pocket. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the mechanism of ligand-protein binding for HsDHODH and offers promising leads for developing novel inhibitors targeting this enzyme.", "date": "2023-03-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

We compute Gibbs energy profiles for enzymes with different cations in the active site: native Zn2+ cations; Co2+ cations that increase the steady-state rate constant. A high-spin state of the cobalt-containing active site catalyzes hydrolysis. Reaction happens with two elementary steps via formation of the pentacoordinated intermediate. For substrates with good leaving groups the reaction proceeds with low energy barriers with both Zn2+ and Co2+ cations in the active site, thus the product release is likely to be a limiting step. For substrates with poor leaving groups, reaction products are destabilized relative to the ES complex that suppresses the reaction. Electron density and geometry analysis of the QM/MM MD trajectories of the intermediate states with all considered compounds allow us to discriminate substrates by their ability to be hydrolyzed by the Pd-PTE.

Bacteria play an important role in bioremediation and waste treatment, and their enzymes are mostly responsible for the degradation of contaminants. However, there are still only a few reports about the bacterial degradation of CNTs, and evidence showing the involvement of bacterial enzymes in CNT degradation with their mechanisms has never been reported. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether CNTs can be degraded by bacterial enzymes. In this study, the degradation of oxidized (carboxylated) single-walled CNTs (O-SWCNTs) by mt2DyP, a dye-decolorizing peroxidase of Pseudomonas putida mt-2, a common soil bacterium, was investigated. After incubation of O-SWCNTs with recombinant mt2DyP and its substrate H2O2 for 30 d, the optical absorbance and Raman spectra revealed the degradation of O-SWCNTs. However, inactivation of the enzyme was observed within 60 min of the start of incubation, suggesting that the degradation of O-SWCNTs occurred nonenzymatically. The inactivation of mt2DyP was accompanied by the release of iron, the active center metal, and degradation of O-SWCNTs was significantly inhibited in the presence of diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, a chelating agent, indicating that O-SWCNTs were degraded by the Fenton reaction with iron released from mt2DyP and H2O2. The same phenomenon was observed with P450, which is also a heme enzyme. Furthermore, we investigated the contribution of the Fenton reaction to the O-SWCNT degradation by horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which was reported to enzymatically and rapidly degrade O-SWCNTs. Our results revealed that the degradation of O-SWCNTs in the presence of HRP is also mainly due to the Fenton reaction, with negligible enzymatic degradation. This contradicts the report showing enzymatic degradation of O-SWCNTs by HRP but supports the subsequent report quantitatively showing very slow transformation of O-SWCNTs by HRP. The current results emphasize that the Fenton reaction, which has received little attention in CNT degradation by heme enzymes, must be taken into consideration and will contribute to the development of a simple disposal method for CNTs, utilizing the Fenton reaction with bacteria/bacterial enzymes and H2O2.", "date": "2023-03-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With respect to thermodynamics, this work seeks to understand the impact of this series on the complexation and coacervation of hyaluronic acid (HA) with chitosan (CHI) at three distinct pHs (3.25, 5.25, and 6.25) and two different molecular weights (HA, 1200 kDa & 199 kDa).

It has been determined that isothermal titration calorimetry is useful for comprehending the thermodynamics of coacervation. Our results indicate the validity of the direct Hofmeister effect for cations and the reverse Hofmeister effect for anions.

The HSV-1, like other herpesviruses, produces transmembrane glycoprotein N (gN / UL49.5 protein). Although this protein is conserved throughout the herpesvirus family, little is known about its function in HSV-1. The amino-acid sequence and length of UL49.5 proteins differ between herpesvirus species. It is, therefore, crucial to determine whether and to what extent the spatial structure of UL49.5 orthologs that are TAP inhibitors (i.e., of BoHV-1 virus) differs from that of non-TAP inhibitors (i.e., of HSV-1 virus). As a result, the primary goal of our study was to examine the 3D structure of HSV-1-encoded UL49.5 protein in an advanced model of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Circular dichroism (CD), 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and multiple-microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the ER membrane mimetic environment were used to determine the final structure of the HSV-1 UL49.5 protein. According to our findings, the N-terminus of HSV-1 UL49.5 adopts a highly flexible, unordered structure in the extracellular part due to the presence of a large number of Pro and Gly residues. In contrast to the UL49.5 protein from BoHV-1, the transmembrane region of HSV-1-encoded UL49.5 is formed by a single long transmembrane -helix, rather than two helices oriented perpendicularly, while the cytoplasmic part of the protein (C-terminus) has a short unordered structure. Our findings provide experimental structural information on HSV-1-encoded UL49.5 protein and structure-based insight into its lack of biological activity in inhibiting the TAP-independent antigen presentation pathway.", "date": "2023-03-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Classic macrocyclic tetrapyrrole ligand scaffolds, such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines, have been studied in detail for their 1O2 photosensitization capabilities. Despite their compelling photophysics, these systems have been limited in PDT applications because of adverse biological side effects. Conversely, the development of non-traditional oligotetrapyrrole ligands metalated with palladium (Pd[DMBil1]) have established new candidates for PDT that display excellent biocompatibility. Herein, the synthesis, electrochemical, and photophysical characterization of a new family of 2,18-bis(phenylalkynyl)-substituted PdII 10,10-dimethyl-5,15-bis(pentafluorophenyl)-biladiene (Pd[DMBil2R]) complexes is presented. These second generation biladienes feature extended conjugation relative to previously characterized PdII biladiene scaffolds (Pd[DMBil1]). We show that these new derivatives can be prepared in good yield and, that the electronic nature of the phenylalkynyl appendages dramatically influence the PdII biladiene photophysics. Extending the conjugation of the Pd[DMBil1] core through installation of phenylacetylene resulted in a ~75 nm red-shift of the biladiene absorbance spectrum into the phototherapeutic window (600-900 nm), while maintaining the PdII biladienes steady-state spectroscopic 1O2 sensitization characteristics. Varying the electronics of the phenylalkyne groups via installation of electric rich or poor groups dramatically influences the steady-state spectroscopic and photophysical properties of the resulting Pd[DMBil2R] family of complexes. The most electron rich variants (Pd[DMBil2N(CH3)2]) can absorb light as far red as ~700 nm but suffer from significantly reduced ability to sensitize formation of 1O2. By contrast, Pd[DMBil2R] derivatives bearing electron withdrawing functionalities (Pd[DMBil2CN] and Pd[DMBil2CF3]) display 1O2 quantum yields above 90%. The collection of results we report are suggest that excited state charge transfer from more electron-rich phenyl-alkyne appendages to the electron deficient biladiene core circumvents triplet sensitization. The spectral and redox properties, as well as the triplet sensitization efficiency of each Pd[DMBil2R] derivative is considered in relation to the Hammett value for each biladienes R-group. More broadly, the results reported in this study clearly demonstrate that biladiene redox properties, spectral properties, and photophysics can be perturbed greatly by relatively minor alterations to biladiene structure.

For a benchmark to be effective, it must closely resemble real-world tasks. If the level of difficulty or relevance is inadequate, it can impede progress in the field. Moreover, benchmarks should have low computational overhead to ensure accessibility and repeatability. The objective is to achieve a kind of \"Turing test\" by creating a surrogate model that is practically indistinguishable from the ground truth observation, at least within the dataset's explored boundaries. This objective necessitates a large quantity of data. This study encompasses numerous features that are characteristic of chemistry and materials science optimization tasks that are relevant to industry. These features include high levels of noise, multiple fidelities, multiple objectives, linear constraints, non-linear correlations, and failure regions. We performed 494498 random hard-sphere packing simulations representing 206 CPU days' worth of computational overhead. Simulations required nine input parameters with linear constraints and two discrete fidelities each with continuous fidelity parameters. The results were logged in a free-tier shared MongoDB Atlas database, producing two core tabular datasets: a failure probability dataset and a regression dataset. The failure probability dataset maps unique input parameter sets to the estimated probabilities that the simulation will fail. The regression dataset maps input parameter sets (including repeats) to particle packing fractions and computational runtimes for each of the two steps. These two datasets were used to create a surrogate model as close as possible to running the actual simulations by incorporating simulation failure and heteroskedastic noise. In the regression dataset, percentile ranks were calculated for each group of identical parameter sets to account for heteroskedastic noise, thereby ensuring reliable and accurate results. This differs from the conventional approach that imposes a-priori assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, by specifying mean and standard deviation. This technique can be extended to other benchmark datasets to bridge the gap between optimization benchmarks with low computational overhead and the complex optimization scenarios encountered in the real world.", "date": "2023-03-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Aggregates and Assemblies; Composites; Materials Processing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This simple exploration policy surprisingly (re)discovered pathways to all major experimental pyrolysis products, many intermediates proposed by previous computational studies, and also identified new low-barrier reaction mechanisms that resolve outstanding discrepancies between reaction pathways and yield in isotope labeling experiments. This network also provides explanatory pathways for the high yield of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and the reaction pathway that contributes most to the formation of hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA) during glucose pyrolysis.

As a result, computational modelling of 27Al ss-NMR spectra has grown increasingly popular as a means to support experimental characterization.

We demonstrate the necessity of operando modelling; in particular, taking into account the effects of water loading, temperature and the character of the charge-compensating cation. We observe that conclusions drawn from simple, high symmetry model systems such as CHA do not transfer well to more complex zeolites and can lead to qualitatively wrong interpretations of peak positions, Al assignment and even the number of signals.

This also affects studies on the growth mechanism of graphene and the synthesis of completely defect free products.  To address these challenges, the open source computational fluid dynamics toolbox OpenFOAM is used for the first systematic exploration of reactor conditions for the synthesis of single crystal and single layer graphene (SLG) in a tube reactor that is typically used in the laboratory.  It is found that the reactor flow conditions are in the turbulent regime, and, the temperatures of the 50-100 \u03bcm thick copper foils on which graphene is grown are not uniform but have large temperature gradients with a sensitivity to the system pressure, the total mass flow rate and the process gas composition that increases with decreasing foil thickness.   Furthermore, both the foil and gas temperatures can be manipulated by modifying the mass flow rates of Ar and H2 in the process gas mix.  Based on this new-found knowledge, a process window was identified where the amount of Ar gas in the reactor was optimized to mimic cold-wall like conditions inside the hot-wall reactor and that favored the synthesis of pristine SLG films (while hotter reactor conditions produced films with numerous unwanted adlayers).

This involves the prediction of ground and excited state redox potentials, for which an accurate description of electronic structures is needed. Even with highly sophisticated computational approaches, however, a number of difficulties arise from the complexity of excited state redox potentials as they require the calculation of the corresponding ground state redox potentials and the estimation of the 0-0 transition energies (E0,0). In this study we have systematically evaluated the performance of DFT methods for these quantities on a set of 37 organic photocatalysts representing nine different chromophore scaffolds. We have found that the ground state redox potentials can be predicted with reasonable accuracy that can be further improved by rationally minimizing the systematic underestimations. The challenging part is to obtain E0,0 as calculating it directly is highly demanding and its accuracy depends strongly on the DFT functional employed. We have found that approximating E0,0 with appropriately scaled vertical absorption energies offers the best compromise between accuracy and computational effort. An even more accurate and cost-effective approach, however, is to predict E0,0 with machine learning and avoid the use of DFT for excited state calculations. Indeed, the best excited state redox potential predictions are achieved with the combination of M062X for ground state redox potentials and ML for E0,0. With this protocol the excited state redox potential windows of the photocatalyst frameworks could be adequately predicted.

An environment in which transient self-assembly (vesicles) was induced by substrate and surfactant molecules initiated new reactivity through H2O addition on the TCBD generating enol form of the intermediate which results in the formation of the 6,6-dicyano-heteropentafulvene (amidofulvene) compound while lamellar sheets at higher concentrations favored TCBD generation.

The high H2O2 utilization towards power-to-hydrogen conversion (EH2O2-HER) in the HPEL is essential to ensure the efficiency and cyclability of the system. Unfortunately, the disproportionation of H2O2 at the anode and its crossover to the cathode in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) HPEL is detrimental to H2O2 utilization and must be mitigated. This work investigates the effects of catalyst type, catalyst loading, and membrane thickness on H2O2 utilization in PEM HPEL. The results show that cobalt- and nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-N-C) catalyst exhibits higher H2O2 utilization than the Fe-N-C and Pt/C catalysts due to its higher selectivity towards the hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction (HPOR) and the lesser H2O2 disproportionation reaction (HPDR). Increasing the loading of the Co-N-C catalyst and membrane thickness can effectively inhibit the H2O2-crossover and improve the H2O2 utilization. On the other hand, the portion of HPDR and the ohmic loss increases with the catalyst loading and membrane thickness, respectively. A maximum H2O2 utilization of over 98% can be achieved by balancing these factors and the cell operating condition.

However, direct translation of an IR spectrum to a molecular structure remains challenging, as reference libraries of IR spectra of molecular ions largely do not exist. Quantum-chemically computed spectra can reliably be used as reference, but the challenge of selecting the candidate structures remains. Here we introduce an in silico library of vibrational spectra of common MS adducts of over 4500 compounds found in the human metabolome database (HMDB).

This demonstrates that 75% of metabolites in the experimental dataset is correctly identified, based solely on their exact m/z and IRIS spectrum. Additionally, we demonstrate an approach for specifically identifying substructures by performing a search without m/z constraints to find structural analogues.

Relative binding free energy calculations (RBFE) have emerged as an industry standard approach to achieve highly accurate rank-order predictions of the potency of related compounds; however, this approach requires that the ligands share a common scaffold and a common binding mode, restricting the methods' domain of applicability. This is a critical limitation, since complex modifications to the ligands, especially core hopping, are very common in drug design.  Absolute Binding Free Energy calculations (ABFE) are an alternate method, which can be used for ligands that are not congeneric. However, ABFE suffer from a known problem of long convergence times, due to the need to sample additional degrees of freedom within each system, such as sampling rearrangements necessary to open and close the binding site. Here, we report on an alternative method for RBFE, called Separated Topologies (SepTop), which overcomes the issues in both of the aforementioned methods, by enabling large scaffold changes between ligands with a convergence time comparable to traditional RBFE. Instead of only mutating atoms that vary between two ligands, this approach performs two absolute free energy calculations at the same time in opposite directions, one for each ligand. Defining the two ligands independently allows the comparison of binding of diverse ligands without the artificial constraints of identical poses or a suitable atom-atom mapping. This approach also avoids the need to sample the unbound state of the protein, making it more efficient than absolute binding free energy calculations.  Here, we introduce an implementation of SepTop. We developed a general and efficient protocol for running SepTop, and we demonstrated the method on four diverse, pharmaceutically relevant systems. Here we report the performance of the method, as well as our practical insights into strengths, weaknesses, and challenges of applying this method in an industrial drug design setting. We find that the accuracy of the approach is sufficiently high to rank order ligands with an accuracy comparable to traditional RBFE calculations, while maintaining the additional flexibility of SepTop.", "date": "2023-03-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

These include a near-perfect correlation between predicted and ac-cepted charge radii of stable nuclides through 36Ar. Proposed average quark model (AQM) radius predictions compare favorably to Green's function Monte Carlo methods,  but with fewer and simpler assumptions. Per the model, alternating up- and down-quarks occupy average positions within linear and polygonal geometries, and the distance between se-quential quarks derives from the radius of the proton. Best-fit solutions form anisotropic cylindrical lattices of stacked 6-nucleon (18-quark) rings. Evolving structures contain unique sub-structures that recur periodically every 12 nucleons, as presented within a periodic table of nuclear structure. Nuclide structural periodicity has led to the discovery of 12-nuclide periodicity in nuclear magnetic moments, and a second trend in single-nucleon nucleosynthesis. The 12-nuclide periodicity of each is superior when analyzed against hypothetical 6,8,10,14, and 16-nuclide periodicities. Proposed quark structures are consistent with theoretical prolate hadron shapes, and the low central quark density of open ring and cylindrical structures is consistent with electron scattering experiments demonstrating central depressions or dips in the nuclide charge densities. A novel criterion of nuclear stability is demonstrated: Nuclides containing contiguous al-ternating quark sequences tend to be stable, and tend to produce alternating nucleon sequences that contain equal num-bers of protons and neutrons. Nuclides having disrupted quark sequences tend to be unstable, and tend to have unstable ratios of protons to neutrons. Model-consistent structures of 5He, 8Be, 18F, and 30P illuminate why they are unstable. The list of stable nuclides through 36Ar evolves one nucleon at a time. The AQM nuclide structure acts as a substrate that ste-rically selects whether a proton or neutron will be the next added nucleon, analogous to base pair selection in DNA repli-cation. This method correctly predicts the most abundant isotope of every stable nuclide through 36Ar, missing the mark only with four trace isotopes. The proposed model of nucleosynthesis resembles important facets of the linear step-growth polymerization (SGP) mechanism.   Relevance to the European Muon Collaboration effect is discussed.

The motivation to use this state-of-the-art material characterisation in the soil is to reduce the testing cost while increasing the efficiency of the characterisation.  In India, a bulk volume of soil is still required for the characterisation of agricultural soil.  The fertility of micronutrient contents and crop supply capacity vary greatly depending on soil types, crop types, ecology, and agroclimatic variability.  Since total levels of micronutrients are rarely predictive of the availability of a nutrient to plants, knowledge of the differences in soil micronutrients that are available to plants is essential for the sensible management of micronutrient fertility and toxicity.  In the state of Uttarakhand, low levels of micro-nutrients in the soil are frighteningly common, and this issue is made worse by the fact that many current cultivars of important crops are extremely vulnerable to low mineral levels.

This adversely affects the prediction of mechanical properties at realistic strain rates, intermediate degrees of cure, and elevated temperatures.

The phenomenological approach is used to map the predictions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for a DGEBF/DETDA epoxy system to the corresponding laboratory-based properties for intermediate degrees of cure and temperatures above and below the glass transition temperature. The approach uses characterization data from dynamical mechanical analysis temperature sweep experiments. The mathematical formulation and experimental characterization of the mapping are described, and the resulting corrections to the predicted elastic properties for various degrees of cure and temperatures are compared with the experiment.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms, enabled by pre-existing experimental and computational data, have emerged as robust tools for the prediction of quantitative relationships between feature parameters and various physical properties of materials. In this work, we employed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation with ML models to systematically investigate the viscosity of PNCs over a wide range of NPs loading, shear rates and temperature.With the increase in shear rates, shear thinning takes place as the value of viscosity decreases on the orders of magnitude. In addition, the NPs loading -dependence and T-dependence reduce to the extent that it is not visible at high shear rates. The value of viscosity for PNCs is proportional to NPs loading and inversely proportional to T below the intermediate shear rates.

Here, we present the first deep-learning model for molecular standardization.  We enable custom standardization schemes based solely on data, which, as additional benefit, support standardization options that are difficult to encode into rules. Our model achieves over 98% accuracy in learning two popular rule-based standardization protocols.

As standardization can be considered, more broadly, a transformation from undesired to desired representations of compounds, the same data-driven architecture can be applied to other tasks.

Addressing this challenge, this study focuses on optimizing the continuous flow synthesis of Copper Benzene-1,3,5-Tricarboxylate (HKUST-1) in a supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) environment. The effects of the synthesis parameters on the physiochemical characteristics of MOF were investigated over a wide range of CO2 injection temperature Tinj = 50  300 C while maintaining sub-second reactor residence time ~ 650 ms. The X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) verified a well-defined MOF crystal structure. Analysis of the MOFs' surface area and pore sizes indicated that the optimal properties were obtained at a CO2 injection temperature of 150 C corresponding to an average reactor temperature of ~80 C with the maximum BET-specific surface area ~ 1,550 m2/g and pore size ~ 10.55 . At lower synthesis temperatures, the pore sizes and BET-specific surface area are lower due to insufficient activation, while at temperatures Tinj >250C, BET surface area decreases significantly due to the degradation of organic precursors. The increase in the synthesis temperature results in a fast MOF synthesis and activation due to a single-phase supercritical environment; however, high CO2 injection temperatures may create a high-temperature gradient leading to rapid degradation of organic precursors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of sub-second synthesis of high-quality MOFs and highlights the need to optimize the continuous flow process for HKUST-1 and other MOFs.", "date": "2023-03-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Composites; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We use the origin-invariant LG approach, LG(OI), that we recently proposed as reference for the calculations, and we study whether a proper choice of coordinate origin and molecular orientation can be made such that diagonal elements of the LG-OR tensor match those of the LG(OI) tensor. Using a numerical search algorithm, we show that multiple spatial orientations can be found where the LG and LG(OI) results match. However, a simple analytical procedure provides a spatial orientation where the origin of the coordinate system is close to the center of mass of the molecule. At the same time, we also show that putting the origin at the center of mass is not an ideal choice for every molecule (relative errors in the OR up to 70% can be obtained in out test set). Finally, we show that the choice of coordinate origin based on the analytical procedure is transferable across different methods and it is superior to putting the origin in the center of mass or center of nuclear charge. This is important because the LG(OI) approach is trivial to implement for DFT, but not necessarily for non-variational methods in the CC family.

Due to their structural versatility, porosity, and nanoscale size, MOPs are considered an attractive platform for catalysis. In this study, we report for the first time the use of three zirconium(IV)-based MOPs for the degradation of trace concentrations of the nerve agent simulant, dimethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP). All three MOPs degraded DMNP instantaneously, with half-lives ranging from t1/2 = 17 to 130 s. The catalytic activity of MOPs is thought to be due to (1) their periodic packing resulting in long-range order that creates extrinsic porosity, allowing DMNP to diffuse in and interact with the pore surface and Lewis acids (Zr(IV) centers) of MOPs, and (2) the lability of Zr-Cp (Cp = cyclopentadienyl) bond, allowing Cp ligands to rearrange and make space for DMNP to interact with the Zr(IV). The catalytic activity of MOPs is not deteriorated by increasing the concentration of the nerve agent simulant nor in consecutive catalytic experiments, highlighting their robustness as catalysts.

The uneven distribution of endogenous stimuli within tumor tissues makes it difficult for prodrug to be completely activated. And the inadequate tissue penetration depth of external light results in low efficiency of PDT. Aiming at these two bottlenecks, we designed a biocompatible dextran based - multi-component nanomedicine (PCL-NPs) that integrate a chemiluminescence agent luminol, a photosensitizer chlorine e6 (Ce6), and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activable thioketal-based paclitaxel (PTX) prodrug.

To address this challenge, here we introduce a robust and computationally effcient method for characterizing surface ice-philicity, which combines molecular simulations and enhanced sampling techniques to quantify the free energetic cost of increasing surface-ice contact at the expense of surface-water contact. Using this method to characterize the ice-philicity of a family of model surfaces that are latticed matched with ice but vary in their polarity, we find that the non-polar surfaces are moderately ice-phobic, whereas the polar surfaces are highly ice-philic.

Binding of inhibitors to the allosteric site of human SERT (hSERT) impedes the dissociation of antidepressants bound at the central site, and may enhance the efficacy of such antidepressants to potentially reduce their dosage and side effects. Here we report the discovery of a series of high-affinity allosteric inhibitors of hSERT in a novel scaffold, with the lead compound, Lu AF88273 (3-(1-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)piperidin-4-yl)-6-chloro-1H-indole), having 2.1 nM allosteric potency in inhibiting imipramine dissociation. In addition, we find that Lu AF88273 also inhibits the serotonin transport in a non-competitive manner. The binding pose of Lu AF88273 in the allosteric site of hSERT is determined with extensive molecular dynamics simulations and rigorous absolute binding free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, which show a part of the compound occupies a dynamically formed small cavity. The predicted binding location and pose is validated by a site-directed mutagenesis study, and can explain much of the structure-activity relationship of these inhibitors using the relative binding FEP calculations. Together, our findings provide a promising lead compound and the structural basis for the development of allosteric drugs targeting hSERT.

MS provides high specificity and sensitivity for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 peptides in wastewater, allowing for early detection of outbreaks and real-time monitoring of disease trends.

Post-acquisition data mining of mass spectral repository obtained with a maXis HD QToF mass spectrometer, retrospective quantification and confirmation using bbCID method was undertaken. A large scale, multi-city spatiotemporal profiling programme of antifungal agents was undertaken in the Avon River catchment, South-West England encompassing five contrasting towns/cities served by five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) covering a large geographical area of 2000 km2 and a population of ~1.5 million accounting for > 75% of the overall population in the studied catchment. Key drivers of AFs in the catchment were identified with communal WWTP discharges being the main driver for human AFs (e.g., fluconazole and ketoconazole) and agricultural runoff being the main driver for pesticide AFs (e.g., prochloraz, prothioconazole and tebuconazole). Daily mass loads (DLs) of AF were study/city dependent with several instances of large quantities of AFs (direct disposal) observed. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) pipelines were developed to estimate community-wide exposure to antifungal agents and to triangulate the WBE data with per-postcode prescription. Average WBE-estimated human used fluconazole and ketoconazole PNDIs (population normalised daily intake per person) exceeded on average 300 mg day-1 1000inh-1 and 2000 mg day-1 1000inh-1. This is much higher than PNDPs (population normalised daily prescriptions) <40 mg day-1 1000inh-1 and <80 mg day-1 1000inh-1 for fluconazole and ketoconazole respectively. This was expected due to both prescription and OTC (over-the-counter) usage as well as both oral and topical (non-metabolic) application. WBE applied to pesticide-based AFs: prothioconazole and tebuconazole provided variable PNDI estimates across the catchment.  Prothioconazole PNDIs were <40,000 mg day-1 1000inh -1, which gave intake per kg of body weight at: 0.43, 0.26, 0.07 mg kg-1 in City A, B and C and is likely due to accounting for external/non-human sources. This is higher than the acceptable daily intake (ADI) set at 0.01 mg kg-1bw day-1, which warrants further study. Intake per kg of body weight estimated using tebuconazole as a xenobiotic chemical residue (XCR) was: 0.86, 1.39, 0.12, 0.13 and 2.7 mg kg-1 in City A-E respectively and is likely due to accounting for external/non-human sources. Intake calculated using the metabolite is in line with ADI: 0.02 and 0.01 mg kg-1 in City B and C respectively, which aligns well with ADI set at 0.03 mg kg-1bw day-1. The environmental risk assessment of the target AAs indicates low/medium risk from fluconazole, prochloraz and tebuconazole, medium risk from epoxiconazole, prothioconazoles metabolite, and tebuconazole, and high risk for prothioconazole in river water. High risk was estimated from fluconazole, epoxiconazole, prothioconazole and its metabolite, tebuconazole, ketoconazole in influent (and/or effluent) samples, which is important due to possible raw sewage discharge via sewer overflows. Due to lack of information on PNEC (predicted no-effect concentration) for other AFs, risk assessment could not be undertaken, which warrants further study.

Here, using a two-step methanol oxidation reaction as a case study, we combined an analytically derived criterion for R1-R2 phenomenon with the Weisz criterion for R1-D phenomenon to allow the development of assignment criteria for four overall controlling factors. The overall assignment criteria are found to be dependent on the internal effectiveness factors , as well as the rate of the individual reactions at the catalyst surface. When the assignments criteria are re-decomposed using assignable criteria that are based on only the two internal effectiveness factors, a child component criterion is confirmed to satisfy the overall assignment criteria. Based on the sensitivity of the overall controlling factor with respect to the reaction temperature and catalyst size, the selectivity of the formaldehyde intermediate species in methanol oxidation reaction can be enhanced at high reaction temperature when catalysts are specifically designed to enhance the rate of formaldehyde formation (rate of the first reaction). However, CO formation (the rate of the second reaction) needs to be suppressed to enhance selectivity towards formaldehyde at moderately low temperature. This reaction-diffusion theoretical framework provides guidance for the development of highly selective catalyst for two-reactions-in-series systems and can be extended for higher-number multiple reactions in series and in parallel.", "date": "2023-03-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

When compared to well-established solution phase assays, native mass spectrometry provides accurate quantitative descriptions of molecular glue potency and efficacy while also enabling the binding specificity of E3 ligases to be determined in a single, rapid measurement. Such mechanistic insights should accelerate the rational development of molecular glues to afford powerful therapeutic agents.", "date": "2023-03-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To be specific, fragment group orbitals, as in analogy with ligand group orbitals in coordination chemistry, are eliminated from the space spanned by occupied molecular orbitals. Via this approach, the skeletal bonding orbitals of complex systems including but not limited to pi-delocalized systems and cluster compounds are recovered with a minimal contribution from surrounding moieties, making this method the ideal choice to analyze the electronic structure of complex systems and separate skeletal bonding contribution against peripheral moieties from various sum-over-orbital properties.", "date": "2023-03-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Theory - Inorganic; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As for the Li-ion technology, safety aspect is of high importance to ensure large-scale development. In this work, we studied the thermal stability and decomposition mechanisms of carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and two fluorine-rich phases belonging to the solid-solution Na3V3+2-yV4+y(PO4)2F3-yOy (y = 0.07 and y = 0.12), that family of compounds being often considered among the most promising positive electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. This study shows the good thermal stability of these polyanionic materials and reveals that a low O2- for F- substitution has a very limited effect on the thermal stability of fully re-intercalated materials recovered in the discharged state of the battery, whereas it has a beneficial impact for highly de-intercalated ones, obtained by in-depth charges. Furthermore, whatever the state of charge and the oxygen content in NaxV2(PO4)2F3-yOy (1<=x<=3 and y = 0, 0.07 and 0.12), the thermal degradation leads, quite unexpectedly, to the formation of crystalline Na3V3+2(PO4)2F3 in addition to an amorphous phase.

Here, we studied the influence of pH, natural organic matter (NOM), ionic strength, and temperature on the adsorption of PFAS on MPs generated from PET water bottles. The adsorption of the PFAS to the MPs was spontaneous at 25C, based on Gibbs free energy (G  -16 kJ/mol), primarily due to increased entropy. Adsorption reached equilibrium within 7-16 h. Hence, the PFAS will partition to the surface of PET MPs within a few hours to days in fresh and saline waters. Natural organic matter decreased the capacity of PET MPs for PFAS through electrosteric repulsion while higher ionic strength favored PFAS adsorption by decreasing electrostatic repulsion. Increased pH increased electrostatic repulsion, and negated PFAS adsorption.

However, current approaches are limited because robust animal carcinogenicity data is only available for a few simple nitrosamines, which do not represent the structural diversity of the many possible nitrosamine drug substance related impurities (NDSRIs). In this paper, we present a novel method that uses data on CYP-mediated metabolic hydroxylation of CH2 groups in non-nitrosamine xenobiotics to identify structural features that may also help in predicting the likelihood of metabolic alpha-carbon hydroxylation in N-nitrosamines. Our approach offers a new avenue for tapping into potentially large experimental datasets on xenobiotic metabolism to improve the risk assessment of nitrosamines. It is believed that alpha-carbon hydroxylation is the vital rate-limiting step in the metabolic activation of nitrosamines, and identifying structural features that influence this process may be valuable in evaluating their carcinogenic potential. This is particularly significant as information regarding the factors that influence the metabolic activation of NDSRIs is practically non-existent. We discovered hundreds of structural features that either promote or hinder hydroxylation, in contrast to the very few that have been identified so far from the small nitrosamine carcinogenicity dataset. While relying solely on -carbon hydroxylation prediction is insufficient for forecasting carcinogenic potency, the identified features can help in the selection of relevant structural analogs in read across studies and assist domain experts who, after considering other factors such as the reactivity of the resulting electrophilic diazonium species, can establish the acceptable intake limits for nitrosamine impurities.", "date": "2023-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Confinement of DNA in nanopores of clay minerals is a promising route for this long-term stabilization and storage. Using smectites with various layer charges, we measured adsorption capacity for DNA using UV spectroscopy and intercalation capacity using X-ray diffraction. We found that while the smectite adsorption capacity is large, the DNA intercalation, i.e. nanoconfinement, decreases as smectite charge increases. We show that low-charge smectites intercalate DNA at concentrations relevant to aqueous environments even at neutral pH but the nanoconfinement is minimal or absent in high-charge smectites. Different intercalation behaviour in NaCl and CaCl2 solutions imply different mechanisms driven by electrostatic forces. Our results demonstrate that DNA nanoconfinement in smectites is likely an important strategy for DNA preservation and that protocols targeting low-charge smectites might improve the success of ancient and modern DNA extraction even in hot and humid climates so far deemed unfavourable for DNA preservation.", "date": "2023-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Geochemistry; Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

G4 DNA is thought to have a functional role in the regulation of gene transcription and telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance and is therefore a target for drugs.  The details of the molecular interactions that cause stacking of the guanine tetrads are not well-understood, which limits a rational approach to the drugability of G4 sequences. To explore these interactions further, we employed Electron-Vibration-Vibration two-dimensional Infra-red (EVV 2DIR) spectroscopy to measure extended vibrational coupling spectra for a parallel-stranded G-quadruplex DNA formed by Myc2345 nucleotide sequence.  We also tracked the structural changes associated with G4 folding as a function of K+ ion concentration to generate further insight. In order to classify the structural elements that the folding process generates in terms of vibrational coupling characteristics, we used quantum-chemical calculations utilising density functional theory. This resulted in predictions of the coupling spectra associated with a given structure, which are compared against the experimental coupling data obtained from the EVV 2DIR spectroscopy. Overall, 102 coupling peaks are experimentally identified and followed during the folding process. A number of phenomena are noted and associated with the formation of the folded form. This includes frequency shifting, changes in cross-peak intensity and the appearance of new coupling peaks. The new peaks can be assigned to the coupling between specific chemical groups within the complex, and we use the 2DIR data to propose a folding sequence for this particular type of G4 under our experimental conditions. Overall, the combination of experimental 2DIR data and DFT calculations suggests that guanine quartets may already be present in the initial DNA before the addition of potassium ions, but that these quartets are unstacked until potassium ions are added, at which point the full G4 structure is formed.

Herein, a novel quasi-solid-state water-in-swelling-clay electrolyte (WiSCE) containing zinc sulfate and swelling clay bentonite (BT) is designed to enable highly reversible Zn metal anodes. AZIB full 2 cells based on the WiSCE exhibit excellent cyclic stability at various current densities, long shelf life, low self-discharge rate, and outstanding high-temperature adaptability. Particularly, the capacity of WiSCE-based AZIB full cells retains 90.47% after 200 cycles at 0.1 A/g, 96.64% after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g, and 88.29% after 5000 cycles at 3 A/g. Detailed density functional theory calculations show that strong hydrogen-bonds are formed between BT and water molecules in the WiSCE. Thus, water molecules are strongly confined by BT particularly within the interlayers, which significantly inhibits water-induced side reactions and thus greatly improves cyclic stability. Compared to the state-of-the-art water-in-salt electrolyte, the WiSCE can provide a significantly higher capacity at the full-cell level with a substantially reduced cost, which is promising for the design of next-generation high-performance AZIBs.

While several approaches are available to aid in the identification of general catalyst systems there is currently no simple procedure for directly measuring how general a given catalyst could be. Herein, we present a catalyst-agnostic workflow centered on unsupervised machine learning that enables the rapid assessment and quantification of catalyst generality. The workflow uses curated literature data sets and reaction descriptors to visualize and cluster chemical space coverage. This reaction network can then be applied to derive a catalyst generality metric through designer equations and interfaced with other regression techniques for general catalyst prediction. As validating case studies, we have successfully applied this method to identi-fy-through-quantification the most general catalyst chemotype for an organocatalytic asymmetric Mannich reaction and predicted the most general chiral phosphoric acid catalyst for the addition of nucleophiles to imines. The mechanistic basis for catalyst generality can then be gleaned from the calculated values by deconstructing the contributions of chemical space and enantiomeric excess to the overall result. We conclude that broadly applicable catalysts may be more adaptative to changes in reactant structure because enantioinduction does not rely on a single set of noncovalent interactions. In contrast, some systems work by engaging in robust noncovalent contacts that do not change significantly in nature when the structure of the reaction component is altered. Finally, our generality techniques permit-ted the development of mechanistically informative catalyst screening sets that allow experimentalists to rationally select catalysts that have the highest probability of achieving a good result in the first round of reaction development. Overall, our findings represent a framework for interrogating and predicting catalyst generality, and this strategy should be relevant to other catalytic systems widely applied in asymmetric synthesis.", "date": "2023-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Drop-freezing experiments are key for the determination of the ice nucleation activity of biotic and abiotic ice nucleators (INs). The results of these experiments are reported as the fraction of frozen droplets f_ice (T) as a function of decreasing temperature, and the corresponding cumulative freezing spectra N_m (T) computed using Valis methodology. The differential freezing spectrum n_m (T) is an approximant to the underlying distribution of heterogeneous ice nucleation temperatures P_u (T) that represents the characteristic freezing temperatures of all IN in the sample. However, N_m (T) can be noisy, resulting in a differential form n_m (T) that is challenging to interpret. Furthermore, there is no rigorous statistical analysis of how many droplets and dilutions are needed to obtain a well-converged n_m (T) that represents the underlying distribution P_u (T). Here, we present the HUB method and associated Python codes that model (HUB-forward code) and interpret (HUB-backward code) the results of drop-freezing experiments. HUB-forward predicts f_ice (T) and N_m (T) from a proposed distribution P_u (T) of IN temperatures, allowing its users to test hypotheses regarding the role of subpopulations of nuclei in freezing spectra, and providing a guide for a more efficient collection of freezing data. HUB-backward uses a stochastic optimization method to compute n_m (T) from either N_m (T) or f_ice (T). The differential spectrum computed with HUB-backward is an analytical function that can be used to reveal and characterize the underlying number of IN subpopulations of complex biological samples (e.g. ice nucleating bacteria, fungi, pollen), and quantify the dependence of their subpopulations on environmental variables. By delivering a way to compute the differential spectrum from drop freezing data, and vice-versa, the HUB-forward and HUB-backward codes provide a hub to connect experiments and interpretative physical quantities that can be analysed with kinetic models and nucleation theory.", "date": "2023-03-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Specifically, we investigate whether this approach can help reduce methanol production costs by strategically exploiting dynamics of electricity markets. Our study integrates high-fidelity process simulations, optimization tools, and microkinetic modeling (informed by density functional theory) to conduct detailed techno-economic analyses and to compare performance against traditional processes that use hydrogen produced via steam-methane reforming (SMR). We also use this approach to estimate the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) as a function of time-varying electricity prices (from day-ahead and real-time prices) and of key techno-economic parameters.  Our results show that the proposed electrification framework is cost-competitive under certain electricity market conditions. Specifically, we find that, when the electrolysis system is operated in flexible mode (and can respond to dynamics of electricity markets), the associated electricity cost nearly collapses to zero. Conversely, when the unit is not flexible (and cannot respond to markets), the electricity cost comprises 60% of the total cost. Our results also reveal that the LCOH of the flexible electrolysis system participating in real-time electricity markets is 31% lower than the LCOH obtained from SMR. Overall, this indicates that exploiting the dynamics of electricity markets can make hydrogen production cost-competitive and this can lead to viable alternatives to electrify methanol production and other hydrogen-based processes.

One example are single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which exhibit chirality-dependent near infrared (NIR) fluorescence. They can be modified with quantum defects through the reaction with diazonium salts and the number or distribution of these defects determine their photophysics. However, the presence of multiple chiralities in typical SWCNT samples complicates the identifica-tion of defect-related emission features. Here, we show that quantum defects do not affect aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) of different SWCNT chiralities into different phases, which pinpoints to low numbers of defects. For bulk samples the bandgap emission (E11) of monochiral (6,5)-SWCNTs decreases and the defect related emission feature (E11*) increas-es with diazonium salt concentration and represents a proxy for the defect number. The high purity of monochiral sam-ples from ATPE allows us to image NIR fluorescence contributions (E11 = 986 nm, and E11* = 1140 nm) on the single SWCNT level. Interestingly, we observe a stochastic (Poisson) distribution of quantum defects. SWCNTs have most-likely 1 to 3 defects (for low to high (bulk) quantum defect densities). Additionally, we verify this number by following single reaction events that appear as discrete steps in the temporal fluorescence traces. We thereby count single reactions via NIR imaging and demonstrate that stochasticity plays a crucial role for the optical properties of SWCNTs.

We find that as diverse AFPs accumulate on ice, their concentration in the aqueous solution does not develop a gradient but remains equal to its bulk concentration throughout our experiments.

Here, we report a PL microscopy based on the nonlinear interactions between mid-infrared and visible excitations on matters, which we termed Multi-Dimensional Widefield Infrared-encoded Spontaneous Emission (MD-WISE) microscopy. MD-WISE microscopy demonstrates multiplexity in a three-dimensional space, by distinguishing chromophores that possess nearly identical emission spectra through three independent variables: the temporal delay between the infrared and the visible pulses, and the optical frequencies of the two pulses. More importantly, MD-WISE method operates at widefield imaging conditions, other than the confocal configuration adopted by most nonlinear optical microscopies which require focusing the optical beams tightly to reach high intensity for nonlinear interactions. MD-WISE microscopy is enabled by two mechanisms: 1. Modulating the optical absorption cross sections of molecular dyes by exciting specific vibrational functional groups; 2. Reducing the PL quantum yield of semiconductor nanocrystals through strong field ionization of excitons. By demonstrating the capacity of registering multi-dimensional information into PL images, MD-WISE microscopy has the potential of expanding the number of species and processes that can be simultaneously tracked in high-speed widefield imaging applications.", "date": "2023-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Optics; Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Replacing surface indium with zinc to form a ZnO shell results in reduced nonradiative decay and a density of states at the valence band edge that resembles defect-free, stoichiometric InP. We then developed a synthetic strategy using stoichiometric amounts of common atomic layer deposition precursors in alternating cycles to achieve layer-by-layer growth.

Upon growing ZnSe shells of varying thickness on the oxide-shelled QDs, we observe increased photoluminescence quantum yields and narrowing of the emission linewidths that we attribute to decreased ion diffusion to the shell, as supported by P X-ray emission spectroscopy.

However, solid-state synthesis of the metastable phase is affected by multiple thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, leading to ambiguity in the categorization of stability and metastability. This study categorizes remnant and intermediate metastability based on thermodynamic principles. The intermediate metastable phase, which is less stable than the temperature-independent stable phase, typically transforms into the stable phase(s) at high temperatures. In contrast, the remnant metastable phase, such as the high-temperature stable phase obtained by fast cooling, becomes the most stable phase, and annealing of the remnant metastable phase causes the phase transition to the low-temperature stable phase. Investigating Li+ conducting chlorides, Li3MCl6 (M = Y and Ho), this study shows that heating starting materials to approximately 600 K produced low-temperature Li3MCl6 phase with one formula unit; high-temperature Li3MCl6 with three formula units were observed by further heating. Annealing of quenched Li3MCl6 at 573 K resulted in a phase transition from high-temperature to low-temperature, indicating that the high-temperature phase was remnant metastable at low temperatures.

In this work, we demonstrate that although cells using HCE experience low capacity fading compared to conventional carbonate based-electrolyte, HCE does not prevent oxidation of dimethyl carbonate at high potential. Even worse, this phenomenon cannot be fully offset by lithium intercalation at the negative electrode and eventually leads to lithium plating that precipitates the cell end of life.

In this work, a novel method has been developed for the synthesis and design of artificial gold metalloenzymes at 50\u00baC in aqueous media, using two genetically modified variants of the alkalophilic lipase Geobacillus thermocatenulatus (GTL). The only difference between these two enzymatic variants is the possible coordination of the Au via active site (GTL-114) or Lid site (GTL-193). TEM analysis of the metalloenzymes revealed the formation of Au (0) nanoparticles with different structures (nanowires, nanorods, nanoshells, nanoclusters) and sizes depending on the mutant and the pH used during the synthesis. Characterisation by fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that conjugation of the enzyme to Au altered the tertiary structure of the protein. On the other hand, all metalloenzymes showed excellent reductase like activity. Finally, the selectivity of the enzyme-Au bioconjugates was tested in the asymmetric reduction of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol in aqueous medium at room temperature. The protein environment played a key role in the reactivity and selectivity of the metalloenzymes, obtaining chiral nanoparticles with an enantiomeric excess of up to 39% towards (R)-1-phenylethanol after two hours of reaction using GTL-114 pH 10 as catalyst.", "date": "2023-03-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Nanoscience; Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

To date, reports invoking oxidative quenching cycles are comparatively rare and direct observation of such a quenching event has not been reported. However, when PCs with highly reducing excited states are used (e.g. Ir(ppy)3), photo-reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(I) is thermodynamically feasible. Recently, a unified reaction system using Ir(ppy)3 was developed for forming C\u2013O, C\u2013N, and C\u2013S bonds under the same conditions, a prospect that is challenging with PCs that can photo-oxidize these nucleophiles. Herein, in a detailed mechanistic study of this system, we observe oxidative quenching of the PC (Ir(ppy)3 or a phenoxazine) via nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Speciation studies support that a mixture of Ni-bipyridine complexes form under the reaction conditions, and the rate constant for photoreduction increases when more than one ligand is bound. Oxidative addition of an aryl iodide was observed indirectly via oxidation of the resulting iodide by Ir(IV)(ppy)3. Intriguingly, persistence of the Ir(IV)/Ni(I) ion pair formed in the oxidative quenching step was found to be necessary to simulate the observed kinetics. Both bromide and iodide anions were found to reduce the oxidized form of the PC back to its neutral state. These mechanistic insights inspired the addition of a chloride salt additive, which was found to alter Ni speciation, leading to a 36-fold increase in the initial turnover frequency, enabling the coupling of aryl chlorides.

However, a major roadblock to the widespread implementation of MOFs, including highly tunable and hydrolytically stable Zr- and Hf-based frameworks, is their benchtop-scalable synthesis, as MOFs are typically prepared under highly dilute (\u22640.01 M) solvothermal conditions. This necessitates the use of liters of organic solvent to prepare only a few grams of MOF. Here-in, we demonstrate that Zr- and Hf-based frameworks (eight examples) can self-assemble at much higher reaction concen-trations than are typically utilized, up to 1.00 M in many cases. Combining stoichiometric amounts of Zr or Hf precursors with organic linkers at high concentrations yields highly crystalline and porous MOFs, as confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and 77 K N2 surface area measurements. Further, the use of well-defined pivalate-capped cluster pre-cursors avoids the formation of ordered defects and impurities that arise from standard metal chloride salts. These clus-ters also introduce pivalate defects that increase the exterior hydrophobicity of several MOFs, as confirmed by water con-tact angle measurements.

Herein, we introduce a new gel-immobilized HIPE (HIPEG) using chiral G-quadruplex (GQ) based hydrogel with external stimuli-responsive dual-drug release behavior, which is scarce for HIPEs. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments of HIPEGs allow encapsulation of different drugs in both the compartments, with stimuli-responsive diffusion mediated release. Encapsulation of natural oils and antibiotics produces synergistic antimicrobial effects on both Gram positive (MRSA) and Gram negative (P. aeruginosa) bacterial strains. Moreover, we demonstrate biocatalytic reaction networks utilizing compartmentalized enzyme dyads. Notably, the ideal viscoelastic property of HIPEGs enables 3D bioprinting into different shapes, making the scaffold potential for tissue engineering applications. Altogether, our approach offers a one-step route to stimuli-responsive HIPE microcompartments immobilized in GQ hydrogels with endogenous reactivity and high viscoelasticity, and provides a viable step towards the development of biocompatible soft materials with tailorable functionality.

However, the self-assembly and optical properties of these aggregates in solvents have not been reported to date. Here, we report on the condition for this self-assembly to occur and show a simple strategy to induce the formation of these nanoplates stacks in suspension in different organic solvents. We combined wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopy to evaluate CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 perovskite nanoplates with different thickness distributions. We observed the formation of these stacks by changing the concentration of nanoplates and the viscosity of the colloidal suspensions, without the need of antisolvent addition. We found that, in hexane, the concentration threshold for the formation of the stacks is rather high and approximately 80 mg/mL. In contrast, in decane, dodecane, and hexadecane, we observe a much easier self-assembly of the nanoplates, presenting a clear correlation between the degree of aggregation and viscosity. We, then, discuss the impact of the self-assembly of perovskite nanoplates on F\u00f6rster resonant energy transfer.

Our previously developed physics-based artificial neural network framework for adsorption and chromatography emulation (PANACHE) approach is extended to simulate the dynamics of chromatographic columns without using adsorption isotherms. The incorporation of underlying conservation laws in the form of a physics-constrained loss function during training enables PANACHE models to infer the complex dynamics of chromatographic columns, even without the knowledge of adsorption isotherms. The isotherm-agnostic abilities of PANACHE models are tested by considering two binary systems with complex adsorption equilibria: 1) mixed Langmuir M1-type binary system, and 2) Tr\u00f6ger's base enantiomers on Chiralpak AD that show inflection in the isotherm. For each case study, unique feed-forward deep neural networks with an input layer, five hidden layers, and an output layer are trained for two solute components using the elution data either from simulations or experiments. The results show that PANACHE models are successful in predicting the dynamics of binary solute mixtures in chromatographic columns even in the absence of adsorption isotherms, with prediction errors in the order of 10^-2 in the measure of relative L2-norm, for most of the cases.

The most dominant CO2 emissions originate from flue gases that contain diluted concentrations of CO2 emitted from combustion and industrial processes. Conventional capture technologies such as amine scrubbing are impeded by their high energy demand due to the thermodynamically low driving force for desorbing CO2. A new concept is here presented that exploits the robustness of microbial catalysts to simultaneously desorb the CO2 from an amine-based absorbent and convert the captured CO2 to biomethane (CH4) in a single step by the use of renewable hydrogen. The concept combines carbon capture with that of power-to-methane, to hereby abate CO2 emissions and use the captured CO2 as a resource. Experimental results of the conceptual design in batch reactors demonstrated high microbial biocompatibility with amine methyl diethanolamine (MDEA). The biocompatibility was examined in the range of 0 \u2013 500 mM MDEA, and the system demonstrated almost full bioavailability of the absorbed CO2 until 120 mM of MDEA. Within this range, the CH4 productivity ranged from 40.7 - 63.6 NmLCH4 L-1culture h-1 from synthetically absorbed CO2 with a maximum conversion 1.77 times higher than traditional biomethanation with gaseous CO2. Conversion of raw flue gas from a biogas engine resulted in only a slight decrease in conversion efficiency compared to that of pure gasses, which demonstrated that the concept has high robustness to the impurities and oxygen present in raw flue gas.

This phenomenon is known as Elastocapillary effect. The evolution of a new species at this interface too alters the interfacial energy and consequently the extent of deformation. Hence, it should be possible to monitor dynamics of physical and chemical events occurring near to the solid-liquid interface by measuring this deformation by a suitable method, e.g., optical profilometer. \nExperiments:   Aqueous solution of a metal salt inserted into these channels reacts with Silicon-hydride present in PDMS, yielding metallic nanoparticles at the channel surface. The kinetics of this reaction was captured in real time, by measuring the wall deformation. Similarly, physical adsorption of a protein: Bovine Serum Albumin, on PDMS surface too was monitored.  \nFinding :  The rate of change in deformation can be related to rate of these processes to extract the respective reaction rate constant.

Unfortunately, the antibiotic development pipeline is slow even though AMR has been escalating uncontrollably fast, namely amongst Gram-negative pathogens. Although out of use until recently due to their toxic side effects, polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option since all other antibiotics are currently failing. In an attempt to ameliorate their toxicity and improve antimicrobial activity,  many studies have been generating polymyxin analogues through different strategies, mostly empirical. As such, there is still a lack of  faster and more reliable approaches to make analog design efficient in order to tackle AMR in a timely fashion. The solution to accelerate the discovery of new drugs probably lies in the use of in silico approaches, such as machine learning, due to their faster pace and time and cost efficiency. In this work, machine learning was applied to Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling with the objective of providing a working semi-quantitative model capable of predicting the activity of polymyxin-like molecules for a given species. For this, we applied four different learning algorithms and ten different families of molecular descriptors to our dataset of 408 molecule/microorganism pairs retrieved from PubChem. The AdaBoost model devised using the CKP set of descriptors was the best performer, with good accuracies and very low false negative and positive predictions. Preliminary exploration of the model's response to systematic changes in the structure of polymyxin B reveals a trend towards increased antimicrobial activity when exchanging some of its constituent amino acids for more lipophilic ones.

These series of experiments reveal that the terminal group of organic SAM molecules must satisfy two conflicting requirements, the first of which is to promptly react with ALD precursors and the second is not to bind strongly to the bottom metal oxide layers to avoid undesired SAM conformations. OH-terminated phosphate aliphatic molecules, which we have synthesized, were identified as one of the best candidates for such a purpose. Molecular compatibility between metal oxide precursors and the -OHs must be properly considered to form superlattices. In addition, it is also important to form densely packed and all-trans-like SAMs to maximize the surface density of reactive -OHs on the SAMs. Based on these design strategies for organic-metal oxide superlattices, we have successfully fabricated various superlattices composed of metal oxides (Al-, Hf-, Mg-, Sn-, Ti-, Zr oxides) and their multilayered structures.

Concentrated interfaces can typically retard the local electrocatalytic reactions to extend the voltage window for high-voltage batteries, whereas in this study we demonstrated that a dense interface constituting of zwitterionic betaine could selectively promote the electrocatalytic transformation of anionic species, especially electrocatalytic hydroxide oxidation in alkaline water splitting. Under concentrated betaines, the state-of-the-art oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts of nickel and nickel-iron oxyhydroxide exhibited overpotential gains of 138 mV and 97 mV, corresponding to two orders of magnitude higher current densities. The activity increment was stemmed from both the static dehydration effect that the hygroscopic betaine rips off the anionic hydration shell to promote its downstream reaction and the dynamic double layer effect that the ultra-dense betaine layer accelerates the accumulation of underhydrated anions in the inner Helmholtz plane. This enhancement is highly specific to ions for enabling the selective ionic transformation in complex media. The concentrated betaine interface effectively segregates the reactive zones to improve the durability of water electrolysis in aniline-containing electrolytes by at least an order of magnitude, opening up new possibilities for next-generation unconventional water splitting.

Pancharatna; Musiri M.  Balakrishnarajan", "abstract": "Polyhedral boron clusters are lauded as 3D-aromatic that frequently form interconnected periodic networks in boron-rich borides with metal and non-metals having high thermodynamic stability and hardness.  This leads to the question of whether the spherical delocalization of electrons in these clusters is extended across the network as in organic aromatic networks. These borides also frequently show partial oxidation, having fewer electrons than that is mandated by electron counting rules, whose impact on their aromatic stability and geometry remains mysterious.  Understanding the nature of electronic communication between polyhedra in polyhedral borides is largely unknown though it is crucial for the rational design of advanced materials with desirable mechanical, electronic and optical properties.  Here we show that electronic delocalization across polyhedral clusters has a significant impact on their structure and stability.  Our computational inquiry on closo borane dimers shows substantial variation in conjugation with the ideal electron count.  Upon two-electron oxidation, instead of forming exohedral multiple bonding that disrupts the aromaticity, it undergoes subtle geometric transformations that conserve aromaticity.  The nature of geometric transformation depends on the HOMO that is decided locally on the polyhedral degree of the interacting vertices.  The prevalence of \u03c0-type interactions as HOMO in tetravalent vertices encourage conjugation across clusters and turn into a macropolyhedral system hosting a rhombic linkage between clusters upon oxidation.  In contrast, the \u03c3-type interactions dominate the HOMO of pentavalent vertices that prefers to confine aromaticity within the polyhedra by separating them with localized 3c-2e bonds.  Our findings expose the fundamental bonding principles that govern the interaction between boron clusters and will provide chemical guidance for the design and analysis of polyhedral boride networks with desired properties.", "date": "2023-03-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.); Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work we demonstrate a method for modulation of the crossflow rate during separation increases the peak-to-peak resolution of the resulting fractograms. In classical FFF methods, the crossflow rate is either maintained constant or decreased during separation of the different species. In this work, higher resolution between peaks was achieved by a novel gradient method in which the crossflow is increased briefly during separation to allow stronger retention of the later eluting peaks. We first outline the theoretical basis by which the improved separation is achieved. We confirm our hypothesis by quantifying the impact of increasing crossflow on the resolution between a monoclonal antibody monomer and its high molecular weight (HMW) aggregate. We then demonstrate that this method is applicable to two different FFF methods (AF4 and HF5) and various pharmaceutically relevant samples (monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and adeno-associated viruses (AAV)).

Many years of research made it clear that the driving force for spontaneous emulsification arises from the differences of the chemical potentials of various components in the organic and aqueous phases, which triggers diffusion coupled hydrodynamic fluctuation. While extraordinary theoretical developments have taken place that attempted to describe these processes within the scopes of equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the local processes underlying the spontaneous emulsification, however, still remain elusive. In this research, we investigate the local processes that involve the transfer of surfactant as well as water from one phase to another (i.e. water to oil), which results in the formation of water-in-oil emulsion in the organic phase and, subsequently. Thes emulsions invert into oil-in-water emulsion, rather abruptly, as they cross the phase boundary. Studies based on UV spectroscopy and molecular dynamics indicate that these processes may involve explosive events and subsequent assembly of the fragments to other organized structures which are reminiscent of cusp catastrophe proposed earlier by Dickinson. These processes lead to either to a strong or a weak fluctuation of the component concentrations below the interface that also becomes evident in the fast (athermal) diffusion of the emulsion droplets from the interfacial region farther into the bulk water.

Structure-function relationships between ligand set and reactivity are developed, with a particular emphasis on rationalizing previously uncharacterized ligand-controlled reactivity toward high energy and challenging C(sp2)\u2013Cl bonds. Through a dual Hammett and computational analysis, the mechanism of the formal oxidative addition is found to proceed through an SNAr-type pathway, consisting of a nucleophilic two-electron transfer between the Ni(I) 3d(z2) orbital and the Caryl\u2013Cl \u03c3* orbital, which contrasts the mechanism previously observed for activation of weaker C(sp2)\u2013Br/I bonds. The bpy substituent provides a strong influence on reactivity, ultimately determining whether oxidative addition or dimerization even occur. Here we elucidate the origin of this substituent influence as arising from perturbations to the effective nuclear charge (Zeff) of the Ni(I) center. Electron donation to the metal decreases Zeff, which leads to a significant destabilization of the entire 3d orbital manifold. Decreasing the 3d(z2) electron binding energies leads to a powerful two-electron donor to activate strong C(sp2)\u2013Cl bonds. These changes also prove to have an analogous effect on dimerization, with decreases in Zeff leading to more rapid dimerization. Ligand-induced modulation of Zeff and the 3d(z2) orbital energy is thus a tunable target by which the reactivity of Ni(I) complexes can be altered, providing a direct route to stimulate reactivity with even stronger C\u2013X bonds and potentially unveiling new ways to accomplish Ni-mediated photocatalytic cycles.", "date": "2023-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bond Activation; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The reaction is scalable, shows a broad substrate scope, and tolerates a range of functional groups. The utility of this method is demonstrated in the concise syntheses of BN isosteres of a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction pathway involves boron-mediated cyclopropane ring-opening and base-mediated elimination, followed by an unusual low-barrier 6\u03c0-electrocyclization accelerated by the BN/CC isomerism.", "date": "2023-03-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

H. pylori expresses the outer membrane HopQ protein at the earliest stages of infection. Therefore, HopQ is a highly reliable candidate as a biomarker for H. pylori detection in saliva samples. \n\nMaterials and Methods: An H. pylori immunosensor is developed based on detecting HopQ as a biomarker in saliva by a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with MWCNT-COOH decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNP). The HopQ antibodies are grafted on the SPCE/MWCNT/AuNP surface using EDC/S-NHS chemistry. The sensor performance is investigated by various methods and H. pylori detection performance in spiked saliva samples is evaluated by square wave voltammetry. \n\nResults: The sensor is suitable for HopQ detection with high sensitivity and excellent linearity in the 10 pg/mL - 100 ng/mL range and with a 10\u2009pg/ml limit of detection. The sensor was tested in saliva at 10 ng/mL and returned an 107.6% recovery. The dissociation constant Kd for HopQ/HopQ antibody interaction, estimated from Hill's model, is calculated with a value of an order of \n4.605 \u00d7 10\u221210 mg/mL.  \n\nConclusions: Due to the strategical choice of biomarker, the utilization of nanocomposite material to enhance the SPCE electrical performance, the intrinsic selectivity of the antibody-antigen interaction, and effective immobilization, the fabricated platform shows high selectivity, good stability, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness for early H. pylori detection.

While wettability is commonly associated with the macroscopic measurement of a contact angle between surface, water, and air, the molecular physics that underlie these macroscopic observations are not fully known, and anticipating relative behavior of different polymers is challenging. To address this gap in molecular-level understanding, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate and contrast interactions of water with six chemically distinct polymers: polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, poly(methyl methacrylate), Nylon 66, and polyvinyl alcohol. We show that several prospective quantitative metrics for hydrophobicity agree well with experimental contact angles. Moreover, the behavior of water in proximity to these polymer surfaces can be distinguished with analysis of interfacial water dynamics, extent of hydrogen bonding, and molecular orientation--even when macroscopic measures of hydrophobicity are similar. The predominant factor dictating wettability is found to be the extent of hydrogen-bonding between polymer and water, but the precise manifestation of hydrogen-bonding and its impact on surface-water structure varies. In the absence of hydrogen-bonding, other molecular interactions and polymer mechanics control hydrophobic ordering. These results provide new insights into how polymer chemistry specifically impacts water-polymer interactions and translates to surface hydrophobicity.

Benefiting from the marvellous features (e.g. bright emission and phototheranostic effect in aggregates) of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) materials, constructing AIE-based multifunctional nanocarriers that act as all-rounders to integrate multimodalities for precise theranostics is highly desirable. Here, an intelligent nanoplatform (P-TN-Dox@CM) with homologous targeting, controllable drug release, and in vivo dual-modal imaging for precise chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy is proposed. AIE photothermic agent (TN) and anticancer drug (Dox) are encapsulated in thermo-/pH-responsive nanogels (PNA), and the tumor cell membranes are camouflaged onto the surface of nanogels. Active targeting can be realized through homologous effects derived from source tumor cell membranes, which significantly elevates the specific drug delivery to tumor sites. After being engulfed into tumor cells, the nanogels exhibit a burst drug release at low pH. The near-infrared (NIR)-photoinduced local hyperthermia can activate severe cytotoxicity and further accelerate drug release, thus generating enhanced synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy to thoroughly eradicate tumors. Moreover, P-TN-Dox@CM nanogels could achieve NIR-fluorescence/photothermal dual-modal imaging to monitor dynamic distribution of therapeutics in real-time.

However, in order to obtain practically useful polarization, large single crystals doped with a polarizing agent must be strictly oriented with respect to the magnetic field to sharpen the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, which is a fatal problem that prevents its application to truly useful biomolecular targets. Instead of this conventional physical approach of controlling crystal orientation, here, we propose a chemical approach, i.e., molecular design of polarizing agents; pentacene molecules, the most typical triplet-DNP polarizing agent, are modified so as to make the triplet electron distribution wider and more isotropic without loss of the triplet polarization. In fact, the modification of pentacene with thiophene moieties makes the ESR spectrum sharper and stronger than that of pentacene. To elucidate the effect of the substitutions on spin polarization and zero-field splitting parameters, which determine ESR spectrum, state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations were performed and revealed that the direction of the spin polarization is altered by the modification with thiophene moieties and the size of D and E parameters are reduced from parent pentacene due to the partial delocalization of spin densities on the thiophene moieties. The triplet-DNP with the new polarizing agent successfully exceeds the previous highest 1H polarization of glassy materials by a factor of 5. This demonstrates the feasibility of a polarizing agent that can surpass pentacene, the best polarizing agent for more than 30 years since triplet-DNP was first reported, in the unoriented state.

However, the sole organic groups introduction does not unambiguously guarantee hydrophilicity control and might lead to porosity drop, acidity modulation, structural changes, etc. Therefore, a thorough and complex characterization is necessary to provide a complete view of the interaction between the catalyst surface, reactants, and products.

This material was post-synthetically modified with trimethylsilyl groups; their number on the catalyst surface was controlled via a temperature vacuum pretreatment. In such a way, we have obtained aluminosilicate materials with similar porosity, structure, and acid site strength and quality. Notably, the water sorption measurements showed that trimethylsilylated aluminosilicates adsorb 2.5\u22123 times less water (p/p0 = 0.3) than the parent aluminosilicate catalyst. The turn over frequency in epoxide ring opening and ethanol dehydration scaled up with the number of trimethylsilyl groups grafted on the catalyst surface.

We present detailed atomistic simulations showing that graphanol (hydroxylated graphane) will conduct protons anhydrously with very low diffusion barriers. We developed a deep learning potential (DP) for graphanol that has near-density functional theory accuracy, but requires a very small fraction of the computational cost. We used our DP to calculate proton self-diffusion coefficients as a function of temperature, to estimate the overall barrier to proton diffusion, and to characterize the impact of thermal fluctuations as a function of system size. We propose and test a detailed mechanism for proton conduction on the surface of graphanol. We show that protons can rapidly hop along Grotthuss chains containing several hydroxyl groups aligned such that hydrogen bonds allow for conduction of protons forward and backward along the chain without hydroxyl group rotation. Long-range proton transport only takes place as new Grotthuss chains are formed by rotation of one or more hydroxyl groups in the chain. Thus, the overall diffusion barrier consists of a convolution of the intrinsic proton hopping barrier and the intrinsic hydroxyl rotation barrier.  Our results provide a set of design rules for developing new anhydrous proton conducting membranes with even lower diffusion barriers.", "date": "2023-03-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Carbon-based Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Three thiol-containing molecules, L-cysteine, glutathione, and D-penicillamine, were studied separately, and it was found that more than 95% of oxidation happened after incubating any of these compounds with mesoporous silica nanoparticles in the dark for a day at room temperature.

Lateral flow tests (LFTs) use a well- established format that was designed to simplify the user experience.

Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (\u03bcPADs), like LFTs, have the potential to be used in diagnostic applications at the point of care. However, \u03bcPADs have not gained significant traction outside of academic laboratories, in part, because they have often demonstrated a lack of homogeneous shape or color in signal outputs, which consequently can lead to inaccurate interpretation of results by users. Here, we demonstrate a new class of \u03bcPADs that generate colorimetric signals at the interfaces of converging liquid fronts (i.e., lines) to control where colorimetric signals are formed without relying on capture techniques.

The rational design of MIMs with desired functionalities requires studying their dynamics at sub-molecular resolution and on relevant timescales, which is challenging experimentally and computationally. Here, we combine molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations to reconstruct the thermodynamics and kinetics of different types of MIMs at atomistic resolution under different conditions.

Nonetheless, current NIR dyes are often plagued by relatively large molecular weights, poor water solubility, and limited photostability. Herein, we provide the first examples of azaphosphinate dyes. These dyes display maximal absorbance and emission above 750 nm and the inclusion of a phosphinate functionality virtually abolishes aggregation in aqueous solutions compared to the parent dye scaffold. The dramatically improved water solubility of this dye class enables applications in both photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging. In the case of photoacoustic imaging, we demonstrate 4.1-fold enhanced signal intensity compared to commonly used standards, the ability to multiplex with existing dyes in blood samples, and imaging depths of 2.75 cm in tissue. An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed substantially reduced photobleaching compared to the FDA-approved indocyanine green dye and could be used to selectively label mitochondria in living cells. To the best of our knowledge, azaphosphinate dyes are the lowest molecular weight, water soluble dyes with absorbance and emission in the 750 nm range.

Previous studies revealed that cis isomer of azobenzene gains strong nonequilibrium polarization (called hyperpolarization) of 15N nuclear spins through interaction with parahydrogen molecules (i.e., a dihydrogen isomer with protons having zero total spin, pH2) in the reversible exchange with Ir-complex. This technique, known as SABRE (Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange), enhances inherently weak NMR signals by several orders of magnitude at relatively low operational cost. We demonstrate that performing SABRE in the presence of light irradiation allows to hyperpolarize trans-azobenzene, which direct coordination with the SABRE Ir-complex is sterically hindered. The proposed approach, which we called photo-SABRE, is robust and efficient, as well as non-destructive and reproducible. It combines coherent polarization transfer from pH2 to cis-azobenzene with the reversible cis-trans-photoisomerization. Moreover, using photo-SABRE, it is possible to hyperpolarize the long-lived spin order of 15N spin pair in trans-azobenzene, with a lifetime of about 25 minutes, which greatly exceeds the ordinary relaxation times T1 of its 15N nuclei at high (around 10 s) and low (around 200 s) magnetic fields.

Maier", "abstract": "In this work, the new class of locally range-separated local hybrid (LRSLH) functionals is presented. LRSLH functionals combine the concepts of a local exact-exchange admixture as in local hybrids with a locally range-separated exact-exchange admixture as in locally range-separated hybrid functionals. The satisfiability of important theoretical constraints on hybrid functionals by the LRSLH approach is discussed in comparison to existing hybrid functional classes by proposing a new categorization scheme for hybrid functionals, labeled as hybrid functional ladder. In particular, this concerns the iso-orbital and asymptotic potential limits as well as the high-density limit with respect to uniform coordinate scaling and the gradient expansion of the exchange energy density, which in contrast to existing hybrid schemes can be simultaneously satisfied by LRSLH functionals. Furthermore, this work provides a first explorative study regarding the performance of the new LRSLH approach. Despite featuring only up to two empirical parameters, the optimized LRSLH functionals exhibit a similar performance for atomization energies and transition barrier heights as some of the more recent hybrid functionals. In particular, this highlights the great potential of the new LRSLH approach.", "date": "2023-03-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Yet, the lack of established process and business models defining \u201cgreen steel\u201d make it difficult to understand what the respective H2 price has to be in order to be competitive with commercial state-of-the-art natural gas DRI. Given the importance of establishing break-even H2 prices and CO2 emission reduction potentials of H2-DRI, this study conducted techno-economic analyses of several design and operation scenarios for DRI systems. Results show that renewable H2 use in integrated DRI steel mills for both heating and the reduction of iron ore can reduce direct CO2 emissions by as much as 85%, but would require an H2 procurement cost of $1.63 per kg H2 or less. When using H2 only for iron ore reduction, economic viability is reached at an H2 procurement cost of $1.70 per kg, while achieving a CO2 emission reduction of 76% at the plant site. System design optimization strategies around excess H2 ratios in the DRI top gas and the H2 recycle pressurization can further improve performance and economics. Low H2 excess ratios are particularly attractive as they reduce pre-heating energy requirements and offer integration opportunities with static recycle ejectors if H2 is supplied at sufficiently high pressure. The potential of utilizing the EAF off-gas is shown to be much more synergistic with H2 DRI than NG DRI and can increase the break-even H2 procurement cost by up to 7\u00a2 per kg H2. Such findings are critical for setting technical performance criteria for H2 supply and storage in the iron and steel sector.", "date": "2023-03-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Thermodynamics (Chem.

Herein, the problem is tackled by a systematic mathematical analysis of firstly single-adsorbate reactions and then more complicated reactions. A complete regime diagram of all possible EIS shapes of single-adsorbate reactions is provided, navigating the analysis in the multi-dimensional parametric space. For single-adsorbate reactions involving two steps with identical transfer coefficients of 0.5 in the absence of lateral adsorbate interactions, several rigorous corollaries are derived.

Classically, catalytic promotion in alloy catalysts has been ascribed to atomic scale cooperativity between the metal constituents. For catalytic reactions that could involve charge transfer to solution, electron flow across a conductive support can be coupled to ionic flow through solution to permit, in principle, bimetallic promotion even in the complete absence of atomic level connectivity between metal constituents. We examine this hypothesis in the context of nitrate hydrogenation, a reaction that is catalyzed almost exclusively by bimetallic catalysts. Using the state-of-the-art PdCu/C catalyst, we show that the overall nitrate hydrogenation reaction proceeds via the electrochemical coupling of the hydrogen oxidation and nitrate reduction half-reactions. Studies of each metal in isolation reveal that Pd exclusively catalyzes the former, while Cu exclusively catalyzes the latter. These findings suggest that nitrate hydrogenation on PdCu alloys proceeds via galvanic coupling of complementary half-reactions on Pd and Cu, obviating the need for atomic scale cooperativity. Based on this mechanistic insight, we design two new nitrate hydrogenation catalysts, RuCu and RuAg, that operate via the same principle with comparable activity to PdCu.

Nevertheless, contemporary CGMD modeling is relatively bespoke and there are no black-box CGMD methodologies available that could play a comparable role in discovery applications that density functional theory plays for electronic structure. This gap might be filled by machine learning (ML) based CGMD potentials that simplify model development, but these methods are still in their early stages and have yet to demonstrate a significant advantage over existing physics-based CGMD methods. Here we explore the potential of  $\\Delta$-learning models to leverage the advantages of these two approaches. This is implemented by using ML-based potentials to learn the difference between the target CGMD variable and the predictions of physics-based potentials. The $\\Delta$-models are benchmarked against the baseline models in reproducing on-target and off-target atomistic properties as a function of CG resolution, mapping operator, and system topology. The $\\Delta$-models outperform the reference ML-only CGMD models in nearly all scenarios. In several cases, the ML-only models also manage to minimize training error while still producing qualitatively incorrect dynamics, which is corrected by the $\\Delta$-models. Given their negligible added cost, $\\Delta$-models provide essentially free gains over their ML-only counterparts. Nevertheless, an unexpected finding is that neither the $\\Delta$-learning models nor ML-only models significantly outperform the elementary pair-wise models in reproducing atomistic properties. This fundamental failure is attributed to the relatively large irreducible force errors associated with coarse-graining that produces little benefit from using more complex potentials.

Many use cases require the prediction of cell- to-cell variability between identically cycled cells, such as production quality control.

Using the dataset published by Severson et al. in 2019 as an example, we show that features encoding cycling conditions boost model accuracy because they predict the protocol-to-protocol variability. However, models based on these features are less transferable when deployed on identically cycled cells. Our analysis underscores the concept of using the right features for the right prediction task.

Stress-testing was performed on the EACNE to evaluate its chemical and colloidal stability under the influence of different environmental factors, encompassing both physical and chemical stressors. Subsequently, the EACNE was converted to a solid powdery material while still retaining its THC potency, and suited for \u201cmicrodosing\u201d applications.\n\nMethods: An ethanol-assisted emulsification method was used to generate a THC nanoemulsion. The EACNE was fully characterized, imaged, and subjected to stress-tests. The EACNE was then mixed with a solid matrix material post facto and lyophilized to create a solid ingestible substance. Upon ball-milling, a dense powdery material was obtained. Flow properties and thermal properties of this material were recorded. Potency of the material was evaluated in triplicate using HPLC and correlated with the potency of the starting EACNE. \n\nResults: EACNE had an average lipid droplet size of ca. 190 nm, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.15, and an average droplet zeta potential of -49\u00b110 mV. The nanoemulsion was colloidally stable for at least 6 weeks, with no meaningful change in cannabinoid potency over the experimental period, as determined by HPLC analysis. The EACNE remained stable when subjected to physical stresses such as heat, freeze/thaw cycles, carbonation, dilution to beverage concentrations, high sucrose concentrations, and a pH range between 5-8. The effect of undesirable events during the lyophilization of the EACNE were minimized by ball-milling the resulting solid. The microencapsulated EACNE demonstrated limited free-flowing behaviour but was freely redispersible in water without any visible phase separation.\n\nConclusions: A solvent-mediated emulsification protocol creates a THC-loaded nanoemulsion that can subsequently be converted to a water-soluble powder. These materials are particularly suited for THC \u201cmicrodosing\u201d, a practice that\nmight decouple the health benefits of THC from its psychotropic effects.", "date": "2023-03-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One of these advantages is its direct action on cancer cells, avoiding possible side effects, unlike chemotherapy, which reaches tumor cells and affects healthy cells in the body, leading to a great loss in the quality of life of patients. In this way, it is known that vanadium complex (VC) [VO(oda)(phen)] has proven inhibition effect on autophagy process in pancreatic cancer cells. Keeping that in mind, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can be considered excellent strategies to investigate the interaction of metal complexes and their biological targets. However, simulations of this type are strongly dependent on the appropriate choice of force field (FF). Therefore, this work proposes the development of AMBER FF parameters for VC, having a minimum energy structure as a starting point, obtained through DFT calculations with B3LYP/def2-TZVP level of theory plus ECP for the vanadium atom. An MD simulation in vacuum was performed to validate the developed FF. From the structural analyses, satisfying values of VC bond lengths and angles were obtained, where a good agreement with the experimental data and the quantum reference was found. The RMSD analysis showed an average of only 0.3%. Finally, we performed docking and MD (120 ns) simulations with explicit solvent between VC and PI3K. Overall, our findings encourage new parameterizations of metal complexes with significant biological applications, as well as allow to contribute to the elucidation of the complex process of autophagy.", "date": "2023-03-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It is shown that Co incorporates into the garnet structure preferably four-fold coordinated as Co2+ or Co3+ depending on oxygen fugacity. The solubility limit of Co is determined to be around 0.16 pfu, whereby concentrations beyond this limit causes a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition.

In particular, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a typical kraft lignin could be tuned over a remarkable and unprecedented 213 oC.

The most extensively used method in structure-based virtual screening is molecular docking. However, the docking process is not computationally efficient and simultaneously accurate due to classic mechanics-based scoring functions. These can only approximate, but not reach, quantum mechanics precision. In order to reduce the computational cost of the protein-ligand scoring process and use data-driven approaches to boost the scoring function accuracy, deep learning non-docking methods can be used by utilizing 3D structure or 1D sequence information of the protein target. This method can minimize the error inherited from molecular docking methods and avoid the extensive computational cost of docking. Furthermore, these two methods are integrated into an easy-to-use framework, CarbonAI, that provides both choices for researchers. Graph neural network (GNN) is employed in the 3D version and BiLSTM has been adopted in the sequence version of CarbonAI, respectively. To verify our approaches, different experiments were performed on two datasets, an open dataset Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD.E) and an in-house proprietary dataset without computer generated artificial decoys (NoDecoy). On DUD.E we achieved a state-of-the-art AUC of 0.981 and on NoDecoy we achieved an AUC of 0.974 whereas on the conventional docking program, the respective AUC performance is less than 0.8.

Efficient catalysis of these reactions classically recourses to heterogeneous or homogeneous transition-metal species. Whether thermal or electrochemical, C\u2013C multiple bond catalytic hydrogenation commonly involves metal hydrides as key intermediates. Here, we report that the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes by molecular Ni complexes proceeds without the mediation of a hydride intermediate. Through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, we disclose a mechanism that primarily involves a nickelacyclopropene resting state upon alkyne binding to a low-valent Ni(0) species. A following sequence of protonation and electron transfer steps via Ni(II) and Ni(I)-vinyl intermediates then leads to olefin release in an overall ECEC pattern as the most favored pathway. Our results also evidence that pathways involving hydride intermediates are strongly disfavored, which in turns promotes high semihydrogenation selectivity by avoiding competing hydrogen evolution. While bypassing catalytically competent hydrides, this type of mechanism still retains inner-metal-sphere characteristics with the formation of organometallic intermediates, often essential to control regio- or stereo-selectivity.

Furthermore, activity of the hydrolyzing enzyme, myrosinase, was evaluated across the leaves. Additionally, a possible glucosinolate transport from older to younger leaves was monitored. Young leaves of both species contained of more glucosinolates than old ones. Accordingly, more isothiocyanates were released upon glucosinolate hydrolysis in young leaves. Myrosinases fully hydrolyzed the whole glucosinolates regardless of the leaf age. It was confirmed that older leaves can supply younger leaves with glucosinolates.

Combining these gives a more complete picture of the total metabolites present in a sample. However, the effect of this data merging on subsequent data analysis, especially in combination with normalization, has not yet been analysed. To address this issue, we conducted a neutral comparison study to evaluate the performance of eight post-acquisition normalization methods under different data merging procedures using 1029 urine samples from the Food Chain plus (FoCus) cohort.

In marked contrast with its phenyl-based congeners (tBuPCP)IrHCl and derivatives, 2-H is highly air sensitive and reacts with oxidants such as ferrocenium, trityl cation, and benzoquinone. These oxidations ultimately lead to intramolecular activation of a phosphino-t-butyl C(sp3)-H bond and cyclometalation. Considering the greater electronegativity of N than C, 2-H is expected to be less easily oxidized than simple PCP derivatives; DFT calculations of direct one-electron oxidations are in good agreement with this expectation. However, 2-H is calculated to undergo metal-ligand-proton tautomerism (MLPT) to give an N-protonated complex that can be described with resonance forms representing a zwitterionic complex (negative charge on Ir) and a p-N-pyridylidene (remote NHC) Ir(I) complex. One-electron oxidation of this tautomer is calculated to be dramatically more favorable than direct oxidation of 2-H (G\u00b0 = 31.3 kcal/mol). The resulting Ir(II) oxidation product is easily deprotonated to give metalloradical 2\u2022 which is observed by NMR spectroscopy. 2\u2022 can be further oxidized to give cationic Ir(III) complex, 2+, which can oxidatively add a phosphino-t butyl C-H bond, and undergo deprotonation to give the observed cyclometalated product. DFT calculations indicate that less sterically hindered complexes would preferentially undergo intermolecular addition of C(sp3)-H bonds, for example, of n alkanes. The resulting iridium alkyl complexes could undergo facile -H elimination to afford olefin, thereby completing a catalytic cycle for alkane dehydrogenation that is driven by one-electron oxidation and deprotonation, enabled by MLPT.", "date": "2023-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Bond Activation; Reaction (Organomet.); Theory - Organometallic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

They are exploited for many applications from cosmetic to food science since both hydrosoluble and liposoluble cargos can be encapsulated within. They are generally prepared using a one-step or a two-step method, phase inversion and also via spontaneous emulsification. Here, we describe a general and simple one-step method based on hydrophilic polymers dispersed in polar oils to generate osmose-induced diffusion of water into oil droplets, forming polymer-rich aqueous droplet within. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), but also other hydrophilic polymers (branched polyethylene imine, bPEI, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, PVPone) were successfully dispersed in 1-octanol or other polar oils (oleic acid or tributyrin) to produce an O/W emulsion that spontaneously transformed into a W1/O/W2 emulsion, with the inner aqueous droplet (W1) enriched with the hydrophilic polymer (PEG, bPEI or PVPone). Dispersion of hydrosoluble dyes in the oil/polymer mixture in the form of a W/O microemulsion further allowed their encapsulation within the internal W1 aqueous droplet of the double emulsion. Single drop experiments, as well as macroscopic viscosity measurements, confirm that the double emulsion is actually the result of water diffusion, which amplitude can be adjusted by the polymer concentration. Production of high internal phase emulsions (HIPE) was also achieved together with a pH-induced transition from multiple to single core double emulsion. We expect this new method for producing double emulsions to find applications in domains of microencapsulation and materials chemistry.

ORF8 has domains associated with EF-hand, oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol binding, macrophage-specific clearance receptors, suppression of telomerase transcription, damaged telomeres of \u00a0DNA, Cyclin, NOS, ubiquitination, etc., according to the search results. ORF8 binds to oxidized VLDL cholesterol via macrophage-like specialized clearance receptors (SMB and SRCR) \u00a0domains and is endocytosed into macrophages in the form of CD14+ receptor-bound VLDL, as revealed by the results. ORF8 colonizes macrophages via domain-like ABC and MlaD functions. ORF8 reaches the nucleus via cholesterol nuclear translocation and binds histones by ubiquitination. Ca2+ binding activates ORF8 NOS activity to produce NO, influencing histone acetylation, and ORF8 binds the CpG island of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene in order to suppress transcription. ORF8 also binds to DNA telomeres via the TRF domain and telomerase-like activity, catalyzes telomere breaking via ribonuclease II, DNA topoisomerase (TOPEUc), and the Ku protein. And ORF8 activates the S/G2 switch via the cyclin and motor domains. ORF8 interferes with the genetic activity of macrophages and induces the death of immune cells, hence subverting the NO regulating mechanism of the immune system and facilitating virus evasion from the reproductive immune system.

Thus, the difference between n-octanol/water and toluene/water partition coefficients has proven to be a valuable descriptor to study the propensity of molecules to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and exhibit chameleon-like properties that modulate solubility and permeability.

Furthermore, the study also investigates the performance of two computational strategies for the prediction of logPtol/w.

The second consists of the parametrization of the IEF-PCM/MST continuum solvation model from B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations to predict the solvation free energies of 163 compounds in toluene and benzene. The performance of the ML and IEF-PCM/MST models has been calibrated against external test sets, including the compounds that define the SAMPL9 logPtol/w challenge. The results are used to discuss the merits and weaknesses of the two computational approaches.

Recently, poly(benzodifurandione), PBDF, was reported to have unexpected solubility given the absence of side chains and to exhibit an unprecedented, high electrical conductivity upon reduction (\u201cn-doping\u201d), with protons acting as counter-ions. Here, we theoretically investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of PBDF by taking long oligomers and one-dimensional (1D) periodic chains as model systems. With the oligomer models, we characterize the formation of polarons and bipolarons in n-doped PBDF. Our results indicate that singlet bipolarons tend to be the energetically most favorable species when protons bind to two adjacent carbonyl groups in nearest-neighbor benzodifuran moieties. The calculations on the 1D periodic chain models show that the positions of the protonated carbonyl groups determine the metallic, semiconducting, or insulating nature of a PBDF chain. When the protonated carbonyl groups are all situated on the same side of a PBDF chain, a stable helical chain configuration is found that exhibits ferromagnetic behavior. Our findings elucidate the mechanism of polaron and bipolaron formation in long oligomers of n-doped PBDF and highlight the fascinating electronic and magnetic properties of periodic 1D chains.

Although commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) satisfy the current needs, the limited availability of raw materials and moderate specific charge capacities (SCC) of LIBS, motivated scientists to search for alternate anode materials for LIBs and also to find technologies beyond LIBs. In this work, we studied the potential of six Cobalt anti-MXenes (CoAs, CoB, CoP, CoS, CoSe, and CoSi), a class of newly discovered 2D materials, as anode materials for lithium, sodium, and potassium ion batteries (LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs). We found that these materials are good electrical conductors and have high adsorption stability for the alkali metal ions, which helps to prevent the formation of dendrites and increase the cycle life of the battery. They also show moderate to low migration energy barriers (MEBs), indicating the potential for faster charge-discharge kinetics. We also explained the slightly counter-intuitive result of observing low MEBs along with high adsorption stability.  Furthermore, Co-anti-MXenes can adsorb multiple alkali atoms per formula unit, resulting in high specific charge capacities and low average anodic voltages. For example, as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, CoP and CoSi have SCC values of 1075.4 mAh g-1 and 934 mAh g-1, and anodic voltages as low as 0.28 V and 0.43 V, respectively. Moreover, even the maximally metallated Co-anti-MXenes did not show agglomeration tendency at room temperature. Also, the volume expansion of these materials is minimum for both Li and Na adsorption. As a whole, we find that Co-anti-MXenes can act as promising anode materials for alkali metal ion batteries.

These values are over 1 eV lower than those calculated for analogous silver(II) porphyrins, reflecting much greater relativistic destabilization of the Au 5d orbitals relative to Ag 4d orbitals. The calculations reproduced the experimentally observed lateral distortion of the Au porphyrin core, ascribing the phenomenon to dx2-y2-dz2-6s mixing. The calculations also underscored a mild wave deformation as an intrinsic feature of the Au porphyrin core. Although previously noted, the origin of this unusual deformation has remained obscure. The topology of the HOMO and spin density profile appear to provide at least a partial explanation of the wave deformation: the electronegative Au(II) center appears to suck electron density from the porphyrin\u2019s p-HOMO by triggering a wave deformation.

Instead, the crystal structure of PuOx is assumed to be isostructural with neptunium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Np(C2O4)\u00ac2\u22196H2O; NpOx) and uranium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (U(C2O4)\u00ac2\u22196H2O; UOx) despite the high degree of unresolved disorder that exists when determining water positions in the crystal structures of the latter two compounds. Such assumptions regarding the isostructural behavior of the actinide elements have been used to predict the structure of PuOx for use in a wide range of studies. Herein, we report the first crystal structures for PuOx and Th(C2O4)2\u00b76H2O (ThOx). This data, along with new characterization of UOx and NpOx, has resulted in the full determination of the structures and resolution of the disorder around the water molecules. Specifically, we identify the coordination of two water molecules with each metal center, which necessitates a change in oxalate coordination mode from axial to equatorial that has not been reported in the literature. The results of this work exemplify the need to revisit previous assumptions regarding fundamental actinide chemistry, which are heavily relied upon within the current nuclear field.", "date": "2023-03-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Nuclear Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thousands of MOFs have been synthesized, yet relatively few have been screened for their promise in methane conversion. We developed a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) workflow that identifies MOFs from a diverse space of experimental MOFs that have not been studied for catalysis, yet are thermally stable, synthesizable, and have promising unsaturated metal sites for C\u2013H activation via a terminal metal-oxo species. We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the radical rebound mechanism for methane to methanol conversion on models of the secondary building units (SBUs) from 87 selected MOFs. While we showed that oxo formation favorability decreases with increasing 3d filling, consistent with prior work, previously observed scaling relations between oxo formation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) are disrupted by the greater diversity in our MOF set. Accordingly, we focused on Mn MOFs, which favor oxo intermediates without disfavoring HAT or leading to high methanol release energies\u2014a key feature for methane hydroxylation activity. We identified three Mn MOFs comprising unsaturated Mn centers bound to weak-field carboxylate ligands in planar or bent geometries with promising methane to methanol kinetics and thermodynamics. The energetic spans of these MOFs are indicative of promising turnover frequencies for methane to methanol that warrant further experimental catalytic studies.", "date": "2023-03-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this paper, we investigated the effect of doping the MAPbI2.6Cl0.4 hybrid perovskite (MA-methyl ammonium) with non-toxic elements, such as alkaline earth metal ions (Mg2+) and transition metal ions (Zn2+). The structural, morphological, and optical properties of the prepared samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and UV-Vis. spectroscopy. Finally, the doped films were used as photoactive layers in solar devices in order to evaluate their photovoltaic performance. Zn proved to be more appropriate to replace partially Pb and films with higher quality were obtained. As a result, the MAPb1-xZnxI2.6Cl0.4 based solar cells have demonstrated a slight improvement of the photovoltaic performances, resulting in a uniform and narrower PCEs (power conversion efficiency) range, compared to pristine MAPbI2.6Cl0.4 based devices.", "date": "2023-04-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Photovoltaics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we present a computational study of the colloidal aggregation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) isotropically functionalized by a mixture of charged and hydrophobic ligands. We show that, by varying the relative proportion of the two ligands, the NPs form anisotropic aggregates with markedly different topologies: dumbbells, chains, or ribbons. In all cases, two kinds of connections keep the aggregates together: hydrophobic bonds and ion bridges. We show that the anisotropy of the aggregates derives from the NP shell reshaping due to the formation of the hydrophobic links, while ion bridges are accountable for the \u201csecondary structure\u201d of the aggregates. Our findings provide a general physical principle that can also be exploited in different self-assembled systems: anisotropic/directional aggregation can be achieved starting from isotropic objects through a soft moldable surface.

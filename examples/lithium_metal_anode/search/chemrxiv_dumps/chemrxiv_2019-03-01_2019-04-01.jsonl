This has important implications for understanding the thermodynamic driving forces underlying the adsorption of acid groups from crude oil, in particular naphthenic acid, onto calcite. Free energy calculations show that naphthenic acid binds favorably to the water mono-layer adsorbed on the calcite surface. But to bond directly to the calcite, a free energy barrier has to be overcome to expel the intervening layer of water. Further, naphthenic acids with longer alkyl chains bind with lower free energy to the calcite surface than those with shorter alkyl chains, and, for the same chain length, branching also enhances adsorption. To better understand this behavior, for a specified alkyl chain length we study adsorption at different temperatures. Consistent with experiments, we find that adsorption is enhanced at higher temperatures. Examining the enthalpic and entropic contributions to adsorption shows that adsorption of naphthenic acid is entropically favored.<br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Based on their reinforced structures and high degradation temperatures as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), many reports have claimed that COFs have excellent thermal stability. However, their stability to heat and pressure has not been probed using methods that report on structural changes rather than the loss of volatile compounds. Here we explore two structurally analogous 2D COFs with different polymerization chemistries using in operando X-ray diffraction, which demonstrates the loss of crystallinity at lower temperatures than the degradation temperatures measured by TGA. Density functional theory calculations suggest that an asymmetric buckling of the COF lattice is responsible for the observed loss of crystallinity. In addition to their thermal stability, x-ray diffraction of the 2D COFs under gas pressures up to 100 bar showed no loss in crystallinity or structural changes, indicating that these materials are robust to mechanical stress by applied pressure. We expect that these results will encourage further exploration of COF stability as a function of framework design and isolated form, which will guide the design of frameworks that withstand demanding application-relevant conditions.", "date": "2019-03-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Polymers; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Physical and Chemical Processes; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The plasmonic stamps were prepared by sputtering gold films on PDMS, followed by thermal annealing to dewet the gold and form gold nanoparticles. By changing the film thickness of the sputtered gold, the approximate size and shape of these gold nanoparticles can be changed, leading to a shift of the optical absorbance maximum of the plasmonic stamp, from 535 nm to 625 nm. Applying the plasmonic stamp to a Si(111)-H surface using 1-dodecene as the ink, illumination with green light results in covalent attachment of 1-dodecyl groups to the surface. Of the dewetted gold films on PDMS used to make the plasmonic stamps, the thinnest three (5.0, 7.0, 9.2 nm) resulted in the most effective plasmonic stamps for hydrosilylation. The thicker stamps had lower efficacy due to the increased fraction of non-spherical particles, which have lower-energy LSPRs that are not excited by green light. Since the electric field generated by the LSPR should be very local, hydrosilylation on the silicon surface should only take place within close proximity of the gold particles on the plasmonic stamps.To complement AFM imaging of the hydrosilylated silicon surfaces, galvanic displacement of gold(III) salts on the silicon was carried out and the samples imaged by SEM - the domains of hydrosilylated alkyl chains would be expected to block the deposition of gold. The bright areas of metallic gold surround dark spots, with the sizes and spacing of these dark spots increasing with the size of the gold particles on the plasmonic stamps.

In an effort to enable the rapid exploration of this\nspace in the case of binary copolymers, we train a neural network using a\ntiered data generation strategy to accurately predict the optical and\nelectronic properties of 350,000 binary copolymers that are, in principle,\nsynthesizable from their dihalogen monomers via Yamamoto, or Suzuki-Miyaura and\nStille coupling after one-step functionalisation.

However, the implementation of PGC-based separations in glycomics\nstudies has been limited because system-independent retention values have not\nbeen established to normalize technical variation. To address this limitation,\nthis study combined the use of hydrolyzed dextran as an internal standard and\nSkyline software for post-acquisition normalization to reduce retention time and\npeak area technical variation in PGC-based glycan analyses.

Optical absorption spectra of different icosahedral silver and gold nanoclusters of diameters between 1 and 4 nanometers has been simulated. Furthermore, the energy absorption process have been quantified by means of calculating a fully quantum absorption cross-section using the information contained in the reduced single-electron density matrix. This approach allows us take into account for the quantum confinement effects dominating in this size regime. Likewise, the plasmon-induced hot-carrier generation process under laser illuminations have been explored from a fully dynamical perspective. We have found noticeable differences in the energy absorption mechanisms and the plasmon-induced hot-carrier generation process in both metals which can be explained by their respective electronic structures. These difference can be attributed to the existence of ultra-fast electronic dissipation channels in gold nanoclusters that are absented in silver nanoclusters.

We present a descriptor based micro-kinetic model of the trends in selectivity and activity of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over close-packed metal facets and through varied reaction conditions. Our model predicts and explains the experimentally observed promotion effect on turnover rate from co-feeding hydrogen as an effect of the shifting equilibria in steady state. At low conversion reaction conditions over Pt, the path to ethene goes through ethane dehydrogenation to ethyl, CH 3 CH 2 *, then to ethene while the non-selective pathway to methane and deeply dehydrogenated species is predicted to go through dehydrogenation via CH 3 CH*. This implies that the desorption step of ethene is not the limiting step for selectivity and that geometric effects that stabilize CH 2 CH 2 * compared to CH 3 CH* are desirable properties of a better catalyst.

To this end, various adaptive quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods have been proposed, in which free solvent exchanges are allowed via a flexible switching of their identities between QM and MM models according to their distances from the QM solute. However, temporal and spatial discontinuities that remain in the standard implementations continue to hamper stable and accurate dynamics simulations using adaptive QM/MM approaches. We previously demonstrated that the size-consistent multi-partitioning (SCMP) method achieved temporal continuity while avoiding spatial discontinuities to some extent. In the present study, however, we demonstrate that the residual spatial discontinuity may lead to severe problems under certain conditions; via quantitative analysis, we show that not only adaptive QM/MM but also all multiscale approaches might share these problems implicitly, which have not been investigated in depth so far.

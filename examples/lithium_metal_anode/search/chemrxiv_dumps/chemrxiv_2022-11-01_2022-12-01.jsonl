Metastable domains of solid-solution\nintermediates are detected, but are not associated with the reaction front between the lithiated and delithiated phases as predicted by current theory.

Boron doping showed to be a promising approach to modify the properties of metal catalysts and improve their performance in various applications. In this work, we conduct periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study boron doping on a number of metals and its impact on sulfur poisoning. Our DFT calculations show that boron doping impacts metals differently. Boron doping is favourable on few metals (Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru) and very unfavourable on other metals (e.g. Ag and Cu). On Pd, Pt, and Rh, boron doping has a positive impact on reducing sulfur poisoning, with the impact varying with boron concentration.

In this report industry members of the consortium worked together to objectively evaluate the performance of the force fields (referred to here as OpenFF) produced by the initiative on a combined public and proprietary dataset of 19,653 relevant molecules selected from their internal research and compound collections. This evaluation was important because it was completely blind; at most partners, none of the molecules or data were used in force field development or testing prior to this work.

Hitherto, modeling efforts have focused on the description of 18-methyl eicosanoic acid (18-MEA), the primary fatty acid covalently attached to the hair surface, without explicit modeling of the protein layer. Herein, the molecular details of the outermost surface of the human hair fiber surface, also called the F-layer, were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The F-layer is composed primarily of Keratin associated proteins KAP5 and KAP10, which are decorated with 18-MEA on the outer surface of a hair fiber. In our molecular model, we incorporated KAP5-1, and evaluated the surface properties of 18-MEA through MD simulations, resulting in 18-MEA surface density, layer thickness, and tilt angles in agreement with previous experimental and computational studies. Subsequent models with reduced 18-MEA surface density were also generated to mimic damaged hair surfaces. Response to wetting of virgin and damaged hair showed rearrangement of 18-MEA on the surface, allowing for water penetration into the protein layer. To demonstrate a potential use case for these atomistic models, we deposited naturally occurring fatty acids and measured 18-MEA\u2019s response in both dry and wet conditions. As fatty acids are often incorporated in shampoo formulations, this work demonstrates the ability to model adsorption of ingredients on hair surfaces.

The exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) dispersion model has shown good performance in the calculation of relative and absolute lattice energies of molecular crystals, although it has traditionally been applied in combination with plane-wave/pseudopotential approaches. This has limited XDM to use with semilocal functional approximations, which suffer from delocalization error and poor quality conformational energies, and to systems with a few hundreds of atoms at most due to unfavorable scaling. In this work, we combine XDM with numerical atomic orbitals, which enable the efficient use of XDM-corrected hybrid functionals for molecular crystals. This improves the treatment of delocalization error and conformational energies, and makes the calculation scale linearly with system size. We test the new XDM-corrected functionals for their ability to predict the lattice energies of molecular crystals for the X23 set and 13 ice phases, the latter being a particularly stringent test. A composite approach using a XDM-corrected, 25% hybrid functional based on B86bPBE achieves a mean absolute error of 0.48 kcal/mol per molecule for the X23 set and 0.19 kcal/mol for the total lattice energies of the ice phases, compared to recent diffusion Monte-Carlo data.

Discrete metallosupramolecular cages exhibiting SCO are an exciting, though rare, class of porous polyhedral material. Incorporating the SCO property into these architectures is complicated, as there are many inter- and intramolecular factors which must be appropriately balanced. Previous investigations into the magnetic properties of a large cubic metallosupramolecular cage, [Fe8Pd6L8]28+, constructed using semi-rigid metalloligands, found that the Fe(II) centers that occupied the corners of the cubic structure did not undergo a spin transition. In this work, substitution of the linker metal on the face of the cage resulted in spin crossover behavior, as evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, M\u04e7ssbauer and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Structural comparisons of these two cages were undertaken to shed light on the possible mechanism responsible for switching of the [Fe8MII6L8]28+ architecture from SCO inactive to active by simply changing the identity of M(II). This led to the suggestion that a possible interplay of intra- and intermolecular interactions may permit SCO in the Ni(II) analogue, 1. The distorted octahedral coordination environment of the secondary Ni(II) centers occupying the cage faces provided conformational flexibility for the eight metalloligands of the cubic architecture relative to the square planar Pd(II) environment. Meanwhile the occupation of axial coordination sites of the Ni(II) cations by CH3CN prevented the close packing of cages observed for the Pd(II) analogue, leading to a more offset, distant packing arrangement of cages in the lattice, whereby important areas of the cage that were shown to change most dramatically with SCO experienced a lesser degree of steric hindrance. Design via the effect of secondary metal centers on the flexibility of metalloligand structures and the effect of the axial donors on the packing arrangements may serve as new routes for engineering cage systems with desired magnetic properties.", "date": "2022-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Magnetism", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Thus, understanding the energetic balance of solvation and desolvation resulting from individual water molecules can be crucial when estimating ligand binding, especially when evaluating different molecules and poses as done in High-Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS). Over the last decades, several methods were developed to tackle this problem, ranging from fast approximate methods (usually empirical functions using either discrete atom-atom pairwise interactions or continuum solvent models), to more computationally expensive and accurate ones mostly based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, such as Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) or Double Decoupling. On one hand, MD-based methods are prohibitive to use in HTVS to estimate the role of waters on the fly for each ligand. On the other hand, fast and approximate methods show unsatisfactory level of accuracy, with low agreement with results obtained with the more expensive methods. Here we introduce WaterKit, a new grid-based sampling method with explicit water molecules to calculate thermodynamic properties using the GIST method. Our results show that the discrete placement of water molecules is successful in reproducing the position of crystallographic waters with very high accuracy, as well as providing thermodynamic estimates with accuracy comparable to more expensive MD simulations.  Unlike these methods, WaterKit can be used to analyze specific regions on the protein surface, (such as the binding site of a receptor), without having to hydrate and simulate the whole receptor structure.

With this screening approach we discover 12 different multi-tail lipidoid structures capable of assembling into the bicontinuous double gyroid phase. The large quantity of morphological data uncovers unexpected design criteria that enable phase selection as a function of lipidoid headgroup size and architecture, tail length and architecture and counterion identity. Surprisingly, combining branched headgroups with bulky tails forces lipidoids to adopt unconventional pseudo-disc conformations that pack into double gyroid networks, entirely distinct from other synthetic or biological amphiphiles within bicontinuous cubic phases.

With the advent of the green revolution, water for irrigation and domestic use led to the development of groundwater resources. Slowly, the green revolution changed into a greed revolution, and the exploitation of groundwater resources converted into their overexploitation. Groundwater's overexploitation not only led to groundwater depletion but also led to a change in the chemistry of the Malwa region's aquifers. Researchers from academia and institutions worked and published their findings of the uranium and arsenic contaminations in the Malwa region of Punjab. In this article, we are the first to bring all the dispersed data to one commonplace. By studying the physicochemical parameters of groundwater of all districts of the Malwa region and their correlation, this paper is going to highlight the various chemical reactions occurring in the Malwa region's aquifer and how they impact groundwater chemistry.

Static DNA assemblies often have delicate designs with structural rigidity to overcome thermal fluctuations, whose design strategies have been studied extensively. Dynamic structures reconfigure in response to external cues. Such transformational mechanisms have been explored to create dynamic nanodevices for environmental sensing, payload delivery, and other applications. However, the precise control of reconfigurable dynamics has been a challenge due partly to flexible single-stranded DNA connections between moving parts. Deformable structures are special dynamic constructs with deformation on double-stranded parts and single-stranded hinges during reconfiguration. These structures often have better controls in programmed deformation. However, related deformability and mechanics, as well as deformation mechanisms are not well understood or documented. In this review, we summarize the development of dynamic and deformable nanostructures from the mechanics perspectives. We present deformation mechanisms such as single-stranded DNA hinges with lock-and-release pairs, jack edges, helicity modulation, and external loading. Theoretical and computational models are discussed for understanding the deformations and mechanics, including commonly used elasticity theory, finite element method, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics models. Other special models are also introduced. We elucidate the pros and cons of each model and recommend design processes based on the models. The design guidelines should be useful for those who have limited knowledge in mechanics as well as expert DNA designers. After presenting unique applications, we conclude with current challenges in dynamic and deformable structures and outlook for the development of the field.", "date": "2022-11-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Biological Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Atom-sized quantum sensors are highly promising to bridge this gap and have enabled measurements of temperature, electric and magnetic fields on the nano- to microscale. Nevertheless, the technical complexity of both disciplines has so far impeded an uncompromising combination of LOC systems and quantum sensors. Here, we present a fully integrated microfluidic platform for solid-state spin quantum sensors, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Our platform fulfills all technical requirements, such as fast spin manipulation, enabling full quantum sensing capabilities, biocompatibility, and easy adaptability to arbitrary channel and chip geometries. To illustrate the vast potential of quantum sensors in LOC systems, we demonstrate various NV center-based sensing modalities for chemical analysis in our microfluidic platform, ranging from paramagnetic ion detection to high-resolution microscale NV-NMR.

This makes predicting and establishing a structure-property relationship for each phase necessary as well as challenging. In this work, the molecular and physical changes occurring in sulfur-cross-linked natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), and their 50/50 blend subjected to accelerated weathering are analyzed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, atomic-force microscopy (AFM), and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). NMR transverse relaxation time (T2) studies suggest the formation of rigid components due to weathering. FTIR and AFM reveal that this is related to the formation of a stiff surface due to chemical modifications, which shows up as an additional thermal transition in the DMTA curves. Low-field double-quantum (DQ) NMR studies of the cross-link density, by the residual dipolar coupling constant (Dres), of SBR show a continuous increase in its cross-link density over the weathering duration (988 h). In contrast, NR exhibits dominant chain scission reactions resulting in defects, with both materials demonstrating the formation of different chain lengths. During the first 168 h, NR also undergoes modification of sulfur bond lengths, which is also observed in the blend. The blend largely follows an intermediate trend of cross-link densities compared to the two polymers but shows signs of lesser chain modifications than a weighted average of the two polymers. This is confirmed by phase-resolved DQ magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments whereby the peak-specific Dres of the blend was measured to be lesser than that of the individual vulcanizates, thus proving that the blend is more resistant to weathering than its constituent elastomers.", "date": "2022-11-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Elastic Materials; Polymer blends; Polymer chains", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The aluminum ion battery (AIB) is a promising technology, but there is a lack of understanding of the desired nature of the batteries\u2019 electrolytes. These properties cannot simply be extrapolated from other metal ion batteries, as the ionic charge carriers in these batteries are not simply Al3+ ions but the anionic AlCl4\u2212 and Al2Cl7\u2212, which form in the electrolyte. This study aims to illustrate the effect of mole ratios and organic solvents to improve the AIB electrolytes with the aid of computational techniques. To this end, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on varying ratios forming acidic, neutral and basic mixtures of the AlCl3 salt with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMImCl) ionic liquid (IL) and an organic solvent electrolyte (dichloromethane (DCM) or toluene). The data obtained from both viscosity and diffusion calculations indicate that the solvents could improve the transport properties. Both DCM and toluene lead to lower viscosities, higher diffusion coefficients, and higher conductivity. Detailed calculations demonstrated solvents can effectively improve the formation of AlCl3\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl (AlCl4\u2212) and AlCl4\u2212 \u2026AlCl4\u2212 (Al2Cl7\u2212) especially in acidic mixtures. Densities which were averaged around 1.25 g/cm3 for pure electrolyte mixture of AlCl3-EMImCl were of comparable values to the experimental reports.

There are several methods for reversible solid-state and chemical CO2 storage, but their advantages and limitations have yet to be reviewed. This article focuses on the physical and chemical aspects of CO2 storage via liquid and solid chemical carriers and sorbents, and gives an overview of the energetics around their use, as well as prospects for their future development.

Herein, we report a dinuclear Fe(II) triple helicate 1, which is a rare example of a SCO material possessing two distinct magnetic behaviors that depend upon the thermal scan rate. Desolvated 1 was seen to undergo spin transition (ST) which was complete following slow cooling (1 K min-1), but incomplete ST (corresponding to 50% conversion) on fast cooling (10 K min-1). The incomplete ST observed in the latter case was accompanied by a higher temperature onset of ST, differing from TIESST (Temperature-Induced Excited Spin-State Trapping) materials. The two SCO pathways have been shown to arise from the interconversion between two structural phases (a and b), with both phases having associated high spin (HS) and low spin (LS) states. SCXRD (Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction) experiments using controlled cooling rates and a synchrotron light source enabled short collection times (2-3 minutes per dataset) which has enabled the identification of a mechanism by which the slow-cooled material may fully relax. In contrast, fast-cooled materials exhibit disordered arrangements of multiple structural phases, which has in turn revealed that the [HS-LS] \u2194 [LS-HS] equilibria are controllable in the solid by varying the scan rate. Such behavior has been previously observed in solution studies, but its control in solids has not been reported up to now. This study demonstrates how intermolecular cooperativity can allow multiple distinct magnetic behaviors, and provides some insight into how [HS-LS] \u2194 [LS-HS] equilibria can be controlled in the solid state, which may assist in the design of next-generation logic and signaling devices.", "date": "2022-11-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Magnetism", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Their utility for multiple glycoproteomic applications is driving the search to both discover new O-glycoproteases and to understand how structural features of characterized O-glycoproteases influence their substrate specificities. One challenge of defining O-glycoprotease specificity restraints is the need to characterize O-glycopeptides with site-specific analysis of O-glycosites.

Metabolome coverage from untargeted LC-MS studies relies heavily on the pre-analytical protocols used (e.g., homogenization and extraction). Chosen protocols impact which metabolites are successfully measured, which in turn impacts biological conclusions. Furthermore, different homogenization and extraction parameters produce significant variability in metabolome coverage, sample reproducibility, and extraction efficiency. There is a need for an efficient and systematic approach to optimize matrix-specific sample preparation parameters. Herein we describe a Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) approach for matrix-specific sample preparation optimization using model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. To demonstrate this methodology we optimized: i) extraction solvent, ii) volume, iii) extraction time, and iv) LC reconstitution solvent for a sequential non-polar and polar extraction, and confirmed our optimized results using NMR spectroscopy. DOE is rarely used in metabolomics, yet it provides a systematic path forward for optimizing multiple sample preparation parameters while keeping the number of experiments, labor, and costs necessarily low. Altogether, the Taguchi DOE method is an adaptable and scalable method well-fit for the diversity of current and future hypotheses studied using untargeted metabolomics.", "date": "2022-11-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Carbon dioxide is the most abundant ghg and its direct air capture (DAC) is a very attractive strategy to reduce its concentration in the atmosphere. However, the existing capturing processes are technologically challenging due to the costs of the processes and the low concentration of CO2. The efficient valorisation of the CO2 captured could help overcoming many technoeconomic limitations. Sorbants capable to concentrate CO2 from the atmosphere require strong interactions (e.g. carbamate synthesis), which increase the cost of regeneration of the sorbants and introduce thermodynamic barriers to efficiently transform the CO2 into added value products. Here we present a novel methodology for direct air capture and conversion (DACC) able to efficiently convert CO2 from air into cyclic carbonates using epoxides or halohydrins as substrates. The new approach employs commercially available basic ionic liquids (ILs), it works without the need of sophisticated and expensive co-catalysts or sorbants and under mild reaction conditions. The CO2 from atmospheric air was efficiently captured by IL solution (0.98 molCO2/molIL) and subsequently completely converted (> 99%) to cyclic carbonate. A mechanism of conversion was evaluated and proposed, which helped to identify relevant reaction intermediates based on halohydrins, which could be sourced from biomass derivatives. A 100% selectivity towards the desired cyclic carbonates was obtained employing this methodology. Finally, the catalyst was reactivated employing an ion exchange column, and reused for at least 3 cycles.", "date": "2022-11-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report a platform for generating a panel of soluble and functional dyes for SWIR imaging by late-stage functionalization of a fluorophore intermediate via click chemistry.

These aqueous interfaces have been probed by heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy. To obtain the molecular response  from the measured HD-SFG spectra , one needs to correct the measured ssp spectra for local electromagnetic field effects at the interface due to a spatially varying dielectric function. This so-called Fresnel factor correction can change the inferred response substantially, and different ways of performing this correction lead to different conclusions about the interfacial water response. Here, we compare simulated and experimental spectra at the air/water interface. We use three previously developed models to compare the experiment with theory: an advanced approach taking into account the detailed inhomogeneous interfacial dielectric profile, and the Lorentz and slab models two approximate the interfacial dielectric function. Using the advanced model, we obtain excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment, in both spectral shape and amplitude. Remarkably, we find that for the Fresnel factor correction of ssp spectra, the Lorentz model for the interfacial dielectric is equally accurate in the H-bonded region of the response, while the slab model underestimates this response significantly. The Lorentz model thus provides a straightforward method to obtain the molecular response from measured spectra of aqueous interfaces in the hydrogen-bonded region.", "date": "2022-11-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These new designs can help reduce optical losses, facilitate incorporation into the built environment or unlock new applications. However, as fabrication of complex geometries can be time- and resource-intensive, the ability to simulate the expected LSC performance prior to production would be highly advantageous. While a variety of softwares exist to model LSCs, they either cannot be applied to unconventional geometries, are not open-source, or are not tractable for most users. Therefore, here we introduce a significant upgrade of the widely-used Monte Carlo ray-trace software pvTrace to include: (i) capability to characterize unconventional geometries and improved relevance to standard measurement configurations; (ii) increased computational efficiency; and (iii) a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease-of-use.

Our simulations were designed to represent recently synthesized gels composed of tetrapoly-(acrylic acid) and tetrapoly(ethylene glycol) stars. To model the ionization equilibrium of the weak acid groups and the exchange of small ions with the reservoir, we applied the recently developed Grand-Reaction Monte-Carlo method. We showed that the ionization of these gels as a function of the pH significantly deviates from the ideal Henderson-Hasselbalch equation due to two main contributions: (1) electrostatic interactions and (2) Donnan partitioning of small ions. The first contribution dominates in the gels composed of alternating neutral and acidic blocks, contrasting with our previous observations that both contributions are comparably strong in hydrogels composed of homogeneously distributed weak acid groups. We also critically examined the counterion condensation argument, previously invoked to explain why the experimentally observed swelling was lower than predicted by theory. Thus, a detailed analysis of the simulations allowed us to understand which of the above effects dominates in different systems and why, thereby allowing us to identify the correct physical origin of the deviations from ideal swelling. Such an understanding is important not only for correctly interpreting experimental measurements but also for designing polyelectrolyte gels tailored to exhibit specific swelling response to pH and salt concentration.

The intrinsic length and time scales often stretch far beyond the nanometer and picosecond range due to e.g. large spatial heterogeneities or complex phase transitions. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can extend the applicability of density functional theory (DFT) towards such challenging systems,  but the generation of a representative training set of atomic configurations still poses a major challenge. In this work, we present an incremental learning scheme that constructs accurate and transferable MLPs based on a minimal number of DFT evaluations. Key to the approach is a combination of an active learning scheme that generates systematically improved MLPs with efficient and parallelized enhanced sampling protocols that explore increasingly larger portions of the phase space and learn physical interactions on-the-fly. The method requires a single atomic structure and a collective variable as input, after which the incremental learning approach constructs accurate interatomic potentials based on as few as 1000 single point DFT evaluations, even for flexible frameworks with multiple structurally different phases. The accuracy of the obtained potentials is extensively validated in terms of structural and mechanical properties across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, yielding thermodynamically transferable MLPs. Finally, it is demonstrated how the incremental learning approach shows great potential to train universal MLPs for a larger set of materials. A proof of principle based on 10 well-known aluminum- and zirconium-based MOFs is shown. The proposed incremental learning approach is universally applicable and may induce a paradigm shift in both the accuracy as well as the time and length scale of computational models for framework materials.", "date": "2022-11-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Specifically, a brief overview will be given on experimental efforts related to the P adsorption at mineral surfaces and the factors affecting this process. Moreover, a brief introduction into common CC methods, techniques, and applications is presented. The main part of this review is focused on a possible strategy to cope with the soil heterogeneity by breaking down the complexity of P behavior in soil into well-defined models that can be discussed in terms of particular key factors. Hence, different molecular model systems and molecular simulations are introduced to reveal the P binding to soil organic matter (SOM), metal ions, and mineral surfaces. Simulation results provided an in-depth understanding of the P binding problem and explained at a molecular level the effects of surface plane, binding motif, kind and valency of metal ions, SOM composition, water, pH, and redox potential on the P binding in soil. On this basis, an overall molecular picture of P binding in soil can be then obtained by combining results for the different models.

Here we report on a family of planar bismuth (III) complexes (c.f. typically pyramidal structure for such compounds), which show a geometric Lewis acidity that can be further tuned by varying the steric and electronic features of the triamide ligand employed. The structural dynamism of the planar bismuth complexes was probed in both the solid and solution phase, revealing at least three distinct modes of intermolecular association. A modified Gutmann-Beckett method was used to assess their electrophilicity by employing trimethylphosphine sulfide in addition to triethylphosphine oxide as probes, providing insights into the preference for binding hard or soft substrates. Experimental binding studies were complemented by a computational assessment of the affinities and dissection of the latter into their intrinsic bond strength and deformation energy components. The results show comparable Lewis acidity to triarylboranes, with the added ability to bind two bases simultaneously and reduced discrimination against soft substrates.

Triggered by mechanical agitation, the sticky fluid rapidly transitions into solid fibers. The assembly of slime proteins into stiff polymers is fully reversible and recyclable enabling the recovery of the soluble precursors. In order to understand the rapid and reversible mechanoresponsive behavior of this material, here, we study the nanostructural organization of slime components using small-angle scattering with neutrons and x-rays under physiological native conditions, after drying and re-hydration, and mechanical agitation. The scattering intensities are successfully described with a three-component model accounting for proteins of two dominant molecular weight fractions and for protein-based nanoglobules with a radius of ~40-45 nm, which is in line with the literature. However, in contrast to the previous assumption that high molecular weight (HMW) proteins -- the presumed building blocks of the fiber core -- are contained in the nanoglobules, we find that the majority of slime proteins exist as free proteins in solution, including the HMW fiber core precursors. Only less than 10 % of the slime proteins are contained in the nanoglobules, necessitating a reassessment of the previously proposed function of nanoglobules in fiber formation. Exploiting distinct differences in the x-ray and neutron scattering contrast of slime re-hydrated with light and heavy water (D2O) indicates that the majority of lipids available in the slime are contained in the nanoglobules, where they are homogeneously distributed. Surprisingly, mechanical agitation of slime in a completely filled container causes gelification; however, this neither leads to fiber formation nor alters the bulk structure of the slime significantly, suggesting that interfacial phenomena and directional shearing are required for the formation of stiff fibers in velvet worm slime.", "date": "2022-11-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Biological Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this contribution, we use the Nb-catalyzed epoxidation of ethylene as a test reaction to analyze various aspects of the modeling that need to be taken into account for simulations of effective reaction rates. We show that each site can host a variety of transition state structures that represent the same reaction event, but that can differ considerably in reaction barrier. Furthermore, many different sites need to be sampled. We then use machine learning to identify the most important descriptors of the bare active site that correlate directly with the energy barrier.

Radionuclides that can be carried by selective ligands such as antibodies, peptides, and small molecules targeting cancerous cells have demonstrated a clear improvement in the move towards precision medicine. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a family of enzymes involved in DNA damage repair signalling pathway, with PARP inhibitors olaparib, talazoparib, niraparib, veliparib, and rucaparib having FDA approval for cancer therapy in routine clinical use. Based on our previous work with the radiolabelled PARP inhibitor [18F]rucaparib, we replaced the fluorine-18 moiety, used for PET imaging, with iodine-123, a radionuclide used for SPECT imaging and Auger electron therapy, resulting in 8-[123I]iodo-5-(4-((methylamino)methyl)phenyl)-2,3,4,6-tetrahydro-1H-azepino[5,4,3-cd]indol-1-one, ([123I]GD1), as a potential radiopharmaceutical for RLT.\nMethods: [123I]GD1 was synthesised via copper-mediated radioiodination from a selected boronic esters precursor.  In vitro uptake, retention, blocking, and effects on clonogenic survival with [123I]GD1 treatment were tested in a panel of cancer cell lines. The enzymatic inhibition of PARP by GD1 was also tested in a cell-free system. The biodistribution of [123I]GD1 was investigated by SPECT/CT in mice following intravenous administration.\nResults: Cell-free enzymatic inhibition and in vitro blocking experiments confirmed a modest ability of GD1 to inhibit PARP-1, IC50= 239 nM. In vitro uptake of [123I]GD1 in different cell lines was dose-dependent, and the radiolabelled compound was retained in cells for more than 2 h. Significantly reduced clonogenic survival was observed in vitro after exposure of cells for 1 h with as low as 50 kBq of [123I]GD1. The biodistribution of [123I]GD1 was further characterized in vivo showing both renal and hepatobiliary clearance pathways with a biphasic blood clearance.\nConclusion: We present the development of a new theragnostic agent based on the rucaparib scaffold and its evaluation in in vitro and in vivo models. The data reported show that [123I]GD1 may have the potential to be used as a theragnostic agent.\n", "date": "2022-11-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We detail several aspects of the derivation of the equations, and present test calculations that verify the correctness of the tensors formulation and of their implementation. The results show that the full OR tensor is completely origin invariant as for molecules and that PBC calculations match molecular cluster calculations on 1D chains.

A comparison with experimental data of OR for the tartaric acid crystal shows reasonable agreement given the level of theory employed.

However, for the same reasons, they often suffer from poor membrane permeation and thus low oral bioavailability. As permeability assays do not allow to monitor the pathway and behavior of cyclic peptides on their \u201cjourney\u201d trough lipid membranes, little is known about the underlying permeation process, which poses a major obstacle for their rational design. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a computational microscope to uncover how large and conformationally flexible cyclic peptides enter and cross a lipid bilayer. In a first step, we performed unbiased MD simulations to elucidate the permeation pathway. Subsequently, this pathway knowledge was utilized to seed biased simulations to further enrich for permeation events. Based on our simulations, we show how specific side-chain residues can act as \u2019molecular anchors\u2019, which establish the first contact between the peptides and the membrane, and consequently enable membrane insertion. Inside the membrane, the cyclic peptides are positioned directly between the polar headgroup and the apolar tail region, where they are subjected to a unique polar/apolar interface environment. In this environment, the cyclic peptides show a preference for one of two distinct orientations. We observe that only one of these orientations allows the formation of the permeable \u2019closed\u2019 conformation, and only in this \u2019closed\u2019 conformation the cyclic peptides can cross from the upper to the lower membrane leaflet, which again requires a unique anchoring and flipping mechanism.

Solid oxide-based CO2 electrolysis on Ni-YSZ at high temperature requires the presence of H2 in the CO2 inlet stream. It is believed that in pure CO2 streams the reaction fails due to oxidation of the Ni-YSZ electrode. Using operando Raman spectroscopy and online mass spectroscopy, we have shown that CO2 can in fact be reduced on the Ni-YSZ surface. Our measurements, reveal that Ni-YSZ oxidizes to NiOx-YSZ within a pure CO2 stream. CO2 electrolysis is possible on this oxide surface via a surface oxygen and vacancy-mediated mechanism similar to those observed within other oxide cathodes such as CeOx. The deactivation of the electrode coincides with strongly reducing conditions and at current densities > 400 mA/cm2, NiOx is completely reduced coinciding with complete stoppage of CO production. Cu-impregnation into Ni-YSZ was demonstrated to mitigate the deactivation issue by forming a more stable surface oxide on Ni which continued to carry out CO2 reduction under strongly reducing conditions.

Demonstrated here is that these monolayers can not only last at least one week under such harsh conditions, but that significant applied value can be captured for continuous electrochemical aptamer biosensors. Electrochemical aptamer biosensors provide an ideal tool to investigate monolayer degradation, as aptamer sensors require a tightly-packed monolayer to preserve sensor signal versus background current and readily reveal fouling by albumin and other solutes when operating in biofluids. Week-long operation in serum at 37 \u02daC is achieved by: (1) assembling monolayers on gold with roughness that promotes small alkylthiolate monolayer defect sizes; (2) increasing van der Waals interactions between adjacent monolayer molecules to increase the activation energy required for desorption; (3) optimizing electrochemical measurement to decrease both alkylthiolate oxidation and electric-field induced desorption; (4) mitigating fouling by using protective zwitterionic membranes and zwitterion-based blocking layers with antifouling properties. This work further proposes origins and mechanisms of monolayer degradation in a logical stepwise manner that was previously unobservable over multi-day time scales. Several of the observed results are surprising, revealing that short term improvements to sensor longevity (i.e., hours) actually increase sensor degradation in the longer term (i.e., days).

This support is based on agarose microbeads activated with aldehyde, amino and cobalt-chelates moieties that allow a fast and irreversible immobilization of enzymes (5 to 30 min), making most of the heterogeneous biocatalysts highly thermostable (up to 21-fold higher than the soluble one). We also demonstrated the potential of this tri-functional support to efficiently co-immobilize a multi-enzyme system composed by an alcohol dehydrogenase, a NADH oxidase and a catalase. The confined multi-enzymatic system demonstrates higher performance than the soluble enzyme counterparts reaching and accumulated TTN of 1x104 during five batch consecutive cycles under operational conditions. Finally, we expanded the versatility of the described exploited heterogeneous chemistry to other frequently used immobilization supports such as cellulose microbeads and commercial methacrylate porous beads. We envision this solid material to be a reference platform for co-immobilizing multi-enzyme systems with enhanced properties to catalyze stepwise biotransformations.

Herein,  extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to examine the mechanism of Ni-catalyzed electrochemical aryl amination reactions.

AMPs can target many features of the cell surface, and effective resistance development may require multiple mutations in parallel that have large fitness costs. Although they have diverse modes of action, AMPs will often begin by binding to the membrane; cell-penetrating peptides will subsequently need to cross it. Characterization of AMP activity can thus be inferred by the determination of KD (dissociation constant for binding affinity) and KP (partitioning constant).\nHere we demonstrate that microscale thermophoresis (MST) can be used for reliable label-free measurement of KD and KP utilising the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence - removing the need for chromophore labelling. The MST results of binding to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and styrene maleic acid (SMA) based nanodiscs are compared to the corresponding surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. SMA-QA nanodiscs are shown to be best suited for accurate measurements, while vesicles are a viable alternative. Unmodified SMA-nanodiscs proved unsuitable due to interactions between the cationic AMPs and the anionic polymer belt.\nSignificant reduction of KD was observed when 5% anionic lipids were included in the lipid composition of the membrane models. This highlights the preference of the tested AMPs for anionic bacterial membranes, and the measured KD and KP values correlate well with their activity towards S. aureus and E. coli. We conclude that MST is a promising method for fast and efficient detection of peptide-lipid interactions, and the relative strength of the interactions can be reliably ranked within a library of screened compounds.\n\n", "date": "2022-11-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Apparatus; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, a bioorthogonal reaction to label TePhe was required to enable protein tagging to facilitate analysis.  Here we establish that the tellurophene side chain of TePhe is a potent partner in an oxidation-controlled, strain-promoted tellurophene-alkyne cycloaddition (OSTAC) reaction.

The main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV 2 mediates viral replication through proteolytic activity and the subsequent generation of infectious virus particles. Current computational efforts towards SARS-CoV 2 MPro inhibitor design generally neglect an allosteric mechanism linked to His41-Cys145 catalytic dyad disruption and thus do not target the open conformational state. Using both empirical and computational evidence, it was found that the rotation of the His41 imidazole side chain along the His41 backbone dihedral from 0.5 rads to -0.25 or -0.6 rads provides a  conformational pathway for mediating MPro activity. In this work,  the importance of enhanced sampling methods such as metadynamics  when performing computer-aided MPro inhibitor design is demonstrated via the sampling of the dyad disruption pathway in a computationally feasible timescale.  We calculate an MPro dyad-open against dyad-closed free energy difference of 3.55 \u00b1 1.21kJ/mol, which is compensated by His41 imidazole-ligand interactions.

In addition, manual surveys are labor intensive. Novel methane detection technologies offer opportunities to further reduce emissions by quickly detecting the high-emitters, which account for a disproportionate fraction of total emissions. In this work, combinations of methane detection technologies were simulated in a tiered approach for facilities representative of the Permian Basin, a region with skewed emission rates and large numbers of high-emitters, which include sensors on satellites, aircraft, continuous monitors and Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) cameras, with variations on survey frequency, detection thresholds and repair times.

This was achieved in a two-step process involving (i) hydrometallation of a methylidene cycloalkane followed by (ii) intramolecular C\u2013C bond activation. While hydrometallation of methylidene cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane occurs for both Mg and Zn reagents, the C\u2013C bond activation step is sensitive to ring size. For Mg, both cyclopropane and cyclobutane rings participate in C\u2013C bond activation. For Zn, only the smallest cyclopropane ring reacts. These findings were used to expand the scope of catalytic hydrosilylation of C\u2013C \uf073-bonds to include cyclobutane rings. The mechanism of C\u2013C sigma-bond activation was investigated through kinetic analysis (Eyring), spectroscopic observation of intermediates, and a comprehensive series of DFT calculations, including Activation Strain Analysis. Based on our current understanding, C\u2013C bond activation is proposed to occur by beta-alkyl migration step. beta-Alkyl migration is more facile for more strained rings and occurs with lower barriers for Mg compared to Zn. Relief of ring strain is a key factor in determining the thermodynamics of C\u2013C bond activation, but not in stabilising the transition state for beta-Alkyl migration. Rather we ascribe the differences in reactivity to the stabilising interaction between the metal centre and the hydrocarbon ring-system, with the smaller rings and more electropositive metal (Mg) leading to a less destabilisation interaction energy as the transition state is approached. Our findings represent the first example of C\u2013C bond activation at Zn and provide detailed new insight into the factors at play in beta-alkyl migration at main group centres.", "date": "2022-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Bond Activation; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions; Main Group Chemistry (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Binding of RBD caused the aptamer to dissociate from the biotin-cDNA, making the cDNA available to initiate RCA on the magnetic beads. Detection of RBD was achieved using a dual signal output. For fluorescence signaling, the RCA products were mixed with a dsDNA probe labelled with fluorophore and quencher. Hybridization of the RCA products caused the dsDNA to separate to emit fluorescence. To generate easily detectable UV-vis absorbance signal, the RCA amplification was extended to produce DNA flower to encapsulate horseradish peroxidase (HRP).

Despite continuous improvements in the field, a subset of the outputs that sequence-based de novo generators produce cannot be progressed due to errors. Here, we propose to fix these invalid outputs post hoc. In similar tasks, transformer models from the field of natural language processing have been shown to be very effective. Therefore, here this type of model was trained to translate invalid Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) into valid representations. The performance of this SMILES corrector was evaluated on four representative methods of de novo generation: a recurrent neural network (RNN), a target-directed RNN, a generative adversarial network (GAN), and a variational autoencoder (VAE). This study has found that the percentage of invalid outputs from these specific generative models ranges between 4 and 89 %, with different models having different error type distributions. Post hoc correction of SMILES increases model validity, with the SMILES corrector fixing 35 to 80 % of invalid model outputs. While, corrector models trained with one error per input sequence alter 60 to 90 % of invalid inputs, a higher performance was obtained for transformer models trained with multiple errors per input. In this case, the best model was able to correct 60 to 95 % of invalid generator outputs. Further analysis showed that these fixed molecules are comparable to the correct molecules from the de novo generators with regard to novelty and similarity. Additionally, the SMILES corrector can also be used to expand the amount of interesting new molecules within the targeted chemical space. Introducing different errors into existing molecules yields novel analogs with a uniqueness of 39 % and a novelty of approximately 20 %. The results of this research demonstrate that SMILES correction is a viable post hoc extension and can enhance the search for better drug candidates.", "date": "2022-11-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we use rheology experiments and density functional theory calculations to characterize the stability of coordination complexes and establish the binding hierarchy of histamine and imidazole with Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+. We find that the binding hierarchy is driven by the specific affinity of the metal ions to different coordination states, which can be macroscopically tuned by changing the metal-to-ligand stoichiometry of the metal-coordinated network.

These properties are essential to enable long shelf lives, reduce refrigeration usage, mitigate food waste, and increase food accessibility. However, ML f film production processes generate large amounts of plastic waste that cannot be mechanically recycled. Recently, we have proposed a process, which we call solvent-targeted recovery and precipitation (STRAP), that enables the separation and recycling of the constituent polymers of ML films. This technology uses a series of solvent washes that selectively dissolve and precipitate target polymers. Quantifying the environmental benefits of STRAP over virgin resin production is essential for the commercial deployment of this technology. This work uses life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to evaluate these impacts in terms of carbon footprint, energy use, water use, and toxicity. We analyze three STRAP process variants that use anti-solvent and temperature-driven precipitation and that target different types of ML films. Our analysis reveals that a couple of STRAP process variants can provide environmental benefits over virgin film production and also provides valuable insight into the key components of ML films and of the STRAP process that are responsible for the highest impacts.

Kiddle; Pietro Li\u00f2", "abstract": "High-throughput screening (HTS), as one of the key techniques in drug discovery, is frequently used to identify promising drug candidates in a largely automated and cost-effective way. One of the necessary conditions for successful HTS campaigns is a large and diverse compound library, enabling hundreds of thousands of activity measurements per project. Such collections of data hold great promise for computational and experimental drug discovery efforts, especially when leveraged in combination with modern deep learning techniques, and potentially leading to improved drug activity predictions and cheaper and more effective experimental design. However, existing collections of machine learning ready public datasets do not exploit the multiple data modalities present in real-world HTS projects. Thus, the largest fraction of experimental measurements, corresponding to hundreds of thousands of 'noisy' activity values from primary screening, are effectively ignored in the majority of machine learning models of HTS data.\n\nTo address these limitations, we introduce MF-PCBA (Multi Fidelity PubChem BioAssay), a curated collection of 60 datasets that includes two data modalities for each dataset, corresponding to primary and confirmatory screening, an aspect that we call multi-fidelity. Multi-fidelity data accurately reflects real-world HTS conventions, and presents a new, challenging task for machine learning: the integration of low and high-fidelity measurements through molecular representation learning, taking into account the orders-of-magnitude difference in size between the primary and confirmatory screens. Here, we detail the steps taken to assemble MF-PCBA, in terms of data acquisition from PubChem and the filtering steps required to curate the raw data. We also provide an evaluation of a recent, deep-learning based method for multi-fidelity integration across the introduced datasets, demonstrating the benefit of leveraging all HTS modalities, and a discussion in terms of the roughness of the molecular activity landscape. In total, MF-PCBA contains over 16.6 million unique molecule-protein interactions.

To enhance the efficiency of TADF-related processes of the emitter, we targeted a molecular design that would introduce a large number of intermediate triplet states between the lowest energy excited triplet (T1) and singlet (S1) excited states. Here, we introduce an oligomer approach using repetitive donor-acceptor units to gradually increase the number of quasi-degenerate states. In our design, benzonitrile (BN) moieties were selected as acceptors that are connected together via the amine donors, acting as bridges to adjacent BN acceptors. To preserve the photoluminescence emission wavelength across the series, we employed a design based on an ortho substitution pattern of the donors about the BN acceptor that induces a highly twisted conformation of the emitters, limiting the conjugation. Via a systematic photophysical study we show that increasing the oligomer size allows for enhancement of the intersystem crossing and reverse intersystem crossing rates. We attribute the increasing intersystem crossing rate to the increasing number of intermediate triplet states along the series, confirmed by the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory. Overall, we report an approach to enhance the efficiency of TADF-related processes without changing the blue photoluminescence colour.", "date": "2022-11-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Obtaining EIS data is simple when modern electrochemical workstations are used; however, analyzing EIS spectra is still a considerable quandary. The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. Nevertheless, DRT deconvolution underlies an ill-posed optimization problem, which is often solved by ridge regression (RR). RR\u2019s accuracy strongly depends on the choice of the regularization level as encapsulated in the parameter \u03bb. In this article, five cross-validation methods (i.e., generalized cross-validation, modified generalized cross-validation, robust generalized cross-validation, re-im cross-validation, and k-fold cross-validation) and the L-curve method are studied for the selection of \u03bb. A hierarchical Bayesian DRT (hyper-\u03bb) deconvolution method is also analyzed, whereby \u03bb_0, a parameter analogous to \u03bb, is obtained through cross-validation. The analysis of synthetic data suggests that the values of \u03bb selected by generalized and modified generalized cross-validation are the most accurate among the methods studied. Furthermore, synthetic EIS spectra show that the hyper-\u03bb approach outperforms optimal RR when \u03bb_0 is obtained by generalized and modified generalized cross-validation. This research is expected to foster additional research on the central topic of regularization level selection for DRT analysis. This article not only explores various cross-validation methods, but also provides, through pyDRTtools, an implementation that may serve as a starting point for future research.", "date": "2022-11-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In parallel to these advancements, another rapidly growing area is the self-assembly of these colloidal nanoparticles into greater periodic arrangements. Firstly, the organization of nanoparticles into ordered structures is important for obtaining functional interfaces that extend or even amplify the intrinsic properties of the constituting nanoparticles at a larger scale. The synthesis of large-scale interfaces using complex or intricately designed nanostructures as building blocks, requires highly controllable self-assembly techniques down to the nanoscale. In certain cases, for example, when dealing with plasmonic nanoparticles, the assembly of the nanoparticles further enhances their properties by coupling phenomena. In other cases, the process of self-assembly itself is useful in the final application such as in sensing and drug delivery, amongst others. In view of the growing importance of this field, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in the field of self-assembly of different nanostructures and their applications. For clarity, the self-assembled nanostructures are classified into two broad categories: finite clusters/patterns, and infinite films. Different state-of-the-art techniques to obtain these nanostructures are discussed in detail, before discussing the applications where the self-assembly significantly enhances the performance of the process.", "date": "2022-11-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Aggregates and Assemblies; Multilayers; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

It was in 1992 that a Mobil Research group disclosed a method to produce silica particles having a regular network of pores with hexagonal and cubic symmetries. The method was proposed as based on a liquid-crystal 'templating' mechanism. Since the symmetries resulting from the templating of silica scaffolds are those observed in the mesophases of lyotropic liquid crystals, the Mobil Research group supposed the presence of a mesophase directly in a stage of the templating mechanism. Here we discuss the method as it was reported in 1992 and what is today defined as a true liquid-crystal templating approach.  It will be stressed that, in any case, the templating is a surfactant-assisted method,  that can be better defined as supramolecular templating method.

On the basis of the obtained configurations, we calculate the extended X-Ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectra rigorously based on the MD snapshots and compare in detail with other theoretical and experimental results available in the literature. We find our EXAFS spectra based on QM/MM MD simulations in good agreement with their experimental counterparts for the ions. Classical MD simulations for the ions lead to EXAFS spectra that agree equally well with the experiment when it comes to the oscillatory period of the signal, even though they differ from the QM/MM radial distribution functions extracted from the MD. The amplitude is, however, considerably overestimated. This suggests that to judge the reliability of theoretical simulation methods or to elucidate fine details of the atomistic dynamics of the solvent based on EXAFS spectra, the amplitude and not only the oscillatory period need to be considered. If simulations fail qualitatively, as does the classical MD for the aqueous halogen atoms, the resulting EXAFS will also be strongly affected in both oscillatory period and amplitude. The good reliability of QM/MM-based EXAFS simulations, together with clear qualitative differences in the EXAFS spectra found between halides and their atomic counterparts, suggests that a combined theory and experimental EXAFS approach is suitable for elucidating the nonequilibrium solvent dynamics in the photoionization of halides, and possibly also for electron transfer reactions in more complex systems.", "date": "2022-11-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Solvates; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nonetheless, elements of the underlying classical structure have effects on quantum results, an understanding of which may aid in the interpretation of wave functions and energies.

Recent studies have found that both HOMO/LUMO energy levels and energy gaps are important factors controlling the performance of MpPs photocatalysts. Since pure quantum chemistry methods consume a large amount of computational resources and cannot learn directly from previously accumulated data, in this study, we proposed a deep transfer learning approach to rapidly predict the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and energy gaps based on two quantum chemistry databases. To complement the open-source Porphyrin-based Dyes Database (PBDD), which contains porphyrin structures designed as photosensitizers, we curated a new database, the Metalloporphyrins and Porphyrins Database (MpPD), in which MpPs were specifically designed as potential photocatalysts. We also adapted two state-of-the-art chemical deep learning models to accommodate more complex systems of MpPs. The PorphyBERT model and PorphyDMPNN model, both pretrained with PBDD and fine-tuned with MpPD, performed satisfactorily in predicting HOMO/LUMO level and energy gap.

The target property was the impact sensitivity h_50 (cm) values quantified by drop-weight measurements. After a preliminary screening of 42 ML algorithms, four were selected based on the lowest root mean square errors: Extra Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost. The predicted h_50 values of molecules having very different sensitivities for the four algorithms are in the range 19% - 28% compared to experimental data. The most important properties for predicting h_50 are the electron delocalization in the ring atoms and the polarization of the nitro groups with averaged weights of 39% and 35%, followed by the charge (16%) and number (10%) of nitro groups. A significant result is how the contribution of these properties to h_50 depends on its sensitivities: for the most sensitive explosives (h_50 up to ~ 50 cm), the four properties contribute to reducing h_50, and for intermediate ones (~ 50 cm \u2272 h_50  \u2272 100 cm) #NO_2 and \u2211\u2592\u3016Q_1 (NO_2)\u3017 contribute to increasing it and the other two properties to reducing it.

These screenings generate large amounts of data proportional to the size of the compound library used, which must be stored and filtered before visual analysis. As the size of compound libraries which can feasibly be screened grows, so do the challenges in result management and storage. Here we introduce Ringtail, a new Python tool in the AutoDock Suite for efficient storage and analysis of virtual screening data based on portable SQLite databases. Although Ring- tail is designed to work with AutoDock-GPU and AutoDock Vina out-of-the-box, its modular design allows for easy extension to support input file types from other dock- ing software, different storage solutions, and its incorporation into other applications. Ringtail\u2019s SQLite database output can dramatically reduce the required storage by selecting individual poses to store and by taking advantage of the relational database format. We observed disk usage reductions of between 36-46 fold compared to raw AutoDock-GPU DLG output for a 50-pose docking and, and more than 3 times more efficient than achievable by only the reduction of stored poses. Filtering times are also dramatically reduced, requiring minutes to filter millions of ligands.

In the gas phase, the O K-edge spectra of 2-propanol and acetone as well that of 2-propoxide considered as reaction intermediate, present no pre-edge peaks. Upon 2-propanol adsorption at the Co site of Co3O4 (001) surface, the O K-edge spectrum presents a distinct peak preceded by a bumb in the pre-edge region, both due to dipole transitions from O 1s to 2p states hybridized with Co 3d empty states. The formation of 2- propoxide leads to two distinct pre-edge peaks due to the increase of 3d empty states. A further increment of these pre-edge peaks is observed when acetone is formed and is rather ascribed to the new contributions of carbon 2p empty states in the transitions occurring in the pre-edge region. The changes observed in the pre-edge peak along the oxidation were correlated to the electronic configuration and hybridization of the cobalt atom directly bonded to alcohol. The variation of electron densities was also monitored for all surface cobalt atoms including the ones on which molecular and dissociated water are adsorbed. The PDOS analysis and crystal field theory showed that adsorption of 2-propanol and molecular water on the surface does not change the oxidation state of +3, while surface cobalt atoms bonded to OH groups have an oxi- dation state of +4.

One property is the electrochemical activity which limits the gate voltage (VG) that can be applied and therefore the maximum extent to which carriers can be modulated. A second property is electrolyte thickness, which sets the response speed of the EDL gate, and therefore the timescale over which the channel can be doped. Typical thicknesses are on the order of microns, but thinner electrolytes (nanometers) are needed for very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) both in terms of physical thickness and the speed that accompanies scaling. In this study, finite element modeling of an EDL-gated field-effect transistor (FET) is used to self-consistently couple ion transport in the electrolyte to carrier transport in the semiconductor, in which density of states, and therefore, quantum capacitance is included. The model reveals that 50 to 65% of the applied potential drops across the semiconductor, leaving 35 to 50% to drop across the two EDLs. Accounting for the potential drop in the channel suggests that higher carrier densities can be achieved at larger applied VG without concern for inducing electrochemical reactions. This insight is tested experimentally via Hall measurements of graphene FETs for which VG is extended from \u00b13 to \u00b16 V. Doubling the gate voltage increases the sheet carrier density by an additional 2.3\u00d710^13 cm^\u22122 for electrons and 1.4\u00d710^13 cm^\u22122 for holes without inducing electrochemistry. To address the need for thickness scaling, the thickness of the solid polymer electrolyte, polyethylene oxide (PEO):CsClO_4, is decreased from 1 \u03bcm to 10 nm and used to EDL- gate graphene FETs. Sheet carrier density measurements on graphene Hall bars prove that the carrier densities remain constant throughout the measured thickness range (10 nm\u22121 \u03bcm). The results indicate promise for overcoming the physical and electrical\nlimitations to VLSI while taking advantage of the ultrahigh carrier densities induced by EDL gating.", "date": "2022-11-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Nanodevices; Nanofabrication", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Aqueous flow batteries fully decouple power and energy elements and can thus easily be scaled, a prerequisite for cheap long-duration energy storage, but low energy density is generally considered a key limitation of the technology. To date, the role of this metric for grid-scale installations has not been quantified, a crucial step for guiding further development of this potential trillion-dollar market. Here, we analyze the footprint of forty-four MWh-scale battery energy storage systems via satellite imagery and calculate their energy capacity per land area in kWh m\u22122, demonstrating that energy density is not critical for such installations and that the importance of this metric for grid-scale batteries is heavily overstated in academia. We suggest that a unique advantage of aqueous flow batteries, due to their intrinsic safety and vertical scalability, is their ability to provide reliable power in space-restricted sites, and we show that even with current chemistries and modest assumptions about storage tank sizes and footprints, areal energy densities five times as high as with the average lithium-ion based system can be achieved.", "date": "2022-11-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We designed a 3D printed Omnidirectional Sheath-flow Enabled Microfluidics (OSEM) Device for producing mRNA-loaded LNPs that closely resemble the Moderna vaccine: we used the same lipid formulations to encapsulate mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The OSEM device is made of durable methacrylate-based materials that can support flow rates in the mL/min range and was fabricated by stereolithography (SLA), incorporating readily adaptable interfaces using commercial fluidic connectors. Two key features of the OSEM device are: 1) a 4-way hydrodynamic flow focusing region and 2) a staggered herringbone mixer (SHM). Superior to conventional planar fluid junctions, the 4-way sheath flow channel generates an evenly focused, circular center flow that facilitates the formation of LNPs with low polydispersity. Downstream, fluid mixing in the SHM is intensified by incorporating a zig-zag fluidic pathway to deliver high mRNA encapsulation efficiency. We characterized the mRNA-loaded LNPs produced in the OSEM device and showed that the enhanced 3D microfluidic structures enable a 5-fold higher throughput production rate (60 mL/min) of LNPs than commercial multi-thousand-dollar micromixers. The device produced LNPs of diameter less than 90 nm, with low polydispersity (2-8%) and high mRNA encapsulation efficiency (> 90%).

End-on bridging N2 complexes (\u00b5-N2) are key species in nitrogen fixation chemistry, but a lack of consensus on the seemingly simple task of assigning a Lewis structure for such complexes has prevented application of valence electron counting and other tools for understanding and predicting reactivity trends. The Lewis structures have traditionally been determined by comparing the experimentally observed NN distance to the bond lengths of free N2, diazene, and hydrazine. We introduce an alternative approach here, and argue that the Lewis structure should be assigned based on the total \u03c0-bond order in the MNNM core (number of \u03c0-bonds), which derives from the character (bonding or antibonding) and occupancy of the delocalized \u03c0-symmetry molecular orbitals (\u03c0-MOs) in MNNM. To illustrate this approach, the end-on bridging N2 complexes cis,cis-[(iPr4PONOP)MCl2]2(\u00b5-N2) (M = W, Re and Os) are examined in detail. Each complex is shown to have a different number of nitrogen\u2013nitrogen and metal\u2013nitrogen \u03c0-bonds, indicated as, respectively: WN\u2013NW, Re=N=N=Re and Os\u2013NN\u2013Os.

Herein, with the catalytic hydride reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) over gold nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts as a prototype reaction, the influence of delicate change of microenvironment of catalytic active site on the reaction kinetics of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) with the introduction of varied alkali-metal ion (AM+) salt, have been deeply investigated. We demonstrate that structural water (SW) adsorbed on Au NPs in the form of {OH-\u00b7H2O@Au NPs} is the real catalytic active sites (not alone Au NPs), and in the presence of lithium chloride (LiCl), it shows the best catalytic performance. In addition, the isotope labeling and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments evidences that, the reduction of 4-NP does not follow the classical Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) bimolecular mechanism, but an interfacial SW dominated electron and proton transfer mechanism. The proposed mechanism answers why the dissociation of O-H bond of water is the rate-determining step (RDS) of 4-NP reduction, and, counter-intuitively, the solvent water is the hydrogen source of final product 4-AP, instead of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reducer. Importantly, the co-existence of Li+ and Cl- ions synergistically stabilizes the transition state of reaction and accelerates the interfacial electron and proton transfer, consequently enhancing the reaction kinetics.

Ray tracing simulations coupled with color visualization and spectral analysis techniques are used to model, examine, and rationalize the iridescence generated for a range of micro-geometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres, under varying illumination conditions. An approach to deconstruct the observed iridescence and complex far-field spectral features into its elementary components and systematically link them to ray trajectories that emanate from the illuminated microstructures is demonstrated. The results are compared with experiments, wherein microstructures are fabricated with methods such as chemical etching, multiphoton lithography, and greyscale lithography. Microstructure arrays patterned on surfaces with varying orientation and size lead to unique color-traveling optical effects and highlight opportunities for how total internal reflection interference can be used to create customizable reflective iridescence.

Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) is an approach that accelerates the exploration of the conformational space of a system, and thus can be used to enhance the sampling of complex biomolecular processes. In parallel, the empirical valence bond (EVB) approach is a powerful approach for modeling chemical reactivity in biomolecular systems.

Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) shows great promise to circumvent this issue by generating high energy photons from incident lower energy photons. However, molecules that facilitate TTA-UC usually have poor water solubility, limiting their deployment in aqueous environments. To address this challenge, we leverage a nanoencapsulation method to fabricate water-compatible UC micelles, enabling on-demand UV photon generation deep into materials. We present two iridium-based complexes for use as TTA-UC sensitizers with increased solubilities that facilitate the formation of highly emissive UV-upconverting micelles.

The increased complexity has challenged the reliability of computational methods to accurately predict the relative energy between excited states as well as their nature.

BF.7 is more infectious than existing Omicron variants, and to date there are no specific therapeutic agents for this variant.\nMETHODS: The active compounds were collected by TCMSP, ETCM database and literature mining method, and the targets of the compounds were searched by Swiss Target Prediction and SUPERPRED database, while the targets of Omiron virus were collected by DisGeNET and GEO database, and then the intersecting targets were compared and analyzed. In this study, Swiss-Model was applied to construct the Spike RBD structure of Omicron variant BF.7 by replacing mutant amino acids into the Native Spike (S) structure, and the structural changes of Native S were compared. The four active compounds screened were docked with Omicron S protein and Omicron S-hACE2 complexes. To evaluate the structural stability of the complexes in a physiological environment, we also performed molecular dynamics simulations of the docked complexes and compared them to the control drug, chloroquine. The affinity of ligands and protein complexes was determined by free energy analysis using the MM-PBSA algorithm, and the structural changes of S proteins in combination with ligands were evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 12 mongolic medicines were screened and 310 active ingredient predictions were made, with a total of 55 genes overlapping with Omicron variants and 14 targets with the largest differences being conserved. Once these 14 targets were mapped to the active ingredients of 12 mongolic herbs, four more precise active ingredients were filtered out. Of these four phytochemicals, Berberine was the most potent inhibitor of Omicron S protein. In addition, molecular docking simulations revealed that Berberine can bind stably to Omicron S protein and the Omicron S-hACE2 complex. Using molecular dynamics simulations, Berberine was shown to be able to form a stable complex with Omicron S in a physiological environment with better results than the control drug chloroquine. Free energy analysis by the MM-PBSA algorithm and evaluation of S protein structural changes following ligand binding also demonstrated a higher affinity of Berberine for Omicron S compared to the other small molecule compounds.\nCONCLUSION: Berberine was found to have the most substantial inhibitory potential against Omicron VOC (BF.7) S protein and could be further investigated and developed as a potential inhibitor of Omicron.\n", "date": "2022-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Filling these data gaps experimentally is impossible so in-silico approaches and prediction are essential. Many existing models are however limited by assumptions (e.g. linearity and continuity) and small training sets.\n In this study we present a supervised direct classification model that connects molecular descriptors to toxicity. Categories can be either data-driven (using k-means clustering) or regulatory-defined. This was tested via 907 experimentally defined 96h LC50 values for acute fish toxicity. Our classification model explained ~90% of variance in our data for the training set and ~80% for the test set.  This strategy gave a 5-fold decrease in the incorrect categorization compared to a QSAR regression model. Our model was subsequently employed to predict the toxicity categories of ~32k chemicals. A comparison between the model-based applicability domain (AD) and the training set AD was performed, suggesting that the training set based AD is a more adequate way to avoid extrapolation when using such models.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is often used to validate the environmental potential of emerging technologies. Consequently, an increased number of ex-ante LCAs is expected in this field. However, a comprehensive description through paramterized modelling of life cycle inventories of distinc technological pathways, which is essential for transparency, has recently been missing from the international literature. To fill this gap, the present study analyzes three selected DAC technologies to create an inventory. Amine-based adsorption and absorption, as well as alkali-based absorption, were modelled. \nThe energy consumption of the operation, cradle-to-gate embodied energy, and sensitivity analysis based on parameter variations were carried out. The \u201ccradle-to-gate\u201d energy requirement of DAC often lies in the range or above the formation energy of CO2 (8.94 GJ energy can be obtained by formation of 1t CO2 from elementary C and O2). This indicates that theoretically more energy is required for capture, as can be obtained during the formation of CO2. Because energy has continuously growing economic and ecological value, this energy intensity of DAC implies that DAC might have important role in CCU to add directly measurable economic value. The parametrized model includes over 60 parameters, resulting in an array of possible energy and material requirements. The use of this wide range of figures in life cycle assessment sheds light on real opportunities for direct air capture in future product systems. The option of varying parameters enables the tailoring of the calculation to a particular situation or design. In this way, the calculator offers a common base for LCA, fostering an early stage analysis of DAC technologies.\n", "date": "2022-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Natural Resource Recovery; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The dehalogenation reaction that these two enzymes catalyze has been studied to determine its rate-limiting step (rls) for the last two decades now. As a result, it has been determined that HLDs can show different rate-limiting steps for individual substrates, and at this point we do not have a basis for any generalization in this matter. Therefore, in this work we aimed at gaining insights into the enzymatic dehalogenation of selected dibromo- and bromochloro- ethanes and propanes by LinB and DhaA using computational approach to determine whether defined structural similarities of the substrates result in a unified mechanism and the same rls. By predicting halogen binding isotope effects (BIEs) as well as computing interaction energy for each HLD-ligand complex the nature of the protein-ligand interactions has been characterized. Furthermore, C and Br kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) as well as the minimum free energy paths (MFEPs) were computed to investigate the chemical reaction for the selected systems. Accuracy of the approach and robustness of the computational predictions were validated by measuring KIEs on the selected reactions. Overall results strongly indicate that any generalization with respect to the enzymatic process involving various ligands in the case of DhaA is impossible, even if the considered ligands are structurally similar as those analyzed in the present study. Moreover, even small structural differences such as changing of one of the (non-leaving) halogen substituents may lead to significant changes in the enzymatic process and result in a different rls in the case of LinB.

The electrochemical and DFT results suggested that a concerted PCET mechanism via 4\u2019OH of trans-resveratrol proceeds, where the coplanarity of the two phenolic rings in the stilbene moiety linked by an ethylene bridge is essential for a successful O2\u2022\u2212 scavenging.", "date": "2022-11-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, the underlying structural and biophysical mechanisms for many MLGIs remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to design glycoconjugates that can potently target specific MLGIs for therapeutic intervention. Glycosylated nanoparticles have recently emerged as a powerful biophysical probe for MLGIs, although how nanoparticle shape affects MLGI mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Herein, we have prepared fluorescent quantum rods (QRs), densely coated with \uf061-1,2-manno-biose ligands (denoted as QR-DiMan), as a new multifunctional probe to investigate how scaffold geometry affects the MLGI of a pair of closely-related, important tetrameric viral receptors, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. We have previously shown that a DiMan-capped spherical quantum dot (QD-DiMan) gives weak crosslinking interactions with DC-SIGNR but strong simultaneous binding with DC-SIGN. Against the elongated QR scaffold, DC-SIGN retains a similarly strong simultaneous binding of all four binding sites with a single QR-DiMan (apparent K_d ~0.5 nM, ~1.8 million fold stronger than the corresponding monovalent binding), while DC-SIGNR is able to achieve both weak crosslinking and strong individual binding interactions, resulting in a larger binding affinity enhancement than that with QD-DiMan. S/TEM analysis of QR-DiMan-lectin assemblies reveals that DC-SIGNR\u2019s different binding modes arise from the different surface curvatures of the QR scaffold. The glycan display at the spherical ends present too high a steric barrier for DC-SIGNR to bind with all four binding sites, thus it crosslinks between two QR-DiMan to maximize binding multivalency, whereas the more planar character of the cylindrical center allows the glycans to bridge all binding sites in DC-SIGNR. This work thus establishes glycosylated QRs as a powerful new biophysical probe for MLGIs, not only to provide quantitative binding affinities and binding modes, but also to demonstrate the specificity of multivalent lectins in discriminating different glycan displays dictated by the scaffold curvature. This work thus highlights the importance of nano-scaffold shape on MLGIs.", "date": "2022-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The electronic ground state of the cation is prepared by resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization of neutral bromobenzene (BrBz) and probed by x-rays produced by high-harmonic generation (HHG). Replacing one of the hydrogen atoms in benzene with a bromine atom shifts the transition from the 1sC* orbital of the carbon atom (C*) bonded to bromine by ~1 eV to higher energy in the x-ray spectrum compared to the other carbon atoms (C). The x-ray absorption spectra of neutral BrBz reveals the influence of the bromine atom on the x-ray absorption spectrum due to the 1sC* orbital, while the influence of the bromine atom on the cation spectrum is even more prominent. The  x-ray spectrum of the cation is dominated by two relatively intense transitions, the 1sC\u2192 \u03c0* and the 1sC*\u2192 \u03c3*(C*-Br), where the second transition is enhanced relative to the neutral BrBz. In addition, a doublet peak shape for these two transitions is observed in the experiment. The 1sC\u2192 \u03c0* doublet peak shape arises due to the spin coupling of the unpaired electron in the partially vacant \u03c0 orbital (from ionization) with the two other unpaired electrons resulting from the transition from the 1sC core orbital to the fully vacant \u03c0* orbitals. The 1sC*\u2192 \u03c3* doublet peak shape results from several transitions involving \u03c3* and vibrational C*-Br mode activation following the UV ionization, which demonstrates the impact of the C*-Br bond length on the core-valence transition as well as the relaxation geometry of BrBz+.

Herein, we elucidate a novel abiotic mechanism by which RNA, but not DNA, degrades upon adsorption to surfaces of iron (oxyhydr)oxides such as goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH) that are abundant in soils and sediments. Upon adsorption to goethite, both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA hydrolyzed on the timescale of hours under environmentally relevant physicochemical conditions. The reaction products were consistent with iron present in goethite acting as a Lewis acid to accelerate non-selective hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds comprising the RNA backbone. In contrast to well-established acid- or base-catalyzed RNA hydrolysis in solution, mineral-catalyzed hydrolysis was fastest at circumneutral pH, which allowed for both sufficient RNA adsorption and hydroxide concentration. We further confirmed that contact of the RNA with the mineral surface is necessary for hydrolysis to occur by demonstrating RNA degradation was inhibited by compact RNA conformation at elevated ionic strength and competitive adsorption with orthophosphate and organic matter. In addition to goethite, we observed RNA hydrolysis was also catalyzed by hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3), but not by aluminum-containing minerals (e.g., montmorillonite). Given the extensive adsorption of nucleic acids to environmental surfaces, we anticipate previously overlooked mineral-catalyzed hydrolysis of RNA may be prevalent particularly in iron-rich soils and sediments, which must be considered across biogeochemical applications of nucleic acid analysis in environmental systems.", "date": "2022-11-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the case of extractants that are also soluble in the aqueous phase, our recent studies of lanthanide ion-extractant complexes at the surface of aqueous solutions have suggested that ion-extractant complexation in the aqueous phase can hinder the solvent extraction process. Here, we investigate a similar phenomenon relevant to the separation of Co(II) and Ni(II) with supporting experiments that probe the separation of Fe(III) and Ni(II). X-ray fluorescence near total reflection and tensiometry are used to characterize the adsorption behavior of Co(II) and Ni(II) at the surface of aqueous solutions containing water-soluble extractants, either bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) or 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (HEHEHP). Consistent with our earlier studies of lanthanides, we observe a comparable adsorption behavior of Co(II) and Ni(II) at the surfaces of both HDEHP and HEHEHP aqueous solutions in spite of the known preference for Co(II) under solvent extraction conditions. Comparison experiments that utilized the water-insoluble extractant di-hexadecyl phosphoric acid (DHDP), confined to a monolayer on the water surface, reveal that Co(II) is preferentially adsorbed to the surface, as expected. This preference for Co(II) is also supported by molecular dynamics simulations of the potential of mean force for the ions interacting with the soluble extractants in water. These results highlight the possibility that complexation of extractants and ions in the aqueous phase can hinder the desired selectivity in the solvent extraction of critical elements.

Identification of non-toxic alternatives has been hampered by lack of a detailed understanding of the mechanism of protection that 6PPD affords rubber compounds against ozone. Herein, we report high-level density functional theory studies into early steps of rubber and PPD ($p$-phenylenediamine) ozonation, identifying key steps that contribute to the antiozonant activity of PPDs. In this, we establish that our density functional theory approach can achieve chemical accuracy for many ozonation reactions, which are notoriously difficult to model. Using adiabatic energy decomposition analysis, we examine and dispel the notion that one-electron charge transfer initiates ozonation in these systems, as is sometimes argued. Instead, we find direct interaction between \\ce{O3} and PPD carbon atoms is kinetically accessible, and that this motif is more significant than interactions with PPD nitrogens. The former pathway results in a hydroxylated PPD intermediate, which reacts further with \\ce{O3} to afford 6PPD hydroquinone and, ultimately, 6PPDQ. This mechanism directly links the toxicity of 6PPDQ to the antiozonant function of 6PPD. These results have significant implications for development of alternative antiozonants, which are discussed.", "date": "2022-11-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Wastes; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Already at the two-body level, the density-based MBE clearly outperforms a conventional, energy-based embedded three-body expansion.

Several earlier stage compounds have been also reported to engage KRAS SII-P with other position 12 mutants, including G12D, G12S and G12R. A highly conserved water molecule exists in the KRAS SII-P, linking the Thr58 of switch-II and Gly10 of beta1-sheet. This conserved water is also present in the co-crystal structures of most of the disclosed small-molecule inhibitors but is only displaced by a handful of SII-P binders. Here we evaluated the conserved water molecule energetics by the WaterMap for the SII-P binders with publicly disclosed structures and studied the water behavior in the presence of selected inhibitors by microsecond timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two water models (total simulation time of 120 \u03bcs). Our data reveals the high-energy nature of this hydration site when co-existing with a SII-P binder, and that there is a preference for a single isolated hydration site in this location within the most advanced compounds. Furthermore, the water displacement is suboptimal and only achieved with a few disclosed compounds.

Depending on the nature of the nucleophile, a broad variety of products can be obtained, but reaction pathways are difficult to probe experimentally due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the \u03c9B97X-D/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // \u03c9B97X-D/ aug-cc-pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, this study provides the first comprehensive picture of the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. These reactions are prototypical of the reactions of sulfur with other strong nucleophiles including carbon-based systems, and are important for the titration and detection of elemental sulfur in complex media. We first demonstrate that from the two mechanisms proposed more than 60 years ago, the Foss-Bartlett hypothesis is the most likely nucleophilic decomposition pathway for polysulfide intermediates containing good leaving groups. Importantly, we find that unimolecular decomposition pathways, either cyclizative or not, have the lowest activation barriers for most polysulfide intermediates. This indicates that such intermediates are fleeting in solution as they rapidly decompose even without an external nucleophile. Other bimolecular decomposition pathways were also located, including scrambling reactions and attack on thiosulfoxides, which are less likely to intervene as they require larger concentrations of highly-reactive intermediates. Overall, our results indicate that for long polysulfides intramolecular cyclization is the most favorable decomposition pathway. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition and nucleophilic attack can be expected, in addition to scrambling pathways if the concentration of nucleophile is low. Overall, this work highlighted the various pathways available for polysulfide decomposition, allowing the study of polysulfide reactivity in more complex settings such as organic transformations or biochemical pathways.", "date": "2022-11-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In drug discovery and design process, conceptualizing protein-ligand binding is a major problem. Targeting this problem through computational methods is beneficial in order to substantially reduce the resource and time requirements for the overall drug development process. One way of addressing protein-ligand docking is to model it as a search and optimization problem. There have been a variety of algorithmic solutions in this respect. However, there is no ultimate algorithm that can efficiently tackle this problem, both in terms of protein-ligand docking quality and speed. This argument motivates devising new algorithms, tailored to the particular protein-ligand docking scenarios. To this end, this paper reports a machine learning-based approach for improved and robust docking performance. The proposed set-up is fully automated, operating without any expert opinion or involvement both on the problem and algorithm aspects. As a case study, an empirical analysis was performed on a well-known protein, Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), with 1428 ligands. For general applicability, AutoDock 4.2 was used as the docking platform. The candidate algorithms are also taken from AutoDock 4.2. Twenty-eight distinctly configured Lamarckian-Genetic Algorithm (LGA) are chosen to build an algorithm set. ALORS which is a recommender system-based algorithm selection system was preferred for automating the selection from those LGA variants on a per-instance basis. For realizing this selection automation, molecular descriptors and substructure fingerprints were employed as the features characterizing each target protein-ligand docking instance. The computational results revealed that algorithm selection outperforms all those candidate algorithms. Further assessment is reported on the algorithms space, discussing the contributions of LGA\u2019s parameters. As it pertains to protein-ligand docking, the contributions of the aforementioned features are examined, which shed light on the critical features affecting the docking performance.", "date": "2022-11-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We critically show that machine learning models can predict hydride thermodynamics and capacities with reasonable accuracy and that explainability analyses capture the competing trade-offs that arise from feature interdependence.

This enables the transformation of abundant feedstocks (arenes and N2) into N-containing organic compounds. The key N\u2013C bond forming step occurs upon partial silylation of N2, which then can accept the aryl fragment. However, the pathway through which reduction, silylation, and migration occurred was unknown. Here we describe synthetic, structural, magnetic, spectroscopic, kinetic, and computational studies that elucidate the steps of this transformation. N2 must be silylated twice at the distal N atom before aryl migration can occur, and sequential silyl radical and silyl cation addition is a kinetically competent pathway to a formally iron(IV) intermediate with an NN(SiMe3)2 ligand. It can be isolated at low temperature. Kinetic studies show its first-order conversion to the migrated product, and DFT calculations indicate a concerted transition state for migration. The electronic structure of the formally iron(IV) intermediate is examined using DFT and CASSCF calculations, which reveal contributions from iron(II) and iron(III) resonance forms with oxidized NNSi2 ligands.

This hemilability led to mononuclear bidentate complexes with both the aromatic and aliphatic sulfonium ligands. With the latter, due to its flexibility, dimeric structures of two different kinds were also allowed. The more rigid aromatic backbone adopted only a mononuclear bidentate mode, leading to a dynamic equilibrium between two asymmetric geometries.

In this study, we demonstrate the solution-phase synthesis of Co-N-C catalysts via the formation of CoNx moieties at metal vacancy-Nx (MVNx) sites on nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) templated by alkali metals, including sodium and potassium. The formation of CoNx sites is confirmed via a combined approach of various physical characterization techniques, elemental analysis, and electrochemical analysis.

Moreover, the correlation of CoNx content with ORR activity also depends on the type of sacrificial alkali metals, suggesting the role of sacrificial metals in creating MVNx sites with a diverse coordination environment.

Xu", "abstract": "In recent years, using an external magnetic field to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on magnetic catalysts has attracted great attention. It is an appealing topic, but with a puzzle where the increment comes from. The early theoretical work has predicted that the production of triplet dioxygen in OER can be facilitated by the spin-polarization effect in a single domain of magnetic catalysts. Recent progress has revealed that the M-O radical species is the key for promoting the triplet dioxygen formation, which is evident by the pH-dependent enhancement by magnetization. However, magnetization of a ferromagnetic material only changes its magnetic domain structure in the case of bulk ferromagnetic catalytic structures. It does not directly change the spin orientation of unpaired electrons in the material. Thus, where would be the OER enhancement coming from? The confusion further lies in that each magnetic domain is a small magnet and theoretically the spin-polarization promoted OER already occurs on these magnetic domains, and thus the enhancement should have been achieved without magnetization. Here, we demonstrate that the enhancement comes from the disappeared domain wall between magnetic domains. The proportion of domain wall occupied surface before magnetization determines the degree of enhanced OER by magnetization. Due to the spin-facilitated promotion effect, the OER on surface occupied by magnetic domains are more favourable than that on surface occupied by domain walls. Magnetization leads to the evolution of the magnetic domain structure, from a multi-domain one to a single domain one, in which the domain wall disappears. Consequently, the occupied by the domain wall is reformatted into one by a single domain, on which the OER follows the spin-facilitated pathways and thus the overall increment on the electrode occurs.

One step towards optimized photoelectrodes is nanostructuring of the metal oxide absorbers addressing the generally short minority charge carrier diffusion lengths. In this work, mesoporous CuFe2O4 (CFO) thin film photoanodes were prepared by a sol-gel chemistry-based dip-coating and soft-templating strategy. The mesoporous CFOs were fabricated with distinct pore morphologies in order to study the impact of pore ordering and surface structure on the photoelectrochemical properties. The degree of pore ordering and geometry was varied by using different structure-directing copolymer surfactants, which were poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)  (Pluronic\uf0e2 F-127), polyisobutylene-block-poly(ethyleneoxide) (PIB-PEO), and poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (Kraton liquid\uf0d4-PEO, KLE). The distinctly mesostructured CFO materials were characterised by means of scanning electron (SEM) and transmission electron microscopies (TEM), grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The structural and electronic properties were correlated with the photoelectrochemical water and sulfite oxidation scans. The non-ordered, Pluronic\uf0e2 F-127 templated CFO showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.2 mA/cm2 at 1.3 V vs. RHE for sulfite oxidation, but the least photocurrent density (1.5 \u00b5A/cm2) for water oxidation. This can be understood on the basis of the high surface area which promotes hole transfer to sulfite (a fast hole acceptor), but retards oxidation of water (a slow hole acceptor) due to electron-hole recombination at the defective surface. These results are confirmed by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). These yield the lowest surface recombination rate for the ordered KLE-based mesoporous CFO thin films, which retain spherical pore shapes at the surface resulting in fewer surface defects and thus in the highest water oxidation activity. Vibrating Kelvin probe surface photovoltage spectroscopy (VKP-SPS) on CFO films in contact with aqueous NaIO4 solution confirms these results and further reveals the presence of a detrimental Schottky junction at the FTO-CFO interface. Lastly, the electronic band diagram of the CFO photoanodes was investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy providing electronic structure arguments about the photoelectrochemical reactions the material is capable of driving. Post-use XPS data suggest that the concentration of hydroxyl groups, oxygen vacancies and adsorbed water/oxygen has indeed changed during photoelectrochemical operation, however the chemical state of the surface metal cations remained unaffected.", "date": "2022-11-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While these have been shown to offer increased modularity, speed and for some methods, even the inherent capacity for further functionalization (e.g., with small molecule cargo), most of these approaches lacked the ability to include a fragment crystallizable (Fc) modality. The Fc component of IgG antibodies offers effector function and increased half-life. Here we report a first-in-class disulfide re-bridging and click-chemistry-based method for the generation of Fc-containing, IgG-like mono- and bispecific antibodies. These are in the FcZ (FabX)-FabY format, i.e., two distinct Fabs and an Fc, potentially all from different antibodies, attached in a homogeneous and covalent manner. We have dubbed these molecules synthetic antibodies (SynAbs). We have constructed a bispecific T cell-engager (BiTE) SynAb, FcCD20-(FabHER2)-FabCD3, and have confirmed that it exhibits the expected biological functions, including the ability to kill HER2+ target cells in a co-culture assay with T cells.", "date": "2022-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here, we report two emitters, PhCz-O-DiKTa and PhCz-DiKTa, showing multi-resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF). By modulating the conjugation between the MR-TADF DiKTa emissive center and donor substituent, emission directly from the T2 state was for the first time observed in MR-TADF emitters. Single crystal and reduced density gradient (RDG) analyses reveal that the origin of the reduced observed concentration-quenching results from weak CH\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf070 and slipped \uf070\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf070 stacking interactions, which suppress nonradiative transitions.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from Bacteriophage P22 have been explored as biomimetic catalytic compartments. The in vivo co-encapsulation of enzymes is typically achieved via sequential fusion to the scaffold protein (SP), which results in an equimolar ratio of enzyme monomers. However, control over enzyme stoichiometry, which has been shown to influence pathway flux, is key to realising the full potential of P22 VLPs as artificial metabolons. Here we present a strategy for the stoichiometrically controlled in vivo co-encapsulation of cargo proteins within P22-based VLPs. Co-encapsulation was achieved via co-expression of cargo proteins with individual SP fusions using a dual plasmid system and verified for fluorescent protein cargo by F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer. This strategy was subsequently applied to a two-enzyme reaction cascade. L-homoalanine, an unnatural amino acid and chiral precursor to several drugs, can be synthesised from the readily available L-threonine by the sequential activity of threonine dehydratase and glutamate dehydrogenase. We find that scaffolding by this system has a profound impact on the activity of each enzyme and, using a purification strategy designed to isolate the range of particle forms that exist in vivo, that scaffolding of multimeric enzymes can be at unexpectedly high densities. This work demonstrates the controlled co-localisation of multiple heterologous cargo proteins in a P22-based nanoreactor and shows that careful consideration of loading densities of individual enzymes in an enzymatic cascade is required for the optimal design of synthetic metabolons.

To this end we have developed a new benchmark strategy and we have applied it to evaluate the predictions given by two wavefunction and several density functional theory (DFT) methods for the UV-vis absorption spectra of recently developed organic photocatalyst molecules. The novelty in our benchmark framework is that it focuses on evaluating the real-world applicability of computational methods and does not penalize errors that do not contribute to spectral shapes. We employ a spectral fitting process where the calculated excitations are convoluted with Gaussians using two parameters for broadening and wavelength scaling. This way, most methods can sufficiently reproduce the experimental spectra, but they differ in how much adjustment they require from the parameters. Overall, the double hybrids (with the notable exception of DSD-BLYP) are the best functionals that offer highest predictive power as they require practically no scaling. They are exceptionally good in estimating the excitation energies with almost 90% of the fitted spectra falling into the \u00b110% scaling window. This is the same level of accuracy as what the STEOM-DLPNO-CCSD correlated wavefunction method provides. In terms of cost efficiency, M06 emerges as the best functional. It compensates a slightly less consistent performance with lower computational demand and availability in nearly all computational codes. Therefore, we recommend the use of double-hybrid and M06 functionals for developing novel photocatalysts and we also highlight that M06 can be used as a black-box method even by those who are non-experts in computational chemistry.

Rheology, or the flow behaviour of CNC dispersion, is integrally tied to the processing and design of CNC-based products, thus it is important and warrants inquiry to carefully examine the relationship between rheology's flow behaviour and their attributes. In this paper, we report the most recent findings on the advanced application of CNC suspension, aerogel, and hydrogels.

Thus, improvements in the overall electrolysis process can contribute with this task. One of the problems that has been confronted for decades is the sluggishness of the electro-oxidation of water by preparing a myriad of materials with limited success. Therefore, instead of keeping on looking for materials to be applied for this reaction, one possibility is to change the water for another cheap substance, easier to be oxidized.\nIn this context, biomass-derived resources, like several alcohols and polyols, emerge as suitable candidates to be oxidized in the anodes of electrolyzers. This way, it is possible to concomitantly obtain high purity hydrogen at the cathode and value-added biomass derivatives at the anode.\nHerein, to avoid/decrease the use of noble metals, we prepare Ag/C catalyst and modify the Ag surface by different quantities of Pt. The catalyst containing only 0.5% of Pt reached half the electro-oxidation peak current of Pt/C. Besides, considering the current normalized by Pt mass, this material is around 80 times more active than Pt/C. Apart from the electrochemical results, we irradiated our materials with white light and observed an increased activity for the electro-oxidation of glycerol, showing the presence of a plasmonic effect.\nFTIR in situ and HPLC online showed that all the catalysts produced glycerate, lactate, glycolate and formate and that the selectivity do not change with the irradiation of light. The most important difference between the materials was that while Pt/C produce carbonate, this specie was not detected for Pt-Ag/C. Finally, the materials were also tested for the electro-oxidation of ethanol, showing that they are promising for the electro-oxidation of several alcohols/polyols.\nTherefore, this study paves the way for future optimization of Ag/C catalyst modified on its surface with different more active materials that must be afterward tested in real devices like, for instance, anion exchange membrane electrolyzers.\n", "date": "2022-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One important example is the development of energy decomposition analysis (EDA) to reveal the physical driving forces behind intermolecular interactions. In EDA, typically the interaction energy from a good-quality density functional theory (DFT) calculation is decomposed into multiple additive components that unveil permanent and induced electrostatics, Pauli repulsion, dispersion, and charge-transfer contributions to non-covalent interactions. Herein, we formulate, implement and investigate decomposing the forces associated with intermolecular interactions into the same components. The resulting force decomposition analysis (FDA) is potentially useful as a complement to the EDA to understand chemistry, while also providing far more information than an EDA for data analysis purposes such as training physics-based force fields. We apply the FDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs) to analyze interactions of water with sodium and chloride ions as well as in the water dimer. We also analyze the forces responsible for geometric changes in carbon dioxide upon adsorption onto (and activation by) gold and silver anions. We also investigate how the force components of an EDA-based force field for water clusters, namely MB-UCB, compare to those from force decomposition analysis.", "date": "2022-11-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Revealing the numerical sparsity of the 4-index electron repulsion (ERI) tensor is central to achieving linear scaling in local correlation methods. For second order M\u00f8ller-Plesset theory (MP2), one of the simplest post-HF methods, only the $(ia|jb)$ ERIs are needed, coupling occupied orbitals $i,j$, and virtuals $a,b$. In this paper, we compare the numerical sparsity (called the \"ragged list representation\") and the low-rank sparsity of the $(ia|jb)$ ERI tensor. The ragged list requires only one set of (localized) virtual orbitals, and we find that the orthogonal valence virtual-hard virtual (VV-HV) set of virtuals originally proposed by Subotnik et al. gives the sparsest ERI tensor relative to 4 other good choices: projected atomic orbitals (PAOs), Boys localized virtuals, Pipek-Mezey localized virtuals, and Cholesky localized virtuals. To further compress the $(ia|jb)$ ERI tensor, the low-rank (pair-natural orbital) representation uses different sets of virtual orbitals for different occupied orbital pairs. Our results indicate that while the low-rank representation achieves significant rank reduction, it also requires more memory than the ragged list representation. An approximation (called the \"fixed sparsity pattern\") for solving the local MP2 equations using the numerically sparse ERI tensor is proposed and tested to be sufficiently accurate and to have highly controllable error. A low-scaling local MP2 algorithm based on the ragged list and the fixed sparsity pattern using this representation is therefore promising.", "date": "2022-11-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Bell", "abstract": "The development and characterization of active and selective catalysts is critical for the simulation and optimization of electrochemical synthesis of chemicals and fuels using renewable energy. The rate of electrochemical generation of a specific product as a function of electrode potential can be described by a Tafel equation, which depends on two parameters: the Tafel slope (or the related transfer coefficient) and the exchange current density. However, common methods for calculating Tafel slopes are subjective and limited by data insufficiency resulting from challenges associated with product quantification, and, as shown here, the effects of mass transport, bulk reaction occurring in the mass-transfer boundary layer, and the occurrence of competitive surface reactions. Errors in the Tafel slope extracted from experimental data can also lead to errors in the exchange current density estimation. To address these issues, we present a technique that leverages statistical learning methods informed by physics-based modeling to calculate kinetic parameters (the transfer coefficient and exchange current density) with quantified uncertainty. The method is applied to 21 sets of data for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO and H2 on Ag catalysts acquired under similar experimental conditions. We find that fitted values for the transfer coefficient and exchange current density do not converge to a unique set of values, and that there is an apparent correlation of these parameters; however, the most probable value of the exchange coefficient for CO and H2 formation correspond reasonably well with the DFT-predicted values of this parameter. While the system explored is relatively simple, the techniques developed can be used to evaluate the transfer coefficient and exchange current density for many other electrochemical processes.", "date": "2022-11-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This realization requires effective earth-abundant catalysts that facilitate making and breaking H\u2014H and H\u2014X bonds. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs), such as nickel phosphide, cobalt phosphide, and molybdenum phosphide, have been historically used as hydro-processing catalysts in the petroleum industry, enabling critical hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions. Over the past two decades, TMPs have been attracting extensive attention for applications in energy conversion due to their exceptional activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The exceptional HER activity of certain TMPs has been attributed to their nearly ideal H binding energy (HBE), similar to Pt, as deduced by first-principles calculations. In contrast to Pt and other noble metals, where HER and the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activities are usually correlated, TMPs are usually inactive for HOR. This challenges the applicability of HBE theory to describe activity trends for H2 electrocatalysis on TMPs. In this viewpoint, we discuss the structural complexity of TMPs and its impact on the formation of adsorbed H (Had) and catalysis. In light of this we discuss the validity of HBE theory on TMPs and whether a single value of HBE is sufficient to describe TMP activity trends. Lastly, we propose that the presence of diverse adsorption sites on TMP surfaces can be leveraged to design selective and efficient hydrogenation and electrochemical reduction reactions beyond HER.", "date": "2022-11-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Cu is the only material known to produce multi-carbon (C2+) products with appreciable selectivity. However, the generation of C2+ products compete with the formation of C1 products and the reduction of H2O to hydrogen. Here, we tuned the activity of H2O from 0.97 to 0.47 by using a NaClO4-based H2O-in-salt-electrolyte. Commercial Cu-nanoparticle electrodes evaluated in pH 9 NaClO4 with a H2O activity of 0.66 achieved a Faradaic Efficiency of ~ 73% for C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol, and propanol) with a C2+ partial current density of \u2212110 mA cm\u20132 at \u20130.88 vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode. Furthermore, we were able to modulate the C2+/C1 ratios between 1 to 20 by altering only the H2O activity, demonstrating unrivaled tunability between C1 and C2+ products. Analysis of the Tafel slopes and reaction orders on model Cu electrodes revealed that the mechanism for forming C2 products was unchanged across a wide range of H2O activities, while C1 products and H2 had mechanisms which changed as the activity of H2O was lowered. Therefore, we can conclude that protons are part of the rate-determining step for the formation of C1 products, but not C2 products.  We have demonstrated that tuning the activity of H2O in an aqueous solvent is a powerful new guiding principle for improving the reduction of CO2 to C2 and C3 products.", "date": "2022-11-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Chemical Kinetics; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, due to their biochemical plasticity, plants can adjust their metabolism to ensure survival under changing environmental conditions. In the most comprehensive and straightforward way these metabolic shifts can be addressed by the untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach. However, although this methodology is well-established for cadmium-related responses, comprehensive metabolomics studies of Zn-induced metabolic shifts are still missing. Therefore, here we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics study of Zn2+-induced stress responses in amaranth. Thereby, 419 metabolites could be annotated and 144 of them were unambiguously identified. The metabolic shifts were organ-specific and more pronounced in roots. The most of the responsive metabolites were up-regulated and dominated with sugars and, to a lesser extent, TCA-related organic acids (a total of 51 and 41, respectively) that could be attributed to their involvement in osmoregulation, ROS scavenging and complexation of Zn2+ ions. Galactose was the most Zn2+-responsive root sugar that indicated its possible role in Zn2+ ion binding to the root cell walls. A 59-fold increase of gluconate content in roots clearly indicated its involvement in Zn2+ chelation. A high Zn2+\u2013induced up-regulation of salicylic acid in roots and shoots suggested a key role of this hormone in the activation of Zn2+ stress tolerance mechanisms. Thus, our study provides the first insight in the general trends in Zn-induced biochemical rearrangements and main adaptive metabolic shifts in A. caudatus plants.", "date": "2022-11-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Feed; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We compare the behavior of free electron dynamics within the bandgap of TiO2 and upon generating them across the interface with adsorbing organic dyes. This comparison shows that the main driving force of dramatic charge recombination of photogenerated charges is the presence of hole within the band-gap of TiO2 or close to the interface of TiO2. Once, the hole is far from the TiO2 surface, the electron trapping process is hindered and almost 100% of photogenerated charges can live up till nanoseconds.

In this study, we combined uncertainty- aware GNN potentials and enhanced sampling to investigate the reactive process of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at Au(100)-water interface. By using a well-established active learning framework based on CUR matrix decomposition, we can evenly sample equilibrium structures from MD simulations and non-equilibrium reaction intermediates that are rarely vis- ited during the reaction. The trained GNNs have shown excep- tional performance in terms of force prediction accuracy, the ability to reproduce structural properties, and the low uncer- tainties when performing MD and metadynamics simulations. Furthermore, the collective variables employed in this work en- ables an automatic search of reaction pathways and provide a detailed understanding towards the ORR reaction mechanism on Au(100).

These represent the first reported crystalline semiconductors found in the Cu-Sn-O or Cu-Ti-O chemical systems (and not currently predicted within any materials databases), with their kinetic stabilization requiring a relatively low reaction temperature of ~475\u00b0C.  Both phases crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system in space group C2/c, exhibiting edge-shared hexagonal \u2018MO3\u2019 (M = Sn or Ti) layers that also contain octahedrally-coordinated Li(I)/Cu(I) cations.  These layers are bridged by linearly-coordinated Cu(I) cations.  Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm the +1 oxidation state of the copper cations.  The optical band gaps were found to be indirect and to significantly redshift with Cu(I) content, down to ~2.31 eV for I and ~1.46 eV for II. Electronic structure calculations show the decreased band gaps can be attributed to a higher-energy valence band derived from the filled 3d10 orbitals of the Cu(I) cations, which most notably arise from the octahedrally-coordinated Cu(I) cations within the layers.  Total energy calculations reveal an increasing metastability with respect to decomposition to Cu2O and SnO2 or TiO2 as a result of occupation of the intralayer sites by Cu(I) cations.  In both phases, their edge-shared hexagonal layers lead to highly-dispersive conduction bands and small electron effective masses of ~0.51 me for I and ~0.41 me for II.

It is often assumed that organic radicals are anchored to the gold electrodes by designated linker thiol groups, with the radical substituents far from the electrodes. However, the interaction between a radical substituent and gold, in addition to the functional groups designed for anchoring the molecule, could influence the interaction between the whole molecule and the surface. Although some relevant experiments have been reported, the findings are inconsistent. To elucidate a possible influence, we discuss the interaction between a commonly used nitroxyl radical, (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO), with gold electrode surfaces by density functional theory methods, combined with empirical dispersion corrections. Within the uncertainty inherent in this methodology, our results suggest that the interaction between TEMPO and gold is made up of two competitive and complementary contributions: direct binding between the nitroxyl and gold adatoms, and dispersion interactions between bulky methyl groups and the surface (which is more pronounced for clean Au(111) surfaces but also prevents direct binding in case). Importantly, the overall interaction is not negligible and is even comparable to some commonly used anchoring groups (e.g., amino groups).

The agents show high photocytotoxicity upon irradiation with light and low dark toxicity in different cancer cell lines in 2D culture as well as in 3D multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTSs). The ratio of dark to light toxicity (phototoxic index, PI) of these agents reaches striking values exceeding 830\u2019000 after irradiation with energetically low doses of light at 630 nm. The oxygen-dependent mechanism of action (MOA) of established photosensitizers (PSs) hampers effective clinical deployment of these agents.

To circumvent this drawback we herein conducted in-depth analyses of the origins of structural degradations occurring in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 electrodes upon long cycling. Vanadium dissolution with associated parasitic reactions is identified as one of the major reasons for cell failure.

The concentration profiles of both TFSI anions and water are found to be sigmoidal, in agreement with an increasing surface tension as a function of concentration, both being typical of a negative adsorption mechanism. More striking, however, is the length at which the concentration profiles extend, ranging from 11 to 2 \uf06dm with increasing concentrations, compared to a few nanometers for ITIES. We thus reveal that unlike ITIES, salt-salt ABSs do not have a molecularly sharp interface but rather form an interphase with a gradual change of environment from one phase to the other.

This work develops a radical functionalization of benzylic oxetanes and azetidines using visible light photoredox catalysis to prepare 3-aryl-3-alkyl substituted derivatives and assesses the influence of ring strain and heterosubstitution on the reactivity of small-ring radicals. 3-Aryl-3-carboxylic acid oxetanes and azetidines are suitable precursors to tertiary benzylic oxetane/azetidine radicals which undergo conjugate addition into activated alkenes. We compare the reactivity of oxetane radicals to that of other common benzylic systems. Computational studies indicate that reversible Giese additions of non-strained benzylic radicals into acrylates result in low yields and radical dimerization. Benzylic radicals that are part of a strained ring, however, are both less stable and more \ud835\udf0b-delocalized, decreasing dimer formation and increasing Giese product formation. Oxetane substitution, in particular, results in high product yields due to ring strain and Bent\u2019s rule rendering the Giese addition irre-versible. Mechanisms for the formation of side products observed with different substrates are proposed based on experi-mental and computational evidence.", "date": "2022-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Hereby we developed a targeted photodynamic approach to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by engineering a genetically encoded photosensitizer (SOPP3) to a diverse list of antibodies targeting the WT spike protein, including human antibodies isolated from a 2003 SARS patient, potent monomeric and multimeric nanobodies targeting RBD, and non-neutralizing antibodies (non-NAbs) targeting the more conserved NTD region.

Of the two-dozen acidic sites we extensively examined, only one aqua group from the tri-sulfated MOF-808 Zr6 node exhibits strong enough acidity to produce a dimerization barrier consistent with the experiment.

Here, we combine mixed-reference spin-flip time-dependent density-functional theory (MRSF-TDDFT) with electrostatic embedding QM/MM using electrostatic potential fitting (ESPF) atomic charges, as a strategy to accurately and efficiently describe the electronic structure of chromophores polarized by an electrostatic medium. In particular, we develop analytic expressions for the energy and gradient of MRSF/MM based on the ESPF coupling using atom-centered grids and total charge conservation. We apply this methodology to the study of solvation effects on thymine photochemistry in water and thymine dimers in DNA. In the former, the combination of trajectory surface hopping (TSH) non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) with MRSF/MM remarkably revealed the accelerated deactivation decay pathways, which is consistent with the experimental decay time of ~ 400 fs. The enhanced hopping rate can be explained by the preferential stabilization of corresponding conical interactions due to their increased dipole moments. Structurally, it is a consequence of characteristic methyl puckered geometries near the conical intersection region. For the thymine dimer in B-DNA, we found new photochemical pathways through conical intersections that could explain the formation of cyclobutadiene dimers and 6-4 photoproducts.", "date": "2022-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Due to the large amount of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding of cellulose, it is insoluble in general solvents, which severely limits the conversion and utilization of cellulose. Ionic liquids with lower melting point and lower viscosity show strong solubility to cellulose, so they have been widely used for cellulose pretreatment in recent years. Exploring the relationship between the structure of ionic liquids and their solubilization properties for cellulose is necessary to design new efficient ionic liquids. The wide variety of ionic liquids and the complex structure of cellulose have led to slow progress in the study of cellulose solubilization mechanisms in ionic liquids. In this paper we will use a coarse-grained force field approach to simplify the all-atomic molecular mechanics model of ionic liquids to quickly simulate the dissolution process of cellulose in ionic liquids with less computational resources.", "date": "2022-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Rasmussen; Diana S.  Christensen; Jan H.

We show that the Crippen logP model (J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1999, 39, 868) provides an excellent benchmark for atomic attribution/heatmap approaches, especially if the ground truth heatmaps can be adjusted to reflect the molecular representation. The \u201catom attribution from finger prints\u201d-method developed by Riniker and Landrum (J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2013, 5, 43) gives atomic attribution heatmaps that are in reasonable agreement with the atomic contribution heatmaps of the Crippen logP model for most molecules, with average heatmap overlaps of up to 0.54. The agreement is increased significantly (to 0.75) when the atomic contributions are adjusted to match the fact that the molecular representation is fragment-based rather than atom-based (the finger print-adapted (FPA) ground truth vector). Most heatmaps and the corresponding FPA overlaps are relatively insensitive to the training set size and the results are close to converged for a training set size of 1000 molecules, although for molecules with low overlap some heatmaps change significantly. Using the \u201cremove an atom\u201d approach for graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) suggested by Matveieva and Polishchuk (J. Cheminform. 2021, 13, 41) we find an average heatmap overlap of 0.47 for the atomic contribution heatmaps of the Crippen logP model. Like the simpler attribution benchmarks for classification tasks that have come before it, this work sets the bar for regression tasks.", "date": "2022-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The immediate reaction environment of the electrocatalyst constitutes the electrical double layer (EDL) which extends a few nanometers into the electrolyte and screens the surface charge density. In this study, we resolve the species concentrations and potential profiles in the EDL of a CO<sub>2</sub>ER system by self-consistently solving the migration, diffusion and reaction phenomena using the generalized modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck (GMPNP) equations which include the effect of volume exclusion due to the solvated size of solution species. We demonstrate that the concentration of solvated cations builds at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) with increasing applied potential until the steric limit is reached. The formation of the EDL is expected to have important consequences for the transport of the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule to the catalyst surface. The electric field in the EDL diminishes the pH in the first 5 nm from the OHP, with an accumulation of protons and a concomitant depletion of hydroxide ions. This is a considerable departure from the results obtained using reaction-diffusion models where migration is ignored. Finally, we use the GMPNP model to compare the nature of the EDL for different alkali metal cations to show the effect of solvated size and polarization of water on the resultant electric field. Our results establish the significance of the EDL and electrostatic forces in defining the local reaction environment of CO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalysts.</p>", "date": "2019-08-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

In this work, we extend strategies on proteins and oligopeptides (e.g. Ramachandran plots of secondary structure) to study the correlated torsions in small molecules. We use a bivariate von Mises distribution to capture the correlations, and use it to constrain the search space. We validate the performance of our Bayesian optimization with prior knowledge (BOKEI) on a dataset consisting of 533 diverse small organic molecules, using a force field (MMFF94) and a semi empirical method (GFN2). We compare BOKEI with Bayesian optimization with expected improvement (BOA-EI), and a genetic algorithm (GA), using a fixed number of energy evaluations.

However, due to the many inherent drawbacks, there is a surge for new chemotherapeutic drugs. More specifically, the discovery of new drug candidates able to overcome severe side effects, the occurrence of resistance and the inefficacy toward metastatic tumours is highly desirable. In this work, we designed a new chemotherapeutic drug candidate against cancer, namely [Ru(DIP)2(sq)]PF6 (Ru-sq) (DIP = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline; sq = semiquinonate ligand). The aim was to combine the great potential expressed by Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes and the singular redox and biological properties associated to the catecholate moiety. Several pieces of experimental evidence (e.g., X-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance, electrochemistry) demonstrate that the semiquinonate is the preferred oxidation state of the dioxo ligand in this complex. The biological activity of Ru-sq was then scrutinised in vitro and in vivo, and the results highlight the tremendous potential of this complex as a chemotherapeutic agent against cancer. Ru-sq was notably found have a much higher cytotoxic activity than cisplatin on several cell lines (i.e. in the nanomolar range), and, contrary to cisplatin, to have mitochondrial disfunction as one of its modes of action. The multicellular targets of Ru-sq could potentially be the key to overcome one of the main drawbacks of cisplatin i.e. the occurrence of resistance. Moreover, Ru-sq exhibited impressing activity on Multi Cellular Tumour Spheroids (MCTS) model, leading to a growth inhibition of the tumour even 13 days after treatment (20 \u03bcM). Very importantly, using two different in vivo models, it could be demonstrated that this compound is extremely well-tolerated by mice and has a very promising activity, curing, in some cases, tumour-bearing mice.<br />", "date": "2019-08-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinorganic Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One increasingly popular technique is photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM), which utilizes the mechanical heterodyne signal detection between cantilever mechanical resonant oscillations and the photo induced force from light-matter interaction. So far, photo induced force microscopy has been operated in only one heterodyne configuration. In this article, we generalize heterodyne configurations of photoinduced force microscopy by introducing two new schemes: harmonic heterodyne detection and sequential heterodyne detection. In harmonic heterodyne detection, the laser repetition rate matches integer fractions of the difference between the two mechanical resonant modes of the AFM cantilever. The high harmonic of the beating from the photothermal expansion mixes with the AFM cantilever oscillation to provide PiFM signal. In sequential heterodyne detection, the combination of the repetition rate of laser pulses and polarization modulation frequency matches the difference between two AFM mechanical modes, leading to detectable PiFM signals. These two generalized heterodyne configurations for photo induced force microscopy deliver new avenues for chemical imaging and broadband spectroscopy at ~10 nm spatial resolution. They are suitable for a wide range of heterogeneous materials across various disciplines: from structured polymer film, polaritonic boron nitride materials, to isolated bacterial peptidoglycan cell walls. The generalized heterodyne configurations introduce flexibility for the implementation of PiFM and related tapping mode AFM-IR, and provide possibilities for additional modulation channel in PiFM for targeted signal extraction with nanoscale spatial resolution.</div>", "date": "2019-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Imaging; Microscopy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Dysregulation of PPIs are often key drivers of disease. To better understand the biophysical basis of such disease processes \u2013 and to potentially target them - it is critical to understand the molecular determinants of PPIs. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) facilitates the acquisition of large amounts of biochemical data by coupling selection with high throughput sequencing (HTS). The challenging and labor-intensive design and optimization of a relevant selection platform for DMS, however, limits the use of powerful directed evolution and selection approaches. To address this limitation, we designed a versatile new phage assisted continuous selection (PACS) system using our proximity-dependent split RNA polymerase (RNAP) biosensors with the aim of greatly simplifying and streamlining the design of a new selection platform for PPIs. After characterization and validation using the model KRAS/RAF PPI, we generated a library of RAF variants and subjected them to PACS and DMS. Our HTS data revealed that amino acid (aa) positions 66, 84, and 89 on RAF, key residues in the KRAS/RAF PPI, are intolerant to mutations. We also identified a subset of residues with broad aa substitution tolerance, aa positions 52, 55, 76, and 79. Due to the plug and play nature of RNAP biosensors, this method can easily be extended to other PPIs. More broadly, this, and other methods under development, supports the application of evolutionary and high-throughput approaches to bear on biochemical problems, moving towards a more comprehensive understanding of sequence-function relationships in proteins.", "date": "2019-08-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The investigation explores the feasibility of two different mechanisms: the first exploits a single phosphine complex and the second uses a two phosphines complex. The energy barriers involving a hydrogen transfer have a ten kcal.mol-1 higher than the one obtained through the single-phosphine mechanism. These results confirm the experimental hypothesis claiming that the departure of a phosphine is favourable at the beginning of the reaction which is the substitution of the catalyst model RuHCl(CO)(PMe3)2 by the real catalyst RuHCl(CO)(PCy3)2 shows no significant influence on the energetic barriers of hexene hydrogenation mechanism. The most important step of the mechanism is the kinetically determining step. The heterolytic cleavage of ruthenium-complexed H2 molecule leads to the generation of two Ru-H bonds and the oxidation of the ruthenium from Ru(II) to Ru(IV). The energy profile of this step is not relative to an elementary reaction because a shouldering is observed after the transition state. This results in an unusual gradient norm profile with five extrema. This is a direct consequence of the asynchronous nature of the different processes taking place during this step. In the case of the model complex RuHCl(CO)(IMes)(PMe3) with IMes = ( N , N '-bis( mesityl)imidazol-2-ylidene), an increase of the free enthalpy of activation is observed during the kinetically determining step, which is in agreement with the experimental work.", "date": "2019-08-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Human corneal stromal cells (hCSCs) were used as an exemplar as they have been observed to de-differentiate to an undesirable myo-fibroblastic phenotype when cultured by conventional 2D cell culture methods. Scaffolds were functionalised with a cell adherence peptide sequence GGG-YIGSR by thiol-ene chemistry to improve cell adherence and phenotype support. This was obtained by functionalising the thermo-responsive polymer with a thiol (PDEGMA/PDEGSH) by co-polymerisation. These incorporated thiols react with the norbornene acid functionalised peptide (GGG-YIGSR) under UV exposure. Presence of the thiol in the scaffold and subsequent peptide attachment on the scaffolds were confirmed by fluorescence labelling, ToF-SIMS and XPS analysis. The biocompatibility of the peptide containing scaffolds was assessed by the adhesion, proliferation and immuno-staining of hCSCs. Significant increase in hCSCs adherence and proliferation was observed on the peptide containing scaffolds. Immuno-staining showed maintained expression of the desired phenotypic markers ALDH, CD34 and CD105, while showing no or low expression of the undesired phenotype marker \u03b1-SMA. This desired expression was observed to be maintained after thermo-responsive passaging and observed higher when cells were cultured on PLA scaffolds with 10 wt% PDEGMA/4 mole% PDEGS-Nor-GGG-YIGSR. This paper describes the fabrication and application of a first generation, biocompatible thermo-responsive peptide conjugates fibrous scaffolds. The ease of fabrication, successful adherence and expansion of a therapeutically relevant cell type makes these scaffolds a promising new class of materials for the application of cell culture expansion platforms in the biomaterials and tissue engineering field.</p>", "date": "2019-08-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological Materials; Fibers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For material architectures derived from block copolymer (BCP) micelle co-assembly, the pore size is typically manipulated by changing the molecular weight corresponding to the pore-forming block.

An alternative method for pore size tuning involves the use of swelling agents, such as homopolymers (HPs), which selectively interact with the core-forming block to increase the micelle size in solution. In this work, poly(isobutylene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PIB-b-PEO) micelles were swollen with poly(isobutylene) HP in solution and co-assembled with aluminosilicate sol with the aim of increasing the resulting pore dimensions.

TiCl 4 coordinates at ambient temperature to form the indole complex ( 1 ), which undergoes isomerization to the indolenine ( 2 ). DFT calculations indicate that complex ( 2 ) is more stable than ( 1 ) by 6.4 kcal/mol. Upon warming to about 105\u00b0C, extrusion of HCl takes place with simultaneous orthometallation ( 3 ), yielding a metallacyclic complex ( 4 ). The mechanism of the orthometallation has been investigated by DFT, and the transition state c onfir med by IRC. At the elevated temperature the transition state ( 3 ) involves the synchronous transformation of four atoms, Ti, ortho C, H, and the apical Cl. The ortho C of the phenyl group acquires a partial positive charge through conjugation, forming a (C-H)\u03b4 + ...Cl\u03b4 - interaction, with a simultaneous elongation and breaking of the Ti-Cl bond, resulting in the formation of a Ti-C bond. The latter bond is created at the same time a Ti-Cl bond is breaking, and an HCl is being formed, as illustrated in transition state ( 3 ).

This \nvideo  game is designed as a  new \nkind  of  teaching \ntool  for  chemistry \nconcepts  and  as an assessment tool for domain-specific problem-solving competence, by applying a problem-solving model and the\nfactors of self-determination theory through game elements. These types of\nvideo games are designed not only to have fun\nand motivate students, but also to help the teachers and educators to assess\ntheir students according to their weaknesses and strengths in each particular\nphase of the competence. Thus, educators could improve their teaching\nstrategy or use the tools to improve weak areas. Based on this idea, we developed ALCHEMIST. ALCHEMIST targeted\nthe 9th-grade students in the German chemistry curriculum. The scientific\ncontent is about acids, bases, and indicators, and is designed and based on the\nproblem-solving model to access this competence of the students. The 3D game\nframework was chosen for this game\nsince it makes the game efficient, interactive and drives it into more virtual reality. The designing process was complicated, as it includes\nmultidisciplinary work across psychology, design,\nscientific content, development and programming, which makes it challenging. To cover these points, we followed\na game design model, adding some steps to cover the educational needs and the aim of the game.</p><p>In order to make the game more effective and\ninteractive, and to drive it into a more\nvirtual world, the 3D game framework was  chosen for this game since for this\nage group  a 3D educational game is\nexpected to be more effective (Gunter\net al, 2008; Terzidou et al, 2012) .\nMoreover, the use of avatars in the\n3D virtual environment establishes non-verbal communication (NVC) features,\nwhich can foster collaboration interactions, and enhance the student\u2019s ability\nto apply abstract knowledge later in reality (Dede, 1992; Tsiatsos and Terzidou, 2010). The log file provided shows the player points and gameplay path which indicates the performance levels for each\nproblem set. Also, it can help teachers to evaluate\neach particular phase of problem-solving competence. After the success\nof the development of our game-based theoretical background, it will be tested and validated by experts in chemistry education.  This validation process should examine if the\nproblem-solving model is correctly applied and test the significance of the\ngame design, scientific content and\nthe game\u2019s objective.</p><p>It may also be of\ninterest to develop such video games with scientific content and educational\nbackground in other fields.

The electrical properties were tuned by varying the poling field, the polar dopant, and the dopant concentration.

Through the careful tuning of these properties, we are able to achieve a maximum piezoelectric response of 153 pC/N\u2014considerably higher than most other reported flexible PEHs.

However, little is known on the mechanisms of dissociation when micelles encounter and respond to environmental changes. Using salt-jump, time-dependent, light scattering, the pathway of dissociation is observed in polyelectrolyte complex micelles that have complex cores and neutral coronas. The micelle dissociation kinetics appear to be a three-staged process, in good agreement with the scattering data. Using kinetic models of amphiphilic block copolymer micelles in polyelectrolyte complexation-driven micelles, we derive an analytical expression for dissociation relaxation rates as a function of solvent temperature, salt concentration, and the length of the charged polymer blocks. The theoretical predictions are compatible with the experimental data from light scattering experiments. This study demonstrates experimentally the relaxation kinetics of polyelectrolyte complex micelle dissociation and illustrates the underlying mechanism governing the dissociation kinetics.

Such systems have previously been shown to exhibit self-sorting, new folding motifs, and dynamic stereoisomerism, yet there remain important questions about the interplay between folding and macrocyclization and the effect of structural confinement on folding behavior. Here, we explore the dynamic covalent assembly of extended <i>ortho</i>-phenylenes (hexamer and decamer) with rod-shaped linkers. Characteristic <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift differences between cyclic and acyclic systems can be compared with computational conformer libraries to determine the folding states of the macrocycles.

For the <i>o</i>-phenylene hexamer, the bite angle and conformer stability work synergistically to direct assembly toward triangular [3+3] macrocycles of well-folded oligomers. For the decamer, the energetic accessibility of conformers with small bite angles allows [2+2] macrocycles to be formed as the predominant species. In these systems, the <i>o</i>-phenylenes are forced into unusual folding states, preferentially adopting a backbone geometry with distinct helical blocks of opposite handedness.

Here, we investigate label-free immunosensing, using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), to detect exosomes by exploiting their surface protein profile. Exosomes expressing the transmembrane protein CD63 were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography from cell culture media. QCM-D sensors functionalised with anti-CD63 antibodies formed a direct immunoassay towards CD63-positive exosomes, exhibiting a limit-of-detection of 1.7x10^8 and 1.1x10^8 exosome sized particles (ESPs) ml^-1 for frequency and dissipation response respectively, i.e., clinically relevant concentrations.

To explore this issue, we present a database of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for 74 spin states of 69 diatomic species containing a 3d transition metal atom and a main group element, in the moderately sized def2-SVP basis. The presented BDEs appear to have an (estimated) 3\u03c3 error less than 1 kJ/mol relative to the exact solutions to the non-relativistic Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian. These benchmark values were used to assess the performance of a wide range of standard CC models, as the results should be beneficial for understanding the limitations of CC models for transition metal systems. We find that interactions between metals and monovalent ligands like hydride and fluoride are well described by CCSDT.

The position dependence of point charge induced transition rates between the ground and lowest few excited electronic states was resolved for a small polybenzoid.  Notably, electronic excitations that are optically forbidden can be strongly allowed for particular positions of the perturbing point charge.  Application of the methods detailed here can lead to an improved understanding of the electronic response of materials under irradiation by beams of charged particles.", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics; Quasiparticles and Excitations; Radiation", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

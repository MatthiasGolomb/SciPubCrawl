Solving NMR spectra requires expert knowledge, critical thinking, and careful evaluation of multiple features of spectral data.  This study explores the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for solving NMR spectral tasks. We selected 115 problems from NMR-Challenge.com, which has been used by students practicing NMR structure elucidation, collecting >1 million human responses, and developed a plain text problem format for evaluating LLM reasoning in this domain. We evaluated 7 LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o1-mini, o3-mini, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini-2.0-Flash), comparing 5 prompts to spur chain-of-thought reasoning in different ways, especially comparing the influence of providing background NMR chemistry knowledge, reasoning strategy, or both. Newer models trained to emphasize reasoning performed better, and increasing reasoning effort led to modest improvements, but prompting and varying temperature didn't have an effect. We also evaluated undergraduate organic chemistry students in a controlled setting, and analyzed answer submission statistics from global submissions to NMR-Challenge.com, to characterize human performance on these problems. The top-performing students surpassed smaller models like GPT-4o by 24%, 33%, and 29% on the Easy, Moderate, and Hard sets. However, reasoning models like o1 exceeded student performance by 13%, 14%, and 19%, respectively. Patterns in mistakes made by humans and LLMs reveal that errors made by LLMs are similar to those typically made by humans, for instance, incorrect positioning of substituents on benzene and incorrect orientation of carboxyl groups in esters. However, LLMs still \"think\" differently from humans, in some cases, providing answers which no human submitted via the website. This work also illustrates how NMR spectral problems can be used to benchmark LLMs on reasoning-heavy tasks in chemistry, though for this particular set of problems, current LLMs already exceed undergraduate student performance.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemoinformatics; Spectroscopy (Anal.

These features underpin their utility in gas storage, separation, and catalysis. However, their mechanical behavior under hydrostatic pressure, critical for shaping, membrane integration, and high-pressure separations, remains insufficiently understood. Here, we report a comparative high-pressure powder X-ray diffraction (HPPXRD) study of six M2(dobdc) materials (M2+ = Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+) and the expanded analogue Mg2(dobpdc) (dobpdc4\u2013 ( 4,4\u2019-dioxido-[1,1\u2019-biphenyl]-3,3\u2019-dicarboxylate), both in its activated and diamine-loaded forms, under hydrostatic pressure up to 4000 bar. Two distinct compression mechanisms are identified: M2(dobdc) frameworks compress primarily along the crystallographic c-axis through distortion of the square-pyramidal [MO5] coordination units. The bulk modulus varies from 10 to 24 GPa and correlates strongly with metal ion hardness as well as bond length and angular distortion parameters. In contrast, Mg2(dobpdc) undergoes compression via bending of the extended dobpdc4\u2013 linker in the ab-plane, resulting in an exceptionally low bulk modulus of ~3 GPa. Notably, while guest-free Mg2(dobpdc) amorphizes irreversibly, the diamine-loaded variant transitions reversibly to a severely distorted, non-periodic high-pressure phase and fully recovers its crystallinity upon decompression.

In such a hydrogen economy, safety sensors for hydrogen leak monitoring will be an indispensable element due to the high flammability of hydrogen\u2212air mixtures. Palladium-based nanoparticles function as optical hydrogen sensors due to their ability to reversibly absorb hydrogen and undergo a phase transition to palladium hydride, which induces a spectral shift of their localized plasmon resonance. However, the effectiveness of palladium-based nanoparticles as hydrogen sensors are compromised in realistic environments due to surface poisoning from various contaminants, including sulfur-containing compounds (SOx), which block active sites required for hydrogen dissociation. In this study, we use atomic force microscopy, infrared nanospectroscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy, in addition to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to investigate the impact of SOx poisoning on the hydrogen sorption dynamics of single Pd nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that SOx preferentially adsorb on the particle's rim, significantly altering the kinetics of hydrogen (de)sorption without substantially affecting the total sorption capacity. Single particle analysis revealed that poisoning leads to slower (de)sorption kinetics, due to blocking of highly reactive surface sites that are located on the particle's rim. DFT calculations show that SOx bind significantly less strongly to the flat palladium hydride surface compared to the flat palladium surface and the rough surface found at the nanoparticle rim. These calculations rationalize the selective desorption of SOx from the center of the nanoparticle following exposure to hydrogen, and its persistent binding to the particle rim.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Nanoscience; Energy; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Contrast agents used clinically are typically small molecules containing iodine, which are associated with nephrotoxicity, large dose requirements with potentially thyroid-disrupting levels of iodine, short half-lives, and are sometimes immunogenic. Loading/functionalization of larger molecules with iodine may attenuate X-rays similarly to small molecules, but at much lower concentrations, potentially mitigating the adverse effects of current contrast agents. To test this, iodinated poly(ethyene oxide) (PEO) was synthesized with varying amounts of iodine and structural features and examined for use as a contrast agent. First, 5 kDa PEG containing one terminal hydroxyl was reacted with trimethylaluminum to form a macroinitiator from which block-co-polymers consisting of PEO-co-poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH) were synthesized with PECH blocks of 5, 15, and 30 kDa. The polymers were subsequently iodinated and characterized with 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). X-ray attenuation was found to rival that of iohexol, a conventional contrast agent, at 1/20th the concentration.

WPFL demonstrates catalytic efficiency comparable to Novozym 435, a widely used commercial lipase, while offering a significant cost advantage. Characterisation through ESEM and CLSM imaging confirms that wool provides a uniform enzyme distribution, enhancing both catalytic efficiency and structural stability. The system achieves full conversion of geraniol in five hours and 88% conversion of citronellol, effectively doubling productivity compared to solvent-based systems. The final ester yields are independent of rose geranium oil concentration, underscoring the robustness of the system for processing real flower waste oils which is an essential feature for industrial applications.

A peptide is synthesized C-to-N or N-to-C as an extension to a homopeptide header with one end bound to a fixed surface and the other free and enclosed by a nanopore. The surface is mounted on a platform that can be moved with 0.1-0.15 nm precision; the pore acts like a ribosome tunnel to protect amino acid (AA) side-chains from unwanted couplings and also prevents aggregation and cyclization. Synthesis occurs in cycles with the following steps: a coupling agent attaches an end-protected AA to the terminal residue of the growing header at the end of the pore; completion of coupling is detected optically; coupling agent, excess protector, and free AAs are washed out; the platform is retracted by 3.5 \u00c5; the newly added AA is deprotected and the protector washed out. Alternatively in N-to-C synthesis unprotected AAs can be used with an ynamide coupling agent. On completion of synthesis the platform is moved toward the pore by the added peptide\u2019s length, the peptide is separated from the header. A combination of electrical potential and hydraulic pressure keeps the peptide fully stretched at all times. The nanopore plays a secondary role, no measurements are made on it. Parallel synthesis can be done with an array of headers and an array of nanopores, with potential capacities of up to a femtomole. Higher capacities may be possible if header-peptides are passed through wider pores in loose bundles. In principle there is no limit to the length of the peptide that can be synthesized. With no side-chain protection, minimal reagent amounts, reduced washing, and almost no post-synthesis cleanup, the method has a potentially high level of greenness. In particular, since the header-peptide is tethered none of the reactants or byproducts needs to be soluble in water (or other solvent of choice), they can all be flushed out under pressure; the need for purification is minimal. Based on their relative sizes (as computed from the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid) some components of the resulting effluent (which contains protected AAs, coupling agents, byproducts, etc.) may be recovered by nano-filtration for possible reuse. Convergent synthesis of long peptides/proteins from unprotected peptide fragments using a tandem pore structure and ligation or direct coupling is proposed.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inspired by our previous work on the Newman Kwart Rearrangement (NKR), a high barrier (35-43 kcal/mol) C\u2013S bond forming reaction, we sought to leverage photothermal conversion for challenging C\u2013N bond forming SNAr reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporation of an inexpensive photothermal agent, carbon black, and irradiation with red light affords several lightly activated, intermolecular substitution reactions. Attempts to apply this approach to electron neutral and electron rich aryl halides resulted in unproductive reactivity, leading us to examine the reaction barriers. Computations revealed elevated barriers which were within the range previously achieved during our photothermally mediated NKR. Electron neutral, intramolecular analogs were synthesized and found to undergo productive reactivity in short time frames (3-20 minutes), indicating that the inhomogeneous nature of the photothermal heating was a challenge in terms of colocalizing two reactants sufficiently close to the nanoparticle surface. This concept was further leveraged into a one pot, two step SNAr, where an initial intermolecular reaction occurs at a lower barrier, which then primes the substrate for a second, intramolecular substitution.

However, this assumption may overlook emergent molecular trade-offs that arise during the optimization process. This study presents AMODO-EO (Adaptive Multi-Objective Drug Optimization with Emergent Objectives), a computational framework designed to discover and integrate new chemically meaningful objectives during active optimization.\nAMODO-EO builds on established principles from symbolic regression and automated feature engineering. It operates by generating candidate objective functions from molecular descriptors using mathematical transformations such as ratios, products, and differences. These candidates are evaluated for statistical independence from existing objectives, sufficient variance across the population, and chemical interpretability. Validated objectives are incorporated into the optimization process using adaptive weighting and conflict resolution mechanisms.\nThe framework was tested on benchmark datasets and two ChEMBL subsets targeting the dopamine D2 receptor. Initial objectives included binding affinity (pIC\u2085\u2080), a drug-likeness composite score, and synthetic accessibility. AMODO-EO consistently identified emergent objectives such as the hydrogen bond acceptor to rotatable bond ratio (HBA/RTB), MW/TPSA ratio, and LogP \u00d7 aromatic ring count. These objectives passed statistical filters and were chemically interpretable, suggesting they capture relevant trade-offs not encoded in the original objective set.\nOptimization performance was evaluated using hypervolume indicators and compared against baseline NSGA-II runs. AMODO-EO maintained competitive performance on original objectives, with a modest reduction in hypervolume (1.5\u20132.9%), attributed to the computational cost of discovery. Ablation studies confirmed that statistical filtering and interpretability checks are essential for maintaining optimization quality and avoiding spurious objectives.\nThe inclusion of emergent objectives expanded the Pareto front into higher-dimensional spaces, revealing new solution clusters with distinct chemical profiles. For example, the HBA/RTB ratio highlighted a polarity-flexibility trade-off relevant to ligand design. This objective was consistently discovered across all runs and parameter settings, indicating robustness of the discovery mechanism. Other emergent objectives, such as the Selectivity Score and Synthetic Complexity metric, provided additional design axes that could inform compound prioritization.\nSensitivity analysis showed that AMODO-EO is stable across a range of parameter values, including correlation thresholds, learning rates, and weight-mixing parameters. The framework\u2019s reliance on interpretable descriptor relationships ensures that discovered objectives are scientifically grounded and potentially actionable in medicinal chemistry workflows.\nWhile AMODO-EO currently uses predefined functional forms and semi-automated interpretability checks, future work may incorporate grammar-based symbolic regression and ontology-driven validation to enhance discovery scope and automation. The framework is applicable to various chemical optimization contexts and can be integrated with generative models or molecular simulation pipelines.\nIn summary, AMODO-EO provides a structured approach to discovering emergent objectives in drug optimization. It extends existing MOO techniques by enabling dynamic expansion of the objective space, offering a more comprehensive view of molecular trade-offs. The framework demonstrates that adaptive objective discovery can be achieved without compromising optimization performance, and that chemically interpretable objectives can be systematically identified from descriptor data.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this context, supramolecular gel noodles formed by ionic cross-linking of pre-assembled micellar networks offer unique opportunities for creating anisotropic soft materials. However, controlling fibrillar alignment over extended lengths remains a challenge. Here, we report a shear-induced method to fabricate one-dimensional gel noodles with enhanced macroscopic alignment using dipeptide-based gelators. By optimizing the extensional viscosity and shear flow conditions, we produced thin segments of gel noodles with improved internal alignment compared to traditional syringe-pump extrusion. Polarized optical microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering confirmed superior fibrillar orientation in the thin noodles. Mechanical testing revealed that enhanced alignment led to a ~400-fold increase in tensile stress resistance of 2NapFF, with ultimate stress rising from 20-50 kPa in thick noodles to 10-20 MPa in the thin segments. The method was effective across multiple gelators, including LD-2NapFF, 4BPFF, and 1ThNapFF, demonstrating its broad applicability for tuning macroscopic alignment in gel noodles. The biological relevance of thin 4BPFF noodles was demonstrated in C2C12 myoblast cultures, which showed improved cell adhesion, elongation, and myogenic differentiation compared to the thick segment.

All photosynthetic reaction centers (Photosystems I, II, Heliobacter, and bacterial reaction centers (bRCs)) have their charge separating cofactors arranged with two, c2-symmetric paths from primary donor to terminal acceptor. In Type II reaction centers (PSII and bRCs), electrons utilize only one active branch. In bRCs the electron transfer occurs in the A branch from the excited state of dimer P860 through BChlA, BPhA, to QA, and then to the B-branch QB. B-branch BChlB and BPhB do not participate. A similar path is found in PSII. These proteins challenge our understanding of how proteins can turn on or off the activity of bound ligands. The shift of the electrochemical midpoint potential (Em) of each cofactor by the protein environment is calculated using the continuum electrostatics within the MultiConformation Continuum Electrostatic program (MCCE). In bRCs from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the electrostatic potentials favor reduction of the active branch cofactors. The residues that contribute to a more positive potential on the A branch are identified. These are often distant from the cofactors. The large difference of the potential at the competing BChls may direct the electron transfer to the A branch. Residues TyrM210 and PheL181 are at symmetrical positions on the A and B branches, near P860 and between BChlA or BChlB. Mutated bRCs that swap the Tyr and Phe (YF mutant), have been shown to support some electron transfer to the B-branch cofactors. The calculated Ems in the bRC with the YF swap show that more positive B-branch potentials help explain the electron transfer from excited P860 to the normally inactive B branch.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The tBP is considered detrimental to PSCs because it can react with perovskite crystals. In particular, the reactions between tBP and the Pb2+ cation, a perovskite component, have been well acknowledged. In contrast, the interactions between tBP and alkylammoniums, another perovskite component, has sparsely been investigated despite the widespread use of tBP, hindering the development of PSCs. In this work, the mechanisms of interactions between tBP and alkylammoniums are revealed via theoretical studies. In the case of n-octylammonium (OA), up to three tBP molecules stabilize the ammonium moiety in OA via coordination with strong hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen in tBP and hydrogen in the ammonium moiety of OA. Up to three more tBP molecules can coordinate via weak hydrogen bonding to already coordinated tBP molecules. Leveraging this characteristic, herein, the mechanism of spontaneous perovskite passivation is investigated using an HTM solution containing tBP and an OA-based additive (OA-TFSI). The OA unit coordinated to 3 tBP molecules was found to directly chemisorb on the perovskite surface. However, the revealed chemisorption led to the formation of substantial physical space between OA and the perovskite surface, impeding hole injection from the perovskite to HTM. Finally, a method to address this issue is experimentally demonstrated: post-heating removed the coordination of bulky tBP molecules, facilitating hole injection via close adsorption of solo OA cations on the perovskite surface, enhancing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. This study provides profound insights into the tBP effects, an unexplored aspect in PSC studies, as well as the nascent yet potent spontaneous perovskite passivation techniques.

Often, users want to find novel compounds of a particular compound class they are already familiar with.

For such applications, a python-package is presented that allows users to classify their experimental MS/MS spectra, respectively. By leveraging structure-informed embeddings (MS2DeepScore) alongside a curated dataset of 'relevant' and 'other' reference MS/MS spectra, the package enables rapid and accurate prediction of 'relevant' compounds with a series of binary classification models and a majority vote, facilitating exploration of the complex chemical space inherent to LC-HRMS/MS data.

In this study, quaternary ammonium (QALs) and quaternary phosphonium (QPLs) lignin materials were derived from softwood (pine) through chloromethylation and further functionalized with tertiary amines and phosphines. Successful synthesis was confirmed via NMR, FT-IR, and elemental analysis. The antibacterial effectiveness of QALs and QPLs against ESKAPE pathogens was evaluated through growth inhibition zone (ZOI) assays and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). QPLs exhibited greater antibacterial activity than QALs, with QPLs containing a trihexyl carbon chain (C6) demonstrating superior effectiveness compared to those with trioctyl carbon chain (C8). The ZOI test also confirmed that QPLs reached optimal antibacterial activity at C6.

Existing approaches often suffer from arbitrariness in reference selection, limited applicability, or high computational cost. In particular, the balance of \u03c0-energy between the target molecule and its strain-free references has long been overlooked, which is critical for \u03c0-conjugated systems. Here, we introduce \u201cautodesmotic reactions\u201d as a general and efficient strategy for reliable SE evaluation in polycyclic aromatic nanocarbons. An autodesmotic reaction transforms a strained molecule into a uniquely defined single-molecule reference. This reference resides within a virtual strain-free chemical space derived from physically motivated models trained on planar benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Crucially, preservation of molecular topology ensures both unique reference choice and proper \u03c0-energy balance. Benchmarking against asymptotic and StrainViz models across diverse carbon nanobelts (CNBs) validates the accuracy and robustness of the approach. It is broadly applicable to both macrocyclic and nonmacrocyclic systems while requiring only a single quantum chemical calculation per molecule. Applications to more challenging systems, including helicene-containing and saddle-shaped CNBs, helicenes, bowl-shaped PAHs, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes, demonstrate high computational efficiency and provide valuable insights into strain\u2013structure\u2013property relationships. Overall, autodesmotic reactions establish a general, conceptually transparent, and efficient framework for SE analysis in \u03c0-conjugated nanocarbons.

To contribute to the green transition, for more sustainable chemical processes, and to make the most of the unique properties of such material, it is essential to develop synthesis methods compatible with the principles of Sustainable Chemistry. In several syntheses, a metal precursor is reduced in a solvent by reducing agents in a liquid phase. However, these reducing agents and solvents are typically sacrificial and/or difficult to recover. Here, we demonstrate a method that follows more closely the principles of Sustainable Chemistry, where the reduction of 2-ethylanthraquinone (2-EAQ) by H2 makes it possible to further mediate the production of metal nanoparticles by reduction of a metal precursor. Conveniently, 2-EAQ is a molecule widely used in the industry for the production of H2O2 and 2-EAQ is easily reduced with hydrogen at room temperature over a commercial nickel catalyst. As an example, the reduced form of 2-EAQ can be used to reduce copper(II)tetrafluoroborate in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. The effect of the ratios of the chemicals on the size of the resulting materials is investigated. It is found acidity of the medium is crucial to tune the selectivity of the reduction to that either copper(I)oxide or pure copper material. Solvent and reducing agent can be recovered and regenerated multiple times, paving the way to more sustainable syntheses of metallic particles that generate less waste and avoid the use of sacrificial reducing agents.

However, the excited state of radical anions are extremely short-lived, making them impractical for directly accomplishing photochemical transformations with meaningful quantum yields. Herein, we examine the radical anion of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA\u25cf\u2013), which has previously been reported to activate aryl chloride substrates. We show that 10-cyanoanthrolate (10-CA), the product of the reaction of DCA\u25cf\u2013 with oxygen, is a competent photocatalyst for reductive transformations of select aryl chlorides, but not electron-rich aryl chlorides, suggesting another mode of photoreactivity. We show that DCA\u25cf\u2013 yields highly reducing solvated electrons via photodetachment when excited with blue light. Near-infrared femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements show that spectral features assigned to solvated electrons are quenched by electron-rich aryl chlorides that cannot be reduced by 10-CA. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of solvated electron generation using other previously reported radical anion photocatalysts, such as naphthalene monoimide radical anion and a 9-mesityl-3,6-di-tert-butyl-10-phenylacridinium radical. Taken together, we now present a unified picture of radical anion photoredox chemistry in which the radical anion is susceptible to react with electrophiles by an ECE (electron-chemical-electron) process to furnish a closed shell super-reducing photoreagent. Alternatively, radical anions are sufficiently reduced that a solvated electron may be produced by charge-transfer to solvent (CTTS) under sufficiently energetic excitation.

Meanwhile, the large search space of candidate materials, the influence of measurement conditions like temperature and atmosphere, and time-intensive electrochemical characterization further slow down materials discovery efforts. Here, we develop and evaluate a system, including hardware and software, for efficient screening of proton-conducting oxide electrodes for ceramic fuel cells and electrolyzers. Combinatorial thin-film microelectrode libraries are characterized with a joint time-/frequency-domain impedance measurement technique, which provides an order-of-magnitude acceleration relative to conventional impedance spectroscopy. The distribution of relaxation times is extracted from impedance data and analyzed without human intervention. These results feed a Bayesian active learning process that learns to predict electrochemical impedance as a function of material composition, measurement temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and electrical bias, which further reduces screening time by 10-fold with optimized experimental sequences. We apply this system to Ba(Co,Fe,Zr,Y)O3-\u03b4 combinatorial libraries and evaluate its effectiveness for learning materials property trends and optimizing expensive-to-evaluate properties like activation energy.

How large can a macrocyclic \u03c0-system be and still exhibit an aromatic ring current around its circumference? We address this question by investigating a \u03c0-conjugated butadiyne-linked 18-porphyrin nanoring (diameter 8 nm). This nanoring was synthesized by two different strategies: classical template-directed synthesis, using a radial template with 18 pyridyl binding sites, and Vernier templating, using a small hexapyridyl template. Both strategies are effective when the porphyrins have octyloxy sidechains but classical templating is more effective than Vernier templating when the porphyrins have bulky trihexylsilyl substituents. The size and shape of the nanoring was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). Nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations using the BLYP35 functional predicted that the 18 porphyrin nanoring would show global aromaticity in the 10+ and 14+ oxidation states and antiaromaticity in the 12+ and 16+ oxidation state.

Lasalocid acid A possesses broad anti-microbial activities, including against drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but a narrow therapeutic index precludes its use in human medicine. It remains unknown if structural optimization, through synthesis, can provide analogs with sufficiently improved properties, however the complex, polycyclic nature of lasalocid acid A mandates the development of a very short synthesis to unlock such investigations. Here, we report a highly concise and module-based synthesis of lasalocid acid A in 11 steps in the longest linear sequence. A central element in the route is a new Tsuji-Trost-type C-glycosylation reaction to construct \u2013 in a single step \u2013 the challenging attached oxacyclic rings, which include a quaternary stereocenter. We employed the route to also prepare the mirror-image isomer of lasalocid acid A and demonstrated that this compound, interestingly, fully preserves the potent activity of the natural product.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Natural Products; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Stereochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using laser-induced projectile impact testing (LIPIT) and nanoindentation, we evaluated polyurethane-based inverse opals fabricated with periodically ordered air pores (with diameters of 370 nm and 510 nm) to investigate their strain-dependent optical responses under both dynamic and quasi-static loading conditions.

The optimal loading of 0.67 wt.% achieves an oxygen evolution rate of 31.2 \u00b5mol h-1 under visible illumination in the presence of the sacrificial electron scavenger AgNO3. Contrastingly, dark electrocatalytic oxygen evolution rates are maximised at 2.1 wt.% cobalt loading. We use transient absorption spectroscopy to rationalise this difference in optimal metal loading. Photocatalytic activity is shown to correlate with the steady accumulation of photo-oxidised cobalt, with both being maximal at a cobalt loading of 0.67 wt.%. Ultrafast transient absorption demonstrates that picosecond reduction of accumulated oxidised cobalt is a major light-driven loss pathway which competes with the desired nanosecond photoelectron transfer to AgNO3.The optimal 0.67 wt.% cobalt loading for photocatalysis is rationalised as resulting from a compromise between maximising the density of cobalt catalytic sites for water oxidation whilst avoiding excessive losses resulting from oxidised cobalt sites functioning as recombination centres for photogenerated electrons.

Meanwhile, long-lived photogenerated electrons accumulate under continuous irradiation, with this accumulation being enhanced by the presence of a hole scavenger, methanol.

The lipopeptide prevents yeast-to-hyphae morphogenesis in Candida albicans, notably without fungicidal or fungistatic activity. The mode of action and structure-activity relationship of mutanobactin D are unknown and prompt an interdisciplinary program of study. Stereoselective synthesis of designed mutanobactin D analogs reveals that the C26 configuration is crucial for bioactivity associated with inhibition of pathogenesis, or yeast-to-hyphae transition, in C. albicans. To shed light on this finding, we employ molecular dy-namics simulations of mutanobactin D and selected analogs in increasingly complex environments: Monophasic (water or CHCl3), interfacial (water/CHCl3), and explicit lipid membrane (phosphatidylcholine) models. Monophasic MD simulations do not distinguish between bioactive and inactive compounds.

To elucidate the distinctive characteristics of the new sulfonium ligand, its Rh(I) carbonyl complex was subjected to a comprehensive structural (XRD) and spectroscopic (NMR, IR) analysis, in direct comparison with isostructural analogs featuring neutral P-based and anionic Si-based ligands. This study revealed systematic trends along this series, including a progressive shortening of the central E-Rh bond (E = Si, P, S) and an increasing blue shift of the CO stretching frequencies. These results were fully corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which also indicated a steady depletion of the local negative natural charge on the Rh atom along the series.

Desalination, particularly through reverse osmosis (RO), has become a critical method of producing fresh water from saline sources.

Previously, these microenvironments were only indirectly investigated and thus the microphase separation in COFs has remained inconclusive. We probe the local structure of a dual-chain functionalized, amphiphilic COF where the pore size and side chain length is expected to lead to through-pore interactions. 13C and 1H MAS NMR experiments, including 2D 1H-1H spin-diffusion exchange, proved that close spatial proximity and dynamic interactions between the chemically distinct side chains exist for a majority of the side chains, excluding the possibility of significant phase separation.

Existing probes for imaging lipid oxidation often rely on indirect strategies, such as monitoring changes in the fluorescence intensity or color of oxidizable probes, which detect the presence of lipid peroxidation but not its direct chemical products. Among lipid oxidation products, aldehyde-containing lipids are particularly significant due to their heightened reactivity and strong links to disease pathology. Here, we introduce OxiLox, a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine-based probes to enable direct, chemoselective tagging of aldehyde-containing lipids in situ within living cells via rapid oxime ligation.

We had the idea of applying a rigidification approach previously devised to assemble conformationally restrained polymethine indocyanine dyes. Thus, the implementation of an efficient acid-catalyzed domino double cyclization process allowed the synthesis of unprecedented fluorescent phenol KR306. A comprehensive photophysical study has highlighted its outstanding optical properties in neutral aq. buffered conditions; a brightness of 71 500 M-1 cm-1 at pH 7.5 for a yellow emission centered at ca. 560 nm, was obtained in particular.

To tackle this issue, we develop a novel enhanced sampling method called parallelized Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (ParGaMD) that runs many short Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations over multiple GPUs in parallel by using the weighted ensemble method (WE) framework. Although GaMD accelerates sampling by adding a harmonic boost potential to the system, GaMD often takes weeks to run for large systems and does not parallelize well over multiple GPUs in specific MD simulation engines. By using the efficient GPU parallelization of the WE framework, we can overcome this bottleneck and additionally sample along the chosen collective variables, which enables ParGaMD to be more powerful than GaMD itself. We show that ParGaMD can significantly speed up sampling different configuration states and dynamics of various systems, which can benefit the broader scientific community.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We anticipated, based on the Generalized Entropy Theory (GET) of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids and recent molecular dynamics simulation studies, that variations in these material\u2019s polymer charge density should significantly alter the glass transition temperature (Tg) and fragility (m) because of the known effect of charge on the cohesive energy density of polymer materials. To test this hypothesis, we performed dielectric spectroscopy measurements on model complex coacervate films formed by blending poly-diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (PDDA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The critical salt concentration (csalt) was taken to be a quantitative measure of molecular interaction strength, \u0190. The films were vacuum annealed before dielectric measurements were conducted over a wide temperature range extending down to temperatures close to Tg. As anticipated, we find that increasing \u0190 progressively increases Tg but decreases m. We also find that our coacervate films exhibit high apparent dielectric permittivity (> 103) at room temperature for a moderate frequency of 1 kHz, which naturally explains the observed high responsiveness of such materials to even relatively weak electric fields ( 1 V/cm). Finally, we show that moisture tends to plasticize the glassy dynamics of these materials, i,e., reduce Tg.

To enhance their creep resistance while retaining reprocessability, we introduced dynamic covalent cross-links via one-step, radical-based reactive processing to form PEC covalent adaptable networks (CANs). During reactive processing, it is essential to suppress the \u03b2-scission pathway associated with propylene-repeat-unit-derived macroradicals. We achieved this by promoting the formation of stabilized macroradical intermediates through resonance stabilization. We enabled such stabilization by replacing a methacrylate-based dynamic cross-linker, bis(4-methacryloyloxyphenyl) disulfide (BiPheS methacrylate, BPMA) with a phenylacrylate-based cross-linker, bis(4-phenacryloyloxyphenyl) disulfide (BiPheS styrene, BPST) as well as by incorporating vinyl aromatic additives such as styrene (ST) and divinylbenzene (DVB) with the dynamic cross-linker. We found that, in the absence of vinyl aromatic additives, the use of BPST (but not BPMA) resulted in the formation of percolated PEC CANs, while the addition of one (ST) or two (ST and DVB) vinyl aromatic additives significantly reduced the disparity in cross-linking capability between BPMA and BPST by compensating for differences in resonance stabilization. The resulting PEC CANs exhibited markedly improved creep resistance at elevated temperatures compared to neat PEC. Notably, relative to the thermoplastic PEC elastomer from which the PEC CANs were made, the best-performing PEC CAN made by BPST and a combination of ST and DVB suppressed >99% of viscous creep at 160\u202f\u00b0C (melt state) over 600 s and >98% at 100\u202f\u00b0C (semicrystalline state) over 10,000 s.

Quantification of THC and the SC MDMB-4en-PINACA using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with isotopic dilution following homogenisation, liquid-phase extraction, and sample preparation. Evaluation of a portable fluorescence and photochemical degradation-based device for detecting THC and SCs directly on edible surfaces.\nFindings: Of 24 unique edible products, 19 (79%) used packaging mimicking popular confectionery brands. THC was detected in 28/31 (90.3%) products (70/79 individual edibles). Median THC content per edible was 13.28 mg (range 0\u201391.18 mg). Of edibles labelled with a THC dose, 95% (65/68) contained significantly less (>45%) than stated. Substantial inter-product variability (e.g., 6.07\u201329.22 mg THC in edibles labelled as 75 mg) and intra-product variability (dose difference >5 mg THC between items in the same pack for 8/25 packs, max difference 51.91 mg) were found.

While these algorithms improve quantification and reduce processing time, we hypothesize that they alter statistical comparisons between samples when samples are searched together. Herein, we search different cleanup methods or single proteins separately versus together in Progenesis Qi for proteomics database searching software. Our results show that searching samples together increases the number of identifications by each sample, enhances protein similarity between samples, and leads to false transfers.

Consequently, structure-dependent multiscale modeling is required to accurately capture the interaction of CO2 with the various Ni facets and to provide accurate atomistic insights. While mean-field multiscale models can be constructed that account for multiple active facets, almost all of these studies neglect the diffusion of adsorbates between the facets. In this study, we close the gap by extending the open-source Cantera toolkit with capabilities for surface diffusion in mean-field microkinetic models, making it the first widely adopted software tool that includes these features.  We developed a thermodynamically consistent microkinetic model for a Ni nanoparticle consisting of Ni(111), Ni(100), Ni(211), and Ni(110) using data from DFT calculations and single-crystal experiments to unravel the interaction of CO2 with these facets through the simulation of temperature-programmed desorption profiles.  Including surface diffusion and coverage effects into the mean-field microkinetic model leads to a significantly improved agreement between experiments from a Ni/SiO2 catalyst and the simulations.  Using a rigorous correlated uncertainty quantification of all structural and energetic parameters, we found a detailed chemical model within the uncertainty space that is in excellent agreement with the recorded CO2 desorption profile. This model highlights that Ni(110), which contributes only to a small extent to the overall Ni surface area, dominates the desorption pattern and that surface diffusion reactions play a crucial role.  The implemented surface diffusion into Cantera is generic and can be applied to other (mixed) metal nanoparticles and metal/metal oxide interfaces, providing a step towards closing the material gap.

Selectively capturing CO2 in the presence of moisture is a key goal, as there is a growing demand for materials capable of selectively adsorbing CO2 under humid conditions. Among these, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous, highly tunable materials, have attracted extensive interest for gas capture, storage, and separation applications. The numerous combinations of secondary building units and organic linkers offer abundant opportunities for designing systems with enhanced CO2 selectivity.

Here, we investigate the multiphase ozone oxidation of the reaction mixture from the aqueous OH-initiated oxidation of catechol, i.e., simulated OH-driven processing in clouds, using a coated-wall flow-tube apparatus. Reactive uptake of ozone was determined for thin films from the OH-driven processing of catechol with and without further irradiation of the thin films, i.e., simulated light-driven processing after cloud evaporation, at low and moderate relative humidity (RH). The experimental time series were reproduced using kinetic multilayer modeling, which, along with qualitative microscopy experiments, provided insights into the diffusivity of these materials.

Proteins often carry multiple copies of ZnF motifs, enhancing DNA- and RNA-binding affinity and specificity. Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA-binding protein that contains one ZnF motif and one RNA recognition motif. We identified the molecular basis for the strong and specific binding of FUS ZnF to RNA at atomic resolution by performing molecular dynamics and dissociation parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics simulations of a single-stranded RNA complexed with FUS ZnF and the flanking intrinsically disordered RGG2 domain, and observed dissociation of the complex. Our results suggest two distinct binding modes of the FUS ZnF-RNA complex. One is that ZnF specifically recognizes the GGU sequence of RNA while the RGG2 domain non-specifically interacts with RNA and distorts the RNA backbone structure. The second is that ZnF similarly recognizes the GGU of RNA specifically, but the RGG2 domain is barely involved in RNA binding, resulting in weaker binding. Further comprehensive analysis of nucleic acid binding site sequences indicates two possible mechanisms for ensuring strong and specific nucleic acid binding in nucleic acid binding proteins: the first is the stabilization of protein-RNA binding using only one or few nucleic acid binding motifs with flanking disordered regions as in the case of FUS ZnF, and the second is the involvement of more nucleic acid binding motifs.

This study applies an innovative membrane-free silicon nanodialysis (ND) probe coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze the extracellular neuropeptidome in the mouse S1 with spatial resolution down to 100 \u03bcm. Localized in vivo sampling identified extracellular peptides from secretogranin-1, ProSAAS, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and others. Minimal tissue damage, enabled by probe dimensions of 75\u00d715 \u03bcm\u00b2, resulted in the detection of only one structural peptide (JIP-2), indicating low intracellular contamination. Many detected secretory peptides correlated with strong local mRNA expression; however, the detection of POMC-derived peptides, despite negligible local expression, suggests long-distance peptide transport or extracellular processing. To expand peptide identification, a discovery-to-targeted peptidomics approach was developed, revealing 46 peptides from 24 proteins in dialysate samples, including 10 proteins with low local expression. Complementary S1 tissue analysis confirmed POMC peptides and showed that 17% of 304 prohormone-derived peptides had low local expression. These results uncover a complex extracellular peptide landscape shaped by both local and long-distance signaling.

Protons are one of the most common charge carriers in MALDI. For molecules with multiple protonation sites, this can give rise to analyte ion populations composed of multiple protonation-site isomers (protomers), which only differ by the site of proton attachment. This seeming nuance of proton location can result in profound changes in analyte ion stability, affect fragmentation efficiencies, alter tandem mass spectrometry spectra and ion mobility\u2014all while maintaining the m/z ratio. Investigating protonation site isomers provides insight into the ionization mechanism as analytes undergo the phase transition from condensed to gas-phase. In this study, protonation isomers for ten fluoroquinolone antibiotics are investigated using MALDI and only the most stable protomers form, irrespective of matrix composition, and this is consistent with a MALDI gas-phase equilibrium model. In contrast, multiple protomers are formed when using a modified atmospheric pressure MALDI plasma post-ionization source and this demonstrates a different protonation mechanism. Relative protomer populations are influenced by the choice of matrix and this can be controlled by externally doping the plasma source with solvent vapor. Experimental trapped-ion mobility spectrometry collisional cross sections are matched against protomer simulations from trajectory method calculations at the \u03c9B97X-D/aug-cc-pVDZ//\u03c9B97X-D/cc-pVDZ level.

We report a hydrophobic core-substituted naphthalenediimide that self-assembles in water-dioxane mixtures to form a pair of 2D poly-morphs, with distinct morphological, optical and surface characteristics. Changing the solvent composition or temperature prompts an in-situ transformation between the two polymorphs in solution. A comprehensive structural investigation using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, x-ray and electron diffraction analyses reveals not only the nature of molecular packing and noncovalent (n-pi* and pi-stacking) interactions stabilizing each 2D polymorph, but also the role of weak solvent-solute interactions in driving polymorphic interconversion. Different arrangements of perfluoroalkyl sidechains at the exposed 2D surface of the two polymorphs result in difference in solvent-solute interactions at the solid-liquid interface, which affects the surface free-energy and relative stability in different solvent compositions. Further, entropy change associated with surface ordering of perfluoroalkyl sidechains and desolvation dictates thermal reorganization between the polymorphs.

Previous studies have shown that the application of stack pressure can significantly improve the cell\u2019s cycling stability. To reveal the underlying mechanism, this study systematically investigates the impact of stack pressure on the electrochemical performance of ASSFIBs using BiF\u2083|BaSnF\u2084|Sn cells.

Comparative studies with existing techniques underscore its advantages, including a 51% yield for trideuteromethylation of a MET kinase inhibitor precursor (versus a precedented 14% via Kumada coupling) and a streamlined one-step cyclobutylation of an NLRP3 inhibitor intermediate at 41% yield (versus a known <5% over a four-step sequence). By accelerating analog synthesis for hit-to-lead optimization and enabling late-stage functionalization of drug-like molecules, this sulfonyl hydrazide toolbox is a useful resource for synthetic and medicinal chemistry, with significant potential to advance drug discovery and beyond.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Current Li mining from brines based on evaporation-precipitation is time-consuming and water-intensive.  Here, we report three NiHCF/MnO2 composite electrodes based on core-shell construction strategies for Li+ extraction from brine on a rocking-chair capacitive deionization (RCDI) platform.  We find that the MnO2 components varied with the composing condition from \u03b1-, \u03b4- to \u03bb-MnO2 and that the core-shell structured NiHCF@\u03bb-MnO2 electrode showed the optimal ion migration rate, highest specific capacity, and the best cycling stability.  Notably, we reveal that the NiHCF@\u03bb-MnO2 electrode presented the optimum Li+ extraction performance with respect to adsorption capacity, adsorption rate, and energy consumption (e.g., achieving the highest Li+ capacity of 40.51 mg Li+ g\u22121 with a rate of 8.1 mg g\u22121 min\u22121, and at an energy cost of 0.86 Wh g\u22121 in 20 mM LiCl solution at 1.2 V).  In addition, we demonstrate that the NiHCF@\u03bb-MnO2 electrode maintained high cycling stability over 40 consecutive cycles of Li+ intercalation/deintercalation, with 78.4% capacity retention in 10 mM of LiCl solution.  Importantly, the NiHCF@\u03bb-MnO2 electrode also provided excellent Li+ selectivity in both the synthetic brine and the actual brine from the East Taijinaier salt lake, with exceptional separation factors as high as 68.7 and 21.0 for Li+ against Na+ and Mg2+ ions, respectively.  Such unparalleled selectivity is believed to be attributed to the combination of structural and charge synergy of the NiHCF@\u03bb-MnO2 composite.

Due to their near isoenergetic nature, both tautomers can be spectroscopically observed, which enabled a detailed mechanistic interrogation through isotopic labeling, kinetic studies, and comprehensive computational analysis. Remarkably, these tautomers display divergent reactivity in hydrogen atom abstraction and dihydrogen activation, revealing that MLPT profoundly modulates the chemical behavior of the complex.

While most PROTACs are non-covalent interactors, covalent PROTACs may benefit from increased selectivity and improved pharmacodynamics, yet remain largely understudied. In this context, a gold-based PROTAC (AuPROTAC) was synthesized, consisting of a cyclometalated Au(III) warhead, known to induce covalent cysteine-arylation in a gold-templated two-step mechanism, linked to a cereblon binding moiety. The degradome of the covalent AuPROTAC was characterized by establishing a cycloheximide chase assay, which was performed in a non-proliferative steady-state HL-60 cell culture system that maintained a static protein turnover and efficiently decoupled protein degradation from down-regulation. The method was verified with the known SMARCA2 and PBRM1-degrader ACBI2. Interestingly, amongst the possible targets, AuPROTAC could degrade the oncogenic tyrosine kinase MERTK and the thioredoxin-like 1 protein TXNL1, while their degradation was successfully rescued by proteasome inhibition. The investigated PROTACs were found to affect protein half-lives; therefore, proteome-wide degradation selectivity was further characterized by ranking degraded targets based on the acceleration of protein half-lives. Interestingly, the AuPROTAC degraded a relatively limited number of proteins (95) when compared to the targeted ACBI2 (221). Overall, the established approach can be used to efficiently explore degradomes of CRBN and VHL recruiter-based PROTACs.", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Bioorganometallic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Conventional deep learning models often represent substitutionally disordered sites using a simplified linear, occupancy-weighted average of atomic features.

We introduce the Non-Linear Disorder Network (NoLiDNet), designed to overcome this limitation. NoLiDNet module enhances the traditional linear sum by adding a non-linear component, learned via a residual Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which acts on the embeddings of all co-located atomic species at disordered sites. This allows the model to capture complex higher-order interactions. Evaluations on the SuperCon3D and 3DSC$_{MP}$ datasets demonstrate that NoLiDNet significantly improves T$_c$ prediction accuracy, reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to baseline models, particularly for materials with significant disorder.

Under mildly acidic conditions, FeTPP\u2010based catalysts are selective towards the 2e\u2013/2H+ reduction of CO2 to CO; however, in the presence of more acidic proton donors, indiscriminate proton transfers often result in parasitic H2 evolution. This report investigates how SCS amide positioning alters CO versus H2 selectivity during CO2 reduction with a series of four FeTPP isomers bearing SCS amides at varying positions around the porphyrin core: NH donors are placed at either the meta or ortho position of the meso aryl porphyrin ring, as well as proximal (closer) or distal (farther away) to the porphyrin plane. In the presence of a conventional, weakly acidic proton source (phenol; pKa = 29.2 in MeCN), all isomers display the expected high Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards CO (FECO = 67\u201385%) along with minimal H2 evolution (FEH2 = 3\u201313%). With a significantly stronger acid (3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenol; pKa = 23.8 in MeCN), H2 becomes the major product when using the ortho-distal or both meta isomers (FEH2 = 45\u201365%) as well as unfunctionalized FeTPP (FEH2 = 78%). Importantly, the ortho-proximal isomer shows dramatically rescued CO selectivity under these unconventionally acidic conditions (FECO = 83 \u00b1 4%).

However, a possibility exists that the 1(TT) pair intermediates can undergo annihilation to give rise to intersystem crossing (ISC)-born triplets that would decrease the free triplet generation quantum efficiency. In metal-complexes laden with SF chromophores e.g. acenes, it has been shown that heavy metal atom influences the mixing of 1(TT) with the 3(TT) and 5(TT) states leading to ISC triplets although in some cases it is ambiguously absent. In order to fundamentally understand generality of ISC contamination during singlet fission, here we have synthesized a new Chloro-substituted TIPS pentacene cyclophane dimer with ethylene bridges, and compared its SF-dynamics to the nonhalogenated version. Broadband femtosecond-to-nanosecond along with nanosecond-to-microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals formation of 1(TT) state in sub-picosecond timescales while a long-lived triplet state is subsequently observed in both the dimers at room temperature. Notably, the timescale of the 1(TT) dissociation is almost three times slower in the Cl-PC dimer than in the non-halogenated pentacene dimer. Time-resolved EPR spectroscopy at 125 K on the dimers revealed SF-born triplets in non-halogenated dimer while the mixing of 1(TT) state with 3(TT) and 5(TT) states facilitated the formation of ISC-born triplets after SF for the Cl-PC dimer. Electronic structure calculations elaborated on the energetics of the 1(TT) state along with distinct spin-orbit coupling values for both the dimers while highlighting the charge-transfer character of 1(TT) pair multi-excitonic state.

By leveraging stoichiometry-based representations, we construct and benchmark a suite of deep neural network architectures\u2014based on physico-chemical features, chemical element presence or chemical element context as determined by attention mechanisms\u2014capable of learning complex, non-linear chemical trends without explicit structural input. Our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on a curated dataset of (de)hydration reactions, outperforming previous non-deep-learning approaches. We harness these models to perform large-scale screening across previously unexplored regions of the salt\u2013hydrate space and experimentally validate highly promising candidates using differential scanning calorimetry. For the successfully synthesized candidates, our deep learning models demonstrate excellent precision and accuracy. By integrating data-driven prediction with experimental validation, our approach offers a powerful and scalable pathway for accelerating the discovery of salt hydrates, with strong potential to advance the development of thermal energy storage materials for sustainable energy applications.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The most significant challenges with membrane-based processes for ammonia recovery include membrane scaling, low selectivity, and high energy consumption. Here, we evaluate the use of electrodialysis for the recovery of ammonia from simulated and real wastewater mixtures. The specific energy consumption (SEC) of electrodialysis exceeded 31 kWh / kg-N for simulated wastewater, but decreased fourfold to 7 kWh / kg-N after hardness removal. The concentration factors (CF) of NH4+ for real wastewater after ultrafiltration and pretreated synthetic wastewater were 7.5 and 10, comparable to the CF of 9 for single-salt solutions (non-mixtures). We find that when concentrating ammonium with electrodialysis with real and simulated synthetic wastewater,  the concentrated product includes K+ and Na+, as cation exchange membranes exhibit K+/NH4+ and Na+/NH4+ selectivities near one. Thus, if the concentrated product is directly used as an aqueous liquid phase fertilizer, the resulting product will be 30/30/30 for Na, K, and N.

However, CO2RR only takes place in acidic electrolytes upon addition of spectator cations and the mechanistic basis for this requirement remains unclear. Herein, we present scanning voltammetry experiments conducted in bulk acidic electrolytes in conjunction with dynamic electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) analysis of CO2 consumption and product formation. By quantifying both Faradaic CO2 consumption via electroreduction and non-Faradaic CO2 consumption via electrolyte carbonation in real-time, we deconvolute the direct role of the added electrolyte cations from their indirect role in fostering a transient local pH swing. We find that across coinage metals and electrolyte compositions, CO2RR commences only upon substantial depletion of hydronium and coincides with non-Faradaic CO2 uptake via carbonation. Doping Ag with Pt to promote hydronium consumption via efficient H2 evolution serves to lower the overpotential for CO2RR onset in scanning voltammetry experiments by ~1 V. These findings together indicate that interfacial alkalinization is a pre-requisite for, rather than merely a consequence of CO2RR, and that the primary role of the supporting electrolyte cations is to establish a non-equilibrium interfacial ionic environment depleted in hydronium ions. The findings imply a putative mechanistic model in which hydronium ions serve to inhibit CO2 activation at coinage metal surfaces.

Coherences encode critical information about the phase and dynamics of a system, and their interaction with its environment. Particularly, the ultrafast charge transfer process between electron donor and acceptor species in functional energy materials is influenced by vibronic coherences. A key limitation arises from the dephasing of coherences due to dissipation, causing loss of information and limiting applications of molecular systems. Extending and controlling coherence lifetimes would enable the rational design of smarter materials with optimised properties. Here we introduce a novel idea using chirped excitations as a pathway to extend quantum coherence lifetimes, enhancing their robustness against dissipation. A detailed analysis of the light-induced molecular quantum dynamics and wave packet evolution from first-principles models constructed at the donor\u2013acceptor heterojunction of an organic photovoltaic blend is discussed. We demonstrate that tuning the chirp of the excitation pulse, vibronic coherence lifetimes can be extended up to the picosecond timescale. Chirped excitations also enable tunable spatial localisation of the induced wave packet, with localisation controlled by the chirp intensity. These effects are observed consistently across different donor\u2013acceptor adducts selected from the molecular dynamics structure of the blend. Our results introduce a new degree of freedom for coherent control in molecular systems, offering a promising pathway toward the development of advanced functional energy materials and applications in molecular quantum information science.

A high fraction of such chemicals poses a wide array of health risks for humans by affecting various adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Carcinogenicity has been one of the most alarming adverse effects exhibited by these chemicals, which affects millions worldwide.  For the efficient identification and safe disposal of such agricultural and industrial chemicals, it becomes necessary to quickly and easily determine toxicity and fill toxicity data gaps.  In this study, we have developed multiple Machine Learning (ML) regression-based models that quantitatively predict the Oral Slope Factor (OSF) and Inhalation Slope Factor (ISF) of chemicals, identifying and prioritizing carcinogenicity risks. At first, we have developed Partial Least Squares (PLS) Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models. Aiming to further enhance the robustness and external predictivity of the models and better utilize the available chemical space, we have developed similarity-driven quantitative Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (q-RASAR) models.

However, due to the lack of non-rubber components such as phospholipids and proteins, the mechanical properties of SR, such as strength and toughness, are far inferior to those of NR. It is reasonable to assume that the mechanical properties of rubbers are largely governed by chain networks. The coexistence of physical entanglements and chemical crosslinks makes it difficult to distinguish their respective contributions. We elucidate the influence of physical entanglement using a series of model mixtures consisting of ultrahigh-molecular-weight (UHMW) uncross-linked rubber with its chemical identical unentangled oligomers. The concentration of physical entanglements can be quantitatively controlled and determined using rheological measurements. Uniaxial tensile results reveal that intense entanglement network limits the maximum draw ratio of rubber, while slightly reducing the entanglement concentration could promote their elongation behavior. Due to the lack of stress transmitters, mixtures with higher amount of oligomer fraction become brittle and soft. Combined with true stress-strain curves analysis, in situ synchrotron Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD) results provide conclusive evidence that the stretching induced crystallization (SIC) is delayed at higher strains with decreasing UHMW polymer content and is inversely proportional to the entanglement concentration.

The crystal edges exhibit faster attachment rates, while the centers grow more slowly, resulting in a highly unusual morphology.

As a consequence of the vast and sparsely explored landscape of potential catalyst systems, exploitation of the potential of simple metal and organic catalysts has been limited. Here, we exploit an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven discovery framework that uniquely integrates Bayesian optimization (BO), large language models (LLMs), and high-throughput robotics to accelerate the search for Lewis acid-base catalysts for PET glycolysis. Beginning with a literature-guided baseline, BO leveraged LLM-derived semantic embeddings of chemical knowledge to navigate a high-dimensional catalyst space of 11,160 possible systems, systematically identifying promising candidates beyond the initial state-of-the-art. The LLM further analysed experimental results to generate interpretable, data-driven hypotheses, guiding new experiments that surpassed the baseline performance. These insights enabled inductive, human-led extrapolation beyond the predefined chemical space, resulting in the discovery of a zinc pivalate/N,N'-diethylethylenediamine catalyst system achieving a 95% BHET yield in 20 minutes, with robust performance maintained upon scale-up. Mechanistic analysis revealed a synergistic dual-site activation mechanism and facilitated the derivation of transferable design principles for acid\u2013base catalysis. All experiments were executed on a fully autonomous AI-Chemist platform, seamlessly integrating automated reaction setup, execution, and NMR spectroscopy-based analysis. This work demonstrates that combining automation, AI, and human intuition enables a progression from data-driven optimization to truly out-of-sample, unexpected discovery in chemical research.

Initial sediment was composed of either fresh or aged organic matter (OM), and was fed with environmentally relevant, low Se concentrations and filtered lake water. We monitored Se concentration as well as speciation along with pH and the concentrations of dissolved OM, NO3-, NO2-, Fe(II), SO42- and HS- in the outflow of FTRs during 8 experimental phases along increasing Se concentrations. All experiments sequestered a large proportion of Se. Fresh, labile OM removed 50% more Se than aged, more recalcitrant OM. Along with a highest proportion of reduced redox-sensitive species in the reactors with fresh OM, this result is consistent with reducing conditions promoting Se sequestration. Inflowing selenite was sequestered to a larger extent than inflowing selenate. Lastly, only selenate reduction responded strongly to temperature. At 100 nM inflow, selenate was sequestered at a rate of 92 pmol cm-3 d-1 at 23\u00b0C, which lowered to 80 pmol cm-3 d-1  at 4\u00b0C. Outflow Se speciation for selenate reduction experiments comprised mostly of organic Se species at 23\u00b0C and, in contrast, solely of selenate at 4\u00b0C. We hypothesize that selenate reduction proceeded via microbial processes, in line with reactions catalyzed by enzymes being temperature dependent. Overall, our findings suggest that the mobilisation and warming of the boreal and permafrost carbon pools may increase the capacity of aquatic environments to sequester Se, lowering its bioavailability.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Geochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among the loads of materials explored for scaffold development, polymeric hydrogels have gathered exceptional interest due to their high-water content, biomimetic mechanical properties, and versatile functionalization potential. Hydrogels provide a three-dimensional (3D) hydrated environment conducive to cellular activities such as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, making them ideal candidates for regenerative applications . Over time, the hydrogel platform has expanded into nanoscale and microscale domains, giving rise to nanogels and microgels\u2014engineered particles that offer advantages such as injectability, controlled drug release, and tailored microenvironments  While traditional bulk hydrogels are excellent as static scaffolds, nanogels and microgels provide dynamic interactions, injectable formulations, and customizable architectures, enabling a shift toward minimally aggressive TE strategies. \nRecent innovations in polymer chemistry, such as click chemistry, controlled radical polymerizations (e.g., Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT), Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP)), Michael addition, and enzymatic crosslinking, have allowed the precise fabrication of hydrogels with tunable properties.  Emerging fabrication techniques, including microfluidics, 3D printing, and electrospinning, have further expanded the design flexibility, enabling spatially organized, heterogeneous constructs resembling the complex architecture of native tissues.  Furthermore, stimuli-responsive hydrogels that react to pH, temperature, enzymes, or mechanical forces have been developed to achieve on-demand therapeutic delivery, adaptive mechanical performance, and self-healing capabilities. The evolution from simple passive hydrogels to intelligent and interactive systems marks a pivotal shift in the field, aligning more closely with the dynamic nature of living tissues.  Comparatively, nanogels and microgels bridge critical gaps in hydrogel technologies by offering enhanced surface area, controlled porosity, modularity, and precision in therapeutic delivery. Nanogels, owing to their small size, easily penetrate biological barriers and can be engineered for targeted delivery,  while microgels can assemble into macroscopic scaffolds, allowing cell encapsulation and modular tissue construction.  Hybrid systems, combining nanogels and microgels within bulk hydrogels, represent a cutting-edge strategy to achieve multifunctional tissue scaffolds. \nThough researchers are exploring the individual advancement of bulk hydrogels as well as nano and micro gels in tissue engineering applications , an integration of the roles of hydrogels, nanogels, and microgels within a unified framework for tissue regeneration has not been discussed till now.

Here we employed Au9 clusters and Au101 nanoparticles supported on sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (SCN) to study the size effects on the photocatalytic performance in H2O2 synthesis. Au101/SCN exhibits the highest photoactivity with H2O2 production rate 19.5 mM h-1 g-1 followed by SCN (16.2 mM h-1 g-1) and Au9/SCN (13.6 mM h-1 g-1). Transient photocurrent response and photoluminescence spectroscopy indicate that gold loaded SCN (both Au9/SCN and Au101/SCN) has higher efficiency of charge carrier generation and separation compared to pure SCN. A kinetic analysis revealed that Au9/SCN catalyzes the fastest H2O2 decomposition (high kd) leading to a reduced overall H2O2 yield despite having higher charge generation and separation efficiency than SCN. The findings from this work show that better charge carrier generation, separation and transfer alone is not enough to warrant higher photoactivity in H2O2 synthesis because the rate of H2O2 decomposition supersedes the charge carrier properties.

Using density-functional theory (DFT) and real-time time-dependent DFT simulations, we demonstrate that spin-selective charge transfer across van der Waals layers, enabled by type-II bipolar band alignment, offers a robust way to control the magnetic order on the femtosecond timescale. In a representative CrSBr/CrSCl heterostructure, an antiferromagnetic-to-ferrimagnetic transition can be triggered within 40-56 fs under laser excitation above 4.2\u202feV, generating a net magnetic moment of ~1 \u00b5B per unit cell. The transition originates from a spin-flip charge transfer from spin-up valence states in CrSBr into spin-down conduction states in CrSCl. The resulting asymmetric demagnetization stabilizes residual spin polarization in CrSCl and induces a net magnetic moment. Additionally, electronic anisotropy facilitates an optically polarization-dependent charge redistribution, showing the main contribution from surface Cl atoms upon b-polarized excitation, while under a-polarized excitation the donation stems from interfacial Cr atoms. Our findings of spin-selective interlayer charge flow based on band alignment and symmetry breaking present a general mechanism for ultrafast optical control of magnetic order in low-dimensional materials.

Therefore, pyrazine-based multi-carbazoles [1-3] were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods. The compounds' simulated electronic and photophysical features agree with the experimental observations. All compounds show blue emission lies at 2.77, 2.68, and 2.62 eV, respectively.

Automated approaches for optimal model selection based on the available data therefore become critical. In this work, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based approach is developed for model selection by leveraging the linearity of the CALPHAD model with\nrespect to its parameters to convert the model selection and fitting to a LASSO minimization problem.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies that determine hyperfine coupling constants and g-tensor values are essential tools for investigating the local and global electronic structure of these compounds.

Here we present a curated database of 22 molecular Mo complexes with well-defined structures and EPR parameters and investigate quantum chemical approaches to determine optimal protocols for computing 95Mo hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) and g values of Mo(V) compounds. It is shown that the SARC all-electron basis sets developed for the Douglas\u2013Kroll\u2013Hess (DKH) Hamiltonian can be used without any adaptation also for the exact-2-component (X2C) Hamiltonian and require no modifications to produce excellent and converged results for both HFCs and g values. The dependence of EPR parameters on the functional is studied in detail. Double-hybrid functionals and global hybrids with high percentage of exact exchange are top performers for 95Mo HFCs, with PBE0-DH achieving the best agreement with experiment. The DFT results on HFCs are compared with values obtained by coupled cluster theory with the domain-based local pair natural orbital approach (DLPNO-CCSD) and we show that the latter falls short in terms of accuracy and consistency compared to the best performing functionals for the designated set of compounds. Smaller differentiation among functionals is observed for the calculation of g-tensors, with double hybrids being surpassed by several global and range-separated hybrid functionals, although PBE0-DH is still a top performer and can thus be recommended as the most reliable DFT approach overall for describing both valence and core properties of Mo compounds.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Also examined was a set of N,N-diaryl-1,4-diazabutadiene dianion-coordinated triel(I) anions. For four of the five series, the ionization potential of the Ga-based lone pairs was found to be nearly 1 eV or more higher than that of Al-based lone pairs in similar species; the IPs for In were found to hover around the values calculated for Ga.

However, current paraptosis agents face critical challenges, including poor targeting specificity, limited imaging capability, and low therapeutic efficacy. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel approach by functionalizing the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) unit at the meso position of xanthene dyes, enabling the synthesis of two sterically hindered regioisomeric fluorescent paraptosis-inducing agents (m-TSX and p-TSX) for mitochondria-targeted chemo-photodynamic anticancer therapy. These agents exhibited strong near-infrared (NIR) emissions (~663 nm) with a quantum yield of up to 82.9%.

Comparative studies of the meta and para-substituted regioisomers revealed that the metasubstituted m-TSX exhibited superior ROS generation and anticancer behavior. m-TSX effectively induced Alix/ATF4-regulated paraptosis, along with apoptosis and necrosis, while also triggering GPX4/SLC7A11-regulated ferroptosis under low-power 655 nm laser (0.1 W/cm2) irradiation, leading to effective cancer cell growth inhibition.

However, predicting their ionization states in aqueous solutions with added salt remains challenging due to the interplay between long-range Coulomb interactions, conformational degrees of freedom and chemical equilibria. While flexible bead-spring models with an explicit ion treatment provide accurate results, they are computationally expensive. In contrast, Ising-like site-binding models can often be solved in a matter of seconds and a further speed-up is possible using exact reweighting techniques. Notably, these models neglect conformational degrees of freedom and rely on an implicit salt description. To address the question under which circumstances these approximations are justified, we compare a site-binding model to bead-spring models with implicit and explicit ion treatments. Our results show that under strong electrostatic coupling, an explicit ion treatment is critical for accurately capturing ionization behavior. In particular, both, the site-binding model, and the bead-spring model with implicit ion treatment, strongly overestimate correlations between monomers in this regime, leading to significant deviations from the explicit bead-spring model. Conversely, under weak coupling, which is realized in aqueous environments in the presence of monovalent salts, all three models yield reasonable ionization curves. Minor differences arise, with the implicit bead-spring model showing slightly stronger suppression of ionization, while the site-binding model aligns more closely with the explicit bead-spring model due to compensating errors in ion treatment and conformational flexibility. In summary, while all models are effective under weak coupling, the explicit ion treatment within the bead-spring model is essential for capturing accurate ionization behavior under strong coupling.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The results revealed a notable consistency in the effects of ions with a specific charge at one end of Sorensen's pH scale, compared to the influence of ions with the opposite charge at the other end. The data analysis demonstrated that the pH shift is primarily influenced by the electrostatic forces exerted by the ions and the concentration of ionic particles within the solution. Interestingly, this shift appeared to be independent of the degree of dissociation of either acetic acid or ammonia.\nThese results led to a reinterpretation of electrolytic dissociation. Therefore, I propose a theory that explains the behavior of electrolytes in aqueous solutions based on three premises: (i) electrolyte molecules, once dissolved in water, fully dissociate; (ii) when the electrolyte contains H\u207a or OH\u207b ions, those species become part of the solvent and propagate throughout the entire solution; and (iii) the movement of these charged species (H\u207a or OH\u207b) is significantly influenced by the electrostatic forces exerted by the ions in solution, as described by classical physics.\nThis theory is consistent with the experimental observations and clarifies the unusual impact of the common ion. Furthermore, these considerations support the notion that water contains a persistent population of molecules resulting from its auto-dissociation, which propagates throughout the entire volume of the solution.\n", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Drugs that enhance the action of GABAARs are used to treat epilepsy, anxiety and other conditions but their therapeutic action is often limited by sedation because their binding sites are the same as those used by sedatives and general anesthetics. With the exception of the benzodiazepines, which only act on synaptic GABAARs that contain one \u03b3-subunit, little progress has been made on this problem. Recently, it was shown that certain spiro-barbiturates can reverse the action of anesthetics on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs.

In this work, we report the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel spiro-hydantoins, none of which are positive allosteric modulators. They retain the property of the spiro-barbiturates to reverse the action of anesthetics and some of them do so with higher affinity and efficacy than achieved with spirobarbiturates. Furthermore, the reversal action on \u03b13\u03b23\u03b32 receptors occurs in the submicromolar range, which represents a 200-fold selectivity over \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32 receptors.

CH-bonding receptors, which rely on nonclassical CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5anion hydrogen bonds, offer a pH-independent alternative to traditional hydrogen-bonding hosts; however, their design is challenged by the inherently weak nature of CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5anion interactions. This study presents modified resorcin[4]arenes as versatile scaffolds to address this challenge. By the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the upper rim, we effectively convert electron-rich resorcin[4]arenes into potent anion receptors. A series of resorcin[4]arenes bearing -Br, -CHO, -NO2, and -CN substituents exhibit a systematic enhancement in anion binding affinity, reaching a record value for the CN-substituted receptor: Ka (Cl\u207b, THF) = 7\u00d710\u2075 M\u22121. The logKa values of this series of receptors correlate strongly with the electrostatic potential (ESP) at the anion binding site, calculated by DFT methods. In addition, incorporating hydroxyl-terminated alkyl chains at the lower rim promotes the formation of higher-order complexes and further boosts anion binding, even in competitive aqueous\u2013organic media. Notably, these hydroxyalkyl-footed receptors display exceptional selectivity for HSO4\u2212, with a selectivity factor of 17 over similar tetrahedral oxyanions. Transmembrane anion transport studies in large unilamellar vesicles reveal that the nitro-substituted resorcin[4]arene is by far the most effective chloride transporter in this series, followed by the CN-substituted one, emphasizing that the most strongly binding receptors are not necessarily the most efficient transporters.

We employed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations combined with state-of-the-art multireference quantum mechanical calculations to understand the photophysical properties and mechanisms of these diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes. The energetically accessible lowest excitations are nNN(\u03c3CN) \u2192 \u03c0* and range from 3.94 \u2013 3.97 eV. From the >292 trajectories, the reaction proceeds through a dynamically concerted but asynchronous denitrogenation reactions.

In the first cluster, the methylene bridge is fully inverted relative to the reactant geometry. In the second cluster, the inversion is only partial, with one of the carbon atoms in the methylene bridge inverted relative to the reactant. We identified each cluster's corresponding minimum energy conical intersection (MECI), indicating at least two possible S1/S0-MECIs.  Our dynamics simulations illustrate that inversion begins in the excited state immediately after the first \u03c3CN bond breaks. This inversion is driven by the atomic momenta acquired after the bond breaks. These dynamical effects promote the formation of the inverted housane, thereby explaining the observed selectivities.

Its abnormal activation is closely related to various myeloproliferative neoplasms and inflammatory diseases. Developing selective JAK2 inhibitors is an important direction in drug discovery. Accurate prediction of compound inhibitory activity (pIC50) against JAK2 is crucial for accelerating the discovery and optimization of lead compounds. Objective: This study aims to utilize public resources from the ChEMBL database, combined with machine learning methods, to build a computational model capable of efficiently and accurately predicting the pIC50 values of JAK2 inhibitors. Methods: We collected compounds targeting human JAK2 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL2971) and their IC50 (nM) activity data from the ChEMBL database. After data cleaning (retaining only precise values with standard_relation = '=') and standardization (converting IC50 to pIC50, retaining the average pIC50 for duplicate compounds), a dataset containing 5546 compounds was finally obtained. RDKit (version 2022.9.5) was used to calculate Morgan fingerprints (radius=2, 2048 bits), MACCS Keys fingerprints (167 bits), and 13 physicochemical and topological descriptors. Based on feature importance calculated during the data processing phase (derived from preliminary model evaluation), the top 350 features were selected. However, due to the absence of some features in the current dataset, the final model used 345 features. The dataset was randomly split into training (n=4436) and test sets (n=1110) at an 80:20 ratio. The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, version 3.0.0) algorithm was used to build the prediction model, and hyperparameters (learning_rate, max_depth, subsample, colsample_bytree, gamma, reg_alpha, reg_lambda) were optimized using 5-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV. An early stopping strategy was employed during the final model training to prevent overfitting. Results: After hyperparameter optimization, the final XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive performance on the independent test set, achieving a coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) of 0.7184, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.5968, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.4593. Performance metrics on the training set (R\u00b2=0.8978) also indicated a good model fit, and the gap between training and test set performance was within an acceptable range, suggesting that overfitting was effectively controlled. Conclusion: This study successfully constructed an XGBoost-based prediction model for JAK2 inhibitor pIC50. Utilizing easily accessible molecular descriptors, the model demonstrated high prediction accuracy and robustness on an external test set. This model holds promise as an efficient virtual screening tool to aid the early discovery and optimization process of JAK2 inhibitors.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Further, the environmental footprint was notably reduced when mechanochmistry was empolyed (i.e., ~ 800-fold reduction in the environmental factor (E-factor) and ~ 200-fold in the process mass intensity (PMI)). This work also determined that the mechanochemical method did not alter the in vitro growth inhibtion activity.This study provides new insights into the mechanochemical synthesis of six Pt(II)-heteroleptic complexes: PHENSS, 56MESS, 47MESS, 4MESS, 3478MESS and 5ClSS, and sets the foundation for scalable and sustainable routes towards heteroleptic metal complexes with potential applications across diverse fields.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Solid State Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We implemented and evaluated a matrix-based image color correction methodology using a color reference chart, reducing inter-device and lighting-dependent variations by 65-70% (quantified by the color change metric, \u2206E).

Unusual, amino-acid-specific phosphorescence signatures from SNI-guided investigations prompted us to examine the frozen samples with cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), which directly revealed uniform nanoaggregates. These nanoaggregates create distinct local microenvironments that influence photophysical properties of SNI, inducing distinct ground-state conformations that lead to conformation-dependent phosphorescence. Complementary theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and temperature-variable Raman spectra suggest that amino acids, such as alanine, undergo a temperature-dependent proton-transfer process from their ammonium to carboxylate groups, enhancing their hydrophobicity and triggering aggregation upon freezing.

To address these challenges and in order to suppress cavitation, this research proposes a new, nature-inspired solution: adding Cav Edge Riblets (CER), which are tiny grooves similar to those found on shark skin, and reshaping the trailing edge of the hydrofoil with a 70-degree bevel.

While X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is widely used, the artifacts and distortions induced by standard pre-sample treatments, ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, and X-ray beam exposure often prevent a complete and consistent chemical analysis of SEI layers in their native state. In this study, we present a cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Cryo-XPS) approach, integrated with residual gas analysis (RGA), to investigate the metastable and volatile intermediate constituents of the SEI layer. Our findings reveal that, contrary to previous studies, Li2CO3 and LiF are not the main SEI components but rather relatively stable remanent components that withstood the traditional XPS experimental conditions. Instead, metastable organic carbonates and organic intermediate products predominantly constitute the SEI. We identify lithium fluorophosphate (LiPOxFy) a decomposition product of LiPF6 as one of the primary inorganic constituents, which steadily decomposes to fluoride (LiF) and releases POF\u2083 upon UHV conditions. Hence, widely observed LiF phases in SEI layer are likely due to the decomposition of residual LiPF6 and LiPOxFy facilitated by UHV and X-ray exposure during traditional XPS analysis. Overall, our Cryo-XPS analysis, performed across varying thermal conditions and complemented by residual gas analyzer insights, unveils the chemical composition throughout the depth of the SEI layers revealing previously invisible components and significantly enhancing our understanding of their chemical evolution in Li-ion batteries.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Energy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

The model captures reaction kinetics by leveraging recursive relationships between reactant or product concentrations at different times, which is learned through a machine learning algorithm, rather than traditional concentration-time equations. Moreover, we integrate a multiple estimation strategy into the model for performance enhancement. This model demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy, few-shot learning capability, robustness, interpretability, and application scope on an experimental dataset from Fenton reactions of 12 phenolic compounds. Moreover, MERML enabled data-driven kinetic analysis, including reaction condition optimization, analysis of rate-influencing variables, and assisted mechanistic interpretation.

This paper gives a base for understanding the diversity of GP achievements performed for 30 years written in an alternative review on GP (i.e., to appear in Briefings in Functional Genomics (in process)), especially underscoring the importance of the spiddos parameter for calculating closeness of species and constructing genome database. \nSpiddos contains such a kind of information termed as SIOWS (sequence information obtained without sequencing), which is essentially unique and important for the GP technology, derived from the sequence-specific DNA melting phenomenon together with DNA melting theory. Succeedingly, one can understand why GP enables us to draw the sufficient amount of information without sequencing of genomic DNA.  This also explains why identification/classification of species can be so readily and universally done by GP. It requires the perspective on the nature of spiddos. Since this paper first provides detailed procedures of GP and in-depth theoretical explanation of the GP-related phenomena, a wide range of scientists (Bacteriology, Infectious Disease Medicine, Epidemiology, Environmental Science, Biodiversity Science,  Mutagen Research, Taxonomy, Bio-database Science, and others) can  engage in applications of GP, which is difficult without sufficient understanding of the method and theory of GP.

The compounds bind to the C-terminal Kelch domain of Keap1 and occupy the Nrf2 binding pocket, causing Nrf2 to accumulate and increase the expression of a battery of antioxidant response element genes. The binding modes of the compounds have been characterised through a series of X-ray crystallography and binding assay studies. In this work we have evaluated a series of symmetric and asymmetric naphthalene bis-sulfonamides and identified a tight binding acid/tetrazole derivative 25.

Although some materials exhibit an intrinsic defect tolerance that avoids fast recombination channels, there are few examples for metal oxides. We investigate the water-splitting photocatalyst SrTiO3, where photocatalytic performance is enhanced by extrinsic Al dop-ing. We propose that defect tolerance emerges through a passivation effect that effectively eliminates in-gap states and non-radiative re-combination. First-principles defect calculations show that oxygen vacancies are the primary defect species in SrTiO3 under oxygen-poor synthetic conditions, which provide in-gap deep states that are active for carrier capture. Al substitutions are preferred at Ti sites adjacent to the oxygen vacancy, forming [VO-AlTi] defect complexes. As the oxygen vacancy in-gap state is derived from Ti 3d\u2013Ti 3d interactions across the vacancy, substituting Ti by Al deactivates this interaction and eliminates the in-gap state. The absence of valence d orbitals in Al is key for in-gap state reduction, as supported by the consideration of other dopants such as Sc. Our study illustrates how an orbital-wise understanding of defect states can enable doping strategies to achieve defect tolerance in materials like SrTiO3, paving the way for improved solar-to-energy conversion.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Solid State Chemistry; Theory - Inorganic; Photocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Understanding their mode of operation could inspire the development of more efficient synthetic catalysts. In this study, we scrutinize the electrostatic environment surrounding nitrogenase\u2019s active site, the so-called M-cluster. Strikingly, we observe that all types of M-clusters exhibit similar trends, with distinct patterns around the individual metal sites that have been proposed as potential N2-coordination sites.

Operation of electronic biosensors in bodily fluids is challenging because of the short Debye length (\u03bbD) in high ionic strength media. The receptor unit attached to the sc-SWCNT is a crucial component of the biosensor, and the sensor performance depends on efficient signal transduction between the receptor and the sc-SWCNT. In this work, we grew Au nanoparticles (NPs) on sc-SWCNTs sorted using a copolymer of fluorene and 2,2\u2019-bipyridine (BPy), poly(9,9-di-n-dodecylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl-alt-2,2\u2032-bipyridine-5,5\u2032) (PFBPy-5,5\u2019). Au NPs were anchored to the BPy ligands in the polymer backbone, facilitating efficient electrical connection between the Au NPs and the sc-SWCNTs. Label-free cortisol sensors were prepared by coupling a thiol-terminated cortisol aptamer to the Au NPs and integrating the Aptamer/AuNP/sc-SWCNT@PFBPy-5,5\u2019 complex into an EGFET. The sensor exhibited a concentration-dependent increase in source-drain current upon increasing cortisol concentration from 1 \u2013 1000 nM. A control sensor was prepared using sc-SWCNTs sorted with a fluorene homopolymer, poly(9,9-dodecylfluorene) (PFDD), which does not have a ligand to which Au NPs can anchor. The control Aptamer/AuNP/sc-SWCNT@PFDD cortisol sensor only showed a weak concentration-dependent response to cortisol. A further control was prepared using sc-SWCNTs@PFDD to which the aptamer was covalently attached via defect carboxylic acids on the nanotube\u2019s sidewall, without Au NPs. The Covalent-Aptamer/sc-SWCNT@PFDD control sensor did exhibit a concentration-dependent response to cortisol, albeit to a lesser extent than the Aptamer/AuNP/sc-SWCNT@PFBPy-5,5\u2019 system. The results indicate that the tight-anchoring of the Au NPs in the Aptamer/AuNP/sc-SWCNT@PFBPy-5,5\u2019 system provides a crucial contribution to the proposed sensing mechanism: (1) upon cortisol recognition the aptamer undergoes a structure-switch where the negatively charged backbone is brought within or near the Debye length at the Au NP surface, altering the interfacial capacitance and electrostatically gating the Au NP, and (2) efficient signal transfer between the Au NPs and sc-SWCNTs@PFBPy-5,5\u2019.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Carbon-based Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Using density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals corrections and hybrid functional validation, we thoroughly examine how the physicochemical properties of Ti2C MXenes are affected by four prototypical surface terminations (\u2013F, \u2013O, \u2013Cl, \u2013OH). The thermodynamic stability of all functionalized systems is confirmed by cohesive and formation energy analyses; the lowest formation energies are found in Ti2CO2 and Ti2CCl2 . Dynamical stability across configurations is further confirmed by phonon dispersion cal- culations, which show no imaginary modes throughout the Brillouin zone. Significant differences in work function (2.13\u20136.30 eV) and quantum capacitance behavior are caused by termination- dependent modulation of the density of states close to the Fermi level, according to electronic structure analysis.

Despite extensive studies, the initial photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from a neighboring tryptophan residue to FAD remains unclear due to the complexity of simulating all-atom dynamics in excited states, particularly regarding the roles of non-adiabatic pathways and protein environment on the reaction kinetics and quantum efficiency of the ET. To address this gap, we performed extensive non-adiabatic and adiabatic dynamics simulations with on-the-fly multireference ab initio electronic structure calculations of Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 1 (AtCRY1).

Here, we developed an organic reaction-diffusion system based on a thiol-based chemical reaction network (CRN), rationally designed to generate stationary patterns. The CRN features autocatalysis coupled with both rapid direct inhibition and a negative feedback loop, employing azocarboxamides as thiol oxidants. We used disulfide-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogels to modulate thiol diffusion and optimized the molecular structures of reactants to finely tune their reactivity and diffusivity. Patterns formed within a 12-mm hydrogel disk supplied continuously with reactants from a well-mixed reservoir through a nanoporous membrane. The resulting dot, line, and net patterns exhibited characteristic feature sizes around 1 mm. While the membrane permeability primarily influenced the pattern type, the reactivity and diffusivity of reactants determined feature sizes. Experimental results were further validated by numerical modeling. Our findings illustrate that molecular-level design can yield complex pattern-forming CRNs from organic building blocks.

The elasticity of the internal liquid crystalline mesophase often reshapes the droplet geometry, resulting in structures such as filaments, tactoids, tori, and surface facets. Our recent work demonstrated that by slowly cooling into the binodal from a wellmixed state, the dynamics of this liquid-liquid crystal phase separation (LLCPS) can give rise to striking filamentous networks of smectic condensates. Here, we investigate how choice of mesogen, solvent, and concentration can dramatically alter these networks. Using X-ray scattering, we observe that the solvent swells the smectic layers, seemingly reducing the smectic layer's bend modulus, altering the geometric structure of the network. Consistent with this interpretation, samples with a higher smectic layer swelling exhibit more geometrically-complex structures that require higher smectic layer bending to form. We further demonstrate that the formation of filaments and networks does not occur in all systems exhibiting coexistence of a smectic and isotropic phase. Instead, we only observe filament and network formation when the smectic phase develops directly from the isotropic phase\u2014further highlighting the importance of path-dependence in forming these non-equilibrium structures.

Inspired by advancements in lipid nanoparticles, we describe a new chemical approach to deliver multi-tailed DNA surfactant conjugates with the potential for improved endosomal escape efficiency through enhanced membrane destabilizing properties.  Previously we reported the successful delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides to cells using single tailed DNA surfactant conjugates (DSCs) formed from enzyme degradable crosslinked micelles that we refer to as Nucleic Acid Nanocapsules (NANs). This work features the rational design of a new asymmetric set of hydrophobic crosslinkers using a synthetic approach which incorporates one or two alkyl chains and an esterase-labile group into a nonionic surfactant flanked by clickable azides. Through the covalent incorporation of these new crosslinkers into micelles and upon their enzymatic degradation within the cell, multi-tailed DNA surfactant conjugates are released which we show have superior transfection capabilities over single tailed DNA surfactant conjugates. We show that the multi-tailed DNA surfactant conjugates improve mRNA delivery and protein expression in vitro, as well as exhibit enhanced membrane disruption capabilities as seen by their dispersion in cells and through molecular dynamics simulations. Our chemical approach enables the formation of multi-tailed surfactants in situ, post micelle assembly, adding to the membrane destabilizing capacity of the delivered oligonucleotides.

This study also shows, for the first time, that epsilonN2-Ru0 increases with increasing electron density of the Ru0 nanoparticles, as monitored by the position of the maximum of the absorption band of the N2 stretching vibration at about 2200 cm-1 (nuN2-Ru0), with a remarkable correlation between epsilonN2-Ru0 and nuN2-Ru0. The epsilonN2-Ru0 data are two orders of magnitude smaller than the previously reported integrated molar absorption coefficients of CO (epsilonCO-Ru0).

Moreover, in brine splitting H2 evolution coupled with oxidation of chloride (Cl-) to value-added chlorine (Cl2) and/or hypochlorous acid (HOCl) can simultaneously benefit energy and environmental sectors. Cl2 and HOCl are widely used in bleaching, disinfection, sanitization and sterilization in a medical sector, safe drinking water and swimming pools owing to its strong oxidizing and antibacterial properties. The mainstream industrial production employs the chlor-alkali electrolysis of sodium chloride (NaCl) which requires significant energy input and releases enormous CO2. To achieve sustainable production of Cl2 and HOCl that reduces energy consumption and environmental impacts, photocatalytic (PC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology have been attempted as a green alternative. Importantly, PC and PEC enables on site production of Cl2/HOCl in remote areas which can circumvent the instability (decomposition), storage and transport issues. This article reviews the recent progress of PC and PEC production of Cl2/HOCl, catalytic materials, photocatalyst designs and their photocatalytic performance. The applications of in situ HOCl production in anti-bacterial treatment, ammonia removal, selective oxidation and conversion of organic compounds, and CO2 conversion are discussed. We also address the challenges in this area and highlight the prospects for future directions. All in all, we demonstrate that PC and PEC production of Cl2/HOCl serve as green and sustainable alternatives to the chlor-alkali process. This research area is still at infancy, and we hope this review article will garner the attention of researchers to contribute to this area leading to a step closer toward practical applications.

Strategies to increase its interlayer spacing are emerging and have been shown to improve ion intercalation capacity and kinetics. This work explores covalent thiol functionalization for controlling MoS2 interlayer spacing. Using a hydrothermal bottom-up synthesis, dithiolated molecules can be directly incorporated into the MoS2 lattice to act as pillars. Using a comprehensive combination of experiments and simulation, we investigate the influence of dithiol pillar loading on the emerging structure, pillar-host interaction and electrochemistry. Our results reveal clustering of pillars at low loading, leading to an inhomogeneous interlayer expansion. At high pillar loading, the formation of defective bonding configurations with excess sulfur is observed. Interlayer expansion leads to an increased electrochemical Li+ storage capacity with a maximum of 1.43 Li+ per MoS2. However, dithiols occupy storage sites and impede Li+ transport within the interlayer space, leading to unfavorable performance at high pillar loading. This underlines the importance of carefully adjusting the density of nanoconfined pillar molecules within the interlayer space.

Aqueous organic redox flow batteries are low-cost, long-duration energy storage devices that are in the process of being commercialized for this application; however, their operational lifetime is limited by electrolyte decomposition and crossover. These degradation processes are generally studied separately, so the relationship between the two is poorly understood. Previously, it had been assumed that the main contribution to battery capacity fade was electrochemical degradation of the electrolytes. Using the on-line 1H NMR crossover characterization method we developed previously, we reveal the first evidence for crossover-driven side reactions in redox flow batteries. If the impact of these side reactions is not considered, it will lead to an underestimation of crossover and its impacts on battery lifetime. We further introduce simple \u2018simulated-crossover\u2019 experiments to identify anolyte-catholyte combinations where these processes are occurring. Using these simulated-crossover experiments, we find that crossover-driven side reactions can be mitigated by avoiding the use of anolytes with hydroxyl functional groups when using ferrocyanide electrolytes.

Herein, the chemoselective oxygenation of a,\u03b2-unsaturated esters and diesters bearing remote C(sp3)-H bonds was studied through their reactions with H2O2 catalyzed by Mn-complexes and with ethyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (ETFDO), both in MeCN and in the strong hydrogen bond donor (HBD) fluorinated alcohols (RFOHs) 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) and nonafluoro tert-butyl alcohol (NFTBA). In MeCN, reaction of linear and branched esters with the H2O2/Mn(TIPSmcp) system delivered products deriving from remote oxygenation at tertiary or secondary C-H bonds, allylic ketonization and C=C bond epoxidation. In NFTBA, selectivity for oxygenation at remote over proximal sites significantly increased, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the relative importance of the epoxidation pathway. Similar trends were observed with ETFDO where however, epoxidation remained in most cases the predominat pathway and allylic oxygenation was never competing. These changes in chemoselectivity are rationalized in terms of a polarity enhancement effect via electronic deactivation of the proximal sites imparted by the ester group coupled to solvent hydrogen bonding. Introduction of a dialkyl 2-methylenemalonate unit strongly impacted on chemoselectivity, leading in RFOHs to exclusive formation of oxygenation products at the most remote site, completely suppressing epoxidation and allylic ketonization. The use of this group, in combination with NFTBA and a benzimidazole based catalyst (Mn(o,o-CF3bpebpdp), enabled moreover the exclusive hydroxylation at remote primary C-H bonds. Because 2-methylenemalonate units can be easily introduced on aldehyde functionalities and then transformed into a,\u03b2-unsaturated carboxylic acids, the careful control over chemoselectivity obtained through their use in combination with RFOHs provides a poweful strategy to be exploited in synthetically useful procedures.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ewen", "abstract": "The growth of tribofilms from the mechanochemical decomposition of lubricant additives is crucial to prevent wear of sliding metal surfaces. For some applications, such as electric vehicles and wind turbines, lubricants are can be exposed to electric fields, which may affect tribofilm growth. Experimental tribometer results have shown conflicting results regarding antiwear tribofilm growth and wear under external electric potentials. Moreover, the effect of electric fields on the mechanochemical decomposition of lubricant additives remains unclear. Here, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to study the mechanochemical growth of a polyphosphate tribofilm from trialkyl phosphate molecules under external electrostatic fields. The decomposition rate of phosphate esters increases exponentially with the applied stress and temperature. The electric field generally accelerates the molecular decomposition, both by enhancing the interfacial stress and reducing the steric hindrance for nucleophilic substitution. The Bell model is used to analyse the electro-, mechano- and temperature-dependent decomposition process. Under weak electric fields, the activation energy for molecular decomposition increases due to the competition between electric field- and shear-induced deformations. For stronger fields, the activation energy decreases linearly with increased electric field strength and this dominates over the shear-induced molecular rotation. The resultant non-monotonic variation in the activation energy for molecular decomposition with electric field strength explains the conflicting effects of electric potential on tribofilm growth observed experimentally. The activation volume decreases linearly with increasing electric field strength, indicating a reduced dependence of the decomposition on shear stress as the electric field dominates. Asymmetric tribofilm growth is observed between surfaces with external electric fields, which is consistent with the experimental observations.

By plotting the energy error, defined as the difference between the LAS-USCCSD and corresponding CASCI energies, against the inverse cluster amplitude selection threshold ($\\mathnormal{\\epsilon}^{-1}$) for polyene chains containing 2 to 5 $\\pi$-bond units, we establish a relationship between the energy error and the threshold.

Assessing such examples is important to determine the practical feasibility of quantum simulations for chemically realistic systems. Toward this goal, with this LAS-USCCSD algorithm we estimated the quantum resources required for simulating an active space of (30e,22o) in \\ce{[Cr_2(OH)_3(NH_3)_6]^{3+}}, a size that remains beyond the reach of current quantum simulators for accurate treatment.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Computing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we optimized LC-EIEIO-MS analysis for the rapid and detailed structural annotation of glycerides and phospholipids. We evaluated the effects of reaction times, accumulation times, and electron kinetic energies using lipid standards from multiple classes and at varying concentrations.

Herein, we elucidate the crucial role of Fe in MIS photoanodes for water oxidation under light. Our results demonstrate that not only does the presence of residual Fe affect the electrocatalytic properties but also strongly influences the photoanodes\u2019 junction energetics and photovoltaic properties. We show that the synergistic effects caused by Fe doping explain the high performance previously reported for these model photoanodes.

We investigate the elusive charge- compensation mechanisms and their impact on potential oxygen-dimer formation in a recently synthesised Li-rich cathode, Li2NiO3. Using state-of-the-art ab initio dynamical mean-field theory, we show that the excess capacity in Li2NiO3 comes from a combined Ni and O redox, unlike its layered counterpart LiNiO2, where O redox predominates. Moreover, we demonstrate O dimer formation via a plot of the electron localisation function for the first time, and attribute this formation to the higher oxidation state of O, even in the pristine material. Finally, we show that Li migration to the interlayer tetrahedral sites at the end of charge is potentially unlikely due to the end configuration being higher in energy and the stabilisation of the parent structure caused by O dimerization.

Melt-quenched and vapor-deposited glasses of 1,3,5-tris-(\u03b1-naphthyl)benzene (TNB) were obtained and studied by DSC and solution calorimetry. The difference between the solution enthalpies in benzene of the melt-vitrified and vapor-deposited glasses was consistent with the data on fictive temperatures obtained by DSC. The enthalpies of the amorphous thin films slowly deposited onto a cold substrate were substantially lower than those of the vitrified melts, agreeing with the recent studies of ultrastable glasses. The results of the study highlight the perspectives of solution calorimetry as a tool for studying the thermodynamic state of glasses that crystallize quickly on heating, including ultrastable ones, and its promising insights into the Kauzmann paradox.\n", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To understand the natural product and chemical composition of the eggs of this animal, which play a critical ecological role, we examined the metabolite profile of HSC egg extracts thoroughly using NMR and multiple mass spectrometric techniques. In the NMR analysis, maltose-type oligosaccharides, homarine (1), and glycine betaine (2) emerged as a source of the glycogen biosynthetic pathway. Nine amino acids were also identified, and five of them, threonine (4), leucine (7), valine (9), lysine (10), and arginine (11), were essential amino acids used by marine life. By using GC-MS to analyze fatty acid contents, palmitic acid and stearic acid (15) were identified as the major saturated fatty acids in the extracts, and palmitic acid was higher in surface eggs while stearic acid was higher in buried egg clutches. The unsaturated fatty acid profile was similar in the two types of eggs, including elaidic acid (13), oleic acid (14), and EPA. An LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that PC was found to be the primary membrane component of HSC eggs. The elemental composition of HSC egg powder was evaluated using ICP-MS and EA-IRMS. From ICP-MS, the metals Cd, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb were significantly higher in surface eggs, and the EA-IRMS analysis showed the carbon and nitrogen contents consistent with a detritivore lifestyle. Through the combination of NMR and MS techniques, we acquired a comprehensive metabolite profile of HSC eggs, which is important for advancing the developmental and conservation biology of HSC and understanding the ecological role of this keystone species.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Biochemical Analysis; Environmental Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report the construction of an oxidized carbon nitride (g-C3N4) matrix anchored with TiO2 nanoparticles via alkaline hydrothermal treatment. Under ultrasonication, the g-C3N4/TiO2 composite exhibits optimal performance under carefully controlled alkaline hydrothermal conditions. With a low concentration of Ba(OH)2 during hydrothermal treatment, Ba(OH)2 provides an alkaline medium, oxidizing the g-C3N4 species and introducing structural defects into the g-C3N4 framework. The disruption of the g-C3N4 matrix, along with its interaction with TiO2 nanoparticles, enhances the piezoelectric effect.

This study investigates such structure-property relationships between EVAs and their corresponding CANs containing dialkylamine-disulfide-based dynamic covalent cross-links. We characterized these EVA CANs via differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and swelling tests. Our results demonstrated that the crystallinity of EVA CANs decreased compared to their thermoplastic precursors. Swelling experiments revealed gel contents greater than 50%, with most EVA CANs showing values between 66% and 74%. DMA analysis indicated the robustness of the dynamically cross-linked EVAs; the effective cross-link density of EVA CANs increased with increasing vinyl acetate (VA) content yet decreased with increasing melt flow index (MFI) of the precursor EVAs, both results of which align with existing literature reports on thermoset EVAs. The dynamic covalent cross-linker BiTEMPS methacrylate facilitated the recyclability of each EVA CAN independent of the precursor EVA, and each recycled EVA CAN fully reproduced the thermomechanical properties of its predecessor.

In order to investigate the effect of the terminal group of the end-on ligand on the nanoparticle arrangements, three types of AuNPs were employed by using azobenzene ligands with three different terminal groups (ethyl, acetyl, and nitrile). The obtained AuNPs with ethyl group (Au-L1e/d) are in a weakly ordered state, those with acetyl group (Au-L2e) show a hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline phase upon heating, and those with nitrile groups (Au-L3e) are highly aggregated and do not melt even when heated up to 220\u00b0C. According to DFT calculations, the dipole moments of each ligand are in the order of ethyl < acetyl < nitrile. The moderate magnitude of the dipole moment is necessary for the regular arrangement of the AuNPs. Au-L1e/d and Au-L2e exhibit trans-cis isomerization of the azobenzene ligands upon photoirradiation both in dispersed solution and in the film state. Furthermore, they also exhibit a gradual color change from orange to purple in solution, when the solutions are allowed to stand at rt for 24 h after photoirradiation. By means of tunneling electron microscopy (TEM), it is found that the nanoparticles irreversibly coalesce into a non-uniform morphology after being left to stand for 24 h. Prior to photoirradiation, the ligands are found to be densely packed on the gold surface; this dense packing may be responsible for the desorption after the isomerization to cis forms and the particle coalescence.", "date": "2025-05-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While \u00b5 is a key factor of TFT performance and can be tackled by molecular design of OSCs, threshold voltage (Vth) significantly impacts operational voltage and power consumption in integrated circuits and is typically controlled by device engineering. A traditional Vth tuning method involves interfacial modifications of gate-dielectric surface by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with different dipolar characters. Yet, the SAM is less compatible with printed electronics using polymeric gate dielectrics. Therefore, controlling Vth through OSC material design is of interest. This work demonstrates that Vth in sin-gle-crystal OSCs can be effectively modulated by engineering the dipolar character of side-chain substituents which are widely employed in solution-processable OSCs. To validate this concept, we focused on 3,4,9,10-benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8-gh]quinolinetetracarboxylic diimide (BQQDI) derivatives because they have formed compara-ble layered brickwork packing structures mostly irrespective of the side-chain structures. Stemming from the bench-marked, phenethyl-substituted BQQDI (PhC2\u2212BQQDI), here, three PhC2\u2212BQQDI analogues with mono-fluorination at the ortho, meta or para position of the phenyl ring were synthesized. These compounds were designed to maintain isostruc-tural crystal packing while varying the dipolar character of the side chains. In solution-processed single-crystal TFTs, obvious Vth shifts depending on the fluorine substitution position were found. By crystal structure and computational analyses, the Vth shift was correlated with the dipolar character of the side chains at the OSC\u2212gate dielectric interface. This side-chain-engineered dipolar effect is not only useful for Vth control in TFTs but also proposes new avenues for de-signing high-performance OSCs and various thin-film devices with tailored interfacial properties.", "date": "2025-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Aggregates and Assemblies; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Thus, highly sensitive gas sensors that are capable of continuously monitoring HCHO are in demand. The electric conductivity of semiconducting nanomaterials (e.g., single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)) is susceptible to chemical substances adsorbed on the surface; thereby portable and highly sensitive chemiresistive gas sensors, including ones for HCHO, have been developed so far. However, when monitoring very trace gases (<1 ppm) involved in ambient air, most chemiresistive sensors could face practical issues, including false responses to interfering effects (e.g., fluctuations of room temperature and humidity), baseline drift, and the necessity to access purge gas. Here we report an actuator-driven, purge-free chemiresistive gas sensor that is capable of reliably detecting 0.05 ppm HCHO in the air. The sensor is composed of an HCHO\u2192HCl converter (powdery hydroxylamine salt, HA), an HCl detector (SWCNT-based chemiresistor), and an HCl blocker (thin plastic plate). Upon exposure to HCHO, the HA emits HCl vapor, which diffuses onto the adjacent SWCNT and increases its electric conductivity through p-doping. Meanwhile, inserting a plastic plate between HA and SWCNTs makes the conductivity of SWCNTs insensitive to HCHO. Thus, under periodic actuation (insertion and removal) of the plastic plate, HCHO can be reliably detected in a wide concentration range (0.05-15 ppm), with excellent selectivity over other volatile organic compounds. The actuator-driven system is beneficial because the purge gas is unnecessary for sensor recovery and baseline correction. Moreover, since the response to HCHO is synchronized with the actuation timing of the plate, even small (~0.8%) responses to 0.05 ppm HCHO can be clearly separated from larger noise responses (>1%) caused by interfering effects and baseline drift. We believe that this work provides substantial insights into the practical implementation of nanomaterial-based chemiresistive gas sensors.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Carbon-based Materials; Analytical Chemistry - General; Environmental Analysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we report a novel approach for chemical analysis of serum hydroxyurea levels by using an array of intelligent electrochemical microsensors modified with thin films of nanomaterials to record the electrochemical signature of blood samples from 50 children treated with hydroxyurea. To analyze this complex dataset, multiple machine learning models were trained and optimized to predict hydroxyurea levels from microliter sample volumes. We evaluated three regression algorithms: elastic net, random forest (RF), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) across 11 different electrochemical feature matrices. Among these, PLSR demonstrated the best performance, achieving a root mean square error of 41.85 \u00b5M (3.18 \u03bcg/mL) and average prediction error of 7.24 \u00b5M (0.55 \u00b5g/mL), thereby enabling accurate analysis of hydroxyurea levels within the therapeutic range using microliter sample volumes from pediatric patients. With further miniaturization of such sensor arrays and integration into point-of-care testing devices, hydroxyurea PK-based dosing can be simplified for use in low-resource settings to improve SCA treatment outcomes worldwide.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Dental caries is caused by cariogenic bacteria, especially those belonging to the Streptococcus genus, whereas candidiasis is caused by Candida species. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of a series of synthetic N-methyl-4-piperidone-derived monoketone curcuminoids (MKCs) against Candida albicans, C. krusei, and a representative panel of cariogenic bac-teria was assessed. Methods: Fifteen MKCs were synthesized using an environmentally friendly base-catalyzed Claisen-Schmidt condensation between an aromatic aldehyde (R-PhCHO) and N-methyl-4-piperidone ethanol us-ing NaOH as the catalyst. These compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against a representative panel of cariogenic bacteria, along with their antifungal activity against Candida krusei and C. albicans. The antimi-crobial activity was determined based on the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values. Results: Most of the compounds were obtained in about 2 hours in yields ranging from 40 to 70%. None of the compounds displayed antifungal activity, even at 100 \u00b5g/mL, the highest tested concentration. Similarly, none of the compounds were active against Enterococcus faecalis. On the other hand, compounds 1 (R=H), 10 (R=3,4,5-OMe), and 13 (R=3-F) dis-played moderate activity against Streptococcus mutans (13), S. salivarus (1), L. paracasei (1 and 10), S. mitis (1, 10, and 13), S. sanguinis (1, 10, and 13), and S. sobrinus (13), with MIC values of 250 \u00b5g/mL and 500 \u00b5g/mL. The presence of the N-methyl-4-piperidone ring was found to boost the antibacterial activity as compared to the corresponding acetone-derived MKCs. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of compounds 10 and 13 was associated with the pres-ence and position of the fluor atom and the methoxy groups at the aromatic ring.

Although CAS glasses have been extensively studied, the structure\u2013property relationships--particularly in the peraluminous region (Al2O3/CaO >1)--remain insufficiently understood. Experimental studies have identified the presence of five-coordinated aluminum (Al5) depending on the Al2O3 content; however, classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations have struggled to accurately reproduce the aluminum coordination environment. To address this limitation, we developed a MLP tailored for CAS systems, trained on a comprehensive DFT-MD dataset and refined using a fine-tuning approach. Melt-quench simulations were then carried out to model CAS glass structures. The resulting structures from MLMD accurately reproduced both experimental glass densities and the fractions of Al5, including the observed increase in Al5 and oxygen triclusters (TBO) in the peraluminous region. In addition, we performed heating simulations to evaluate enthalpy changes and structural evolution as a function of temperature. Analogous to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments, the glass transition temperature was determined from the MLMD data. The compositional dependence of Al5 and TBO near the glass transition temperature (Tg) was quantitatively analyzed, providing insights into the role of aluminum in structural rearrangements. These findings demonstrate that MLMD enables accurate modeling of CAS glass structures and yields valuable insights into their thermal behavior.

The methodology is here applied to the case of CO methanation, where the catalyst is subject to deactivation by coking. This method can be extended to other reactions and deactivation mechanisms. The method is based on the integration of a single differential equation to describe the activity of the catalyst, and on the evaluation of the profiles in the reactor through consecutive steady states at progressively lower activity values. The model was applied successfully to both fixed- and fluidized-bed methanation with small differences between the two cases. This model showed promising results in a case study, with a correct description of the decrease in CO conversion due to coking. It also allowed observing the higher resistance to deactivation of fluidized-bed reactors compared to fixed-bed ones at similar conditions. The time needed to reach 25% conversion was calculated as 1.5 to 2 orders of magnitude higher in fluidized-bed reactors.

To investigate these factors, molecular dynamics simulation were performed in order to study the adsorption and detachment behavior of 2\u20133 nm-sized Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on defective graphite supports with up to 13-atom large vacancies. Larger NPs show stronger adsorption with increasing vacancy size, particularly for surface-oxidized NPs (Pt/O ratio 1:1), due to additional van der Waals interactions alongside covalent Pt\u2013C bonds at defect sites. Detachment simulations revealed that larger vacancy defects significantly increase the energy barrier for detachment, especially for non-oxidized 2nm NPs, as more Pt atoms remain at the defect after detachment. Surface oxidation reduces detachment barriers by over 50 %, while larger NPs generally show lower barriers. In aqueous environments, detachment barriers for non-oxidized NPs decrease, particularly with larger defects. These findings highlight the critical role of defect size and NP surface oxidation in stabilizing Pt-NPs on carbon supports, reducing material loss and preserving catalytically active material.

By controlling the degree of \ud835\uded1-association of active species, the total fraction of radicals can be kept below a critical threshold from which air stable operation can be accessed, even at oxygen reducing potentials. The resulting system exhibits 94.9% capacity retention in air after 150 cycles but undergoes dramatic losses in performance once diluted outside of its air stability threshold. We tie this behaviour to rates of oxygen consumption in solution and further derive the second Damk\u00f6hler number which informs optimal scaling of battery components to minimise parasitic processes with air. On this basis, air stability is shown to be compatible with scaling requirements needed for applications in long duration energy storage.

Recently, the most concerning adulterants have been synthetic opioids such as nitazenes, which have potencies similar to fentanyl. Increasing deaths are associated with nitazenes, but at present there is no data on nitazene concentration in samples in the UK. Our study examines the current range of street heroin strength (3,6-diactylmorphine and 6-monoacetylmorphine), along with nitazene concentration in heroin and other samples. Additionally, we use our previously developed portable technology for drug discrimination, based on hybridized fluorescence/reflectance spectroscopy, to establish rapid identification of heroin strength from a small (2 mg) sample.\nDesign, setting and participants:\nWe sampled 80 suspected heroin/opioids which were conveyed to our laboratories via 5 regional police forces. Samples were selected based on risk perception or for contribution to police intelligence and public health. A sub-set of these samples originated as self-submissions to local charities. \nMeasurements:\nQualitative gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry were used to identify opioids and other relevant constituents, with concentration measured by quantitative nuclear mag-netic resonance spectroscopy and GC-MS. \nFindings:\nThe submitted samples showed a very broad range of heroin (3,6\u2013diacetylmorphine) strengths, with a bi-modal distribution centered at 19.4 \u00b1 0.34% and 53.1 \u00b1 0.7%. Self-submissions from people who use drugs were typically at the extremes of strength distribution, whereas police identified submissions showed more variance. Our portable technology can accurately identify heroin strength from a 2 mg sample presumptively as 0-20%, 20-40% and 40%+. Of the samples bought as heroin in powder form and found to contain nitazenes, the average nitazene concentration was 13.8 \u00b1 2.5%; ~12-17 mg of nitazene in a heroin dose. 6-monoacetylmorphine had a concentration range of 0.5 \u2013 16.5% in the heroin samples measured.\nIt is typical for tablets to contain a large proportion of excipients and tablets containing nitazenes adhered to this trend with  1.1 \u00b1 1.0%; 0.1-4 mg in a tablet. None of the tablets were sold as heroin, indeed some were presented to drug checking services as non-opioid sedatives.\nConclusions:\nUsers are exposed to an extremely broad variance in street heroin concentration from both 3,6-diactylmorphine and 6-monoacetylmorphine concentrations  and this underscores the importance of quantifying samples to provide effective harm reduction advice. We demonstrate a technology solution to achieving this that could be implemented as part of a public health alerts/ early warning system or a drug checking service delivering rapid point of care results. The first reported quantification of nitazenes in UK heroin, tablet and powder samples, underscore the evolving landscape of opioid adulteration and the potential for heightened overdose risk.\n", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Among the most used families of plastics is polyurethane (PU), valued for its versatility and low production cost. A promising sustainable strategy to address the end-of-life challenge of PU is employing efficient PU-degrading enzymes. Notably, an extracellular lipase from the I.3 family originating from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 has shown significant promise in this regard. In this study, we investigated the enzyme\u2019s capability to hydrolyze a PU fragment. Employing QM/MM computational methodologies, we studied the hydrolysis mechanism of MIS38 lipase and found it to follow the prototypical Serine esterases mechanism involving acylation and deacylation stages. The rate-limiting step occurred between the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate and the second tetrahedral intermediate. The Gibbs activation barrier for this step was 19.67 kcal.mol-1, confirming the lipase\u2019s potential to biodegrade PU efficiently. More importantly, we observed that the enzyme preferentially cleaved the C-N bond instead of the C-O bond. This preference was due to the arrangement of the active site and the substrate, which made C-N the more favorable cleavable site. Furthermore, we find that the C-O group is not a suitable cleavable bond due to steric hindrances. This study suggests that the mechanism of urethane bond hydrolysis is more complex than currently assumed because bond cleavage is context-dependent and may differ depending on the enzyme and the substrate.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Furthermore, computational evaluation of the initiation and propagation pathways for amine degradation in diamine-appended MOFs indicates that: (i) degradation is likely initiated by OH\u2022, (ii) carbon-centered radicals generated via radical transfer reactions react with O2, leading to amine degradation, and (iii) the rate-limiting step of the degradation reactions likely involves O\u2013O bond cleavage. Overall, these mechanistic insights could inform strategies for mitigating O2-induced amine degradation in next-generation carbon capture technologies.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, samples of road runoff stormwaters were collected in the Metro Vancouver area of British Columbia, Canada and assessed for acute lethality to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Three of the four stormwaters tested exhibited complete mortality after the 96-h test. The causes of toxicity in samples that exhibited toxicity were characterized by using Toxicity Identification Evaluation (TIE) techniques, and included zinc, as well as an organic constituent. Subsequent investigation of the organic component implicated 6PPD-Q, and the potential contribution of 6PPD-Q to acute toxicity of rainbow trout was assessed by performing TIE techniques on a standard solution of 6PPD-Q in parallel with collected stormwater. Chemical analysis of the solution phase 6PPD-Q concentration using Condensed-Phase Membrane Introduction Mass Spectrometry (CP-MIMS) was used to support toxicity assessments.

In this work, GFN2-xTB, density functional theory (DFT) and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods were used to explore the most plausible pathways proposed for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction assisted by dimethylamine (DMA). Microkinetic modeling was utilized to predict the methanol turnover number (TON), which agreed with experimental data, and to analyze the proposed mechanisms and catalyst resting states. The model indicated that the dominant dimethylformamide (DMF) hydrogenation pathway proceeds through a metal-ligand cooperative mechanism, followed by the hemiaminal protonolysis through an organic reaction (no Ru-catalyst required). In addition, Ru-formate (3) is the primary resting state, together with Ru-carbamate (8).

They are ubiquitous and ecologically significant, yet remain largely overlooked. Although a growing body of research demonstrates their pivotal roles (e.g., predation, symbiosis, and nutrient cycling) in microbial communities in natural ecosystems, their functions in engineered water systems are poorly characterized and heterotrophic protists are frequently excluded from microbial analyses. This is largely due to methodological constraints that have only recently been overcome. Recent advances in imaging, high-throughput sequencing, and meta-omics approaches, combined with expanding reference databases, have revolutionized studies of protist diversity and functions in a wide range of natural environments. Drawing on research from the fields of protistology, microbial ecology, and environmental microbiology, this review explores how the well-documented ecological roles of heterotrophic protists in natural environments may be relevant in engineered ecosystems and provide insights into their functions in water treatment. We critically evaluate recent literature to synthesize both beneficial roles and potential risks of heterotrophic protists in various water treatment systems while identifying key knowledge gaps and proposing directions for future research. We advocate for a shift in perspective that recognizes heterotrophic protists as important players and call for their integration into microbial community characterization and ecological frameworks in microbial ecology studies of engineered water systems.

Chemical catalysts have emerged as versatile tools for probing and modulating PTMs. A hydroxamic acid-thiol conjugated (HXA-SH) catalyst, mBnA, functionally mimics acetyltransferases by uniquely activating endogenous acetyl-coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) to promote regioselective lysine acetylation of targeted proteins in living cells. However, its in-cell acetylation activity has remained insufficient for furnishing biological function (2.5% yield for epigenetically valuable histone protein), and the key factors governing catalytic activity have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we identify the rate-determining step of the catalytic reaction using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, revealing a pivotal proton-shuttling process that neutralizes the charge-separated intermediate involving the catalyst, substrate amine, and a water molecule. Guided by these mechanistic insights, we develop an improved HXA-SH catalyst, mHXA-pOMe, which facilitates the proton-shuttling process. The mHXA-pOMe catalyst exhibits a significant increase in in-cell histone acetylation yield, reaching 20% without the need for exogenous acetyl donors.

The EQCM leverages the oscillation frequency of a quartz crystal as a sensitive indicator of mass changes on a gold electrode. By utilizing the crystal\u2019s frequency response to the electrostatic attraction of excess free charges, the method identifies potential regions where positive and negative excess charges exist. Our findings reveal a potential region where the EQCM detects no frequency change, flanked by regions showing a marked increase in -\u2206f.

Understanding the selectivity and scope of T1ALPKS domains could greatly expand the diversity of products generated by these synthases and their components.

The selectivity with which these TEs form 12- and/or 14-membered macrolactones and a pair of diastereomeric 14-membered macrolactones was quantified. The results indicate that the selectivity with which wild-type TEs react with unnatural substrates correlates with their parent T1ALPKSs, enabling the assignment of TEs into groups. Additionally, our findings reveal that mutant (Ser->Cys) TEs often exhibit expanded scopes compared to their wild-type counterparts.

When defined broadly as ion-coupled charge transport (ICCT), relevant systems include lithium-ion battery electrodes, electrochromic coatings, and myriad electrocatalysts. Despite ample evidence that ion- electron coupling enhances or diminishes the performance of these devices, little is known about the experimental signatures of ICCT and the microscopic factors that govern its mechanism. We expect that ion-electron coupling becomes especially relevant in high surface area materials, such as the layered electrodes of intercalation batteries, due to the close proximity of itinerant electrons and electrolyte. Here, we report an electrochemical investigation into a family of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that serves as a well-defined platform for understanding the effect of ICCT on both electronic and ionic conductivity. Through photochemical doping of e-\u2013H+ pairs and introduction of solvent guest molecules, the Ti-containing MOFs convert from electronic-only insulators conductors (\u03c3e \u2248 10-12 S cm-1) to mixed ion-electron semiconductors (\u03c3e \u2248 10-7 S cm-1, \u03c3ion \u2248 10-5 S cm-1).

The non-catalytic uses hard chemicals, temperature and pressure, and can present lower selectivity, further oxidizing monoaromatic products. The use of catalysts, especially electrocatalysts, make the conditions mild and increases the selectivity, however, the reaction pathway followed is still under debate. It is difficult to find proposals in the literature that consider the heterogeneous catalyst-lignin interaction, so in this work we applied in situ spectroelectrochemical techniques in the infrared region to check this, using commercial CuO catalyst powder as catalyst and sugarcane lignin in 2.0 mol L-1 KOH.

In this study, we report a surprising twist: newly synthesized, iodinated and charge-compensated [CoSAN]\u207b derivatives with boron\u2013nitrogen (-B\u2013N-) bond show promising anticancer activity. The studied molecules display low-nanomolar IC\u2085\u2080 values across a range of human cancer cell lines, revealing cytotoxic effects far beyond what has previously been observed for this class. We also link their activity to specific structural motifs, identifying auspicious candidates for future therapeutic development. Their biological activity is further evaluated in a vertebrate in vivo model (Danio rerio embryos), where we characterize the developmental effects and toxicological profile. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of simple [CoSAN]\u207b-based molecules exhibiting such high cytotoxic potency and cancer cell selectivity. Our findings show that subtle chemical modifications -like incorporating B\u2013N bond and adjusting charge - can unlock powerful bioactivity in molecules once thought to be inert, opening new possibilities for unconventional anticancer drug design.

This comprehensive study delves into the formation and growth of these deactivating species under a range of conditions, including temperatures from 275 to 325 \u00b0C, pressures ranging from 1.5 to 40 bar, and space-times between 2 and 6 gcatalyst h/molC.\nWe have employed an extensive characterization of the used catalysts, integrating conventional techniques with advanced methodologies. Notably, we utilized Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), which allows for the isolation and detailed molecular-level analysis of these species within the soluble coke. This advanced technique provides a deeper understanding of the molecular composition and structural characteristics of the deactivating species. Our findings reveal that higher pressures promote oligomerization, resulting in an increased accumulation of trapped species. Conversely, higher temperatures facilitate the cracking of these oligomers into lighter fractions or their further conversion into coke molecules through condensation reactions. This dual behavior underscores the complex interplay between temperature and pressure in influencing the deactivation pathways. The insights gained from this study are invaluable for optimizing reaction conditions. By understanding the overall reaction mechanism and the specific formation and growth patterns of trapped and deactivating species, we can develop strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation.

However, the successful use of backbone-modified monomers as substrates by the ribosome requires coordination across multiple parts of the translation machinery, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, translation factors, and finally the ribosome itself. \u03b2-hydroxyacids are particularly interesting monomers because they have potential to support the programmed biosynthesis of both polyesters (plastics) and depsipeptides (therapeutics). Previous work has reported that both enantiomers of \u03b22-hydroxy-N\u03b5-Boc-Lysine (\u03b22-OH-BocK) are in vitro substrates for the orthogonal M. alvi PylRS/tRNA pair, but only one enantiomer is introduced into protein in vivo and with substantially lower yield than expected.

In vitro translation experiments confirm that orthogonal tRNAs acylated with (R)- or (S)-\u03b22-OH-BocK are ribosome substrates, implying that the preferential incorporation of one enantiomer over the other in vivo results from deficiencies in other translation steps, such as tRNA acylation efficiency in cells or delivery to the ribosome by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu).

Fontana", "abstract": "The capillary driven flow of non-Newtonian fluids into networks is a complex phenomenon with multiple applications in biological systems, industry and engineering. In this work, we extend the classical Lucas-Washburn scenario, where a Newtonian fluid is driven by capillary forces through a single cylindrical vertical tube, by considering the flow of a non-Newtonian power-law fluid through a self-similar root-like branching network, without neglecting hydrostatic effects. We develop a theoretical model that assumes axisymmetric flow in each network branch, and find a complex generalized form for the classical square-root Lucas-Washburn relation between filled length and time: $L\\propto t^{1/2}$. The model is validated by comparing our theoretical results with data from experiments and numerical simulations available in the literature. We identify two flow regimes, equilibrium and overflow. In the equilibrium regime the flow asymptotically approaches an equilibrium filling limit, and in the overflow regime the fluid fills the entire network in a finite time. We show that the regime flow is determined by ratio between capillary and hydrostatic forces. Furthermore, we describe an optimal geometrical configuration that maximizes fluid transport across the network. We show that non-Newtonian rheological features play a significant role in the flow dynamics. Finally, we show that the power-law rheology and the structural geometrical complexity, change the simple Lucas-Washburn power-law relation to a fairly complex signomial one. The capillary flow of shear-thinning fluids is significantly faster than shear-thickening ones, but also much more sensitive perturbations on the physical parameters of interest.

While the efficiency and selectivity of these materials have been extensively highlighted for the eNO3RR, the in situ evolution to their structure and composition during electrocatalysis are largely unexplored and lacks catalyst design principles. To solve this, we investigated a series of high utilization metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) SACs (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) for eNO3RR. Except for CuNC, which selectively produced nitrite, all catalysts exhibited Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for ammonia exceeding 50%.

In situ Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) mapping at various cathodic potentials (from open circuit potential to 0.0 VRHE and then \u22120.6 VRHE at 100 mV steps) revealed significant mobility of Ni within the carbon matrix, leading to the formation of metallic clusters from 0.0 VRHE. Similar in situ metal clustering was observed for CoNC. Structure-activity plots were generated from both MNC literature and results obtained here, finding a clear trend between OH binding energy and turnover frequency, with the high activity of NiNC and CoNC in this work explained by their stronger OH binding in the metallic structure compared to their SAC coordination. This work therefore reveals the structure-activity-stability of MNCs for eNO3RR and provides a simple descriptor for identifying highly active eNO3RR catalysts and their in situ structural evolution.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Data splitting is crucial for benchmarking the performance of such AI models. Traditional ran-dom data splits often result in structurally similar molecules in both training and test sets, which conflict with the reality of VS libraries that typically contain structurally diverse compounds. To tackle this challenge, scaffold split, which groups molecules by shared core structure, and Butina clustering, which clusters molecules by chemotypes, have long been used. However, we show that these methods still introduce high similarities between training and test sets, leading to overestimated model performance. Our study examined four representative AI models across 60 NCI-60 datasets, each comprising approximately 33,000 to 54,000 molecules tested on different cancer cell lines. Each dataset was split in four ways: random, scaffold, Butina clustering and the more realistic Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering. Using Linear Re-gression, Random Forest, Transformer-CNN, and GEM, we trained a total of 8,400 models and evaluated under four splitting methods. These comprehensive results show that UMAP split provides more challenging and realistic bench-marks for model evaluation, followed by Butina splits, then scaffold splits and closely after random splits. Consequently, we recommend using UMAP splits instead of overly optimistic Butina splits and especially scaffold splits for mo-lecular property prediction, including VS.

This is evidenced by extensive NMR, SC-XRD, and DFT studies, revealing highly directional CH\u2013\u03c0 interactions and hydrogen bonding between the interlocked components. Our findings challenge the prevailing view that mechanical bonds inherently inhibit the reactivity of nearby functional groups, demonstrating that entanglement can instead promote reactivity through precise spatial control.

To develop our improved MX-Raman methodology, we utilized post-mortem brain tissue from several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) that have considerable clinical overlap. For improving our methodology we used three sources of spectral information arising from distinct physical phenomena to assess which was most important for NDD classification. Spectral measurements utilized combinations of data from multiple, distinct excitation laser wavelengths and polarization states to differentially probe molecular vibrations and autofluorescence signals. We demonstrate that the more informative MX-Raman (532nm-785nm) spectra are classified with 96.7% accuracy on average, compared to conventional single-excitation Raman spectroscopy that resulted in 78.5% accuracy (532nm) or 85.6% accuracy (785nm) using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on 5 NDD classes. By combining information from distinct laser polarizations we observed a non-significant increase in classification accuracy without the need of a second laser (785nm-785nm polarized), whereas combining Raman spectra with autofluorescence signals did not increase classification accuracy. Finally, by filtering out spectral features that were redundant for classification or not descriptive of disease class, we engineered spectral barcodes consisting of a minimal subset of highly disease-specific MX-Raman features that improved the unsupervised and cross-validated clustering of MX-Raman spectra. The results demonstrate that increasing spectral information content using our optical MX-Raman methodology enables enhanced identification and distinction of complex biological samples but only when that information is independent and descriptive of class. The future translation of such technology to biofluids could support diagnosis and stratification of patients living with dementia and po-tentially other clinical conditions such as cancer and infectious disease.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Determining the relative sequence and precise timing of these interactions is crucial for elucidating the functional dynamics of biological processes. Here, we developed Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein-Protein Ensembles using a Destabilizing Domain (TRAPPED) to study protein-protein interactions in a temporal manner. We have taken advantage of a dihydrofolate reductase destabilizing domain (DHFR(DD)) that can be fused to a protein of interest and is constitutively degraded by the proteosome. Addition of the ligand trimethoprim (TMP) can stabilize DHFR(DD), preventing proteasomal degradation of the fusion protein, and thereby inducing accumulation in cells. We synthesized and optimized TRimethoprim Analog Probes (TRAPs) that maintain stabilization activity and contain a terminal alkyne for Click functionalization and a thiol reactive group to covalently tag DHFR(DD). Click reaction with a biotin tag and subsequent streptavidin enrichment enables time-resolved mass spectrometric identification of interacting partners. We evaluated the timing of protein interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV non-structural protein 15 (nsp15) over a 2-hour period. We found interactors GEMIN5 and YBX3, known regulators of SARS-CoV-2 infection that bind viral RNA as well as CACYBP and FHL1 which implicate nsp15 in disruption of host ERK1/2 signaling. We further revealed that these interactions remain relatively steady from 0 to 2 hours post translation of nsp15.

Previous in silico and in vitro studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of multitarget HDAC/ROCK inhibition, leading to the identification of C-9 as the first-in-class multitarget HDAC/ROCK inhibitor. In the present study, C-9 served as a lead compound for the rational design of a new series of multitarget inhibitors.\nStructure-based drug design (SBDD) was used to develop a series of novel HDAC/ROCK multitarget inhibitors. Molecular docking and MM-GBSA binding free energy analysis confirmed strong and specific interactions with the catalytic sites of both targets. Based on these computational insights, ten compounds were synthesized and biologically evaluated using enzyme inhibition and cancer cell assays. Among the synthesized compounds, C-35 and C-40 showed remarkable cytotoxic activity against TNBC cell lines, with IC50 values of 17 \u00b5M and 27 \u00b5M against MDA-MB-231 cells and about 35 \u00b5M against MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively, outperforming known selective HDAC6 and ROCK inhibitors such as tubastatin A and fasudil. Further mechanistic studies revealed that these compounds induce early apoptosis, arrest cell cycle progression and downregulate PD-L1 expression. Remarkably, C-35 also increased the expression of MICA in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, possibly promoting the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by immune cells.\nTo further support rational drug optimization, we used synthesized compounds and their IC50 values for the enzymes to form an external blind validation set that enabled the development of machine learning-based quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models for HDAC6 and ROCK2. These models, developed for the first time for both targets, showed strong predictive performance and were integrated into a comprehensive CADD workflow combining structure-based (molecular docking and MM-GBSA) and ligand-based (QSAR) methods for drug development.\nOverall, this study highlights the anti-cancer, anti-invasive, anti-migratory and immunomodulatory potential of multitarget HDAC/ROCK inhibition for the treatment of TNBC.

Unlike gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), where electron ionization using a single quadrupole detector is commonplace, a wide range of ionization sources and mass spectrometers can be used in AI-MS. Differences in instrument configuration can lead to substantial variability in the mass spectral data obtained. An interlaboratory study, consisting of 35 participants from 17 laboratories, was conducted to begin to understand the landscape and the differences in data that are produced. Laboratories analyzed a series of 21 solutions across multiple days using their own instrumental methods. Mass spectra were extracted and compared to understand operator, within-lab, and across-lab reproducibility for common compounds and mixtures observed in seized drug analysis. In addition, five participants analyzed the 21 solutions using prescribed method parameters to measure reproducibility improvements when using identical instrumental conditions.\nMass spectral reproducibility, measured through pairwise cosine similarity, was found to be generally quite high, regardless of sample type, instrument type, method, or operator. Low-fragmentation spectra showed the lowest variability, as they were dominated by a peak corresponding to intact protonated molecule peaks. Several potential issues that increased variability were identified including carryover from mass calibrants, poor sample introduction, and mass spectrometer inlets that required cleaning. The use of uniform method parameters was shown to increase reproducibility of mass spectra across laboratories, most notably at higher in-source collision induced dissociation energies. This study provides initial insights into the current landscape of AI-MS in seized drug analysis and lays the foundation for future studies that can provide needed data for the development of documentary standards, standard methods, and possibly an establishment of error rates.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With short pump-probe observation time and short laser pulse durations, the electronic and nuclear dephasing times determine the extent and amplitude of third-order non-linear response in the measurements. While the third-order molecular response is unavoidable in ultrafast crystallography it is currently unknown to what extent non-linear optical excitation processes could contribute to the data. We present a separation of weak and strong response from pump-probe data of photoactive yellow protein crystals collected at a single laser power, based on a method of indexing transformation followed by optical crystallography. We show that this allows precise separation of the heterogeneous photochemical populations with a very high level of data correlation that is intrinsic from the methodology of serial crystallography data collection. This data correlation supports measurable crystallographic electron density differences for the cis-chromophore photoproduct at 3 ps delay comparing weak and strong interactions. While the resulting coordinate refinements are supported by these differences, their sub-Angstrom modifications are inconsequential when the RMS differences of displacements are considered at room temperature. We conclude that these minor crystallographic differences reflect the higher population and therefore signal-to-noise in the strong interaction dataset. Moreover, radical formation driven by excited state absorption, which is the dominating non-linear photoexcitation process under the conditions used, are not detected in high-quality and high-resolution TR-SFX of the photoactive yellow protein.

This design feature can serve as a tuning parameter for water vapor adsorption to achieve a desired isotherm behavior. Hence, understanding the role of electrostatic configurations in water vapor adsorption can inform many established and emerging areas concerning the water-energy nexus and water security. In this work, we apply continuous fractional component grand-canonical Monte Carlo (CFC-GCMC) to perform water adsorption simulations in idealized cylindrical nanopores across five different charge configurations with varying pore sizes (1, 1.1 and 1.2 nm) and charge magnitudes (~ +/\u2013 0.39-1.17). The alternating along (AA) configuration (positive charges in the inner ring and negative in the outer ring while alternating in z-direction) demonstrates higher water uptake at saturation and water adsorption starts at a much lower pressure than other configurations. Analysis of water clustering pattern in AA reveals both radial and axial expansion of water clusters which facilitates accommodation of extra water molecules. Increasing charge magnitude shifts the type-V isotherm inflection point to lower pressure, thereby increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cylinder. Probing different energetic interactions and electrostatic potentials of the configuration suggests unique relaxation of the water clusters in the AA patterned cylinders. Investigating the effect of charge magnitude and pore size provides more insight into their hydrophilic nature.

In this Account, we highlight our contributions to the field, particularly focusing on 1,2-radical acyloxy migration (RAM), a process involving the transposition of a radical and an acyloxy group. We highlight its application in carbohydrate modification and allyl carboxylate trifunctionalization, demonstrating how this reactivity enables the streamlined synthesis of novel glycomimetics and facilitates selective 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. These advances establish 1,2-RAM as a versatile platform for catalytic radical transformations, unlocking new opportunities in reaction development and functional molecule design. Our approach leverages excited-state palladium and ground-state nickel catalysis to modify carbohydrates, specifically at the C2 position. This strategy enables C2-deoxy-hydrogenation, deuteration, iodination, alkenylation, ketonylation, and arylation reactions, providing direct access to unprecedented glycomimetics. These transformations streamline the synthesis of structurally diverse glycomimetics, facilitating the discovery and development of carbohydrate-based functional molecules. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance of these catalytic systems make them particularly attractive for late-stage functionalization, broadening their applicability in complex molecule synthesis. Beyond carbohydrates, we have extended 1,2-RAM reactivity to achieve unprecedented 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. By employing excited-state phosphine catalysis, we demonstrate a 1,3-carbobromination reaction accompanied by an acyloxy shift. This proof-of-concept study lays the foundation for developing a broader range of 1,2,3-trifunctionalization reactions, effectively transforming allyl carboxylates into substituted isopropyl carboxylate donors. This advancement expands the synthetic utility of allyl carboxylates, enabling the rapid construction of structurally diverse molecular scaffolds. In summary, the 1,2-RAM reactivity opens a new avenue for reaction discovery and development, granting access to new functional molecules and chemical space. The mild conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and unique reactivity of this approach make it a valuable tool for chemical synthesis. We anticipate that merging 1,2-RAM with other catalytic platforms will further advance bond disconnection strategies, provide access to new functional molecules, and expand the frontiers of chemical synthesis.

We here propose cationic nanogels as a better alternative, and demonstrate their advantages for siRNA delivery. Firstly, nanogels offer a stable 3D structure which can bind RNA in different ways (surface and inside). Depending on the mixing ratio (N/P), siRNA-loaded particles respond differently to serum proteins: at high N/P (excess nanogel) siRNA is bound on interior sites and then better protected against competing serum proteins, so that delivery and transfection are efficient. Moreover, the synthetic protocol (electrostatic-templated polymerization, ETP) allows fine-tuning of the nanogels physicochemical properties (chemical composition, size and cross-linking degree etc.), so that we can systematically explore structure-performance relationships for nanogel-mediated siRNA delivery. Doing so, we find that the best delivery vehicle is a 107 nm PVBTMA (poly vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride) nanogel with 5% cross-linking degree.

For a test set consisting of molecular dynamics snapshots of polypeptides and small proteins, covering different secondary structure motifs, we we performed full quantum-chemical calculations of harmonic vibrational frequencies and normal modes, and applied a localization of normal modes to obtain localized-mode frequencies and coupling constants.

The resulting inter-subunit EET proceeds predominantly between isoenergetic excitonic states. Visualizing these EET dynamics is difficult due to the heavy spectral overlaps between the components, particularly at physiological temperature. In this study, we employ polarization-resolved two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to measure the anisotropy decay of the excitations in the light-harvesting antennas of PSII. We measure and compare the anisotropy kinetics between the LHCII(M)-CP29-CP24 (termed M-CP_2), trimeric LHCII, and monomeric LHCII complexes.  Together with the EET timescales estimated from structure-based energy transfer theory and kinetic modeling, we assign the contributions of intra- and inter-subunit EET processes to the observed anisotropy decay lifetimes. The sub-picosecond (ps) decay processes are similar in the three complexes and can be attributed to intra-subunit origins, while the slower processes are mainly driven by inter-subunit EET and vary between the complexes. The M-CP_2 complex particularly exhibits a long-lived, 24-ps anisotropy decay component, which we assign as representing the EET processes between LHCII(M) and CP24. The results also suggest that EET rates between the subunits are not homogeneous, and can be influenced by the relative arrangement between the proteins. It is shown that EET processes between the isoenergetic antenna subunits can be obtained by leveraging on their orientations, which can be a basis for studying exciton dynamics in large multi-chromophoric systems.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In Nature this is accomplished by the nitrogenase (N2ase) family of enzymes.  Carbon monoxide (CO) has long been known as an inhibitor of dinitrogen reduction by N2ase, but it can also be a substrate of the enzyme, when it is catalytically reduced to hydrocarbons. Understanding the CO interactions with N2ases are thus relevant to both dinitrogen fixation and Fischer-Tropsch-like chemistry. Here, the interaction of CO with the a-V70I variant of Azotobacter vinelandii MoFe N2ase was investigated using EPR- and IR- monitored photolysis of bound CO under cryogenic conditions.  This was supplemented by further analysis of stopped-flow FT-IR (SF-FT-IR) data under turnover conditions.  The a-V70I variant adds a single methyl group close to the active site, and the results show that this inhibits and slows, but does not substantially chemically change, the binding of CO to the FeMo-cofactor.  The EPR spectra of both the hi-CO and lo-CO states closely resemble those from the wild-type enzyme.  Similarly, the SF-FT-IR spectrum is strikingly similar, with only small shifts in band energies and comparison with data from wild-type enzyme allows better interpretation of the published SF-FT-IR spectra. The extra carbon does, however, impact and inhibit the photochemical release and migration of CO at cryogenic temperature, resulting in novel CO-bound species.  In particular, a photolysis product species, termed Hi-1*, with an IR band at 1944 cm-1 may involve CO photochemically migrating on the FeMo-cofactor.

Single-point excited-state calculations using quantum chemical (QC) methods, such as time-dependent density functional theory, can predict peak positions and their intensities of the spectra; however, these methods are inherently incapable of capturing spectral broadening effects. Herein, we present a comprehensive assessment of an approach based on time correlation functions (TCFs) that enables the computational prediction of spectra, including broadening effects, by integrating QC calculations with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We systematically compared the absorption spectral shapes calculated using five levels of TCF-based spectral formulas, including the second-order cumulant approach, which are hierarchically related through successive approximations. To evaluate the applicability of the TCF-based approach, we selected two small organic pigment molecules, 3,4,5,6-tetrachloro\ufb02uorescein(FLU) and crystal violet (CST), as test cases. By assessing the impact of different approximations on the predicted spectral shapes, we found that for FLU, all approximation levels yielded comparable results, whereas for CST, certain approximations led to significant deviations. These discrepancies may be caused by rapid fluctuations of transition dipole moments in CST, which has a flexible molecular skeleton, in contrast to FLU, which has a relatively rigid structure. Additionally, using Kubo's stochastic theory allowed us to investigate the relationship between the timescale of molecular fluctuations and spectral broadening.

Hughes; Megan Griffiths; Simon Cook; Dik van de Meent; John Parsons; Delina Lyon; Amelie Ott", "abstract": "The environmental persistence of a substance plays a key role in determining its exposure to humans and other organisms, making this an important component in the risk assessment and management of chemicals. Regulatory persistence assessments generally involve a comparison of degradation half-lives against threshold criteria for different environmental compartments, typically water, sediment, and soil. Half-lives are commonly determined using Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline biodegradation simulation tests. Other information may be considered relevant to persistence assessments, such as results from biodegradation screening tests, quantitative structure-activity relationships, field studies, monitoring data, and non-standard laboratory experiments. All available relevant information should be considered together in a weight-of-evidence approach, but clear guidance is currently lacking both for evaluating the quality of individual studies and for combining these in a single weight-of-evidence determination. Here we present a systematic methodology to collate, evaluate, and integrate relevant information to reach robust, transparent and consistent conclusions for persistence assessments. First, the quality (reliability and relevance) of individual studies within each information category, or \u2018line of evidence\u2019, is evaluated using a novel scoring methodology. Then, information from different studies is combined to determine outcomes for each line of evidence. Finally, a stepwise weight-of-evidence approach is applied to integrate outcomes from different lines of evidence to reach an overall conclusion for the persistence assessment. Consistency of information is evaluated at various stages in line with weight-of-evidence best practice. The methodology has been developed in accordance with principles of the European Union (EU) Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulatory framework, test guidelines and guidance, whilst being flexible to accommodate different regulatory practices. The methodology has been implemented in a freely available Excel-based software tool, the Persistence Assessment Tool, and is demonstrated using a case study substance hexabromocyclododecane.", "date": "2025-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

A possible solution is the development of mild uncouplers that partially depolarise mitochondria without affecting ATP production. In this study, we prepared a series arylamide substituted fatty acid protonophores and demonstrate that arylamides with appropriate aromatic substitution patterns produce mild uncoupling. Specifically, 3,4-substituted arylamides increased respiration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and partially collapsed mitochondrial proton gradients without affecting ATP production or cell viability. In contrast, the actions of 3,5-substituted arylamides were similar to those of known full uncouplers DNP and CCCP and decreased intracellular ATP levels. Using a vesicle-based proton transport assay, we found that the rates of transmembrane proton transport by the 3,4-substituted arylamides were slower than those of their 3,5-substituted counterparts, which is attributed to a diminished capacity of 3,4-substituted arylamides to form membrane permeable dimers in the rate limiting step of the protonophoric cycle. This is the first study to assess the role of proton transport rate in protonophore-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling, and the results indicate that development of protonophores with limited proton transport rates may be a viable strategy towards identifying mild uncouplers.  \u2003", "date": "2025-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We present a self-referenced approach, termed the Capillary-Volume\u2013Plateau Calibration (CVPC) method, that uses capillary volume as a reference and requires only a one-point calibration to obtain absolute injection volumes (Vinj) without measuring pressure, time, or viscosity. The working relation, Vinj = VA/(kCtm), depends only on five readily measured quantities: (i) the capillary volume, V = \u03c0r2l (r is the inner radius and l is the injection-to-detector length), (ii) the detector constant k (signal per concentration unit), (iii) the analyte concentration C, (iv) the peak area A, and (v) the peak migration time tm. If the detector responds linearly with concentration, the constant k is obtained from a single pressure-driven run: a reference solution of known concentration Cref is introduced just long enough to generate a flat-top plateau, and the average plateau signal \u27e8S\u27e9 gives k\u202f=\u202f\u27e8S\u27e9/Cref.

A test on a commercial instrument with a built-in Hagen\u2013Poiseuille-based predictor revealed overestimates in Vinj of up to approximately 120 %, a bias eliminated by the CVPC method.

Traditional strategies for VHTS do not account for ligand-induced conformational changes in proteins, as they typically rely on a single static structure to represent the protein. This neglects the role of binding entropy and the fact that different ligand molecules can induce slightly different conformations in the protein binding site that significantly affect the assessment of a given molecule's fit. To address this challenge, we have developed a method called \"Flexible Topology\", where a subset of atoms \u2013 typically representing a small molecule ligand \u2013 can continuously change their atomic identities, which are encoded by a set of attributes that parametrize the non-bonded interactions. These attributes are all implemented as dynamic variables that have masses and evolve in time using gradients of the energy function. In other words, the attributes feel forces from their surrounding environment and respond accordingly. In this way, by observing a set of flexible topology particles move and change in a ligand binding site, we can learn the preferences of a binding pocket. Here, we demonstrate how undirected flexible topology simulations can be used to explore ligand binding sites and reveal desirable properties of potential ligands.  We use the beta-2 adrenergic receptor as an illustrative example and compare properties of flexible topology particle groups with a set of 29 B2AR ligand-bound crystal structures, covering 13 distinct ligands. We also show how the shape- and electrostatics-based virtual screening software \"eon\" from OpenEye can be used to find hits that come as close as possible to mimicking the orientation of our flexible topology atoms.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To close this gap\u2014and to unlock AI\u2011driven, data\u2011centric decision\u2011making in chemical research\u2014we present NOCTIS, an open\u2011source platform that streamlines the creation and analysis of reaction networks and accelerates synthesis optimization. \nResult: \nWe present NOCTIS, an open-source Python package for constructing and analyzing Networks of Organic Chemistry (NOCs) from reaction strings. It supports graph-shaped queries that can be easily extended with user-defined queries, offers parallel processing for large datasets, and enables export to Python-compatible formats like NetworkX and Pandas. Built on Neo4j technology, NOCTIS features a modular, extensible architecture with all open-source dependencies.  To enhance NOCTIS functionality, we developed a plugin -- NOCTIS Route Miner -- that implements an algorithm to extract all possible routes for a target from an NOC. Information about reaction routes, especially those that have been previously executed, is highly valuable for avoiding duplication of work and leveraging prior knowledge in synthesis planning. However, this information is often unavailable. Mining routes can help address this gap, though it comes with certain limitations: even for networks as small as 100 reactions, the number of routes can reach millions. This combinatorial explosion of routes makes mining computationally challenging and interpretation of raw results impossible.  To demonstrate broader capabilities of NOCTIS, we analysed the MIT USPTO dataset[1]. We showcase the tool\u2019s efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with Python workflows, providing a practical platform for reaction routes exploration, network connectivity analysis, and synthetic tree evaluation. \nConclusion: \nNOCTIS builds on the ecosystem initiated by LinChemIn[2], providing an open and extensible platform for constructing and analyzing chemical reactions as networks and enabling extraction of synthetic routes. It supports collaborative research and community-driven contributions, fostering advancements in cheminformatics. Future developments will focus on expanding query types and optimizing the performance of route extraction.

Reactive Step-Based Molecular Dynamics (RSMD) is a simple approach that incorporates quantum reactions by periodically halting the MD simulation and allowing the possibility for reactions at each halt, based on a Poisson-type reaction probability. However, this simple approach cannot capture the simultaneous involvement of diffusion and reaction processes, and because the reaction probability does not include the influence of the diffusion step, errors can be introduced, especially when the diffusion process is not significantly slower than the reaction process. In this work, the efficiency of the RSMD model is increased by reducing these errors and by addressing the influence of the diffusion process on the reaction probability. To improve these errors, we modify the RSMD mathematical framework by replacing the Trotter splitting employed in previous works with the Strang splitting scheme. To implement these Strang schemes in MD simulations and to scrutinize their validity, we introduce mathematical models involving three and four states, which correspond to two common reaction scenarios---association-dissociation reactions and homogeneous charge transfer reactions, respectively---in the presence of diffusion processes. Using these mathematical models, effective reaction probability functions are derived for various diffusion limits, for example, when diffusion processes are extremely fast or extremely slow compared to the reaction processes. All the derived reaction probability functions, in combination with appropriate Strang schemes, are validated for various diffusion regimes with respect to the reaction timescale.\t ", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Chiroptical photoswitching is especially interesting in this regard as it uses light in a dual sense, first as trigger for modulation of the chiroptical response and second as the chiral optical output signal. Commonly, chiroptical properties are established in photoswitches by introduction of chirality at the core chromophore. The resulting photoswitches show permanent chiroptical responses with varying degree of effectiveness. In this work, we use molecular confinement to introduce a second level of control and dramatically enhance chiroptical photoswitching. Two different molecular photoswitches were substituted with remote chiral groups, but their reversible photoresponses remain achiral in solution. However, upon take-up into a hexameric capsule, the photoswitches undergo host-induced folding, which leads to effective chirality transfer to the chromophores. As a result, viable chiroptical photoswitching is achieved in the encapsulation assemblies showing the power of molecular confinement for advanced chiroptical property manipulation. Adding a competing guest expels the photoswitchable guest molecules and returns the whole system back to the non-responsive chiroptical state. This concept can be used for virtually any photoswitch to turn on dormant chiroptical responses, make them light-addressable, but also supramolecularly controllable by guest exchange processes.

In this study, we establish the first systematic and rigorous benchmarking framework to evaluate the effectiveness of ML methods in TS search, enabling a standardized and application-relevant assessment of their performance. Using an end-to-end TS search workflow, we benchmark seven representative MLIPs alongside React-OT, a state-of-the-art generative model.

To address this challenge, we propose HighMPNN, a graph neural network model that builds upon ProteinMPNN by incorporating a structure prediction module and integrating cross-entropy loss with Frame Aligned Point Error (FAPE) loss. This dual-loss strategy enables the simultaneous optimization of sequence generation and structural fidelity, making HighMPNN better suited for cyclic peptide design. HighMPNN demonstrates superior performance in both sequence recovery and structural consistency compared to baseline models, particularly for short cyclic peptides and specific secondary structures.

Th\u0435 local adsorption site Rh(I)-like chemistry is confirmed by in situ FTIR spectroscopy of CO, detecting the corresponding monocarbonyl species at about 2100 cm-1. The corresponding metal-dihydrogen complex is manifested via the stretching dihydrogen(deuterium) vibrations observed at 3808 cm-1 (2737 cm-1). Our computational work predicts optimal binding energy in this complex for hydrogen storage applications, in the order of 24 kJ/mol at ambient temperatures, owing to a substantial dihydrogen -bond electron donation into the frontier Rh 4s state. Interestingly, and in contrast to all other known -bond dihydrogen-metal complexes, here a back-donation from rhodium d-states into the dihydrogen * antibonding states is practically absent, and hence the resultant metal-dihydrogen complex appears a pure -bond complex. Furthermore, the particular electronic structure of the dirhodium unit appears very suitable for applications related to the capture and utilization of iodine (its radionuclides) containing volatile species as well as separation of isoelectronic species like nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.

However, due to the lower peak intensity for the long picosecond pulse used in achieving sub-wavenumber resolution in the HR-BB-SFG-VS measurement, only molecular interfaces with relatively strong signal have been studied. To achieve detailed understanding and broader applications in molecular interfacial studies with HR-BB-SFG-VS, higher sensitivity and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for HR-BB-SFG-VS is required. In this report, we present a systematic effort on the significant improvement of sensitivity and SNR for HR-BB-SFG-VS.

While traditional porous materials are typically constructed from abiotic components, there is increasing interest in using biologically derived building blocks (e.g., peptides and proteins) that offer un-matched structural and functional diversity. Here, we report the construction of crystalline mesoporous frameworks that are self-assembled from amphiphilic collagen-mimetic peptides (aCMPs). These aCMPs consist of charge-segregated collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) modified with lipid tails at their N-termini. Through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, aCMPs organize into extended, three-dimensional (3D) porous architectures. Comprehensive structural characterization using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryogenic TEM (cryo-TEM), and small/wide-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) reveals that these frameworks exhibit hexagonally arranged mesopores with diameters of approximately 3 nm. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicates significant disruptions to the canonical collagen triple helix structure of the CMP domains, likely due to the packing of alkyl chains within hydrophobic cores. Notably, the crystal size and lattice packing parameters can be systematically tuned by varying the length of the lipid tail (C12, C10, C8), while shortening the chain further (to C6) leads to the emergent formation of nanosheets. These observations highlight the importance of balancing electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to promote long-range order.

In this study, we introduce vinyl-phosphonamidates (VPAs) as a novel class of latent cysteine electrophiles and assess their reactivity, selectivity, and potential for developing covalent inhibitors. Compared to well-established chloroacetamide and acrylamide electrophiles VPAs exhibit a significantly lower intrinsic reactivity towards the model thiol glutathione. Moreover, VPA-derived covalent fragments displayed only very limited non-specific reactivity in human cell lysate. Encouraged by these results, we developed VPA-functionalized derivatives of the FDA-approved covalent inhibitors Afatinib and Ibrutinib and evaluated their ability to engage the target protein by gel-based and mass spectrometry-based activity based protein profiling (ABPP). Compared to commonly employed Michael-acceptor based electrophilic groups, PA-functionalized drug ligands displayed significantly less off-targets while maintaining inhibitor efficiency. Furthermore, we leveraged the modular nature and accessibility of VPAs to develop a bifunctional proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) for targeted protein degradation. The demonstrated selectivity and modularity, as exemplified by the incorporation of various ligands on the phosphorus O-substituent, of the vinyl-phosphonamidate group as a cysteine-directed electrophile highlights its ability to expand the chemical space in the development of covalent inhibitors with a favourable proteome-wide reactivity profile.", "date": "2025-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A widely proposed mechanism involves stepwise radical capture by a nickel(II) complex that forms a nickel(III) intermediate. The alternative pathway, a concerted radical capture and carbon\u2013carbon bond formation, has been largely overlooked. This study investigates the ligand effect and kinetics of nickel-mediated radical capture and reductive elimination, which provide evidence to distinguish between stepwise and concerted pathways. Through radical clock experi-ments, spectroscopic investigation, electrochemical studies, and multivariate linear regression analysis of a series of [(py-box)Ni(Ar)]BArF4 complexes, we established a strong correlation between the rate of radical capture and HOMO and LUMO energies, along with positive charge stabilization at nickel and the aryl actor ligand. These data rule out the stepwise for-mation of a nickel(III) intermediate and support a concerted pathway. Redox-active nitrogen ligands and non-redox-active phosphine ligands exhibit contrasting reactivity, with only redox-active ligands facilitating radical capture and carbon\u2013carbon bond formation. This critical role of ligand redox activity can be attributed to the participation of the LUMO in bond cleav-age and formation. Among redox-active ligands, bidentate and tridentate ligands exhibit similar rates, suggesting a con-sistent mechanism with relatively minimal ancillary ligand effect.

After merging and performing structure standardization on 18 pesticide/biocide databases, we identified 4,932 unique substances.

The chemical space overlap between the pesticide substances and each genotoxicity set was evaluated by calculating physicochemical descriptors and molecular fingerprints, which were visualized using PCA and UMAP, respectively. The chemical space of pesticide substances was well represented by Ames test data and, to varying degrees, by the other genotoxicity tests, with particularly low coverage for in vivo chromosomal aberration. The major scaffolds found in pesticide substances appeared in all genotoxicity data sets. Functional groups overrepresented in the genotoxicity data compared to pesticide substances were indicative of prototypical genotoxic substances, while those that were underrepresented included motifs potentially associated with pesticides (e.g., halogens).

Here, we report systematic studies of amphiphilic polymer chelators designed to probe how composition and patterning influence binding affinity and selectivity for rare earth elements (REEs), a series of technologically relevant metals with challenging separation profiles. A library of copolymers varying hydrophobic monomer composition and patterning was synthesized via reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization, spanning statistical, gradient, and block architectures.

Further, we investigated the role of different hydrophobic comonomers in tuning metal coordination, with binding trends linked to structural features that influence binding site desolvation. Complementary dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements showed that both polymer and monomer architecture modulate metal-induced conformational changes, and that multi-chain assembly behavior emerges beyond critical hydrophobic thresholds. Sequence control also altered REE selectivity, with non-monotonic differences observed across compositionally identical polymers with different sequence architectures.

While some model implementations with varying degrees of complexity are available, existing regulatory-grade dispersion models are cumbersome to apply within an inversion framework on a routine operational level or at scale, and require a gamut of meteorologic information that is typically not available in field operations. Simple Gaussian plume models on the other hand, fail to incorporate changing wind regimes that are routinely observed and prove relevant in practice. Filling this critical need, we provide a computationally efficient and scalable version of the Gaussian puff model with a thresholding algorithm that is two orders of magnitude faster than a naive implementation and only requires readily available meteorological data. Our comparison shows that the Gaussian puff model is higher fidelity and able to capture temporal variation in atmospheric transport better than the commonly used Gaussian plume model. This computationally-efficient and scalable Gaussian puff implementation can be applied to model near-field atmospheric transport in a broad range of applications including the timely call to quickly infer methane emissions from measurements on oil and gas sites for efficient mitigation.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To this end, biomass and other renewable oxygenates are often processed in water or organic solvents, where products are made at the catalyst support's liquid-solid interface. Under these conditions, the selectivity of acid-catalyzed biomass conversion processes is particularly challenging to control due to the reactive nature of biogenic oxygenates, which can form multiple products in series and parallel. According to our central hypothesis, surface-grafted polymer moieties should modulate the solvation free energy of reactant and product states near active sites, and potentially enhance the rates of desired reaction steps over undesired ones, similar to how liquid solvent mixtures control reactivity over mineral acid catalyst. Here, we utilized readily tabulated polymer solubility descriptors (Hansen Solubility Parameters) to pre-select polyimides (PIM) as HMF-selective silica modifiers from a subset of candidate polymer systems. We utilize solvent-based methods and coprecipitation techniques to generate monodispersed silica nanoparticles (110-13,000 nm) with well-defined acid densities of 0.25-2.35 mmol g-1. We synthesized polyimide moieties from 4,4\u2019-oxidianiline (ODA) and 4,4\u2019-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) precursors, and used THF/water mixtures to tune the solubility of the as-synthesized polyimide film and recover chains of well-defined molecular weights. We graft these polyimide structures on acid-functionalized silica nanoparticles (NP\u2019s); and utilize electron microscopy, laser light diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis to confirm their successful grafting on the silica surface (~4-16 wt%). We report reaction kinetics measurements, as well as modeling results accounting for reaction/diffusion dynamics to demonstrate how polyimide-decorated silicas preferentially stabilize the product state in acid-catalyzed dehydration of fructose into 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). As a result, rates and selectivity towards HMF are enhanced relative to the same catalyst in pure water. Although the polymers do create a strong diffusion boundary which limits their performance, we introduced a molecular dynamics-enabled strategy to screen materials and design polymer modified surfaces that should balance diffusion resistance with enhanced reactivity. In a forthcoming publication, we will present a general strategy to extend this concept to the design of arbitrary surfaces for a given reaction sequence.", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Acid Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The IL absorbs CO2 from raw biogas or simulated air under source-integrated conditions, i.e. 30 \u00b0C and 1-2 bar of CO2 source. Then, iPrRu-MACHO-Cl catalyzes the hydrogenation of the IL-captured CO2 to FA at 30 \u00b0C and 1-20 bar H2. Additionally, the system exhibits high activity for FA dehydrogenation, producing pure CO2 and H2 at temperatures down to just 50 \u00b0C, thus providing optimal conditions for the first example of a benign Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) system that simultaneously can carry out decarbonization. Using real biogas (41% CO2, 1 bar, 30 \u00b0C), the system successfully cycles between converting CO2 to FA to approximately 100 mol% FA/IL and reversing it back to pure CO2/H2, maintaining high activity over multiple cycles. The system is also active under continuous-flow conditions. Under a 1:5 CO2:H2 flow (1 bar), the IL achieves a FA saturation of 67 mol% FA/IL, corresponding to 17 wt% FA/IL. Mass spectrometry (MS) data further indicates that the IL captures CO2 from air. Notably, this work does not involve any additives nor volatile organic solvents.

A minor fraction of surface ZnOx sites possessed Lewis acidity and even fewer sites possessed a Br\u00f8nsted acidic Zn(OH)+Si moiety. Ethanol temperature-programmed surface reaction-mass spectrometry (TPSR-MS) with various oxidative or ethanol reaction pretreatments indicated that only sites with Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acidic character (Zn(OH)+Si) were active for ethanol dehydrogenation, while the majority surface (\u2261SiO)2Zn2+O2Si=) sites were inactive. Greater heterogeneity among all surface ZnOx sites, as assessed by in situ DR UV-vis spectroscopy, was associated with a greater number of ZnOx sites that were active for ethanol dehydrogenation as well as lower enthalpic barriers for acetaldehyde production amongst the most active surface ZnOx sites. Turnover frequencies and the apparent activation energy for ethanol dehydrogenation were determined from steady-state kinetics. Together, these findings suggested that anchoring inactive surface (\u2261SiO)2Zn2+O2Si=) sites on the silica support caused a greater number of active surface ZnOx sites to adopt a more strained configuration, promoting ethanol dehydrogenation catalysis. Pretreatments and catalysts that promoted desorption of ethanol during TPSR, taken as a marker of surface dehydroxylation, were associated an increased number of the most active surface (Zn(OH)+Si) sites.

Consequently, there is a growing need for modeling approaches that effectively integrate the real-space molecular perspective employed by computational chemists and the reciprocal-space dispersive perspective employed by computational physicists. Here, we propose the localized active space (LAS) approach as a promising method to successfully bridge this gap. The LAS approach extends the active space concept from multiconfigurational methods such as complete active space self-consistent field theory to multiple molecular fragments via a product-form wave function ansatz. Here, we apply this method to solid state phenomena by treating each unit cell as a fragment with different sets of local quantum numbers (e.g., charge and excitation number). State interaction between these LAS states (LASSI) thus provides a comprehensive basis for the study of charge and energy transfer, meeting and surpassing the capabilities of single-reference fragmentation approaches such as constrained density functional theory (cDFT). Most centrally, we show how combining this LASSI approach with  multiconfigurational pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) provides an elegant and efficient method to compute band structures that capture multiconfigurational character. We apply the LASSI band structure approach to the computation of band gaps in stretched hydrogen chain, polyacetylene, and bulk nickel oxide (NiO), finding good or excellent quantitative agreement with reference values in all cases. Additionally, we use the LAS basis in one-dimensional model systems to demonstrate its ability to treat difficult solid-state phenomena such as exciton transfer and excitation at p-n junctions.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

While electrolyte compositions have been shown to significantly alter the catalytic activity, the mechanistic role of the electrolytes and their structures at the electrochemical double-layer remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically tuned the water structures through highly concentrated water-in-organics electrolytes, where we confined water in aprotic organic solvents. Decreasing the water-to-organic solvent ratio, water molecules became more isolated and showed increased pKa, which is correlated with more negative water reduction potential on polycrystalline Pt. The hydrogen evolution/oxidation (HER/HOR) reaction kinetics were solvent-dependent, where electrolytes containing organic solvents with high donor numbers, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), decreased the HER activity more  than the electrolytes with low donor number solvents, such as acetonitrile (ACN). DMSO promoted isolated water at the interface through stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds between individual water and DMSO, while ACN promoted more symmetric H-bonded water at the interface. Further support for the proposed mechanism came from in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Decreasing HER activity can be correlated to the increasing fraction of isolated water near the electrical double layer.

For hundreds of millions of people living with diabetes around the world, it is not only a scientific achievement but an urgent necessity \u2013 a vital solution that saves lives every single day. The chemical functionalization of insulin has been desired for various applications such as controlled release (e.g. short or long acting), rescue from toxic fibrillation, and searching for alternative administration approaches (e.g. oral medication). In Type-1 diabetes the controlled pancreas mediated secretion of insulin is been diminished, raising the need to apply insulin to the blood circulation on demand and careful control. With the risk of hypoglycemia attempts are being explored continuously to develop chemistry for the rewiring of insulin properties towards gaining an unnatural sensitivity to glucose blood levels, mimicking the failed pancreatic control. Due to their sugars binding capabilities, boronic acids are great candidates for potential insulin built-in glucose molecular sensors. Nevertheless, despite a century of scientific research the synthetic information currently available for multiple and selective insulin modification is inadequate, limiting the possibility to explore the effect of sensitive functional groups implantation into insulin. Moreover, boronic acid compounds were discovered to be less potent towards glucose rather than other sugars (e.g. fructose), limiting its therapeutic potential. Here, we report the development of a de novo Protein Specific Modification (PSM) strategy. The strategy focuses on shifting the paradigm from general-to-specific protein modification protocols. We revealed and utilized a new synthetic kit to perform multiple insulin modification in a precise manner. Utilizing our developed protocol, we were able to modify naked insulin precisely with three different elements. Moreover, we have progressed towards the potential development of smart boronate insulin by the introduction of synthetic rigid diborontae motif with glucose sensitive properties. Also, we have inserted a glucose mimic element to explore potential activity changes upon internal reversible bridging in presence and absence of glucose. Our in-cell activities findings reveal surprised tolerance of two de novo insulin analogues to a fluctuation with sugars levels. We anticipate these findings to pave the way for the further exploration of synthetic diboronate chemistry in the context of insulin modification. In addition, we expect our PSM approach for targeting a solely protein or a member of large protein family to transform the field of protein chemistry, allowing precise tools for more focused aims, with tremendous therapeutic potential and scope. This paradigm shifts from the general to the specific targeted chemistry in peptide and protein science is anticipated to open the door for a future database, we term as; PSM bank, to modify specific protein in the presence of other peptide and proteins, potentially for in vivo spatial selectivity. \n", "date": "2025-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Graphitic electrodes functionalized with redox-active organic (RAO) capture agents offer a unique opportunity for an inexpensive, abundant, and easily scalable system for direct EMCC. However, the mechanistic understanding and observation of intermediate capture states on carbon surfaces using spectroscopic signatures remains unexplored. Herein, we present in situ monitoring of the reversible capture and release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from graphene-on-gold electrodes modified with grafted anthraquinone (AQ) and a synthesized riboflavin derivative, 10-ethyl-3-methyl flavin derivative (MFD). These electrodes conveniently enable the use of surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy in an attenuated total reflectance configuration (ATR-SEIRAS). We successfully decouple the spectral responses of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and CO2 capture processes by characterizing AQ- and MFD-modified electrodes under argon and CO2 atmospheres. Continuous polarization of the electrode to generate the reduced forms of AQ also generates carbonate (CO32-) peaks at 1640 cm-1 and 1380 cm-1 that overshadow the spectral responses of AQ-bound CO2. Conversely, reducing AQ or MFD under inert atmosphere, followed by introducing CO2 with no applied potential (i.e. at open circuit) results in the growth of distinct spectral features ~1710-1630 cm-1. The release of CO2 was observed through the regeneration of an intense carbonyl stretch at ~1660 cm-1 upon electrooxidation, corresponding with CV observations for AQ and MFD. Preliminary CO2 capture  experiments using a two-electrode flow cell device with AQ- and MFD-modified YP-50 porous carbon electrodes indicate that MFD systems perform on par with AQ systems.

A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of \u03c0-extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri-anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all-red to near- infrared absorption. The excited-state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including (TD-)DFT and ADC(2) calculations as well as steady- state and time-resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that E-to-Z photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead shows that photoswitching proceeds on the T\u2081 PES. These insights enhance our understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the \u03c0-system and peri- connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red-shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference from oxygen quenching.

This approach overcomes the problem of data inconsistencies in the training of machine learning models on atomistic data. We rephrase the underlying problem as a multi-task learning scenario. We show that conditioning neural network-based models on trainable embedding vectors can effectively account for quantitative differences between methods. This allows for joint training on multiple datasets that would otherwise be incompatible. Therefore, this procedure circumvents the need for re-computations at a unified level of theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training on multiple reference methods enables transfer learning between tasks, resulting in even lower errors compared to training on separate tasks alone. Furthermore, we show that this approach can be used for multi-fidelity learning, improving data efficiency for the highest fidelity by an order of magnitude. To test scalability, we train a single model on a joint dataset compiled from 10 disjoint subsets of the MultiXC-QM9 dataset generated by different reference methods. Again, we observe transfer learning effects that improve the model errors by a factor of 2 compared to training on each subset alone.

Herein, a series of bilayered V2O5 host materials pillared with alkyldiamines of different lengths is systematically studied, resulting in tunable nanoconfinement geometry with  interlayer spacings in the range of 1.0-1.9 nm.

However, conventional MS/MS methods are limited in characterizing isomeric lipids resulting from variants in double bond and sn-positions within the fatty acyl chains. This limitation is due to the fact that conventional collision induced dissociation (CID) of even-electron lipid precursor ions does not generate highly efficient product ions from intrachain fragmentation of the fatty acyl substituents. Herein, we have developed a workflow that leverages a new lipid ion type to facilitate radical-directed dissociation (RDD). Briefly, low-energy CID of [M + CuII + anion]+ ion types results in a radical cation, and subsequent activation of the radical cation results in  highly efficient intrachain fragmentation of fatty acyl chains. This method provides abundant diagnostic fragment ions that are associated with the double bond and fatty acyl chain positions on the glycerol backbone and thus can be used to differentiate isomeric phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The incorporation of an anionic ligand in the [PC + CuII + anion]+ ion type is key to this chemistry. Specifically, the major fragmentation channel for the [PC + CuI]+ ion type is neutral loss of phosphocholine headgroup, but shifts to RDD for [PC + CuII + anion]+ ion types containing strongly electronegative anions.

Here, we introduce a mixed-electrolyte strategy that enhances the stability of 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) by enabling continuous in situ regeneration of redox-active species under standard operating conditions. By incorporating 0.1 M 4,4\u2032-((9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-diyl)dioxy)dibutyrate (DBEAQ) into a 0.1 M DHAQ electrolyte, the capacity fade rate is reduced from 4.7% to 0.9% per day, representing a 62% decrease with respect to the value of 2.35%/day expected from the rule of mixtures for a non-interacting mixture. Increasing the DBEAQ concentration to 0.2 M further decreases the fade rate to 0.43% per day, representing a 73% reduction relative to the expected value of 1.57%. Electrochemical and NMR analyses reveal that regeneration occurs via a two-step process: chemical oxidation of anthrone to its dimer, followed by electrochemical oxidation of the dimer back to DHAQ. This regeneration pathway is made possible by the mixed-electrolyte system, which shifts the concentration balance between DHA and dimer toward dimer formation, as DBEAQ acts as an oxidant due to its more positive redox potential. We demonstrate that this mixed-electrolyte strategy is not limited to DBEAQ, highlighting its broader applicability across the anthraquinone species. Moreover, the underlying regeneration mechanism may be extended to other anthraquinone derivatives that degrade through similar pathways, offering a promising framework to enhance electrolyte longevity and stability in organic redox flow batteries.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To address this issue, we propose a relative evaluation framework for odor prediction, focusing on odor similarity rather than absolute descriptors. In this study, we constructed three-dimensional structures of approximately 400 human olfactory receptors (hORs) using AlphaFold2 and performed molecular docking simulations with odorant compounds. Each odorant was represented as a 409-dimensional docking score vector, and odor similarity was inferred by comparing these vectors statistically. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we used odorant molecules from the ATLAS database and tested whether molecules with similar docking profiles correspond to similar olfactory perceptions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed docking-based method enables the relative prediction of odor similarity between molecules, even for compounds not included in the reference database.

Computational solid-form screening is increasingly being used to help identify effective drug formulations and de-risk against undesirable crystal forms.

We first show how these DFT models incorrectly identify the preferred tautomeric polymorphs of 2-thiobarituric acid and the  antihelmintic drug mebendazole, and that some functionals substantially underestimate the barrier to solid-state tautomerization. Surveying 19 additional examples, we find that tautomeric polymorph energy differences defy conventional wisdom by regularly and substantially exceeding the 10 kJ/mol energy window associated with crystal polymorphism.  Moreover, the DFT errors in the polymorph energy differences are strikingly large: they can reach tens of kJ/mol, and they produce the wrong qualitative stability ordering in ~20-30% of the cases. We address the challenge of predicting tautomeric polymorphs through a general solution that combines periodic hybrid DFT with intramolecular coupled-cluster theory corrections to substantially improve agreement with experiment.

While most studies have focused on understanding the role of Ga as a promoter, the effect and role of Si on the catalytic properties are less explored and understood. Therefore, tailored mon-ometallic Pt and bimetallic Pt-Ga catalysts supported on alumina or Si-doped alumina are prepared via surface organometallic chemistry and evaluated under PDH conditions. The Pt catalyst containing both Ga and Si displays the highest propene productivity (1970 molC3= molPt-1 h-1 after 2 hours) and the lowest deactivation constant (0.31 h-1 after 2 hours), pointing out the critical role of both Ga and Si.

However, limited cellular uptake reduces its therapeutic potential, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria. In this study, we investigated Thiol-Mediated Uptake (TMU) to promote the delivery of Fdx into bacterial cells. We synthesized a library of Fdx derivatives bearing cyclic dichalcogenide moieties, and evaluated their antimicrobial properties against C. difficile and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively. Remarkably, the synthetic Fdx derivatives retained strong levels of antibacterial activity, and the disulfide-containing analogs outperformed their all-carbon control counterparts in many instances. We then developed a systematic study to investigate the mechanistic impact of the introduced disulfide functionalities by conducting experiments with TMU inhibitors, and quantifying intracellular accumulation in Mycobacterium bovis BCG, a model organism for M. tuberculosis, via LC-MS/MS. While complete disentanglement of the factors influencing activity was not feasible, features such as compound stability and lipophilicity were identified as significant contributors. Overall, the superior performance of disulfide analogs suggests that differences in cellular entry or intracellular processing, potentially related to TMU, are involved.

Progress toward this grand challenge have been impeded, in part, by the absence of a general blueprint for the macromolecular design of such materials. Herein, we introduce a \u201cmacroisostere\u201d design strategy, where the carbonyl group (\u2013CO\u2013) in polyurethanes (PUs) is replaced with a sulfonyl group (\u2013SO\u2082\u2013), resulting in a virtually unknown family of polymers called polysulfamates. This approach, inspired by the use of bioisosteres in drug discovery, aims to preserve key interchain interactions that contribute to thermomechanical performance, while enhancing the hydrolytic lability of the polymer backbone. The optimization of a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) polymerization allowed the synthesis of ten polysulfamates structurally analogous to common PUs. Comparative analysis of one PU and its polysulfamate analog showed that this isosteric substitution increases thermal stability, slightly lowers the glass transition temperature, and retains similar hardness and reduced Young\u2019s modulus. Notably, the S(VI)-based polysulfamate demonstrated significantly enhanced hydrolytic degradability.

Our observations reveal a general tendency for the replenishment of voids upon redeposition of lithium. We explain this by gradients in the mechanical stress that act as driving forces for atom motion inside the electrode and thus feed lithium away from the interface back into existing voids, which restores the original shape of the electrode. During operation, lithium atoms are inserted or extracted at the interface, creating stresses in the electrode. In electrodes with smaller lithium grains we observe that the shape of voids is strongly influenced by the microstructure of the lithium metal and that grain boundaries can obstruct void growth. We consider diffusion along lithium grain boundaries and the inner surface of voids as important pathways for metal transport. We suggest that the local balance of the diffusional metal fluxes is responsible for the evolution of the shape of the metal electrode.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the predicted 3D structures is below 1 \u00c5\u2014smaller than the radius of a single atom.

Here, we demonstrate a simple synthesis strategy that enables exceptionally stable Ni-rich cathodes without doping, coating or concentration gradients. Through extensive multi-scale microscopy, we show that chemo-mechanical failure is closely linked to microstructural non-uniformity (specifically, nanoscale pores), stemming from limited physical contact between solid-state reactants during calcination. Simply by increasing the melting rate of LiOH, we enhance liquid-solid interfacial contact between precursors, resulting in uniformly evolved microstructures. This uniform microstructure leads to excellent cycle life by effectively dissipating strain energy and mitigating chemo-mechanical failure, surprisingly, even in the presence of the high-voltage phase transition.

However, its wide bandgap (>3 eV) limits solar absorption to under 5%, reducing efficiency under sunlight. Plasmonic materials address this by extending light absorption into the visible and near-infrared range, enhancing catalytic activity through localized electromagnetic fields, hot carriers, and photothermal effects. Transition metal nitrides like TiN, ZrN, and HfN emerge as promising, cost-effective alternatives to noble metals due to their strong broadband absorption and chemical stability. While earlier studies attribute their photocatalytic enhancement mainly to hot carrier injection, more detailed assessment is needed to properly understand the enhancement pathway. This study synthesizes composites of TiN, ZrN, and HfN with commercial P25 TiO2 and evaluates their photocatalytic performance via Rhodamine B dye degradation. Under 100 mW cm-2 illumination, the 1 wt% ZrN/TiO2 composite achieves over 99% dye degradation in 50 minutes, outperforming TiN and HfN, which require 10 wt% loading for similar results. By analyzing reaction temperature profiles and degradation kinetics under different light intensities, the study finds hot carrier effects dominate in TiN/TiO2 and ZrN/TiO2 systems, while photothermal effects play a larger role in HfN/TiO2 composites.

The experimental observations indicate that the activation free energy for ring inversion of 1-SO2 is larger than that of 1-S, a finding that is supported by DFT calculations. This increased energy barrier for inversion in 1-SO\u2082 is due to an intramolecular interaction between the O atom and H atom of the benzene ring. The intramolecular H\u2022\u2022\u2022O interaction, which is strongly supported by DFT calculations and X-ray crystallography, contributes to stabilization of the ground state of 1-SO\u2082, but must be broken in the ring inversion transition state.

Subsequently, the negative free energy for the desorption of NH3 from the O-defective surface discloses the availability of catalytic sites for further NRR. In addition, the reconstructed surface possessing multifarious coordinatively unsaturated Cu atoms succumbs to irreversible structural variations unlike the O-defective surface which has well-defined active centers.

This review provides a comprehensive state of the art on the theoretical and experimental aspects of PFAS adsorption. By adopting a fundamental physical chemistry standpoint, we report on recent advances in understanding the complex adsorption phenomena arising from their rich and intriguing behavior in combination with the various thermodynamic and chemical conditions encountered in practical situations. First, we define the main properties of PFAS by focusing on chemical aspects such as composition, molecular structure and dissociation. We also examine their physical properties -- including the phase diagram, solubility and aggregation of PFAS. Second, we introduce the fundamental interactions involved in the adsorption of individual molecules on solid surfaces before evaluating the collective behaviors associated with the self-aggregation of PFAS molecules, the formation of ionic bridges between PFAS molecules and the solid surface, the competition with organic matter (OM) and/or the adsorption of OM-PFAS complexes. We also present the fundamentals of the thermodynamics and kinetics of PFAS adsorption by introducing classical adsorption isotherm models and highlighting the theoretical principles needed to provide a robust description framework. In particular, an accurate definition of the adsorption and desorption rates for a physical modeling of PFAS kinetics is discussed along with the key factors determining the kinetic order (i.e. first, second or mixed order kinetics). More complex aspects are then presented by emphasizing the specific characteristics of PFAS adsorption. In particular, both batch and kinetic adsorption experiments are analyzed to identify the role of the solid surface geometry and chemistry, as well as the influence of PFAS structure and chemistry on the adsorption mechanisms. The role of the water matrix is also evaluated by examining how the surface capacity and affinity for PFAS molecules is modified by environmental parameters such as pH and salinity. The impact of copollutants and OM on the adsorption kinetics is also evaluated. We conclude this review by identifying the fundamental and practical challenges that remain to be addressed and provide perspectives for the characterization and modeling of PFAS adsorption on solid surfaces and in porous materials.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Chemical Kinetics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Sulfite oxidation rates scale with the surface-area to volume ratio (i.e. 1/radius) of the microdroplet and oxidation occurs in the absence of any added catalysts.

A more stable pyridine adduct, [Ru(bpy')2(CO)(CH2pyridine)]2+, was crystallographically characterized. Even ethylene itself is sufficiently nucleophilic to react with the electrophilic methylidene, revealing a route from CO to the C3 hydrocarbon cyclopropane.

Deane; Frank von Delft; Philip C. Biggin", "abstract": "Fragment hits serve as starting points for lead-like compound development.  A common approach to advancing from fragments is to build structure-activity relationships (SARs) from close analogues. One strategy involves performing automated chemistry around fragment hits and evaluating resulting crude reaction mixtures (CRMs) of analogues in assays, bypassing costly purification. However, these purification-agnostic workflows are often perceived as noisy, and therefore typically involve additional hit resynthesis for confirmation, potentially discarding false negatives and reducing SAR dataset size. High-throughput (HT) X-ray crystallography has the potential to address these issues by unambiguously resolving hits directly from 100s\u20131000s of CRMs. However, no systematic analytics exist for extracting SAR models from HT crystallographic evaluation of CRMs.\nWe demonstrate that crystallographic SAR (xSAR) can be extracted from CRMs evaluated via HT X-ray crystallography. We present here a simple rule-based ligand scoring scheme that identifies conserved chemical features linked to binding and non-binding observations in crystallography. Applied to a large-scale crystallographic dataset of 957 fragment elaborations in CRMs targeting PHIP(2), a therapeutically relevant bromodomain, our xSAR model demonstrated effectiveness in two proof-of-concept experiments. First, it recovered 26 missed binders in the initial dataset, doubling the hit rate and denoising the dataset. Second, it enabled a prospective virtual screen, also leveraging previously resolved cocrystal structures, that identified novel hits with informative chemistries, achieving up to a 10-fold binding affinity improvement over the repurified hit from the initial CRM evaluation.\nThis work establishes a proof-of-concept that xSAR models can be directly extracted from large-scale crystallographic readouts of CRMs, offering a valuable methodology to build SAR models and accelerate design-make-test iterations without requiring CRM hit resynthesis and confirmation. This invites future work to utilise advanced analytics and modelling techniques to further strengthen purification-agnostic workflows.\n", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, an ASPEN Plus model is developed and use to explore the trade-offs between different objectives in syngas production using solid oxide electrolysis cells. Two different system designs are investigated: a low and a high utilization design.

The trade-offs between these objectives are analyzed to gain insights into the operation of SOEC systems in co-electrolysis mode.

By collapsing the full atomic structure into simplified pseudo-oscillators located at the centers of mass (COMs) of benzenoid rings, we construct a compact vibrational representation rooted in group theory. This approach not only reproduces the number and symmetry of vibrational modes obtained from conventional analysis but also provides a clear geometrical and electronic interpretation of the motions through one-dimensional (\\(f(x)\\)) and two-dimensional (\\(f(y,z)\\)) COM trajectories. When applied in conjunction with range-separated density functional theory (DFT) using CAM-B3LYP, LC-\\(\\omega\\)HPBE, and \\(\\omega\\)B97XD functionals, the model reveals persistent, highly regular functional-dependent signatures in vibrational descriptors\u2014force constants, reduced masses, and spatial spans\u2014across all systems.

Functional-specific deviations in ZPE predictions highlight the sensitivity of vibrational properties to the exchange-correlation treatment and underscore the need for internal standards in benchmarking.

Here we leverage surface chemistry and core/shell architectures to uncover the contribution of dopants at the nanocrystal surface and of dopants in the nanocrystal bulk. We first assess the doping efficiency by ICP and find that, while Eu is almost quantitatively incorporated, the other lanthanides (La, Ce, Tb, Tm, Er, Yb) have about 50% incorporation efficiency over the studied doping range of 1-10%. We then determine the nanocrystal surface chemistry using NMR spectroscopy, despite the additional spectral line broadening caused by the paramagnetic lanthanide dopants. By varying the surface ligands and measuring the photoluminescence, we resolve the spectroscopic signals that are sensitive to a change in surface chemistry. Time-resolved emission spectra further reinforce the notion of a bulk component with a long luminescent lifetime and a surface component with a fast lifetime. Upon shelling Eu- or Tb-doped zirconia NCs with pure zirconia, the surface component disappears, and the photoluminescence quantum yield increases. We further functionalized the surface of the core/shell particles with oleylphosphonic acid ligands to obtain excellent dispersibility.

GalNAc ligands are usually added to the termini of therapeutic oligonucleotides by costly and time-consuming chemical methods that often require specialized equipment and knowledge. Here, we have explored the possibility of enzymatically labelling oligonucleotides with triantennary GalNAc ligands which would be directly amenable to any type of sequence without requiring any synthetic effort.

In parallel, we have equipped the 3\u2019-position of an LNA nucleoside triphosphate with a GalNAc residue and used this nucleotide analog for labelling of oligonucleotides with template-independent polymerases. While kinases do not seem to tolerate the presence of such a bulky residue on ATP, template-independent polymerases readily incorporate the modified nucleotide at the 3\u2019-end of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides.

The combination of these amino silanes resulted in synergy, with the best oxidation stability obtained at a ratio of 20%BHAPS for 2-step and 50%BHAPS for single-step synthesis. The resulting sorbents exhibit a loss of CO2 capacity of around 70% after 190 h and 240 h aging in the air at 110 oC for 20%BHAPS (2-step) and 50%BHAPS (single-step), respectively.

This is particularly true for the emerging area of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (conPET), which has attracted both great interest due to its ability to activate inert substrates selectively and under mild conditions, and continuing controversy over its mechanistic feasibility. We describe herein the isolation of the key radical intermediate state of an acridinium-based conPET catalyst and detailed investigations of its photochemistry by a suite of (photo)reactivity, photoluminescence, and transient absorption techniques, supported by computational studies. We observe strong wavelength and solvent dependencies in the reactivity profile, which correlate well with observations of a long-lived, fluorescent excited state that would be compatible with diffusion-limited reactivity. However, photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies suggest that, counter-intuitively, this state does not actually participate in reactivity. Instead, we see changes occurring far faster than the diffusion limit, which provides strong, direct evidence for preassembly of the photocatalyst and substrate prior to photoexcitation. Further inspection also indicates parallel formation of solvated electrons, suggesting that previously competing rationales for conPET can in fact operate simultaneously, and should not be assumed to be mutually exclusive.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This study focuses on creating complex coacervates using ABA-type triblock copolymers that can bridge isolated polyion complex (PIC) domains, enabling the formation of well-ordered assemblies of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated PIC nanoparticles. These coacervates exhibit reversible responses to temperature changes and morphological hysteresis upon cooling, allowing for the controlled release of PIC micelles at physiological temperatures in the zero-order kinetics. This study demonstrates that the degree of bridging of PIC domains can be tuned simply by adjusting the blend ratio of diblock to triblock copolymers, which affects their physical properties and responsiveness.

The successful sustained release of a model protein, green fluorescent protein, is also confirmed to occur in a zero-order manner.

J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 8470\u20138480]. Comparing the accurate experimental singlet\u2013triplet energy gaps and fluorescence energies to values computed with DFT/MRCI reveals a robust performance without large or systematic errors. Specifically in the vertical approximation without a solvation model, DFT/MRCI achieves mean absolute deviations (MADs) for singlet\u2013triplet gaps and emission energies of 0.06 eV and 0.21 eV, respectively. Surprisingly, these values do not improve systematically when geometric relaxation and state-specific solvation effects are included. Apparently, part of these effects are absorbed in the parameterization of DFT/MRCI and attempting to include them explicitly via a ROKS+PCM reaction field leads to an imbalanced treatment. As a result, the simplest approach of running calculations in the vertical approximation in gas phase turns out to be the most accurate. Albeit less accurate and more computationally demanding than state-specific orbital-optimized DFT, DFT/MRCI has the advantage that all low-lying excited states are obtained in a single calculation, including transition properties between them. At the same time, the aforementioned performance for the singlet\u2013triplet gaps and emission energies is achieved without molecule-specific or state-specific adjustments like optimal tuning that is often necessary for time-dependent DFT. Hence, we conclude that DFT/MRCI is particularly useful during the initial stage of computational investigations of TADF emitters to screen for the singlet\u2013triplet gaps and identify the relevant states, whose energies can then be refined with accurate state-specific DFT methods like ROKS or (\u0394)UKS with MADs for singlet\u2013triplet gaps below 0.03 eV.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The local volume change of certain active materials, such as nickel-rich LiNixMnyCozO2, significantly varies with the lithium content, which should be considered in the stress calculations in the ASSB modeling studies.

We performed an extensive computational investigation of DMFase catalysis, combining reaction pathway analysis with quantum mechanical cluster models, charge shift analysis, and energy decomposition analysis to identify the mechanistic role of the coordinating tyrosines/glutamate and second coordination sphere residues. We first compared two mechanisms initiated by the key second coordination sphere residues Glu657 and His519. While both mechanisms generate a ferric hydroxide intermediate, the Glu657-initiated mechanism exhibits more favorable barriers and thermodynamics. These calculations reveal distinct catalytic roles for second second-sphere residues: Glu657 facilitates direct proton transfers, His519 and Asn547 stabilize the rate-determining transition state, and Lys567 favors the anionic tyrosinate state of Tyr440 via a cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction. Mechanistic comparisons to canonical Fe(II)/Fe(III)-2His-1Glu variants reveal that coordination of Fe by tyrosine residues lowers the barrier for deprotonation of a water ligand and subsequent nucleophilic attack on DMF. Attempts to tune the active site through fluorination of coordinating tyrosinate residues yield minimal additional benefit, indicating that the native motif has finely-tuned electronic characteristics.

This highlights the critical need for technically advanced, yet simple-to-operate sensors suitable for field deployment. Specifically, the detection of water-dissolved pollutants is challenging due to the high propensity of water molecules to interact with sensor materials, obstructing the detection mechanism. One class of highly water-soluble pollutants are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers (collectively referred to as BTEX). These compounds are prevalent specifically in fossil fuels and are therefore often found in areas surrounding processing and storage facilities. Due to their relatively high water solubility, they have a high propensity to migrate and transport to the groundwater. Porous metal-organic frameworks have shown promise for separation technology, including as analyte-receptors in adsorption-based sensing. We hypothesized that a hydrophobic MOF with pore dimensions similar to the BTEX molecules would selectively partition these analytes from water. In our study, we have specifically investigated UHMOF-100, a material previously shown to be highly water-repellent with narrow pores hypothesized to selectively adsorb non-polar compounds. Bulk adsorption experiments confirmed the ability of UHMOF-100 to rapidly adsorb BTEX from water, demonstrating high mass capacities (up to 402 mg g\u207b\u00b9) influenced by a complex interplay of water solubility, molecular size, and guest\u2013host interactions. Building upon this, we developed a method for fabricating robust UHMOF-100 thin films on commercial quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) resonators using a layer-by-layer deposition technique. The sensor morphology, crystallite size and density have been characterized using a combination of imaging, spectroscopic and diffraction techniques. The functionalized QCM sensors successfully detected individual BTEX species spiked in water within the concentration range of 0-50 mg L\u00b9. Quantifiable responses were observed at concentrations as low as 5 mg L\u207b\u00b9, with sensitivities ranging from 2.04 to 4.59 Hz / mg L\u207b\u00b9. The sensors showed low cross-sensitivity towards more polar environmental contaminants such as phenol and benzoic acid, and a limited response to naphthalene, validating a degree of selective interaction with the target BTEX molecules. Furthermore, the UHMOF-100 films demonstrated both chemical stability in water and mechanical robustness under continuous flow conditions over extended measurement periods. This work presents, to our knowledge, the first example of a MOF-based QCM sensor for the detection of BTEX in water, demonstrating the potential of suitably designed porous materials for addressing challenging aqueous sensing applications.

The controlled synthesis of Au NPs has been an intense area of research for decades and remains an important topic in nanoscience. In particular, citrate- and borohydride- mediated colloidal syntheses of Au NPs are extremely popular. More recently, so-called surfactant-free colloidal syntheses of Au NPs are emerging promising alternative strategies, for instance using alcohol-mediated syntheses in alkaline media. While anions have been reported to influence the synthesis and stability of colloidal Au NPs, and while it can reasonably be expected that counter-cations might also have a role to play, there is surprisingly almost no study on the effect of counter-cations in citrate- and borohydride- mediated colloidal syntheses of Au NPs. It is here shown that the counter cation (Li+, Na+, K+) from citrate, borohydride, but also from hydroxide species, plays an overlooked role in the stabilization of gold colloidal dispersions. The stability, size and degree of shape control over the NP decrease in the order Li+>Na+>K+. This trend can be explained by a stronger interaction between the smaller cations and metal surfaces. The influence of the cations is more marked at higher concentrations of reducing agent and gold precursor. The findings are directly relevant for further fundamental studies, an improved control of the syntheses and scale up. It is anticipated that the findings will be broadly relevant for catalysis, sensing, biomedical applications and engineering of Au, Au-based and other nanomaterials.

High-frequency resistance (HFR) measurements are commonly used to confirm the completion of the gas purging process; however, these measurements reflect only the water content in the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and overlook water accumulation in the gas diffusion layer (GDL). In this study, we employed in situ synchrotron X-ray radiography with HFR monitoring to investigate the effects of the gas flow rate and purging duration on the water evaporation behavior within the cathode GDL. The results indicated that the water accumulation in the under-rib region of the cathode GDL was evaporation resistant, even with high-flow-rate gas purging. Quantitative analysis revealed that evaporation proceeded mainly via vapor-phase diffusive transport, with convective transport playing a minor role. Importantly, water slugs remained in the flow channels acted as diffusion barriers, limiting vapor transport. Immediately after purging, residual water migrated from the GDL to the PEM, contributing to HFR relaxation. These insights support the development of more effective purging protocols to ensure reliable cold starts in PEFC systems.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

In semiconductor science, for instance, one frequently needs compounds with different band gaps, but typically they belong to different material classes. Not so for hybrid perovskites. The networks of linked metal- (e.g. lead) halide octahedra with voids filled by organic counterions have proven high variability. In particular, impressive achievements were made in tailoring the properties of layered materials. The geometric and electronic setup of the organic linker molecule between inorganic layers impacts the crystal structure and the overall optoelectronic properties. Monoamines typically form bilayers in the so-called Ruddlesden-Popper phases (RPs), while bis-amines allow for making Dion-Jacobsen phases (DJs) with only a monolayer directly bridging the inorganic sheets. Therefore, it would be highly interesting if one could compare RPs to DJs directly to each other, meaning that they have been prepared using exactly the same organic linker molecule, which is the aim of the study presented here. Because of the potential interaction of \ud835\udf0b-conjugated compounds with the electronic system of the semiconductor, we have selected a special linker here, a ferrocene derivative containing one primary amine attached to each of the cyclopentadienyl rings. As wanted, these linkers form novel DJs; their structure was resolved by 3D electron diffraction. We found that by different crystallization kinetics, one can obtain two DJ variants and even RPs because it takes time for the ferrocene-based linker to adjust to a particular conformation. Because the linkage of the octahedra is also different for the three cases, we could observe notable changes in optoelectronic properties.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Organometallic Compounds; Solid State Chemistry; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We herein report a systematic study which demonstrates that the prevalence of this side-reaction may have been overlooked, due to the difficulty to identify it through standard HPLC analytical methods, but also the in situ conversion of aspartimide into other byproducts, having the same molecular mass as the parent aspartate residue. We show that the formation of aspartimide and derived byproducts can be limited by adopting \"good NCL practices\", which involve restricting the ligation temperature and reaction times, as well as replacing the commonly used phosphate buffer with HEPES. However, the efficiency of such precautions is expected to vary considerably depending on the sequence of the target protein, and the amount of byproducts is expected to grow with the length of the target protein, as a result of the number of NCL reactions and potential aspartimide hotspots. To overcome such limitations, we developed a novel straightforward and potentially generally applicable methodology based on the temporary protection of the backbone nitrogen by a 2-(4-aminobutanoyloxy)-4-methoxybenzyl (GABA-Hmb) group. This strategy was validated by the byproduct-free synthesis of SUMO-2 and a SUMOylated peptide mimic.

Double cross-polarization (DCP) is compared with the heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC) method. Both experiments are applicable in instances of enhanced proton polarization such as with dynamic nuclear polarization. Under fast magic-angle spinning, cross-polarization becomes a viable method for polarization transfer and provides an order of magnitude enhancement over HMQC. In particular, it is observed that faster sample spinning opens up regions of rf fields optimal for spin-locking and cross-polarization with much less T2 signal loss. The incorporation of multiple-quantum magic-angle spinning enables high 17O isotropic resolution via proton detection.", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, traditional chemical labeling methods that randomly target lysine or cysteine residues often produce heterogeneous conjugates with limited reproducibility. Conventional site-specific conjugation approaches, which typically modify only the N- or C-terminus, may also be insufficient to achieve the desired functionalities.\nGenetic code expansion offers a powerful alternative by enabling the site-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids bearing reactive handles\u2014such as trans-cyclooctene (TCO)\u2014allowing precise bioorthogonal conjugation via click chemistry. Nevertheless, identifying suitable incorporation sites that tolerate such modifications without disrupting antigen binding remains time- and cost-prohibitive, as this process typically requires labor-intensive screening involving the expression and purification of each candidate variant.\nHere, using HER2 and an anti-HER2 nanobody as a model antigen\u2013binder pair, we present a convenient mammalian cell-based screening platform for rapid, purification-free evaluation of site-specifically labeled nanobodies. The nanobody is fused to blue fluorescent protein (BFP), secreted by HEK293T cells, and labeled in situ with a tetrazine\u2013fluorescein probe. The resulting supernatant is directly applied to HEK293T cells stably expressing HER2\u2013mCherry. Labeling efficiency and retention of antigen-binding activity are simultaneously assessed by fluorescence imaging in the BFP, fluorescein, and mCherry channels.\nThis approach enables efficient identification of labeling sites that support productive click conjugation while preserving binding function. It should be broadly applicable to other antigens and binders, streamlining early-stage screening of engineered antigen\u2013binder conjugates for diverse applications.\n", "date": "2025-05-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, it remains challenging to develop NIR emitters with high brightness. Herein, we report a supramolecular approach to formulate NIR fluorescent molecular nanoparticles from cationic NIR fluorophores and cyanostar receptors using their charge-by-charge packing in small-molecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). Four types of cationic NIR fluorophores were successfully used to form NIR SMILES nanoparticles. The NIR nanoparticles show fluorescence quantum yields (FQYs) of ~1% and are over 60 times brighter than single fluorophores. Four different surface capping agents were examined and found to generate stable nanoparticles with no change in FQY. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the low FQY originates from nonradiative decay introduced by inter-fluorophore coupling. Introduction of inert molecular cations into the SMILES structures raises the FQY to ~7%.

Here, we apply this strategy in the preparation and biological evaluation of synthetic camptothecin analogs involving a C-10 silyl ether on SN-38, which not only blocks a site of metabolism but also imbues bright blue-fluorescent properties in such compounds. These siloxytecans exhibit comparable dose- and time-dependent antiproliferative activity in a broad panel of cancer cells. Uniquely, we demonstrate that the enhanced fluorescence of these compounds enables real-time, quantitative visualization of the dynamics and selectivity of intracellular uptake through fluorescence microscopy without the need for extensive sample preparation or installation of auxiliary fluorophores. We further demonstrate that the kinetics of cellular uptake observed by fluorescence microscopy are consistent with time-course washout experiments with subtle differences in anti-cancer potency in several cell lines. Further cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and cell free topoisomerase inhibition studies suggests that these siloxytecans retain the topoisomerase inhibiting properties of camptothecin and other related topoisomerase I inhibitors. Collectively, these studies highlight the utility of quantitative fluorescence microscopy in investigating mechanisms of biological transport and anticancer activity of such siloxytecans.

The F molecules were found to be accumulated on the non-charged F|W interface; however, on the charged interface, they were replaced with IL ions that formed a monolayer-like structure, nevertheless maintaining the F accumulation below the ionic monolayer. The MD simulation using different F molecules revealed that the distributions of IL ions and F molecules in the EDL varied with their structures. Since the F-W two-phase system in our MD cell was sandwiched between the two graphene (G) electrodes to polarize the F|W interface, we were able to investigate the EDL at the electrode interface of F. Ionic multilayers were formed at the F|G interface expelling the F molecules from the interface even though F was a dilute solution of IL. These accumulation and depletion behaviors at the water and electrode interfaces of F, combined with recent neutron reflectometry results, demonstrate that the EDL structures in F are strongly affected not only by the phase-boundary potential difference but also by the relative polarity of F molecules and IL ions. These findings can help design and control the EDL structures in F, contributing to the electrochemical application of F molecules at liquid/liquid and solid/liquid interfaces.

There are few other catalysts capable of producing these products at such high selectivities, highlighting the significance of chalcogen doping for these transformations. Still, further improvements remain challenging because of the difficulties in obtaining active site uniformity and gaining atomically precise structural and mechanistic understanding about the active sites. As such, much recent research has been devoted to the development of atomically precise nanoclusters for use in catalysis. Despite significant advances in the synthesis and application of gold nanoclusters for catalysis, catalytic studies of copper nanoclusters remain are underexplored.

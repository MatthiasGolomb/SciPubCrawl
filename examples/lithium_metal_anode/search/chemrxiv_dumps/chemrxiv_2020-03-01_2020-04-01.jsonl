Inspired by the membrane trafficking, a core biological process, herein we report that positively charged micro heterogeneous vehicles loaded with substrate could be trafficked suitably at the site of the reaction to promote the localization and proximity of the reactants. The guided vehicular delivery coupled with electrolysis overcomes the entropic barrier related to the proximity of the reactants and allows the hydrolysis of non-activated esters at physiological pH. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction utilizes the electrochemical energy to generate hydroxide ion at the cathode and the positively charged micellar vehicles (loaded with substrates) trafficked selectively near cathode to promote the hydrolysis. The in situ modulation of surface charge was exploited to accelerate or inhibit the hydrolysis in a controlled manner akin to cofactors or zymogens of natural enzymes. We believe this elegant membrane trafficking inspired approach paves the way for the further applications of proximity controlled selective transformations in organic synthesis using green aqueous medium.<br />", "date": "2020-03-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioorganic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The task is, however, much more challenging for regio- and stereoselective transformations because their outcome also depends on functional group surroundings in subtle ways. Here, we challenge the Molecular Transformer model to predict reactions in carbohydrate chemistry, a field of central importance in the life sciences and for vaccine development and where regio- and stereoselectivity are notoriously difficult to predict even for experienced chemists. We show that transfer learning of the general USPTO model with a small set of carbohydrate reactions produces a specialized Carbohydrate Transformer model, returning predictions for carbohydrate reactions with remarkable accuracy.

This work varies the electrophilicity of para-substituents to OPP and\nprobes the dependence of rate coefficients and interfragment interactions on the substituent Hammett parameter, \u03c3p, using constrained density functional theory (CDFT)\nand energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Large electronic coupling elements across substituents indicate an adiabatic electron transfer process for reactants at contact.\nAs one might intuitively expect, free energy changes dominate trends in ET rate coefficients in most cases, and rates increase with substituent electron-donating ability.\nHowever, we observe an unexpected dip in rate coefficients for the most electron-\ndonating groups, due to the combined impact of flattening free energies and a steep\nincrease in reorganization energies. Our analysis shows that flattening OPP LUMO\nlevels lower the marginal increase in free energy with decreasing \u03c3p. Reorganization\nenergies do not exhibit a direct dependence on \u03c3p. They are higher for substituents\ncontaining lone pairs of electrons since substituent orientation varies with OPP charge.\nEDA reveals that interfragment orbital relaxation, or charge transfer interaction, plays\na critical role in stabilizing the vertically excited charge transfer state.

Toxic chemicals may cause a variety of adverse health effects, triggering immediate symptoms or delayed effects over longer periods of time. It is thus crucial to develop methods that can rapidly screen and predict the toxicity of chemicals, to limit the potential harmful impacts of chemical pollutants. Computational methods are being increasingly used in toxicity predictions. Here, the method of molecular docking is assessed for screening potential toxicity of a variety of xenobiotic compounds, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, pollutants and toxins deriving from the chemical industry. The method predicts the binding energy of the pollutants to a set of carefully selected receptors, under the assumption that toxicity in many cases is related to interference with biochemical pathways. The strength of the applied method lies in its rapid generation of interaction maps between potential toxins and the targeted enzymes, which could quickly yield molecularlevel information and insight into potential perturbation pathways, aiding in the prioritisation of chemicals for further tests. Two scoring functions are compared, Autodock Vina and the machine-learning scoring function RF-Score-VS. The results are promising, though hampered by the accuracy of the scoring functions. The strengths and weaknesses of the docking protocol are discussed, as well as future directions for improving the accuracy for the purpose of toxicity predictions.<br />", "date": "2020-03-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Environmental Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While these catalytically controlled processes are an integral part of biocatalytic pathways, man-made analogs are rare. Here, we incorporate catalysis in an artificial fuel driven out-of-equilibrium CRN. The study entails the design of an organocatalytically controlled fuel driven esterification CRN, where the forward (ester formation) and backward reaction (ester hydrolysis) are controlled by varying the ratio of two different organocatalysts: pyridine and imidazole. This catalytic regulation enables full control over ester yield and lifetime. The fuel-driven strategy is subsequently used in the design of a responsive polymer system, where transient polymer conformation and aggregation can be controlled through variation of fuel and catalysts levels.

Safety aspects -in particular flammability of electrolytes- in the state-of-theart battery technology is another important concern, especially for applications in which large numbers of cells are employed. Non-flammable battery electrolytes studied so far are based on highly fluorinated compounds or high salt concentrations, which suffer from high cost and toxicity.

An electrolyte of 0.5 M NaBOB in TMP provides ionic conductivity of 5 mS cm-1 at room temperature, which is comparable to commonly used electrolytes based on sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and organic carbonate solvents. The proposed electrolyte shows the Coulombic efficiency of above 80% in the first cycle, which increased to about 97% from the second cycle in sodium-ion battery fullcells consisting of a hard carbon anode and Prussian white cathode.

No bulk phase transformations or increase in Li/Ni antisite mixing were observed by diffraction; no significant change in the local structure or Li-ion mobility of the bulk were observed by 7Li solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Instead, we propose that the fatigue process is a result of the high interfacial lattice strain between the reconstructed surface and the bulk layered structure when the latter is at SoCs above a distinct threshold of ~75 %.

Its color tuning mechanism has been largely overlooked, as it is less preferable for imaging applications than the redder anionic or B state. Past studies, based on site-directed mutagenesis or solvatochromism of the isolated chromophore, have concluded that its color tuning range is much narrower than its anionic counterpart. However, as we performed extensive investigation on more GFP mutants, we found the color of the neutral chromophore to be much more sensitive to protein electrostatics. Electronic Stark spectroscopy reveals a fundamentally different electrostatic color tuning mechanism for the neutral state of the chromophore that demands a three-form model compared with that of the anionic state, which requires only two forms. Specifically, an underlying zwitterionic charge transfer state is required to explain its sensitivity to electrostatics. As the Stokes shift is tightly linked to the protonated chromophore\u2019s photoacidity and excited-state proton transfer (ESPT), we infer design principles of the GFP chromophore as a photoacid through the color tuning mechanisms of both protonation states.

Prominent results have been obtained with recombinant proteins, for which site-specific conjugation is made possible by the incorporation of particular amino acid residues or peptide sequences. While mutant proteins take most of the spotlight, native and natural proteins have been left in the shadow and site-selective methods to conjugate these are underexplored. In addition, while these few methods give good results on small to medium-sized proteins, most of them tend to fall short whenever applied to bigger constructs such as antibodies. To address this limitation, we reasoned that aiming at the simultaneous conjugation of two amino acid residues should give higher chances of developing a site-selective strategy compared to the large majority of existing methods that solely target a single residue. We opted for the Ugi four-center three-component reaction to implement this idea, with the aim of conjugating the side-chain amine and carboxylate groups of two neighbouring lysine and aspartate/glutamate.

To address these issues, here we report a study of the effectiveness of using features\nextracted from color images using VGG16, which is a more compact CNN than Alexnet. Our\nanalysis reveals that features extracted from the first and second convolutional layers of VGG16\nare sufficient to achieve a perfect classification accuracy on the same dataset used by Cao and coworkers, while reducing the number of features to less than a hundred. The number of features\nis further reduced to ten via recursive feature elimination with minimal loss in classification accuracy (5-10%). This feature reduction procedure reveals that differences in spatial color patterns are\ndeveloped within seconds in the LC response. The results thus reveal that hue histograms provide an informative set of features that can be used to characterize LC micrographs of the sensor\nresponse. We also hypothesize that differences in spatial correlation length of LC textures detected\nby VGG16 with DMMP and water likely reflect differences in the anchoring energy of the LC on the\nsurface of the sensor.

However, current methods of model evaluation are overly optimistic in measuring generalization to new targets, and there does not exist a standard dataset of sufficient size to compare performance between models. We present a new dataset for structure-based machine learning, the CrossDocked2020 set, with 22.5 million poses of ligands docked into multiple similar binding pockets across the Protein Data Bank and perform a comprehensive evaluation of grid-based convolutional neural network models on this dataset. We also demonstrate how the partitioning of the training data and test data can impact the results of models trained with the PDBbind dataset, how performance improves by adding more, lower-quality training data, and how training with docked poses imparts pose sensitivity to the predicted affinity of a complex. Our best performing model, an ensemble of 5 densely connected convolutional newtworks, achieves a root mean squared error of 1.42 and Pearson R of 0.612 on the affinity prediction task, an AUC of 0.956 at binding pose classification, and a 68.4% accuracy at pose selection on the CrossDocked2020 set. By providing data splits for clustered cross-validation and the raw data for the CrossDocked2020 set, we establish the first standardized dataset for training machine learning models to recognize ligands in non-cognate target structures while also greatly expanding the number of poses available for training.

A new algorithm that employs concepts from geometric measure theory, algebraic topology, and optimization, is developed to identify candidate structures at a soft matter surface, and then using a probabilistic approach, to rank their likelihood of being a complex structural feature. The algorithm is tested for a surfactant laden water/oil interface, where it is robust to identifying protrusions responsible for water transport against a set identified by visual inspection.

Recently, structural analysis of DNA performed in this lab indicated that each DNA nucleotide complementary base pair is in perfect correspondence with the structure of the steroid molecule and steroid hormones.  Here, detailed structural analysis and illustrations are presented to clearly support and extend this fundamental finding.  The structural illustrations indicate that the DNA Nucleotide base pairs can achieve perfect alignment with steroid hormones, such that each of its functional groups can be assigned a purpose for binding, stabilization, and transcription regulation.  The relation of the missing third hydrogen bond for A-T and T-A, relative to the three hydrogen bonds of C-G and G-C, is clearly shown to be found through its coupling with the class of corticosteroids like cortisol that have an oxygen group perfectly positioned for interaction with the available functional group of thymine.  Thus the intermolecular coupling by hydrogen bonding of Cortisol-Thymine produces a strong complex.  Moreover, the structural analysis of the end group couplings to an ionic linkage element, Ca2+ or Mg2+, demonstrate interaction with  both the DNA phosphates as well as the oxygen element within the sugar.  The relationships confirm a structural association of cortisol-like steroid hormones with A-T and T-A and a structural association of testosterone-like steroid hormones for G-C and C-G.  Synthetic steroids are assessed, including prednisolone and dexamethasone, to indicate consistency of the functional group interactions with the DNA base pairs, phosphate, and sugar groups to support and confirm direct binding and structural correspondence of steroid hormones to DNA Nucleotides.", "date": "2020-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Biophysics; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The cleavage reaction is highly specific, and DNAzymes exists for a wide range of metal ions. The change of structure upon binding of a specific metal ion has given rise to many sensing strategies, but few exist with nanopore sensors. Resistive Pulse Sensing, RPS, is a platform that has emerged in recent years capable of identifying changes in DNA structure and sequence. Here we develop the use of DNAzymes with RPS technologies for the detection of Ca2+ ions in solution. Ca2+ plays an important role in biological processes, critical for cell signally, protein folding and catalysis. Extreme concentrations of Ca2+ within drinking water have also been linked to problems with corrosion, scaling and the taste of water. Using DNAzyme functionalised nanocarriers and RPS, it was possible follow the Ca2+ ions binding to the DNAzyme. The binding of Ca2+ caused a conformation change in the DNAzyme which was monitored as a change in translocation speed. By following the changes to the translocation speed, it is hypothesised that RPS can verify the changes in structure. In addition, the assay allowed the quantification of Ca2+ between 1 \u2013 9 \u03bcM, and due its catalytic nature, increasing incubation time from 30 to 90 minutes allowed lower detection limits, down to 0.3 \u03bcM. We demonstrate that the speed changes are specific to Ca2+ in the presence of other metal ions, and we can quantify Ca2+ in tap and pond water samples.</b><br />", "date": "2020-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hydrology and Water Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis; Nanodevices", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are front runners among different classes of organic photocatalyst, owing to their tunable porosity, crystallinity, optical and electronic properties. Photocatalytic activity of COFs depends on numerous factors such as band gap, crystallinity, porosity, exciton migration, charge separation and transport, stability etc. However, it is challenging to fine tune all these factors simultaneously to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Hence, in this report, we have prioritized the key factors for efficient photocatalytic H2 production through structure\u2013property\u2013activity relationship combined with microwave spectroscopy and first\u2013principles calculations. Careful molecular engineering allowed us to tune the light absorption (i.e. band gap), crystallinity, porosity, layer stacking and charge carrier generation and transport of a series of isoreticular COFs. We have assessed how these properties and the interplay between them impact photocatalytic activity of studied COFs. From the structure\u2013property\u2013activity relationship, we found that light absorption and charge carrier generation and transport are the prime factors, which influence the photocatalytic H2 production of COFs in much greater extent than other factors.</div>", "date": "2020-03-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Organic Polymers; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Energy Storage; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, exploitation of this resource requires energy-efficient polysaccharide degradation, which is currently limited by the inherent recalcitrance of many naturally occurring polysaccharides. Catalytic breakdown of polysaccharides can be achieved more efficiently by means of the enzymes lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). However, the LPMO mechanism has remained controversial, preventing full exploitation of their potential. One of the controversies has centered around an active site tyrosine, present in most LPMOs. Different roles for this tyrosine have been proposed without direct evidence, but two recent investigations have for the first time obtained direct (spectroscopic) evidence for that chemical modification of this tyrosine is possible. Surprisingly, the spectroscopic features obtained in the two investigations are remarkably different. In this paper we use density functional theory (DFT) in a QM/MM formulation to reconcile these (apparently) conflicting results. By modeling the spectroscopy as well as the underlying reaction mechanism we can show how formation of two isomers (both involving deprotonation of tyrosine) explain the difference in the experimental observed spectroscopic features. The link between our structures and the observed spectroscopy provides a firm ground to investigate the role of tyrosine.", "date": "2020-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among\nthe different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best for\nsmall molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for\nlarge molecules such as peptides. However, no available fingerprint achieves\ngood performance on both classes of molecules.</p>\n\n<p><b>Results</b>: Here we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and\nlarge molecules by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest\nresulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a\ndiameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this fingerprint the circular substructures\nwith radii of <i>r</i> = 1 and <i>r </i>= 2 bonds around each atom in an\natom-pair are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the\ntopological distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called\natom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the resulting set of hashes is\nMinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all\nother fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the Riniker and\nLandrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark recovering BLAST\nanalogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore\nproduces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as\ndiverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database\n(HMBD), and differentiates between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70 % of which\nare indistinguishable from their nearest neighbor using substructure\nfingerprints.  </p>\n\n<b>Conclusion</b>: MAP4 is a new\nmolecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and\ncan be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical\nspace.

These materials are brick-and-mortar composites, where bricks are single-crystal alumina platelets, and a glassy interphase acts as\nthe mortar. Although several processing approaches have been reported to date, these materials were optimized so far by trial-and-error approaches.\nUnderstanding the fracture properties of nacre-like alumina requires the knowledge of the properties of each of its components. However, only the properties\nof alumina platelets have been evaluated so far. Here we characterize at a micro scale the fracture property of an aluminosilicate glass interphase between\nalumina platelets. Micro-cantilever specimens prepared by FIB milling are tested under bending in order to characterize the failure of interfaces exhibiting\norientations between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 with respect to the beam direction, and thus undergoing different combined shear and tensile stress. Failure appears to be\nmainly driven by the interface opening stress that seems to predominate over shear stress. The apparent fracture stresses vary from 0.5 GPa to 3.0 GPa depending\non the interface angle. It results in a maximum opening stress of 0.72 \u00b1 0.18 GPa reached locally at the interface, whereas the apparent tensile fracture stress of\na pack of aligned and perpendicular platelets is approximately 3 GPa. These results should help understand the bulk properties of nacre-like alumina composites\nand future similar materials and enable a rational design of their components and microstructures.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>", "date": "2020-03-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Processing; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we present an atomic-level theoretical study based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) and dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT-D3BJ) calculations on the surface stability and adsorption of heavy metal compounds on silane and APTES covered SiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces. Our simulations show that at low APTES coverage, molecular adsorption of Cd(OH)<sub>2</sub> and HgCl<sub>2</sub> is more favourable near the modifier, compared to As(OH)<sub>3</sub> that binds at the hydroxylated region on silica. At higher coverages, the metallic compounds are preferentially adsorbed by the terminating amino group on the surface, whereas the adsorption in the region between APTES and the oxide surface is also spontaneous. The adsorption is strongly driven by van der Waals interactions at the highly-covered surface, where the consideration of dispersion corrections reduces the modifier-adsorbate interatomic distances and increases the adsorption energy by c.a. 0.4-0.7 eV. The adsorption of water is favourable, although it is generally weaker than for the heavy metal compounds.

Here,\nwe demonstrate that the emerging technique of scanning electron diffraction\n(SED) can bridge this gap. We directly image defect nanodomains in the MOF\nUiO-66(Hf) over an area of ca. 1 000 nm and with a spatial resolution ca. 5 nm to\nreveal domain morphology and distribution. Based on these observations, we suggest\npossible crystal growth processes underpinning synthetic control of defect\nnanodomains. We also identify likely dislocations and small angle grain\nboundaries, illustrating that SED could be a key technique in developing the\npotential for engineering the distribution of defects, or \u201cmicrostructure\u201d, in\nfunctional MOF design.</p>", "date": "2020-03-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Solid State Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Unfortunately, much is unknown about the basic interaction of steroid molecules with DNA, including its receptors, activators, factors, and the gene transcription procedure.  In this research article, a remarkable finding is shown for the first time, in which it is illustrated through structural analysis that the  base pairings of the four DNA nucleotides, adenine with thymine (A-T) and cytosine with guanine (C-G), form perfectly the classic four ring structure of the steroid molecule, which indicates the profound result put forth in this article that steroid molecules bind directly to  DNA  for the purpose of gene transcription.  Further,  critical to a basic understanding of  DNA,  it is resolved here of the location of the unusual ``missing\"  hydrogen bond of the A-T and T-A pairings, which has only two internal hydrogen bonds whereas C-G and G-C have three hydrogen bonds.  It is shown that the third hydrogen bond for A-T and T-A is formed when the A-T and T-A nucleotides are coupled with corticosteroids, such as cortisol, which has an oxygen functional group that is perfectly positioned to form a hydrogen bond with the accessible oxygen-based functional group of thymine.  In addition, to facilitate the binding process, it is shown that Ca$^{2+}$ ions, which are associated with the ligand binding domain of the steroid receptor prior to its association with DNA, couple the oxygen-based functional groups at each  end of the steroid molecule with the PO$_4^-$ ions of adjacent nucleotides and thus bind the steroid molecule directly to the nucleic acid.  Additionally, the basis of initiating the transcription process is described in which the energy stabilization due to the binding of the ion-steroid complex to DNA is dissipated through the DNA molecule to initiate strand separation locally by increasing the length of hydrogen bonds, thus allowing RNA polymerase action.  The results are further amplified by analysis of the cortisol hormone and the ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor in its interaction with the A-T nucleotide pairing.", "date": "2020-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Their scope, though, is still limited to-date by the requirement for a sufficiently potent target binder. A solution that proved useful in tackling challenging targets is the use of electrophiles to allow irreversible binding to the target. However, such binding will negate the catalytic nature of PROTACs. Reversible covalent PROTACs potentially offer the best of both worlds. They possess the potency and selectivity associated with the formation of the covalent bond, while being able to dissociate and regenerate once the protein target is degraded. Using Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a clinically relevant model system, we show efficient covalent degradation by non-covalent, irreversible covalent and reversible covalent PROTACs, with <10 nM DC50\u2019s and >85% degradation. Our data suggests that part of the degradation by our irreversible covalent PROTACs is driven by reversible binding prior to covalent bond formation, while the reversible covalent PROTACs drive degradation primarily by covalent engagement. The PROTACs showed enhanced inhibition of B cell activation compared to Ibrutinib, and exhibit potent degradation of BTK in patients-derived primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The most potent reversible covalent PROTAC, RC-3, exhibited enhanced selectivity towards BTK compared to non-covalent and irreversible covalent PROTACs.

First, we sought to identify existing FDA approved drugs that could block coronaviruses from entering cells by binding to ACE2 or TMPRSS2 using a high-throughput AI-based binding affinity prediction platform. Top results included several ACE inhibitors, a beta-lactam antibiotic, two antiviral agents (Fosamprenavir and Emricasan) and glutathione. The platform also assessed specificity for ACE2 over ACE1, important for avoiding counterregulatory effects. Further studies are needed to weigh the benefit of blocking virus entry against potential counterregulatory effects and possible protective effects of ACE2. However, the data herein suggest readily available drugs that warrant experimental evaluation to assess potential benefit. Second, we sought to identify FDA approved drugs that could attenuate the gene expression patterns induced by coronaviruses, using our Disease Cancelling Technology (DCT) platform.  DCT was run on an animal model of SARS-CoV, and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals.  Top hits included Vitamin E, ruxolitinib, and glutamine.

NMR spectroscopy was used to study in more details the drug-surfactant interactions.

The enzyme is incorporated into a Nafion\u00ae polymeric matrix and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde by a one-pot reaction in a buffered solution, producing a stable BOD-based biogel. The biogel prevents the formation of enzyme aggregates, producing a homogeneous bioelectrode surface, and allows access to the direct electron-transfer mechanism of multicopper centers buried in the enzyme.

A leading postulate is that iron active sites in this class of materials exist in an Fe-N<sub>4</sub> pyridinic ligation environment. Yet, molecular Fe-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) generally feature pyrrolic coordination and pyridinic Fe-N<sub>4</sub> catalysts are, to the best of our knowledge, non-existent.

The catalytic protocol results in the transformation of sp<sup>2</sup> C\u2013F bonds to sp<sup>2</sup> C\u2013Al bonds and provides a route into reactive organoaluminium complexes (<b>2a-h</b>) from fluorocarbons. The catalyst is highly active.

More generally, it can be used for simulations of any reactive system coupled to a reservoir of a known composition. Conceptually, it can be regarded as an extension of the reaction ensemble, combining explicit simulations of reactions within the system and Grand-canonical exchange of particles with the reservoir. To demonstrate its strength, we applied our method to a solution of weak polyelectrolytes in equilibrium with a reservoir. Our results show that the ionization and swelling of a weak polyelectrolyte are affected by the Donnan effect due to the partitioning of ions and by the polyelectrolyte effect due to electrostatic repulsion along the chain. Both effects lead to a similar shift in ionization and swelling as a function of pH; albeit for different physical reasons. By comparison with published results, we showed that neglecting one or the other effect may lead to erroneous predictions or misinterpretations of results.

While they are often thought to be a heuristic construct, it has been established that this is in fact not the case. Here, we present a rigorous and formally exact analysis of generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) density functional theory of hybrid functionals, in which exact remainder exchange-correlation potentials combine with a fraction of Fock exchange to produce the correct ground state density. First, we extend formal GKS theory by proving a generalized adiabatic connection theorem. We then use this extension to derive two different definitions for a rigorous distinction between multiplicative exchange and correlation components - one new and one previously postulated. We examine their density-scaling behavior and discuss their similarities and differences. We then present a new algorithm for obtaining exact GKS potentials by inversion of accurate reference electron densities and employ this algorithm to obtain exact potentials for simple atoms and ions. We establish that an equivalent description of the many-electron problem is indeed obtained with any arbitrary global fraction of Fock exchange and we rationalize the Fock-fraction dependence of the computed remainder exchange-correlation potentials in terms of the new formal theory. Finally, we use the exact theoretical framework and numerical results to shed light on the exchange-correlation potential used in approximate hybrid functional calculations and to assess the consequences of different choices of fractional exchange.<br /><br />", "date": "2020-03-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although experimental evidence for the presence of dynamic disorder was presented, the nature of the associated distortions remained unresolved. In this study, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) were employed to study the dynamic behaviour of this zeotype. At 100 K, static local distortions that break the Ima2 symmetry are present in the time-averaged structures computed from the AIMD trajectories. At 300 and 500 K, the time-averaged structures approach Ima2 symmetry. Although shortened Al\u2212O and P\u2212O bonds and near-linear Al\u2212O\u2212P angles were found in the average structures, an analysis of radial and angular distribution functions confirmed their absence in the instantaneous structures. This deviation is due to a precession-like motion of some oxygen atoms around the Al\u2212P connection line, which moves their time-averaged positions closer to the connection line. In hydrated AlPO-11, some of the water molecules are coordinated to framework Al atoms, leading to an octahedral coordination of 1/5 of the Al sites. DFT optimisations and AIMD simulations on partially hydrated models delivered evidence for an adsorption at the Al1 site. No dynamic disorder was observed for the hydrated form.", "date": "2021-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Structure; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Host-guest systems, despite their relative simplicity in both the structural feature and interaction patterns, still pose problems in theoretical modelling. The barrel-shaped supra-molecular container Cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) shows promising functionalities in various areas, e.g., catalysis and molecular recognition. It can stably coordinate a series of structurally diverse guests with high affinities. In this work, we examine the binding of 7 commonly abused drugs to the CB8 host, aiming at providing a general picture of CB8-guest binding. A thorough comparison of widely used fixed-charge models for drug-like molecules is presented. Extensive sampling of the configurational space of these host-guest systems is performed, and the binding pathway and interaction patterns of CB8-guest complexes are investigated in detail. Iterative refitting of the atomic charges suggests significant conformation-dependence of charge generation. The initial model generated at the original conformation could be inaccurate for new conformations explored during conformational search. Our investigations of the configurational space of CB8-drug complexes suggest that the host-guest interactions are more complex than expected. Despite the structural simplicities of these molecules, the conformational fluctuations of the host and the guest molecules and orientations of functional groups lead to the existence of an ensemble of binding modes (e.g., bracelet-like guest conformations and crescent free energy landscapes). Thus, understandings obtained from static calculations based on a single or several structures are limited for these host-guest interactions. The investigation protocol provides useful guidelines for studying host-guest binding, and the insights of the binding thermodynamics, performance of fixed-charge models, and binding patterns of the CB8-guest systems are useful for elucidating the binding mechanism of other host-guest complexes.

Different manufacturing processes can lead to a significant variability of biotherapeutics arising from chemical and enzymatic post translational modifications (PTMs), resulting in the co-existence of a plethora of proteoforms with different physicochemical properties. Thus, biosimilarity to the originator product must be proven rigorously. Among these PTMs, N-terminal pyroglutamate formation, C-terminal lysine clipping, glycosylation, glycation, and deamidation lead to differences in the net charge of the protein, resulting in charge variants (CV). To unravel the heterogeneity of these proteoforms, Strong Cat-ion eXchange (SCX) High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is routinely used. However, the use of non-volatile salts makes the technique incompatible for hyphenation to mass spectrometry (MS). Recently, an approach employing volatile salts and a pH gradient was applied for CV analysis, opening the era of SCX-HPLC-MS approaches. Here, we apply an already established SCX-HPLC-MS approach by F\u00fcssl et al. to characterize two Rituximab-based biotherapeutics, the originator MabThera\u00ae and its Indian copy product Reditux\u2122.

The practical use of garnet electrolytes,  however,  is limited by pervasive lithium-dendrite growth,  which leads to short-circuiting and cell failure.   One possible mechanism for this lithium-dendrite growth is the direct reduction of lithium ions to lithium metal within the electrolyte, and lithium garnets have suggested to be particularly susceptible to this dendrite-growth mechanism due to high electronic conductivities relative to other solid electrolytes  [Hanet al.  Nature Ener.4187,  2019].   The electronic conductivities of  LLZO  and other lithium-garnet solid electrolytes,  however,  are not yet well characterised.

Our model predicts that under typical battery operating conditions, electron and hole mobilities are low (<1 cm2V\u22121s\u22121), and bulk electron and hole carrier concentrations are negligible,  irrespective of initial synthesis conditions or dopant levels.  These results suggest that the bulk electronic conductivity of LLZOis not sufficiently high to cause bulk lithium-dendrite growth during cell operation, and that any non-negligible electronic conductivity in lithium garnet samples is likely due to extended defects or surface contributions.", "date": "2021-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As a consequence, emerging continuous evolution technologies are rarely applied to biocatalyst evolution.

Structural attributes such as number and type of donor centers (\"hard\" and \"soft\") of ligands are essentially the key components for providing the adequate bonding scenario for uranyl. Beside hard or soft-donor-based binding cavity, the mixed-donor ligands are also finding popularity for achieving optimized performances. However, many aspects are still unknown about how and at what extent the ratio of hard-to-soft donor centers tune the bonding attributes with uranyl. Moreover, a consensus is yet to be reached on the nature and role of underlying covalent interaction between U and donors upon complexation, particularly in the mixed-donor ligand environment. In this work, using relativistic density functional theory (DFT), we attempted to address these important issues by systematically investigating the impact on the bonding characteristics of uranyl ion and an expanded porphyrin, viz. sapphyrin with increasing number of 'O' substitution at the cavity. Our results suggest that in the O-substituted sapphyrin variants, UO$_2^{2+}$ prefers to bind N over O donor sites, and decrease in N donor sites at the cavity prompts UO$_2^{2+}$ to have better interaction with the rest of N donor centers. Extended transition state (ETS) with natural orbital for chemical valences (NOCV) analysis shows that at equatorial plane N acts as better $\\sigma$ donor to uranyl than O donor. Molecular orbital (MO) and density of states (DOS) analysis shows favorable bonding-interaction between U(d) and donor's p orbitals, the participation of U(f)-orbitals in bonding are of low-extent but non-negligible. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA), natural population analysis (NPA) along with thermodynamic analyses confirms the dominance of electrostatic interaction on the thermodynamic stability of the complexes. However, the U-N/O bonds at the equatorial plane do carry appreciable amount of covalent character. Analysis of quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) descriptors in conjugation with MO analysis and overlap integral calculations confirms its nature as near-degeneracy driven type. Statistics of mixed-orbitals and overlap integral further suggest that the O donor does not act as adequate replacement of N for uranyl binding despite having more number of mixed MOs due to the variation in the amplitude of overlap.      \n", "date": "2021-07-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The study presented here utilizes the FMN-dependent NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (NQO, EC 1.6.5.9, UniProtKB Q9I4V0) as a model system to study the effect of introducing an active site negative charge on the flavin absorption spectrum both in the absence and presence of a long-range electrostatic potential coming from solution ions. Using pH-dependent UV-visible spectroscopy, there were no observed changes in the flavin absorption spectrum when an active site tyrosine (Y277) deprotonated in vitro. These results could only be reproduced computationally using Average Solvent Electrostatic Configuration (ASEC) hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations that included both positive and negative solution ions. The same calculations performed with minimal ions to neutralize protein charges predicted that deprotonating Y277 would significantly affect the flavin absorption spectrum. Analyzing the distribution of solution ions from ASEC and radial distribution functions derived from molecular dynamics indicated that the solution ions reorganize around the protein surface upon Y277 deprotonation to cancel the effect of the tyrosinate on the flavin absorption spectrum.

Among the SMCs, we have found our lead small-molecule compound Iododiflunisal (IDIF), a molecule in the discovery phase, one investigational drug (luteolin), and 3 marketed drugs (sulindac, olsalazine and flufenamic), which could be directly repurposed or repositioned for clinical use. Importantly, we found that not all TTR tetramer stabilizers are good SMCs in vitro, emphasizing the importance of our discovery program. A small set of these SMCs will be prioritized to enter preclinical safety studies, to validate TTR as a target in vivo, and to select one repurposed drug as a candidate to enter clinical trials for AD.

To leverage computational screening for homogeneous WOC design, a distinct approach is needed. Here, we compute mechanistically-relevant electronic and energetic properties for 19 mononuclear Ru transition metal complexes (TMCs) from three experimental water oxidation catalysis studies. We discover that 15 of these TMCs have experimental activities that can be correlated to a single property, the ionization potential of the Ru(II)-O2 catalytic intermediate. This scaling parameter is well correlated with experimentally-reported rate constants, allowing quantitative understanding activity trends and insight into rate-limiting behavior. We use this approach to rationalize differences in activity with differing experimental conditions, and we qualitatively analyze the source of distinct behavior for differing electronic states in the other four catalysts. Comparison to closely related single-atom catalysts and modified WOCs enables rationalization of the source of rate enhancement in these experimental WOC catalysts.

As per the reports 2-DG is effective against SARS-COV- 2. Publication of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trial data is pending.

As the understanding of the mechanism of the therapeutic action of 2-DG on SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts is missing, in this work we have studied the possible inhibitory interaction of the drug with two different pathways (a) with non-structured viral proteins involved in translation and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and (b) its inhibition mechanism of the glycolysis pathway. We have used our fully automated novel drug designing platform with state-of-the-art free energy of binding calculator PRinMTML-ESS to evaluate the role of 2-DG as an antiviral and glycolysis pathway inhibitor in SARS-CoV-2 affected humans. Docking, all atom molecular dynamic simulation and enhanced free energy sampling methods used in PRinMTML-ESS have predicted that 2-DG effectively reduced the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human cell by reducing the glycolytic flux, by competitive inhibition of glucose in binding with the enzyme hexokinase. 2-DG is generally administered in covid patient along with other antivirals and steroid, hence it can be used as a mild clinical therapy which can reduce the viral replication, inflammation when given in the earlier stage of the disease.", "date": "2021-07-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We hypothesized that a bioisosteric replacement of an amide with a less polar ester could lead to improvements in both physicochemical properties and bioactivity. Using a library of model compounds, bearing either amides or esters at various linker-warhead junctions, we identify parameters for optimal compound lipophilicity and permeability. We next applied these learnings to design a set of novel amide-to-ester substituted, VHL-based BET degraders with increased permeability. Our ester-PROTACs remarkably retained intracellular stability, were overall more potent degraders than their amide counterparts and showed an earlier onset of the hook effect. These enhanced cellular features were found to be driven by greater cell permeability rather than improvements in ternary complex formation.

Using experimentally-guided molecular dynamics (MD) simulations augmented with multi-scale (i.e., QM/MM) simulations of substrate-bound complexes of BesD and WelO5, we investigate substrate/active-site dynamics that enable selective halogenation. Our simulations reveal that active-site configurational isomerization is necessary in WelO5 to attain substrate/active-site geometry consistent with its observed chemo- and regioselectivity. Conversely, a slight reorientation of the substrate from its crystal-structure position is sufficient to enable regioselective chlorination in BesD without the need to invoke active-site isomerization. We observe how substrate-protein interactions evolve during experimentally-motivated MD of halogenases. We relate the nature of these interactions to the distinct substrates. For BesD, we resolve the uncertainty around the mechanistic relevance of Asn219 based on a prior mutagenesis study. By quantifying the presence of thermodynamically competitive C-H bonds on substrates of SyrB2, BesD, and WelO5, we confirm the need for the protein environment to strategically position the substrate to impart regioselectivity to halogenases.

To reveal how these mechanisms operate and instruct the brain to remember and forget, one judicious approach is developing the mathematical models of processes. However, this notion requires some basic knowledge regarding ordinary differential equations and writing codes. To this respect, it can be postulated that tools, which can be utilized rather by everyone, would certainly expedite and facilitate the formulation of such models. With this rationale in mind, we demonstrate that JigCell offers the perfect platform to develop such models of LTP. Our choice for this tool stems from the fact that it is designed to simulate complex biological systems in a modular way. Thus, this manuscript is crafted to illustrate how this model was constructed in the JigCell environment and to give an idea of how this tool works.

However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of recently manufactured hand sanitizer can be limited. The product expiration date set by manufacturers is also minimally regulated. The efficacy of hand sanitizer is entirely determined by its most volatile ingredient, alcohol, which must remain at a concentration greater than 60% (v/v) to kill bacterial and viral pathogens. In our undergraduate Chem 2123W course (Introductory Quantitative Analysis Laboratory) in spring 2021, we designed and conducted an experiment to investigate the alcohol concentration of ethyl alcohol-based commercial hand sanitizers with varying expiration dates. The presence of a primary alcohol functional group in ethyl alcohol can be observed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT- IR). Through a series of standard additions of ethyl alcohol to the diluted hand sanitizer sample, we measured the changes in the integration of the FT-IR primary alcohol C-O stretch. The signal changes in integration were used to generate a standard addition curve using ethanol concentration and calculate the initial ethanol concentration of each sample. Our approach accounts for this matrix effect and does not rely on a compositional approximation. All the samples studied were found to exceed the minimum concentration required to effectively exhibit antimicrobial properties despite three of the four samples being expired. However, the expired samples remained close to the 60% threshold and with consideration of error analysis, the effectiveness of these hand sanitizers remains uncertain. The samples analyzed in this study varied in reported initial ethyl alcohol concentration, manufacturer, color, perfume, and other ingredients.

A promising process is temperature vacuum swing adsorption (TVSA) employing amine functionalised adsorbents such as Lewatit\u00ae VP OC 1065, which is selected as a benchmark sorbent in this study. To further improve process design, and critically lower costs, detailed modelling of DAC cycles is imperative. However, the multi-component adsorption on these materials, particularly the cooperative adsorption of CO2 and H2O, is crudely understood, and yet to be described in mathematical terms, prohibiting sound modelling efforts. Here, we commit in-depth understanding of the effect of humidity on CO2 adsorption and demonstrate how this impacts modelling of DAC cycles. We present two novel mechanistic co-adsorption isotherm models to describe water's effect on CO2 adsorption and find a good fit to original experimental co-adsorption data. We also show the considerable improvement in predictions of these models when compared to an empirical co-adsorption isotherm model from literature. A detailed TVSA DAC cycle process model is then used elucidating how different co-adsorption models affect the predicted process performance. It is found that the two novel isotherm models generate similar results and Pareto fronts, whilst the minimum work equivalent calculated using the more conservative of the two models is found to be 2.49 MJ kg-1 for the case study considered. These mathematical descriptions laid out will lead to more accurate modelling and optimisation of cyclic DAC adsorption processes, prompting a greater understanding of the material-process combinations ideal for DAC and how costs can be driven down in the years to come.

The methodology introduced includes the detailed analysis of the charge compensation process and of the time-derivative of the mass variations. Typical results for the electro-oxidation of formic acid on PANI supported platinum indicate that the electrocatalysis itself is reflected in the current profile, whereas the charge compensation rules the gravimetric response. This general observation also holds for the oscillatory electro-oxidation of formic acid. The physicochemical description of the support/catalyst systems described here opens interesting perspectives for the investigation of parent systems.

A number of strategies for engineering interfaces with enhanced oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange has recently been proposed. However, the origin and the local magnitude of such local effects remain largely undisclosed to date. This is ascribed to the lack of direct measurement tools with sufficient resolution. In this work, we use atom probe tomography with sub-nanometric resolution to study oxygen mass transport on oxygen-isotope exchanged thin films of lanthanum chromite. We present a direct visualization of nanoscaled highly conducting oxygen incorporation pathways along grain boundaries, with reliable quantification of fast oxygen diffusion at grain boundaries and correlative link to local chemistries. Combined with finite element simulations of the precise 3D nanostructure, we quantify an enhancement in the grain boundary oxygen diffusivity and in the surface exchange coefficient of lanthanum chromite of about 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the bulk. This remarkable increase of the oxygen diffusivity in an interface-dominated material is unambiguously attributed to grain boundary conduction highways thanks to the use of a powerful technique that can be straightforwardly extended to the study of currently inaccessible multiple nanoscale mass transport phenomena.", "date": "2021-07-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Thin Films; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Atrazine and S-metolachlor were quickly photodegraded by both direct and indirect pathways (half-lives <5 and <7 days, respectively).

We first explored the stable conformation of the Nsp15 monomer as the global free energy minimum conformation in the free energy landscape using a combination of parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) and the Markov state model (MSM), and found that the Nsp15 monomer forms a more open conformation with larger druggable pockets on the surface.

One of the identified pockets, which is distinctively bound by inosine analogues, may be an alternative binding site to stabilize viral RNA binding and/or an alternative catalytic site.

We present very high-level ab initio computations on the HNCO + H2O reaction, with results targeting the CCSDT(Q)/CBS//CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ level of theory.  Our results affirm that hydrolysis can occur across both the N=C and C=O bonds of HNCO via concerted mechanisms to form carbamate or imidic acid with 0 K enthalpy barrier heights of 38.5 and 47.5 kcal mol^-1 A total of 24 substituted  RNCO + H2O reactions were studied.  Geometries obtained with a composite method and refined with CCSD(T)/CBS single point energies determine that substituted RNCO species have a significant influence on these barrier heights, with an extreme case like fluorine lowering both barriers by close to 20 kcal mol^-1 and most common alkyl substituents lowering both by approximately 4  kcal mol^-1.  Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis provides evidence that the predicted barrier heights are strongly associated with the occupation of the in-plane C-O* orbital of the RNCO reactant. Key autocatalytic mechanisms are considered in the presence of excess water and RNCO species.  Additional waters (one or two) are predicted to lower both barriers significantly at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z level of theory with strongly electron withdrawing RNCO substituents also increasing these effects, similar to the uncatalyzed case.  The 298 K Gibbs energies are only marginally lowered by a second catalyst water molecule, indicating that the decreasing 0 K enthalpy barriers are offset by the loss of translational entropy with more than one catalyst water.  Two-step 2RNCO + H2O mechanisms are characterized for the formation of carbamate and imidic acid.  The second step of these two pathways exhibits the largest barrier and presents no clear pattern with respect to substituent choice.  Our results indicate that an additional RNCO molecule might catalyze imidic acid formation but have less influence on the efficiency of carbamate formation.  We expect that these results lay a firm foundation for the experimental study of substituted isocyanates and their relationship to the energetic pathways of related systems.

Here we interrogated the uptake efficiency, biocompatibility, and stability of two subtypes of AuNRs with different types of surface coatings and varying charges, including a commercially available set of AuNRs with a 5 nm mSiO2-polymer coating and hybrid lipid-coated AuNRs developed in-house. Confocal and bright field microscopy images showed uptake of both subtypes of AuNRs in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), neural progenitor (NP), and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells.

In contrast, a preferred in-plane registry of methanol overlayers is observed for an ultrathin nominal thickness and becomes lost in slightly thicker films. Such thickness-dependent ordering of methanol assemblies can be explained with semi-commensurate epitaxy with a tensile strain of ~6.6% along hydrogen-bonded chains, whose quick relief results in the loss of order and even the phase.

Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) analysis showed comparable spectra for the two denatured crude protein-capped AgNC, as well with as the undenatured protein-capped AgNC, like previous reports indicating successful capping of the NC. Moreover, the spectra suggest no significant alterations if protein secondary structure upon NC formation. The crude protein extracts were also found to be very weakly hemolytic at the concentration range tested (0.5 \u2013 1 mg protein/mL) and denaturing the protein prior to NC formation did not significantly alter its hemolytic activity as well. These results imply that E. quadricolor crude protein denaturation prior to use with the reduction of Ag+ has no deleterious effects in functioning as capping agents for the prepared AgNC.", "date": "2021-07-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we propose an alternative method of virtual decoupling using deep neural networks, which only requires a single spectrum and gives a significant boost in resolution while reducing the effective phase cycles of the experiments by at least a factor of two. We successfully apply this methodology to virtually decouple in-phase CON (13CO-15N) protein NMR spectra, 13C-13C correlation spectra of protein side chains, and 13C\u03b1-detected protein 13C\u03b1-13CO spectra where two large homonuclear couplings are present.

Chemists have drawn inspiration from biology in designing molecular systems where the secondary coordination sphere can shuttle protons or electrons to substrates. However, a biomimetic activation of O2 requires the transfer of both protons and elec-trons, and molecular systems where ancillary ligands are designed to provide both of these equivalents are comparative-ly rare. Here we report the use of a dihydrazonopyrrole (DHP) ligand complexed to Fe to perform exactly such a biomi-metic activation of O2.

We then used our model during computational screening for porous organic molecules to bias towards precursors whose  easier synthesis requirements would make them promising candidates for experimental realisation and material development.

Vibrational strong coupling is unique in this category that overcomes the issue associated with coherent chemistry. Here, a vibrational transition is coupled to a standing wave of electromagnetic field, result in strong interaction, generating vibro-polaritonic states. This process reshuffles the entire energy-reaction coordinate. The chemical reaction rate can be boosted, stirred, or decelerated with this unconventional tool. Here, we used the idea of cooperative vibrational strong coupling of solute and solvent molecules to enhance the chemical reaction rate. This process is called cavity catalysis. Different derivatives of p-nitrophenyl benzoate (solute) and isopropyl acetate (solvent) are cooperatively coupled to an infrared Fabry-Perot cavity. The apparent reaction rates are increased by more than six times at the ON resonance condition, and the rate enhancement follows the lineshape of the vibrational envelope. Very interestingly, strong coupled system doesn't follow a linear free-energy relationship. The nonlinear rate enhancement can be due to the reshuffling of energy distribution between the substituents and the reaction center. Thermodynamic parameters suggest an entropy-driven process for the coupled molecules. The free energy of activation decreased by 2-5 kJ/mol, suggesting a clear role of vibrational strong coupling in catalyzing the reaction.

By the isolation of the more abundant aromatics, i.e. monoaromatics and naphthalenes, trace species can be enriched for analysis. This enables the identification of features not detectable by routine methods. We demonstrate the applicability by fractionation and subsequent GC-MS analysis of 14 crude oils sourced from the North Sea. The number of tentatively identified compounds increased by approximately 60 to 150% compared to solid-phase extraction and GC\u00d7GC-MS. Furthermore, the method was used to successfully isolate and identify a new set of heteroatom-containing aromatics (amines, ketones). The method is not intended to replace traditional sample preparation techniques or multi-dimensional chromatography but acts as a complementary tool. An in-depth comparison to routine characterization techniques is presented concerning advantages and disadvantages.

Here, we developed an aerosol jet printing method for generating hierarchical electrode structures using indium tin oxide nanoparticles. We printed libraries of micropillar array electrodes varying in height and sub-micron surface features and studied the energy/electron transfer processes across the bio-electrode interfaces. When wired to the cyanobacterium Synechocysis sp.

Flynn", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Delocalization (resonance) is a concept in organic chemistry that influences the chemical reactivity, activity, structure, and physical properties of molecules. However, the concept has proven challenging for students. The goal of the present study was to investigate to what extent ten essential delocalization learning outcomes (LOs) were achieved by students, how students use and reason about delocalization as well as the connections between the LOs. The goal is to discover where and how students may be struggling when answering delocalization-related exam questions and uncover potential barriers to learning delocalization.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed students\u2019 responses (N = 3787) on twelve exam questions related to seven of the ten LOs for the degree of achievement, common errors, and scientific reasoning.\n\nRESULTS: The achievement on the LOs was variable. We report types of errors and strategies used, the errors are primarily related to drawing resonance structures or the resonance. Six key findings emerged from the analysis: (1) the majority of answers had few (<10%) representational errors (2) in an implicit question where delocalization or inductive effect concepts could be used to justify a response, half the students used delocalization concepts, (3) delocalization was used in 10\u201320% of answers when relevant but not prompted or required, (4) strategies that helped students reason with the representations (i.e., drawing out electrons or expanding a structure) were correlated with higher achievement of the LOs, (5) students\u2019 reasoning aligned with course expectations, and (6) students who achieved later LOs typically (60\u201395%) also achieved LO1 and LO2 (Identify that electron delocalization is relevant, Draw resonance structures). \n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings have implications on how students achieve the LOs and suggest ways educators can better support learners with the tools to achieve the LOs. \n    \nIMPLICATIONS: The findings from this work could be used to design and evaluate new teaching techniques or materials, including scaffolding concepts.

Given an adsorption task, we often wish to search a library of NPMs for the one with the optimal adsorption property. The high cost of NPM synthesis and gas adsorption measurements, whether these experiments are in the lab or in a simulation, often precludes exhaustive search.\n\nWe explain, demonstrate, and advocate Bayesian optimization (BO) to actively search for the optimal NPM in a library of NPMs-- and find it using the fewest experiments. The two ingredients of BO are a surrogate model and an acquisition function. The surrogate model is a probabilistic model reflecting our beliefs about the NPM-structure--property relationship based on observations from past experiments. The acquisition function uses the surrogate model to score each NPM according to the utility of picking it for the next experiment. It balances two competing goals: (a) exploitation of our current approximation of the structure-property relationship to pick the highest-performing NPM, and (b) exploration of blind spots in the NPM space to pick an NPM we are uncertain about, to improve our approximation of the structure-property relationship. We demonstrate BO by searching an open database of ~70,000 hypothetical covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for the COF with the highest simulated methane deliverable capacity. BO finds the optimal COF and acquires 30% of the top 100 highest-ranked COFs after evaluating only ~120 COFs.

We find that addition of SnBr2 to the solution-phase synthesis of Cs3Bi2Br9 leads to substitution of up to 7% of the Bi(III) ions by equal quantities of Sn(II) and Sn(IV). The nature of the substitutional defects was studied by X-ray diffraction, 133Cs and 119Sn solid state NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The resulting mixed-valence compounds show intense visible and near infrared absorption due to intervalence charge transfer, as well as electronic transitions to and from localised Sn-based states within the band gap. Sn(II) and Sn(IV) defects preferentially occupy neighbouring B-cation sites, forming a double-substitution complex.

However, despite its promise, the use of ROA has been limited, largely due to challenges in instrumentation. Here, we report a new approach to ROA that exploits high-frequency polarization modulation. High-frequency polarization modulation, usually implemented with a photoelastic modulator (PEM), has long been the standard technique in other chiroptical spectroscopies. Unfortunately, the need for simultaneous spectral and polarization resolution has precluded the use of PEMs in ROA instruments.

Recent advances in coupled-cluster theory, in particular local correlation methods like DLPNO-CCSD(T), now allow the calculation of reaction energies and barrier heights for relatively large systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive, and diverse benchmark set of barrier heights and reaction energies based on DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS, called BH9.

We then present two applications of the BH9 set. First, we examine the performance of several density functional approximations commonly used in thermochemical and mechanistic studies.

Here, we study the interaction of gold nanoparticles (NPs) of different shape (nanospheres and nanorods) with biomimetic membranes of different symmetry, i.e. flat membranes (of 2D symmetry, representative of the most common plasma membrane geometry), and cubic membranes (of 3D symmetry, representative of non-lamellar membranes, encountered in Nature in peculiar biological conditions).

In addition, Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy analyses highlight, on a micrometric legthscale, that cubic and lamellar phases interact with NPs according to two distinct mechanisms, related to the different structures of the lipid assemblies. This study represents a first attempt to systematically study the role of membrane symmetry on the interaction with NPs; the results will contribute to improve the fundamental knowledge on nano-bio interfaces and, more in general, will provide new insights on the biological function of non-lamellar cubic arrangements of interfacial membranes as a response strategy.

In this study, we employ time-resolved operando spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the redox states kinetics of IrOx electrocatalyst films for both water and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Three different redox species involving Ir3+, Ir4+ and Ir4.x are identified spectroscopically and their concentrations are quantified as a function of applied potential. The generation of Ir4.x+ states is found to be the potential determining step for catalytic water oxidation, whilst H2O2 oxidation is observed to be driven by the generation of Ir4+ states. The reaction kinetics for water oxidation, determined from the optical signal decays at open circuit, accelerate from ~ 20 s to < 0.5 s with increasing applied potential above 1.3V vs. RHE (i.e. TOFs per active Ir state increasing from 0.05 to 2 s-1). In contrast, the reaction kinetics for H2O2 are found to be almost independent of the applied potential (increasing from 0.1-0.3 s-1 over a wider potential window), indicative of a first order reaction mechanism. These spectroelectrochemical data quantify the increase of both the density of active Ir4.x+ states and the TOFs of these states with applied positive potential, resulting in the observed sharp turn on of catalytic water oxidation current. We reconcile these data with the broader literature while providing a new kinetic insight into IrOx electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, indicating a first order reaction mechanism for H2O2 oxidation driven by Ir4+ states, and a higher order reaction mechanism involving the co-operative interaction of multiple Ir4.x+ states for water oxidation.", "date": "2021-07-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, the strong-dependence of low-frequency (terahertz) vibrational dynamics on weak and long-range forces in crystals is leveraged to determine the spin state of iron phosphate -- a promising material for cathodes in lithium ion batteries.

However, a significant drawback of standard DBS cards is the potential for sampling bias due to unrestricted filling caused by the hematocrit of blood, which often limits quantitative or reproducible measurements. Alternative microsampling technologies have minimized or eliminated this bias by restricting blood distribution, but these approaches deviate from clinical protocols and present a barrier to broad adoption. Herein, we describe a patterned dried blood spot (pDBS) card that uses wax barriers to control the flow and distribution of blood and provide enhanced sampling by minimizing the hematocrit effect. Patterned cards reproducibly fill four replicate extraction zones independent of the hematocrit. We demonstrate a 3-fold improvement in accuracy for the quantitation of hemoglobin using pDBS cards compared to unpatterned cards. Patterned cards also facilitate the near quantitative recovery (ca. 95%) of sodium with no evidence of a statistically significant difference between dried and liquid blood samples. Similarly, recovery of select amino acids was conserved in comparison to a recent report with improved inter-card precision. We anticipate that this approach presents a viable method for preparing and storing samples of blood in limited resource settings while maintaining current clinical protocols for processing and analyzing dried blood spots.", "date": "2021-07-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Electrochemical etching has proven a critical step in the production of such membranes. Etching is used to selectively remove a very thin layer of sub-surface sp2 bonded carbon, prepared by ion implantation in bulk diamond, releasing the diamond membrane. Due to the nanosized dimensions, etching is carried out using non-contact electrochemistry in low conductivity solutions (bipolar arrangement) which whilst effective, results in extremely slow etch rates. In this work, a new method of non-contact electrochemical etching is presented which uses high conductivity, high concentration, fully dissociated aqueous electrolytes. Careful choice of the electrolyte anion results in significant improvements in the sp2 carbon etch rate. In particular, we show both chloride and sulfate electrolytes increase etch rates significantly (up to \u00d740 for sulfate) compared to the current state-of-the-art. Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, recorded after the electrode potential has been switched off, reveal sizeable hydroxyl radical concentrations at timescales > 10^7 longer than their lifetime (< microsecond).

In order to understand these observations, we have performed QM/MM computational investigations on a range of reaction mechanisms for the reaction of zeolite bound methoxy and carbene groups, which are proposed to initiate hydrocarbon formation in the MTH process. Our simulations demonstrate that it is kinetically unfavourable for methyl species to form on the framework away from the zeolite acid site, and both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavourable for methyl groups to migrate through the framework and aggregate around an acid site. Formation of carbene moieties was considered as an alternative pathway to the formation of C-C bonds; however, the reaction energy for conversion of a methyl to a carbene is unfavourable. Metadynamics simulations help confirm further that methyl species at the framework acid sites would be more reactive towards formed C<sub>2+</sub> species, rather than inter-framework migration and that the role of carbenes in the formation of the first \u2013C bond will be via a concerted type of mechanism rather than stepwise.

In this work, we use molecular dynamics computer simulations to study a simple molecular model that reproduces the crystallization behavior of real chiral molecules, including the formation of enantiopure and racemic crystals, as well as polymorphism. We show that in many cases, the crystal that robustly forms in simulations is not the one with the lowest free energy. We demonstrate that at high supersaturation the prevailing polymorph can be accurately predicted by considering the similarities between prevalent oligomeric species in solution and molecular motifs in the crystal structure. For the  case of racemic mixtures, we even find that knowledge of crystal free energies is not necessary and kinetic considerations are sufficient to determine if the system will undergo spontaneous chiral separation.

Data from operando 19F solution NMR indicates that both bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI\u2013) salt and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)ether (BTFE) diluent molecules play a key role in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, in contrast to prior reports that suggest diluents are inert.

We find that BTFE diluents are chemically (rather than electrochemically) reduced during Li metal battery operation, which can be detected with operando NMR, but not conventional electrochemical methods. Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements confirm that LHCEs decompose to form a SEI on Li metal that contains organic BTFE reduction products as well as high quantities of lithium fluoride from both BTFE and FSI\u2013 reduction.

While glycan-binding proteins (lectins) often initiate cellular adhesion, subsequent fusion events require additional protein machinery. No mechanism for membrane fusion arising from simply a protein binding to membrane glycolipids has been described thus far. Herein we report that a biotinylated protein derived from cholera toxin, becomes a fusogenic lectin upon crosslinking with streptavidin. This novel reengineered protein brings about hemifusion and fusion of vesicles as demonstrated by mixing of fluorescently labelled lipids between vesicles as well as content mixing of liposomes filled with fluorescently labelled dextran. Exclusion of the complex at vesicle-vesicle interfaces could also be observed indicating the formation of hemifusion diaphragms. We propose that negative membrane curvature, caused by binding of the cholera toxin to the membrane surface, induces formation of a fusion stalk as a result of high bending energies building up between multiple inverted membrane dimples aligned on opposing membranes at the vesicle-vesicle interface.

This study illuminates, for the first time, the stereochemical impact on the carbene center and delineates the structural factors that enable control over both stereogenic centers. Sterically bulky, highly activated C\u2013H insertion centers exhibit high substrate control yielding a single diastereomer and a single enantiomer of product regardless of the catalyst used.

First, hydride transfer from the stereogenic insertion site proceeds with high stereoselectivity to the carbene center, thus determining the absolute configuration of the product. Second, the short lived zwitterionic intermediate can undergo diastereoselective ring-closure by an SE2 mechanism that is either controlled by the substrate or the catalyst.

To this end, this work pushes to expand the scope of green electrosynthesis by innovating a new approach to convert acetonitrile, industrially generated in excess and burned off, to in-demand ammonia and acetaldehyde products. Success here was enabled through the use of a Pd-membrane based reactor which abstracted hydrogen atoms from water, which subsequently diffused through to a separate organic compartment in which they carried out the hydrogenation reaction. In this geometry, the reaction proceeded at 5.2 mA/cm2 partial current density and 60% Faradaic efficiency towards ammonia generation. Further, the transmembrane hydrogenation approach gave rise to an onset potential of 0.2VAg/AgCl, surpassing previous state-of-the-art systems by 0.7V. A customized infrared spectroelectrochemcal setup was built up to probe the mechanism of the reaction, which was shown to proceed through an imine hydrolysis like pathway, with the hydrogenation of the NHx species that remained being the rate-limiting steps in the process. This work establishes a new route in electrochemical nitrile hydrogenation and general opens up promising avenues in green electrosynthesis.

We recently reported that an underexplored class of iodine(V) reagents possessing bidentate bipyridine ligands, termed Bi(N)-HVIs, could efficiently dearomatize electron-poor phenols for the first time. To better understand the fundamental mechanistic basis of this unique reactivity, density functional theory (DFT) was utilized. In this way, different pathways were explored to determine why Bi(N)-HVIs are capable of facilitating these challenging transformations while more traditional hypervalent species, such as IBX cannot. Our calculations reveal that the first redox process is the rate-determining step, the barrier of which hinges on the identity of the ligands bound to the iodine(V) center. This crucial process is composed of three steps: (a) ligand exchange, (b) hypervalent twist, and (c) reductive elimination. We found that strong coordinating ligands disfavour these elementary steps and, for this reason, HVIs bearing such ligands cannot oxidize the electron-poor phenols. In contrast, the weakly coordinating triflate ligands in Bi(N)-HVIs allow for the kinetically favorable oxidation of such phenols {e.g., \uf044G\u2021 = ~22 kcal/mol where Bi(N) = Bi(4-CO2Etbipy)}. It was also identified that trapping triflic acid, which is generated in situ, is a key role played by the basic bidentate bipyridine ligands in Bi(N)-HVIs as this serves to minimize decomposition of the sensitive ortho-quinone product.", "date": "2021-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The ability to detect sensitively the activity and spatiotemporal distribution of glycosidases in cells may facilitate the study of glycobiology, and add useful diagnostic tools. However, the currently developed fluorogenic probes for glycosidases are generally based on glycosylation of a phenol group of a donor-acceptor type fluorogen. This general molecular scaffold has potential drawbacks in terms of substrate scope, sensitivity because of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), and the inability for long-term cell tracking. Here, we developed glycoclusters characterized by aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties as a general platform for the sensing of a variety of glycosidases. To overcome the low chemical reactivity during phenol glycosylation, we synthesized an AIE-based dye composed of tetraphenylethylene conjugated with dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran (TPE-DCM) with a red fluorescence emission. Subsequently, a pair of dendritic linkages was introduced to both sides of the fluorophore, to which six copies of different monosaccharides (D-glucose, D-galactose and L-fucose) were conjugated through azide-alkyne click chemistry. The resulting AIE-active glycoclusters were shown to be capable of (1) fluorogenic sensing of a diverse range of glycosidases including \u03b2-D-galactosidase, \u03b2-D-glucosidase and \u03b1-L-fucosidase through the AIE mechanism, (2) fluorescence imaging of the endogenous glycosidase activities in healthy and cancer cells, and during cell senescence, and (3) glycosidase-activated, long-term imaging of cells. The present study provides a general strategy to the functional imaging of glycosidase activities through the multivalent display of sugar epitopes of interest onto AIE-active dyes.", "date": "2021-07-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Chemically heterogeneous interfaces are abundant in these contexts; examples include the surfaces of proteins, functionalized nanomaterials, and polymeric materials. While the hydrophobicity of nonpolar solutes can be predicted and related to the structure of interfacial water molecules, predicting the hydrophobicity of chemically heterogeneous interfaces remains a challenge because of the complex, non-additive contributions to hydrophobicity that depend on the chemical identity and nanoscale spatial arrangements of polar and nonpolar groups. In this work, we utilize atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with enhanced sampling and data-centric analysis techniques to quantitatively relate changes in interfacial water structure to the hydration free energies (a thermodynamically well-defined descriptor of hydrophobicity) of chemically heterogeneous interfaces. We analyze a large data set of 58 self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) containing ligands with nonpolar and polar end groups of different chemical identity (amine, amide, and hydroxyl) in five mole fractions, two spatial patterns, and with scaled partial charges. We find that only five features of interfacial water structure are required to accurately predict hydration free energies. Examination of these features reveals mechanistic insights into the interfacial hydrogen bonding behaviors that distinguish different surface compositions and patterns. This analysis also identifies the probability of highly coordinated water structures as a unique signature of hydrophobicity. These insights provide a physical basis to understand the hydrophobicity of chemically heterogeneous interfaces and connect hydrophobicity to experimentally accessible perturbations of interfacial water structure.

Here, we describe how small molecules can be accurately parametrized within the Martini 3 framework and present a database of validated small molecule models (available at https://github.com/ricalessandri/ Martini3-small-molecules and http://cgmartini.nl). We pay particular attention to the description of aliphatic and aromatic ring-like structures, which are ubiquitous in small molecules such as solvents and drugs or in building blocks constituting macromolecules such as proteins and synthetic polymers. In Martini 3, ring-like structures are described by models that use higher resolution coarse-grained particles (small and tiny particles). As such, the present database constitutes one of the cornerstones of the calibration of the new Martini 3 small and tiny particle sizes. The models show excellent partitioning behavior and solvent properties. Miscibility trends between different bulk phases are also captured, completing the set of thermodynamic properties considered during the parametrization. We also show how the new bead sizes allow for a good representation of molecular volume, which translates into better structural properties such as stacking distances. We further present design strategies to build Martini 3 models for small molecules of increased complexity. The present database, along with the outlined design strategies and the modularity of the Martini force field, constitute a resource of models that 1) can be used \u201cas is\u201d in (bio)molecular simulations; 2) gives reference points for the construction of other small molecule models; 3) provides guidelines and reference data for automated topology builders; and 4) can be used as building blocks for the construction of more complex (macro)molecules, hence enabling investigations of complex biomolecular and soft material systems.", "date": "2021-07-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Relying on QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations, we have sought to situate the energy of the lowest triplet state of thymine embedded in a B-DNA environment. The energy gap varies between 305 and 329 kJ.mol\u22121 when a single thymine is treated at the quantum chemistry level, depending on its position in the model double-stranded 16-bp oligonucleotide.

However, the impacts of phase transformation behaviors of the LMOs minerals, especially during the desalination operations, on the deionization performance of the LMOs/C electrodes have yet to be extensively evaluated. In this study, Mg-buserite derived from ion exchange of fresh Na-birnessite, Na- and K-birnessite were systematically evaluated as active electrode materials for removal of copper (Cu2+) ions from synthetic saline in a symmetric membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) cell. In the cases of Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions, the Mg-buserite/C electrode demonstrated the best deionization performance in terms of the salt and/or ion adsorption capacity, electrosorption rate, charge efficiency, and cycling stability, followed by K-birnessite/C, and then Na- birnessite/C. More importantly, the Mg-buserite/C electrode also exhibited the highest Cu2+ ion adsorption capacity (IAC) of 89.3 mg Cu2+/g active materials at a cell potential of 1.2 V in 500 mg L\u22121 CuCl2 solution, with an IAC retention as high as 96.3% after 60 electrosorption/desorption cycles. The underlying mechanisms for Cu2+ sequestration were investigated via ex-situ X-ray diffraction, indicating that the improving deionization performance toward Cu2+ from solution is mainly attributed to the expanded interlayer spacing through ion exchange of the original stabilizing Na+ ions of Na-birnessite with foreign Mg2+ ions, leading to a phase transformation from Na-birnessite into Mg-buserite that has larger ion diffusion channels and a higher ion storage capacity. Our work has demonstrated that expansion of interlayer spacing of LMOs minerals via ion exchange is a reliable and solid strategy for improving the desalination performance in CDI platforms, and provided insight for the rational design of smart electrodes for CDI applications towards heavy metal ion sequestration.", "date": "2021-07-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Environmental Science; Water Purification", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The standard procedure of reducing H2PtCl6 or H2PtBr6 in presence of NaOH has been intensively investigated as well as the influence of the counter cation of the base. However, the base anion influence has not been explored yet. The results of this work show that the size control rather depends on the precursor (metal salt) and surprisingly not the anion type of the base. The latter is surprising as the concentration of the base anion is often an important factor for the size control. The thermal reduction of the precursors H2PtCl6, H2Pt(OH)6, or Pt(acac)2 in presence of the bases NaOH or Na(acac) lead to comparable size control depending on the precursors, i.e., precursor anions. The reduction of H2PtCl6 or H2Pt(OH)6 in presence of NaOH supports the idea of the size being determined by the OH-/Pt molar ratio. Reducing the two precursors in presence of Na(acac) leads to similar results in particle size control for the same acac-/Pt or OH-/Pt ratios. In contrast, the reduction of Pt(acac)2 in presence of the bases NaOH (previous reports) or Na(acac) (shown in the present work) leads to larger NPs of ca. 3 nm, independent of the concentration of the base anions. Hence the anion effect seems originate predominantly in the character of the precursor (precursor anion dependence) and then for certain precursors as H2PtCl6 or H2Pt(OH)6 in the base anion/Pt ratio determining the NP size in the reduction.", "date": "2021-07-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Nanoscience; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To date, organized surface features that include protrusions, water-fingers, and molecular hinges have been reported. Many of these equilibrium studies have focused upon small-molecule transport - yet the extent to which the complexity of the solute and the competition between different solutes, influence transport mechanisms have not been explored. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations that demonstrate that a metal salt LiNO3 can be transported via a protrusion mechanism that is remarkably similar to that reported for H2O by tri-butyl phosphate (TBP), a process that involves dimeric assemblies. Yet the LiNO3 out-competes H2O for a bridging position between the extracting TBP dimer, which in-turn changes the preferred transport pathway of H2O. Examining the electrolyte concentration dependence on ion-pair transport unexpectedly reveals an inverse correlation with the extracting surfactant concentration. As [LiNO3] increases, surface adsorbed TBP becomes a limiting reactant in correlation with an increased negative surface charge induced by excess interfacial NO3-, however, the rate of transport is enhanced. Within the highly dynamic interfacial environment, we hypothesize that this unique cooperative effect may be due to perturbed surface organization that either decreases the energy of formation of transporting protrusion motifs or makes it easier for these self-assembled species to disengage from the surface.", "date": "2021-07-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Energy; Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Processes; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The hybrid kernel consists of a marginalized graph kernel (MGK) and a radial basis function (RBF) kernel that operates on molecular graphs and global molecular features, respectively. Bayesian optimization was used to get the optimal hyperparameters for both models. The comparisons are performed on 11 publicly available data sets.

However, the relationship and flow between information, energy and mechanics in chemical systems and mechanisms remains largely unexplored. Here we analyze a minimalist experimental example of an autonomous artificial chemically-driven molecular motor - a molecular information ratchet - in terms of information\nthermodynamics, a framework that quantitatively relates information to other thermodynamic parameters. This treatment reveals how directional motion is generated by free energy transfer from the chemical to the mechanical processes involving the motor. We find that the free\nenergy transfer consists of two distinct contributions that can be considered as \u201cenergy flow\u201d and \u201cinformation flow\u201d. We identify the efficiency with which the chemical fuel powers the free energy transfer and show that this is a useful quantity with which to compare and evaluate\nmechanisms of, and guide designs for, molecular machines. The study provides a thermodynamic level of understanding of molecular motors that is general, complements previous analyses based on kinetics, and has practical implications for designing and improving synthetic molecular machines, regardless of the particular type of machine or chemical structure. In particular, the study confirms that, in line with kinetic analysis, power strokes do not affect the directionality of chemically-driven molecular machines. However, we also find that under some conditions power\nstrokes can modulate the molecular motor current (how fast the components rotate), efficiency with respect to how free energy is dissipated, and the number of fuel molecules consumed per cycle. This may help explain the role of such conformational changes in biomolecular machine mechanisms and illustrates the interplay between energy and information in chemical systems.", "date": "2021-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Statistical Mechanics; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Unidirectionality, with macropores arranged along a common direction, is another strategy to improve the strength of porous ceramics, while being beneficial for a wide range of other applications involved with mass, gas or species transport. Here we combine the two approaches and show a simple processing strategy to obtain highly porous, unidirectional ceramic/polymer composites.

After the evaporation of the solvent, porous ceramic composites with a porosity greater than 60% were obtained. We performed a complete mechanical characterization to assess the relative importance of the properties of the ceramic and polymer phases. Our results demonstrate that the addition of a ductile polymer (PCL) can increase both the strength and the toughness of the composites while maintaining a high porosity.

The initial state results from tunneling ionization by a strong IR field which coherently pumps the three lowest states of the cation, D0, D1 and D2. The quantum dynamical simulations show that a strong isotope effect occurs when the ionization accesses significantly the D2 state of the cation in the Franck-Condon region.

To accomplish this goal, various computational molecular generation methods have been developed with recent advances in deep learning and the increase of biological data.

Thus, when the number of available activity data is limited, protein-ligand docking calculations should be used.

To address this problem, we used machine-learning models predicting docking energy to accelerate the molecular generation process.

ONOO\u2212 selectively oxidises the boronate pinacol ester of ATP-LW, to afford the fluorescent 4-hydroxy-1,8-naphthalimide product NA-OH (\u03bbex = 450 nm, \u03bbem = 562 nm or \u03bbex = 488 nm, \u03bbem = 568 nm).

Chass; Devis Di Tommaso", "abstract": "Formed via aqueous carbonation of Mg2+ ions, the crystallization of magnesite (MgCO3) is a promising carbon capture and reuse technology, albeit limited by the slow precipitation of MgCO3. Although magnesite is naturally abundant, forming at low temperature conditions, its production is an energy-intensive process due to the temperatures required to prevent the formation of hydrated phases. The principle difficulty arises from the very strong Mg2+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H2O interaction, raising barriers to dehydration. Using atomistic simulations, we have investigated the influence of thirty additive anions (Xn\u2013, n = 1\u20133), ranging from simple halides to more complex molecules, on the first two steps of MgCO3 aggregation from solution: Mg2+ dehydration and Mg2+\u2219\u2219\u2219CO32\u2013 pairing. We have computed the thermodynamic stability of solvent shared ion pairs, Mg2+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H2O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Xn\u2013, and contact ion pairs, Mg2+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Xn\u2013, with Mg2+ to reveal the propensity of solution additives to inhibit Mg2+\u2219\u2219\u2219CO32\u2013 formation. We have determined the stabilization of undercoordinated hydrated Mg2+ states with a vacant coordination site to which CO32\u2013 can bind, subsequently initiating MgCO3 nucleation or Mg2+ incorporation into the crystal lattice. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations of electrolyte solutions containing Na2CO3 with different sources of Mg2+, MgCl2, MgSO4 and Mg(CH3COO)2, further shows that the degree of dehydration of Mg2+ and the structure of prenucleation MgCO3 clusters changes depending on the type counterion.  Through a fundamental understanding of the role of solution additives in the mechanism of Mg2+ dehydration, our computational study can rationalize previously reported experimental observation of the effect of solvation environments on the growth of magnesite. This understanding may contribute to identifying solution composition conditions that could promote the low-temperature CO2 conversion into MgCO3.", "date": "2021-07-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Geochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, most commonly used surfactants are synthetically derived and pose environmental and toxicological concerns throughout their product life cycle. Because of this, bio-derived and bio-degradable surfactants are promising alternatives. For bio-surfactants to be implemented industrially, they need to be produced on a large scale and also have tailorable properties that match those afforded by the polymerization of synthetic surfactants. In this paper, a scalable and versatile production method for bio-surfactants based on a hydrophilic intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) sequence with a genetically engineered hydrophobic domain is used to study variables that impact their physicochemical and self-assembling properties. These amphiphilic sequences were found to self-assemble into micelles over a broad range of temperatures, pH values, and ionic strengths. To investigate the role of the IDP hydrophilic domain on self-assembly, variants with increased overall charges and systematically decreased IDP domain lengths were produced and examined for their sizes, morphologies, and critical micelle concentrations (CMCs). The results of these studies indicate that decreasing the length of the IDP domain and, consequently, the molecular weight and hydrophilic fraction, leads to smaller micelles. Additionally, significantly increasing the amount of charged residues in the hydrophilic IDP domain results in micelles of similar sizes, but with higher CMC values. This represents an initial step in developing a quantitative model for the future engineering of bio-surfactants based on this IDP sequence.", "date": "2021-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This limits their kinetic capacity to oxidize substrates. In response, we have developed a series of ligand systems bearing bulky aryl substituents that are primarily directed away from the metal centre, Ar3-TMPA (Ar = tpb, dpb, dtbpb), and used them to support [Cu(Ar3-TMPA)(NCMe)]+ copper(I) complexes. Solutions of all three react with O2 to yield [Cu(\u03b71-O2\u2022\u2212)(Ar3-TMPA)]+ complexes that are stable against dimerization at all temperatures. Full binding of O2 is observed at sub-ambient temperatures and can be reversed by warming. The onset of oxygenation is ligand dependent, but can be observed at 25\u00b0C in the case of Ar = tpb and dpb. Furthermore, all three [Cu(\u03b71-O2\u2022\u2212)(Ar3-TMPA)]+ complexes are stable against self-decay at temperatures \u2264 -20\u00b0C. This provides a wide temperature window over which these complexes can be studied, which was exploited by performing extensive reaction kinetics measurements for [Cu(\u03b71-O2\u2022\u2212)(tpb3-TMPA)]+ with a broad range of O-H, N-H, and C-H bond substrates. This includes correlation of second order rate constants (k2 values) versus oxidation potentials (Eox) for a range of phenols (i.e., a Marcus plot), construction of Eyring plots, and temperature-dependent kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements. The data obtained indicates that reaction with all substrates proceeds via H-atom transfer (HAT) to [Cu(\u03b71-O2\u2022\u2212)(tpb3-TMPA)]+. In addition, evidence suggests that HAT reaction with the phenols studied proceeds with significant charge transfer, and that it involves full tunelling of both H and D atoms in the case of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine (DPH) and 4-methoxy-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (MeO-ArOH). Consistent with expectations for HAT, large entropic barriers (\u0394S\u2021) were measured for the substrates MeO-ArOH, DPH, triphenylhydrazine (TPH), and 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH). Despite having the lowest X-H bond dissociation energy (BDE) amongst these substrates, the C-H substrate BNAH exhibits both the largest \u0394S\u2021 and the second largest enthalpic barrier (\u0394H\u2021) to reaction. This is congruent with the expectation that oxidation of C-H bonds is kinetically challenging and the experimental observation that [Cu(\u03b71-O2\u2022\u2212)(tpb3-TMPA)]+ is only able to oxidize very weak C-H bonds, whereas it can oxidize moderately strong N-H bonds.

We consider different choices for the three components of a propeller and systematically investigate the dependence of the stereoisomeric energy difference on these choices. Our results show that the preference of the 0D chirality of a functional group in the propeller system is determined by the 1D chirality, and homochirality is also a remarkable feature for this system. We also unveiled that there exists positive cooperativity and electrostatic interactions play the dominant role in determining the stereoisomeric stability difference while the roles for exchange-correlation and steric effects are minor but indispensable.

As with any analytical technique, ensuring data integrity with DART-MS results is critical. To further enhance data integrity and eliminate some of the challenges associated with qualitative analysis of seized drugs using DART-MS, the incorporation of an internal standard was investigated. After evaluating a number of candidate compounds, tetracaine was chosen because of its desirable characteristics. An appropriate concentration of tetracaine was established that provided similar sensitivity to GC-MS for a panel of drugs. The presence of tetracaine in a drug extract was found to cause a reduction in signal for some common drugs due to competitive ionization but did not cause complete suppression of signal at relevant concentrations. Evaluation of a set of 60 representative case samples with and without internal standard found that the presence of internal standard did not negatively impact the results and that its presence eliminated the false identification of noise peaks in negative samples.

The nature of this practically important phenomenon has remained a mystery for the last six decades and was speculated to be related to increased Bronsted acidity during dealumination. We now prove that during steaming aluminum oxide clusters evolve (due to hydrolysis of Al out of framework positions with the following clustering) in the zeolitic micropores with properties very similar to (nano)facets of hydroxylated transition-alumina surfaces. Bronsted acidity of zeolite does not increase and the total number of Bronsted acid sites decreases during steaming. O5Al(VI)-OH surface sites of alumina clusters dehydroxylate at elevated temperatures to form penta-coordinate Al1O5 sites that are capable of initiating alkane cracking by breaking the first C-H bond very effectively, with the following reaction steps catalyzed by nearby zeolitic Bronsted acid sites. This explains the underlying reason behind the improved alkane cracking and alkane dehydrogenation activity of steamed zeolites: heterolytic C-H bond breaking occurs on penta Al(V)1O5 sites of aluminum oxide clusters confined in zeolitic pores. Furthermore, slightly decreased number of adjacent Al framework sites (due to Al dislodgement from the framework) decreases the coking activity, prolonging catalyst lifetime. Our findings explain the origin of enhanced activity of steamed zeolites at the molecular level and provide the missing understanding of the nature of extra-framework Al species formed in steamed/dealuminated zeolites.  Furthermore, our findings suggest that similar La2O3 clusters exist for La-containing zeolites and the origin of their cracking activity promotion should be similar.", "date": "2021-07-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Acid Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, CD-MS often shows uncertainty in the charge measurement that limits the resolution. To overcome this charge state uncertainty, we developed UniDecCD (UCD) software for computational de-convolution of CD-MS data, which significantly improves the resolution of CD-MS data. Here, we describe the UCD algorithm and demonstrate its ability to improve CD-MS resolution of proteins, megadalton viral capsids, and heterogeneous nanodiscs made from natural lipid extracts.

Control of these morphological traits would allow the tailored fabrication of useful materials including highly porous solids, anisotropic heat conductors, tough composites, among others. While approaches like ice templating has produced foams with elongated cells, there is a need for rapid, versatile, and energy efficient methods that also control the local order and macroscopic alignment of cellular elements. Here we describe a fast and convenient method to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization. We fabricated foams by curing mixtures of dicyclopentadiene and a physical blowing agent via frontal ring opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP). The materials were characterized using micro-computed tomography and an image analysis protocol to quantify morphological characteristics including volume fraction and anisotropy. The cellular structure, porosity, and hardness of the foams changed with blowing agent, concentration, and resin viscosity. Moreover, we used a full factorial combination of variables to correlate each parameter with the structure of the obtained foams. We found a strong correlation between the resin viscosity and the foam\u2019s cellular structure. Furthermore, a specific combination of input parameters controlled the transitions from (i) isotropic to anisotropic cellular structures, (ii) porous to non-porous, and (iii) soft to hard foams. Our results demonstrate the controlled production of foams with specific morphologies using the simple and efficient method of frontal polymerization.

Solubilizing, self-propelling droplets have emerged as a rich chemical platform for exploration of active behaviors, but isotropic droplets rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking to sustain motion. The introduction of permanent asymmetry, e.g. in the form of a biphasic Janus droplet, has not been explored previously as a comprehensive design strategy for active droplets, despite the widespread use of Janus structures in motile solid particles. Here, we uncover the chemomechanical framework underlying the self-propulsion of biphasic Janus oil droplets solubilizing in aqueous surfactant. We elucidate how droplet propulsion is influenced by the degree of oil mixing, droplet shape, and oil solubilization rates for a range of oil combinations. A key finding is that for droplets containing both a mobile (solubilizing) and non-mobile oil, the degree of partitioning of the mobile oil across the Janus droplets\u2019 oil-oil interface plays a pivotal role in determining the droplet speed and swimming direction. In addition, spatiotemporal control over droplet swimming speed and orientation is demonstrated through the application of local thermal gradients applied via joule heating and laser illumination. We also explore the interactions between collections of Janus droplets including the spontaneous formation of multi-droplet clusters that spin predictably based on symmetry. Our findings provide insights as to how the chemistry and structure of multiphase fluids can be harnessed to design microswimmers with programmable active and collective behaviors.\n\n", "date": "2021-07-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Surfactants; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Several synthetic dissipative supramolecular materials have been created using chemicals or light as fuel, with the goal of furthering our understanding of biological systems and creating synthetic materials that have life-like dynamic properties. However, electrical energy, one of the most common energy sources, has remained mostly unexplored for such purposes. Here we demonstrate the use of electrically fueled dissipative assembly as a new platform for creating active supramolecular materials. Through an electrochemical redox reaction network operating in mild aqueous buffers, a transient and highly active supramolecular assembly based on a redox-sensitive cysteine derivative is achieved by applying an electric potential. The dissipative self-assembly as well as its emergent properties can be spatiotemporally controlled by modulation of electrical signals on patterned microelectrodes. Using electrical energy as a readily available and clean fuel, we are able to create dissipative supramolecular materials rapidly (in seconds to minutes) and repetitively under mild conditions with directional and spatiotemporal control.

On the other hand, parameterizations for empirical potentials are often not available and these potentials may ultimately lack the desired predictive accuracy. Fortunately, modern machine learning (ML) potentials are increasingly able to bridge this gap, promising first-principles accuracy at a much reduced computational cost. However, the local nature of these ML potentials typically means that long-range contributions arising, e.g., from electrostatic interactions are neglected. Clearly, such interactions can be large in polar materials like electrolytes, however. Herein, we investigate the effect that the locality assumption of ML potentials has on lithium mobility and defect formation energies in the SSE Li$_7$P$_3$S$_{11}$. We find that neglecting long-range electrostatics is unproblematic for the description of lithium transport in the isotropic bulk.

For ammonia synthesis, it could make the process milder, which would help production decentralization and compatibility with renewable energy. However, one major obstacle preventing optimization of the plasma-assisted process is the incipient mechanistic understanding of ammonia formation on plasma-exposed catalysts. Here, emission spectroscopy detects N\u2022 and H\u2022 radicals in plasma phas-es generated from N2/H2 mixtures even at atmospheric pressure, which are bound to enable new catalyst involved pathways not considered in previously reported kinetic models for ammonia synthesis. Thus, we comprehensively examined, via den-sity functional theory (DFT) calculations, the energetics (favorability) of 51 reactions on Fe, Ni, Co, Pd, Ga, Sn, Cu, Au, and Ag. Enthalpic barriers for Eley-Rideal (ER) reactions involving N\u2022 and H\u2022 radicals were found to be negligible and hence supportive of: i) plausible NNH formation and consequent prominent role of the associative pathway to form NH3 (con-sistent with some experimental reports detecting surface-bound NXHY species), ii) likelihood of N\u2022 adsorption taking over N2* dissociation as the primary source of surface bound N*, and iii) probable dominance of ER hydrogenation reactions over Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) ones. The energetics herein presented will allow thoroughly studying pathway competition in future kinetic models, but numbers calculated here already suggest that the dominant pathway may change with metal identity. For instance, N2HY dissociation favorability becomes competitive with ER hydrogenation earlier in the hydrogena-tion sequence in the more nitrophilic the metals. Yet, the calculated favorability of ER reactions is also already consistent with the weaker dependence of initial NH3 turnover frequencies (TOFs) on metal identity compared to the thermocatalytic scenario. With practical implications for computational catalyst screening, TOFs experimentally measured herein for an atmospheric dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor linearly correlate with \u0394Erxn for the ER hydrogenation reaction H\u2022 + HNNH2* \u2192 HNNH3*. This descriptor may be robust to exact synthesis conditions, as its correlation with TOFs was main-tained for earlier TOF data in a sub-atmospheric radio frequency (RF) reactor", "date": "2021-07-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We test the two approaches on the low-barrier reactions of 3-hydroperoxypropanal, which have been studied by a large variety of reaction discovery approaches and therefore provides a good benchmark. By using PM3 and GFN2-xTB for reaction energy and barrier screening the systematic approach identifies 64 reactions (out of 27,577 possible reactions) for DFT refinement, which in turn identifies the three reactions with lowest barriers plus a previously undiscovered reaction. With optimised hyperparameters meta-dynamics followed by PM3/GFN2-xTB-based screening identifies 15 reactions for DFT refinement, which in turn identifies the three reactions with lowest barrier. The number of DFT refinements can be further reduced to as little as six for both approaches by first verifying the transition states with GFN1-xTB.

The source code is based on open-source tools and is organized as a Python package. Tasks can be executed individually or within the context of scalable, robust workflows. First, structures are standardized and duplicate entries are filtered out. Then, molecules are probed for the presence of predefined fragments. For molecules with more than one match, fragment combinations are classified. The algorithm considers the pair-wise relative position of fragments within the molecule (fused atoms, linkers, intermediary rings), resulting in 18 different possible fragment combination categories. Finally, all combinations for a given molecule are assembled into a fragment combination graph, with fragments as nodes and combination types as edges. This workflow was applied to characterize PNPs in the ChEMBL database via comparison of fragment combination graphs with Natural Product (NP) references, represented by the Dictionary of Natural Products. The Murcko fragments extracted from 2,000 structures previously described were used to define NP-fragments. The results indicate that ca. 23% of the biologically relevant compounds listed in ChEMBL comply to the PNP definition, and that, therefore, PNPs occur frequently among known biologically relevant small molecules.

The substituents (e.g., methyl, trifluoromethyl, and cyclopropyl) affect the overall reactivities of these cubane precursors leading to a yield from 1% to 48%. We now integrate single and multireference calculations and our machine-learning-accelerated non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (ML-NAMD) to understand how substituents affect the mechanistic photodynamics of [2+2]-photocycloadditions. Our calculations show that steric clashes destabilize the 4\u03c0-electrocyclic ring-opening pathway and minimum energy conical intersections by 0.72\u20131.15 eV and reaction energies by 0.68\u20132.34 eV.

The 2 ps ML-NAMD trajectories reveal that closed-shell repulsions block a 6\u03c0-conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening pathway with increasing steric bulk. 57% of the methyl-substituted [3]-ladderene trajectories proceed through the 6\u03c0-conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening, whereas the trifluoromethyl- and cyclopropyl-substituted 3-ladderenes chemoselectively proceed through [2+2]-photocycloaddition pathways.

Previously, we reported the synthesis of a trinuclear Fe(II) complex, Fe3TPM2, supported by a three-fold symmetric 2-pyridylpyrrolide ligand (i.e., tris(5-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methane), that featured a rare cis-divacant octahedral (CDO) geometry at each Fe(II) center. Here, a series of truncated 2-pyridylpyrrolide ligands is described that support mono- and binuclear Fe(II) complexes that also exhibit CDO geometries. Metallation of tetradentate ligand bis(5-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methane (H2BPM) in THF results in a binuclear complex Fe2(BPM)2(THF)2 in which both Fe(II) ions are octahedrally coordinated. The coordinated THF solvent ligands are labile: THF dissociation leads to Fe2(BPM)2, which features five-coordinate Fe(II) ions. The Fe\u2013Fe distance in these binuclear complexes can be elongated by ligand methylation. Metalation of bis(5-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methane (H2BPMMe) in THF leads to the formation of four-coordinate, CDO Fe(II) centers in Fe(BPMMe)2. Further ligand truncation affords bidentate ligands 2- (1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine (PyrPyrrH) and 2-methyl-6-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine (PyrMePyrrH). Metalation of these ligands in THF affords six-coordinate complexes Fe(PyrPyrr)2(THF)2 and Fe(PyrMePyrr)2(THF)2. Dissociation of labile solvent ligands provides access to four- coordinate Fe(II) complexes. Ligand disproportionation at Fe(PyrPyrr)2 results in the formation of Fe(PyrPyrr)3 and Fe(0). Ligand methyl- ation suppresses this disproportionation and enables isolation of Fe(PyrMePyrr)2, which is rigorously CDO. Complete ligand truncation, by separating the 2-pyridylpyrrolide ligands into the constituent monodentate pyridyl and pyrrolide donors, affords Fe(Pyr)2(Pyrr)2 in which the Fe(II) is tetrahedrally coordinated. Computational analysis indicates that the potential energy surface that dictates the coordination geometry in this family of four-coordinate complexes is fairly flat in the vicinity of CDO coordination.

A modification of perfluorocarbon (PFC)-loaded, nanocarrier-based 19F MRI probes with paramagnetic chelates can enhance probe\u2019s functionality. Liquid PFC-loaded nanocarriers typically have a core-shell structure with PFC in the core due to the poor miscibility of PFC. However, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement acts only at a distance of a few angstroms. Thus, efficient modulation of 19F signal is possible only with fluorophilic PFC-soluble chelates. Such chelates, however, cannot interact with the surroundings of nanocarriers. Conversely, chelates on the surface typically affect only the aqueous environment but not the 19F signal.\nWe show that the confinement of PFC in biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles with fractal structure enables modulation of longitudinal and transverse 19F relaxation, as well as proton signal, using non-fluorophilic paramagnetic chelates. We compared nanoparticles with fractal multicore versus conventional core-shell structure, where the PFC is encapsulated in the core(s) and the chelate in the surrounding polymeric matrix. Importantly, paramagnetic chelates affected both longitudinal and transverse 19F relaxation in fractal multicore nanoparticles, but not in core-shell nanocapsules. Both relaxation rates of 19F nucleus increased with an increasing concentration of the paramagnetic chelate. Moreover, as the polymeric matrix remained water-permeable, proton enhancement additionally was observed in MRI. In the future, the effects of fractal confinement could be combined with more effective paramagnetic chelates to develop multifunctional imaging probes, for example, for high-sensitivity 19F MRI combined with sensing.

Substrate transport rates in these materials can significantly influence the efficiency of such applications. Two factors that contribute to transport rates include 1) the porosity of the silicate matrix and\n2) non-bonding interactions between the diffusing species and the silicate surface. These contributions generally emerge from disparate length scales, namely 'microscopic' (roughly nanometer-scale) and 'macroscopic' (roughly micron-scale), respectively. Here, we develop a simulation framework to estimate the simultaneous impact of these factors on methane mass transport in silicate channels.\nSpecifically, we develop a model of methane transport using homogenization theory to obtain transport parameters valid at length scales of hundreds to thousands of nanometers.\nThese parameters implicitly reflect interactions taking place at fractions of a nanometer. The inputs to the homogenization analysis are data from extensive molecular dynamics simulations that incorporate atomistic-scale interactions, processed to yield local diffusion coefficients and mean force potentials. With this model, we demonstrate how nuances in silicate hydration and silica/methane interactions impact methane diffusion rates in silicate materials, including the effects of silicate surface chemistry such as the presence of silanol groups.\nThe molecular dynamics simulations indicate that methane diffusivity at the silica surface is lower than the bulk-like rates observed at the center of channels of sufficient width.\nHowever, potentials of mean force generally evidence attractive methane/silica interactions that enhance diffusion overall. By simultaneously accounting for both of these effects, we show that the effective diffusion coefficient for the nanoporous silicate can be approximately double the value of estimates assuming fully bulk-like behavior in the channel. This study therefore demonstrates the importance of determining diffusion coefficients and potentials of mean force at an atomistic level when estimating transport properties in bulk materials.\nImportantly, we provide a simple homogenization framework to incorporate these molecular-scale attributes into bulk material transport estimates. This hybrid homogenization/molecular dynamics approach will be of general use for describing small molecule transport in materials with detailed molecular interactions.\n", "date": "2021-07-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Processes; Physical and Chemical Properties; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although ex-perimental methodologies such as x-ray and neutron scattering have been applied to characterize ion-extractant complexes, identifying the site of ion-extractant complexation has proven challenging. Here, we use tensiometry and surface-sensitive x-ray scattering to study the surface of aqueous solutions of lanthanide chlorides and the water-soluble extractant bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP), in the absence of a coexisting organic solvent. These studies restrict interactions of HDEHP with trivalent lanthanide ions to the aqueous phase and the liquid-vapor interface, allowing us to explore the consequences that one or the other is the site of ion-extractant complexation. Unexpectedly, we find that light lanthanides preferentially occupy the liquid-vapor interface, with an overwhelming preference for a light lanthanide, Nd, when present in a mixture with a heavy lanthanide, Er. This contradicts our expectation that heavy lanthanides should have a higher interfacial density since they are preferentially extracted by HDEHP in the presence of an organic phase. These results reveal the antagonistic role played by ion-extractant complexation within the aqueous phase and clarify the potential advantages of water-insoluble extractants that interact with ions primarily at the interface during the process of solvent extraction.

Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs) seek to reduce system costs by leveraging the large electrochemical stability window of organic solvents (> 3 V) to operate at high cell voltages and to facilitate the use of redox couples that are incompatible with aqueous electrolytes. However, a key challenge for emerging nonaqueous chemistries is the lack of membranes/separators with suitable combinations of selectivity, conductivity, and stability. Single-ion conducting ceramics, integrated with polymeric fillers to make flexible composites, may offer a pathway to the performance attributes needed for competitive nonaqueous systems. Here, we explore composite polymer-inorganic binder-filler membranes for lithium-based NAqRFBs, investigating two different ceramic compounds with NASICON-type (NASICON: sodium (Na) Super Ionic CONductor) crystal structure, Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) and Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 (LAGTP), blended with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric matrix. We characterize the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized membranes as a function of processing conditions and formulation using a range of microscopic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical techniques. We then integrate select composite membranes into a single electrolyte flow cell configuration and perform polarization measurements with different redox electrolyte compositions. We find that mechanically robust, chemically stable LATP/PVDF composites can support > 40 mA cm\u22122 at 400 mV cell overpotential, but further improvements are needed in selectivity. The insights gained through this work begin to establish the foundational knowledge needed to advance composite polymer-inorganic membranes/separators for NAqRFBs.", "date": "2021-07-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Ceramics; Composites; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we performed ensemble docking for around 2000 FDA approved drugs with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein of SARS-CoV-2 as target. The representative protein structures were generated by clustering classical molecular dynamics trajectories, which were evolved using three solvent scenarios, namely, pure water and benzene/water and phenol/water mixtures. The introduction of dynamic effects in the theoretical model showed to improve the docking results in terms of the number of strong binders and binding sites in the protein. Some of the discovered pockets were found only for the cosolvent simulations, where the nonpolar probes induced local conformational changes in the protein that lead to the opening of transient pockets. In addition, the selection of the ligands based on a combination of the binding free energy and binding free energy gap between the best two poses for each ligand provided more suitable binders than the selection of ligands based solely on one of the criteria. The application of cosolvent molecular dynamics to enhance the sampling of the configurational space is expected to improve the efficacy of virtual screening campaigns of future drug discovery projects.", "date": "2021-07-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Kayode; Matthew M. Montemore", "abstract": "The strength of interaction between a metal and oxygen and/or carbon is a crucial factor for catalytic performance, materials stability, and other important applications. While these are fundamental properties in materials science, there is no general understanding of what makes a metal oxophilic or carbophilic, especially for main group metals. In this work, we elucidate the factors that control how oxophilic or carbophilic a metal is by creating a predictive model and applying it to a variety of data sets for transition metals and main group metals, including DFT-calculated adsorption energies and experimental formation energies. Our model is easily interpretable and accurately describes oxophilic and carbophilic trends across different regions of the periodic table. This model captures the ionic contribution to bonding, the adsorbate-sp contribution to bonding, and the adsorbate-d contribution to bonding by using the reduction potential, matrix coupling elements, band centers, and band filling. For transition metals, the adsorbate-surface d coupling is the major factor that determines oxophilicity relative to carbophilicity. For metals that do not contain d electrons either in their core or valence shell (Li, Be, Na, Mg, Al, K, and Ca), the reduction potential and the adsorbate-surface s coupling are the major factors. As a simple application, we demonstrate the utility of oxophilicity and carbophilicity in rapidly screening metal dopants for improved selectivity for ethylene epoxidation on silver-based catalysts. Using our model, we established a direct relationship between the electronic properties of the metal dopants and their selectivity for ethylene epoxidation. The results suggest that transition metals with high adsorbate-surface d coupling and main group metals with low adsorbate-surface s coupling are good silver-dopant candidates for this reaction. Overall, the improved linkage between a metal\u2019s electronic structure and its interaction with carbon or oxygen will be broadly useful in design of functional materials for  a variety of applications.

Compared to aggregated state, photothermal agents could rotate freely in dispersed state, allowing for an efficient non-radiative dissipation by formation of highly twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. As the molecular motions are completely liberated in this strategy, the PCE enhancement is more remarkable than common methods of supporting molecular motions in aggregates. Noteworthy, this state transformation could be achieved in virtue of a releasing process from nanoparticles in lysosome of cancer cells, demonstrating a distinct photothermal therapeutic performance for cancer ablation.

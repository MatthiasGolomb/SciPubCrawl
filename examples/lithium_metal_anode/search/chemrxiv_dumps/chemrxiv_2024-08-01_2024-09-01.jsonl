This type of assembly, however, is potentially possible on colloidal objects, as showed by preliminary results. The proposed fabri-cation method was done using polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) block copolymer and consists of two steps: i) the formation of a monolayer of BCs by the establishment of non-covalent interactions between the substrate and the hydrophilic blocks in a non-selective solvent ii) the controlled addition of a selective solvent (water) which triggers the assembly of the second layer through hydrophobic interactions between the free and previously adsorbed hydrophobic blocks resulting in the formation of a self-assembled bilayer of BCs on a solid support. A final rinsing step allows to eliminate the excess of aggregates (micelles) generated in the solution during the second step. BC monolayers and bilayers on solid supports were obtained and characterized using various surface characterization techniques. The ability of these bilayers to encapsulate hydrophobic actives of interest for specific applications has also been highlighted using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).

We developed a new approach to \u201cdock\u201d the alkyl groups on isoquinoline nitrogen for their phosphite-mediated migrations to C2 carbon for an overall ortho-C\u2212H alkylation with complete recovery of the phosphite. Tuning the phosphite-mediated protocol to switch the site selectivity would expedite direct and diverse multi-C\u2212H bond functionalization.

This dock-ing strategy for dual nitrogen activation and C\u2212H functionalization led to a net-zero carbon waste method. The docking and migration protocol works with primary, secondary, and all carbon tertiary alkyl halides, leading to unprecedented success with sterically demanding alkylations. The phosphite-mediated transportation of the alkyl group from nitrogen to ring carbon makes the nitrogen of the meta-alkylated isoquinoline product ready for dock again. Here, for the first time, we showed consecutive re-docking of different functional groups on the free isoquinoline nitrogen for their sequential regioselective migrations at ortho-position. The change in phosphite-mediated methods and the docking order led to derivatizations of the meta-alkylated iso-quinoline products, including regiodivergent multi-C\u2212H alkylations of isoquinolines.

Based on quantum mechanical simulations of the active component of stevia's structural relaxation by minimum ground state electron density energy forces, a hypothesis is devised for the origin of this stevia-induced superheating due to interactions with higher frequency, mobile carboxyl and hydroxyl group side-chains present above the base molecular plane of steviol [1], which enable stevia granules to act as bubble nucleation sites.

This report uses Monte Carlo simulations of buoyant microsphere motion and Brownian diffusion to investigate how buoyancy affects the capture rate of analytes and subsequent BAM-complex formation. To computationally simulate buoyant capture kinetics, nucleocapsid proteins (the analyte) are first seeded with a 3D matrix of buoyant particles underneath.

Aiming at to simulate a repair operation a gouged groove (~6-7mm deep) was produced on the top of the weld metal, close to the Thermally Affected Zone by ACAG and rewelded by SAW. The welded joints were studied in three different situations regarding the joint preparation treatment after gouging, namely: i) without any type of cleaning, ii) brushing and iii) rectifying. The degree of sensitization of the welded joint was evaluated using the double loop potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) technique according to ISO 12732 Corrosion of metals and alloys \u2014 Electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation measurement using the double loop method (based on Cihal's method), and susceptibility to intergranular corrosion in accordance with ASTM A262-15 Standard Practices for Detecting Susceptibility to Intergranular Attack in Austenitic Stainless Steels, Practice A.

The conventional hierarchical CSP workflow suggests that no single energy model can fulfill the needs of all stages in the workflow, and energy models across a spectrum of fidelities and computational costs are required. Hybrid ab initio/empirical force-field (HAIEFF) models have demonstrated a good balance of these two factors, but the force-field component presents a major bottleneck for model accuracy. Existing parameter estimation tools for fitting this empirical component are inefficient and have severe limitations on the manageable problem size. This, combined with a lack of reliable reference data for parameter fitting, has resulted in developments in the force-field component of HAIEFF models having mostly stagnated. In this work, we address these barriers to progress. Firstly, we introduce a curated database of 755 organic crystal structures, obtained using high quality, solid-state DFT-D calculations, which provide a complete set of geometry and energy data. Comparisons to various theoretical and experimental data sources indicate that this database provides suitable diversity for parameter fitting. In tandem, we also put forward a new parameter estimation algorithm implemented as the CrystalEstimator program. Our tests demonstrate that CrystalEstimator is capable of efficiently handling large-scale parameter estimation problems, simultaneously fitting as many as 62 model parameters based on data from 445 structures. This problem size far exceeds any previously reported works related to CSP force-field parameterization. These developments form a strong foundation for all future work involving parameter estimation of transferable or tailor-made force-fields for HAIEFF models.

Achieving true reversibility in these materials is the goal that so far remains a significant challenge. Our work presents a monocomponent chitosan film fabricated using a solvent-casting method. Beyond exhibiting instantly reversible shape-morphing, a rare feat in itself, the film demonstrates a remarkable bidirectional capability in response to alkaline solution. The film responds rapidly to a specific stimulus \u2013 water \u2013capability undergoing dramatic shape changes with a high bending angle in minimal time, owing to the spontaneous diffusive gradient. This responsiveness is further enhanced by the ability to program the shape simply by tailoring the aspect ratio of the film. Further, precise control over locomotion was achieved by arresting the deformed structure in a transient state via a solvent exchange (water-ethanol-water) process. We utilized this solvent-responsive behavior to demonstrate a proof of concept for detecting alcohol by creating a 'strip-on-a-drop\u2019 based chemo-mechanical sensor.

This paper is concerned with the step-change improvement in gravity separation utilising the latest in a series of improvements. The laminar-shear separation mechanism led to the introduction of closely-spaced inclined channels, nominally 6 mm, solving a previously intractable problem in concentrating metallurgical coal. The more recent shift to a spacing of 3 mm, and even 1.8 mm has delivered a further step change in the separation of gangue minerals from dense minerals. In this new work, we have introduced changes to the lower fluidised bed, removing the fluidisation distributor and installing a slow-moving rake with water addition. This change produced a much more robust fluidisation boundary condition, removing the vagaries of the minimum fluidisation condition, producing a stronger dense medium effect, hence significant step change in gravity separation performance well beyond anything that was previously possible. This step change in performance reveals a direct pathway from a feed grade of 0.32 wt.% tin to a significant recovery of the tin at a grade higher than 40 wt.%.

The computed spin\u2013state energetics are highly variable with the choice of method and credible reference data are scarce, making it difficult to conduct conclusive computational studies of open-shell TM systems. Here, we present a novel benchmark set of first-row TM spin\u2013state energetics, which is derived from curated experimental data of 17 representative complexes containing Fe(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Co(III), Mn(II), and Ni(II) with chemically diverse ligands. The reference values of adiabatic or vertical energy differences are derived from spin-crossover enthalpies (9 complexes) or energies of spin-forbidden absorption bands in reflectance spectra (8 complexes). These are carefully back-corrected for relevant vibrational and environmental effects (due to solvation or crystal lattice) in order to provide the reference values directly comparable with computed electronic energy differences. The new benchmark set makes it possible to assess the accuracy of spin\u2013state energetics from approximate density functional theory (DFT) and wave function methods with a level of statistical reliability not attained in earlier studies. The lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.5 kcal/mol and maximum error of \u22123.5 kcal/mol are found for the coupled-cluster CCSD(T) method, which outperforms all tested multireference methods: CASPT2, MRCI+Q, CASPT2/CC and CASPT2+\u03b4MRCI. Contrary to earlier claims in the literature, the use of Kohn\u2013Sham instead of Hartree\u2013Fock orbitals in the reference determinant is not found to consistently improve the accuracy of the CCSD(T) spin\u2013state energetics. The best performing DFT methods are double-hybrids (PWPB95-D3(BJ), B2PLYP-D3(BJ)) with the MAEs below 3 kcal/mol and maximum errors within 6 kcal/mol, whereas DFT methods traditionally recommended for spin states (e.g., B3LYP*-D3(BJ) and TPSSh-D3(BJ)) are found to perform much worse with the MAEs of 5\u20137 kcal/mol and maximum errors beyond 10 kcal/mol.

Employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO), our research addresses the challenge of accurately representing the environmental effects on POMs, particularly the influence of counter-cations and solvent molecules. A critical finding of this work is the demonstration that traditional models, like COSMO, often fail to capture the physical distancing effects of solvents, leading to an overestimation of the proximity of counter-cations to POM anions and resulting in over-stabilized frontier orbital energies. By implementing geometry constraints on lithium cations, we achieve a more realistic depiction of POM-cation interactions in solution, enhancing model accuracy. Additionally, our results suggest that explicit counter-cation inclusion is essential for accurate simulations pertinent to POM applications in electronic devices, though it can be computationally intensive in solution environments.

Transition metals play a crucial role in catalyzing the CO2RR; however, their scarcity and high cost pose significant challenges in achieving sustainable chemistry. In this study, we developed a metal-free CO2RR catalytic system using triazolium, a small and structurally simple compound, as the key catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of a solution containing a carbazole photosensitizer and triazolium salt under 1 atm pressure of CO2 afforded formate in high yield at room temperature. No other reduced products of CO2 or by-products such as methanol, formaldehyde, oxalate, CO, or H2 were detected. The turnover number of the catalyst exceeded 2300, indicating high catalytic activity and durability. Mechanistic studies revealed that the triazolium salt serves as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst, with a carbon-centered radical as the catalytically active species. A study on the relationship between the chemical structure and catalytic activity of various triazolium analogs elucidated the essential structural properties required for carbon-centered HAT catalysts.

Engineering an enzyme can often confer it with an altered chemical scope, making it accessible to new and desirable chemistry. Identifying enzymes with the desired substrate specificity and activity, however, remains time-consuming and costly. Galactose oxidase (GOase) is a copper-dependent enzyme that coverts alcohols to their corresponding carbonyls, an important transformation in industrial synthesis. Here, we present a machine learning aided protocol to develop a catalytic activity prediction model (R2~0.7-0.9) for GOase based on a focused dataset of engineered GOase variants with activity toward bulky benzylic secondary alcohols. The trained GOase activity prediction models (with no additional training) also retained their predictive power when applied to another member of the oxidase family, an aryl-alcohol oxidase. Inspired by the fragment-based optimization methods used in drug discovery, we developed an active-site structure-aware substrate library for GOase. Experimental validation of a subset of the constructed substrate library indicates that the trained models provide good prediction (R2=0.61) of GOase activity, enabling the identification of the best GOase variant for each new substrate. This ability to identify optimal GOase variants for the synthesis of industrially important chemicals was demonstrated for Dyclonine, an FDA-approved drug.

This study involved reassessing the standard reference thermodynamic data for Si and Al aqueous species and relevant solids (quartz, gibbsite, boehmite) and producing a new consistent set of polythermal Pitzer interaction parameters for Si and Al species within the oceanic salt system Al\u2013Si\u2013Ca\u2013Mg\u2013Na\u2013K\u2013Cl\u2013SO4\u2013CO3\u2013H2O. Experimental data done for a range of compositions and temperatures were used optimize the interaction parameters and their temperature coefficients. In the absence of data, estimation methods using analogous species or correlations with the SIT aqueous activity model parameters were applied. For Si in acidic to neutral pH regions, interaction parameters for Si(OH)4(aq) were determined from extensive binary and ternary experimental data. The formation constant for the first silicic acid hydrolysis and its temperature dependence were assessed, while the second hydrolysis species required estimation methods due to limited data. Interaction parameters with K+ were estimated, and the effect of Ca and Mg at high pH was accounted for using complexes between Si and alkaline earth metals.  At high Si concentrations, polymeric species impact aqueous Si speciation. Due to limited data, selecting the silica tetramer (Si4O8(OH)44\u2013) and its binary IPs sufficed to reproduce amorphous Si solubility data in NaCl solutions. For Al, standard thermodynamic properties of ions, hydrolyzed species, and hydroxide phases were derived using gibbsite solubility measurements. No temperature coefficients were required for interactions in the Al\u2013Cl\u2013H2O system, yielding similar results in ternary and quaternary systems. Complexes between aluminum and sulfate were accounted for by the \u03b2(2) interaction parameter. At intermediate pH, few measurements exist to derive IPs for hydrolyzed aluminum species, with only Cl\u2013 interactions derived. Al(OH)3(aq) IPs were assumed similar to Si(OH)4(aq). At high pH, extensive gibbsite solubility data enabled consistent IPs for the Na\u2013K\u2013Cl\u2013OH\u2013Al(OH)4 system. Potential IPs with Ca2+ and Mg2+ were not selected due to precipitation of hydrates in cementitious systems and the use complexes instead. Ternary IPs with SO42\u2013 and CO32\u2013 were estimated using OH\u2013 as an analog for Al(OH)4\u2013. This provided satisfactory predictions from gibbsite solubility measurements in Na2CO3 and Na2SO4 solutions. No significant Si and Al interactions were expected in high pH cement system due to the low Si concentration maintained by cement phases like C\u2013S\u2013H or M\u2013S\u2013H precipitation. The updated Pitzer model for Si and Al aqueous speciation was compared with independent data on cement hydrate phases and solutions in moderate concentrations up to 85 \u00b0C, showing good performance.

The well-defined chemical structures of these crystalline porous electrodes facilitate structure-performance studies, however there is a fundamental lack in the molecular-level understanding of charge storage mechanisms in conductive layered MOFs. To address this, we employ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study ion adsorption in nickel 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene, Ni3(HITP)2. In this system, we find that separate resonances can be observed for the MOF\u2019s in-pore and ex-pore ions.

Quantification of the electrolyte environments by NMR was also found to provide a proxy for electrochemical performance, which could facilitate the rapid screening of synthesised MOF samples. Finally, the charge storage mechanism was explored using a combination of ex-situ NMR and operando electrochemical quartz-crystal microbalance (EQCM) experiments. These measurements revealed that cations are the dominant contributor to charge storage in Ni3(HITP)2, with anions contributing only a minor contribution to the charge storage.

Our results suggest that the proposed OneOPES strategy can be used to inform lead optimization campaigns in drug discovery and to study protein-ligand binding and unbinding mechanisms.", "date": "2024-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this work, the mechanism for the methanol to syngas reaction catalyzed by a Ru-PNP pincer complex has been studied using DFT and CCSD(T) calculations with methanol and toluene as the solvent. In the proposed mechanism, the CO is directly released from the methyl formate byproduct, forming a Ru-OCH3 intermediate. This reaction is preferred in toluene compared to methanol due to the lower polarity of the organic products and the lower stability of the Ru-alkoxy intermediates. This mechanism differs from previous proposals going through a Ru-CO2CH3 intermediate. The computed Gibbs free energy barriers for the different mechanisms were compared to experimental data using a microkinetic model coupled to a liquid-vapor batch reactor model designed from reported experimental setups. After refining the organic reaction thermodynamics consistent with CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ method corrections, only our proposed mechanism shows a good agreement with the experimental H2 and CO formation. Our findings herein demonstrate the usefulness of microkinetic modeling to support reaction mechanisms by direct comparison of computational and experimental data. In addition, the proposed mechanism rationalises the decarbonylation reaction in a way that can be easily extended to other carbonyl substrates and acid-base catalysts.

The simulations successfully capture the structural transition from low to high symmetry phases with rising temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. The phase transition initiates at two critical interfaces: the first is between the inorganic and organic layers, where the melting of N-H bonds in BA leads to significant reduction in hydrogen bonding between BA and iodides, and the second is at the interface between top and bottom organic layers, where the melting of the tail bonds in BA triggers the phase transition. Following this, BA cations exhibit a patterned and synchronized motion reminiscent of a conical pendulum, displaying a mix of ordered and disordered behaviors, prior to evolving into a completely molten and disordered state. While the melting of BA cations is the primary driver of the phase transition, the rotational dynamics of MA cations also plays a critical role in determining the phase transition temperature, influenced by the BA-MA interaction. Such interaction alters the polarization patterns of MA cations across the phase transition. In particular, an anti-parallel polarization pattern is observed in low temperature phase. Additionally, displacive elements of the phase transition are identified in the simulations, characterized by the shear and distortion of the inorganic octahedra. Notably, at lower temperatures, the octahedral distortion follows a bimodal distribution, reflecting significant variations in distortion among octahedra. This variation is attributed to an anisotropic hydrogen bonding network between iodides and BA cations.

This study reported a novel and unprecedented photoredox-catalyzed protocol for direct allylic C-H fluorosulfonylation of alkenes with FABI (1-fluorosulfonyl 2-aryl benzoimidazolium triflate salts). This mild protocol exhibited excellent compatibility with various functional groups, broad substrate scope, and promising scalability, enabling convenient access to a wide range of allyl sulfonyl fluorides with exceptional regioselectivity. The synthetic robustness of this strategy was further demonstrated by the late-stage functionalization of natural products and their further ligation with other drugs via SuFEx chemistry.

In synthesis planning, it is crucial to understand regioselectivity, or the preference of a reaction over competing reaction sites. Precisely predicting regioselectivity enables early exclusion of unproductive reactions and paves the way to designing high-yielding synthetic routes with minimal separation and material costs. However, it is still at emerging state to combine chemical knowledge and data-driven methods to make practical predictions for regioselectivity. At the same time, metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have profoundly transformed medicinal chemistry, and thus become one of the most frequently encountered types of reactions in synthesis planning. In this work, we for the first time introduce a chemical knowledge informed message passing neural network(MPNN) framework that directly identifies the intrinsic major products for metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with regioselective ambiguity. Integrating both first principle methods and data-driven methods, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96.51% on the test set of eight typical metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction types, including Suzuki-Miyaura, Stille, Sonogashira, Buchwald-Hartwig, Hiyama, Kumada, Negishi, and Heck reactions, outperforming other commonly used model types. To integrate electronic effects with steric effects in regioselectivity prediction, we propose a quantitative method to measure the steric hindrance effect. Our steric hindrance checker can successfully identify regioselectivity induced solely by steric hindrance. Notably under practical scenarios, our model outperforms 6 experimental organic chemists with an average working experience of over 10 years in the organic synthesis industry in terms of predicting major products in regioselective cases. We have also exemplified the practical usage of our model by fixing routes designed by open-access synthesis planning software and improving reactions by identifying low-cost starting materials.

We report, for the first time, a full structural dynamics study of human dUTPase by NMR. dUTPase has been investigated in terms of structural dynamics in its apo form, in complex with the modified substrate resistant to hydrolysis, 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-a,b-imido-triphosphate (dUpNHpp), as well as the product, 2'-deoxy-uridine-monophosphate (UMP). \nThe apo form of the enzyme displayed slow dynamics in the milli- to microsecond regime in relaxation dispersion experiments, which was further slowed down to observable heterogeneity upon substrate-analogue binding. The results suggest that the non-hydrolysable substrate-analogue traps the enzyme in the conformational isomerization step that has been previously suggested to be part of the enzyme catalysis kinetics cycle. The observed heterogeneity fits well with the pattern expected to emerge from the suggested kinetic model, and no evidence for homotropic allosterism was found.\n\nThe heatmaps of the slow dynamics, chemical shift perturbation upon substrate binding and conserved regions of the enzyme sequence all displayed a similar pattern, which suggests that the structural dynamics is finely tuned and important for the biological function of the enzyme for binding, conformational shift, catalysis and substrate release.

We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the elementary reaction of pyridine with excited nitrogen atoms, N(2D), aimed at providing information on the primary reaction products and their branching fractions (BFs). From previous\ncrossed molecular beam (CMB) experiments with mass-spectrometric detection and present synergistic calculations of the reactive potential energy surface (PES) and product BFs we have unveiled the reaction mechanism. It is found that the reaction proceeds via N(2D) barrierless\naddition to pyridine that, via bridged intermediates followed by N atom \u201csliding\u201d into the ring, leads to 7-membered ring structures. They further evolve, mainly via ring-contraction mechanisms toward 5-membered ring radical products and, to a smaller extent, via H-displacement mechanisms\ntoward 7-membered ring isomeric products and their isomers. Using the theoretical statistical estimates, an improved fit of the experimental data previously reported has been obtained leading to the following results for the dominant product channels: C4H4N (pyrrolyl) + HCN (BF = 0.61 +/- 0.20), C3H3N2 (1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl) + C2H2 (BF = 0.11 +/- 0.06), and C5H4N2 (7-membered ring molecules or pyrrole carbonitriles) + H (BF = 0.28 +/- 0.10).

Here, results from a combined experimental and computational study on four MgB2Se4 spinels (B = Sc, Y, Er, Tm) are presented. The room-temperature ionic conductivities (\u03c3ion = 2x10\u20135-7x10\u20135 S cm\u20131) of the spinels are accurately measured, as electron transport is effectively suppressed by purely Mg-ion conducting electrode interlayers.

We focused our study on DAD, an azobenzene derivative that, according to a previous experimental investigation, can restore visual function in blind mice due to trans-cis photoisomerization upon light absorption. With the present computational study, we aim to characterize the absorption spectrum of DAD, and to understand its photoisomerization mechanism by means of conformational search analysis, quantum mechanical (QM) and hybrid QM/continuum calculations, and classical molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we explored the effect of the derivation (DAD vs azobenzene), the protonation (DAD vs DADH22+, the two possible protonation states) and the solvation effects (vacuum vs water) on the photoisomerization. Similarly to azobenzene, we showed that the photoisomerization of both protonation states of DAD begin with the population of the bright S2 state. Then, it crosses to the S1 surface and relaxes along the rotation of the azo dihedral to a S1/S0 crossing point. The latter is close to a transition state that connects the trans and cis geometries on the ground state. Finally, our results suggested that amino derivation, non-protonation and water solvation could improve the quantum yield of the photoisomerization.", "date": "2024-08-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Of the fifteen known hCAs, human CA I (hCA I) is particularly abundant in erythrocytes, playing a critical role in CO2 transport. Despite extensive research on hCA I, the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly phosphorylation, on its catalytic activity and inhibitor binding remains poorly understood. Although multiple phosphorylation sites have been identified in hCA I in vivo through high-throughput proteomics studies including at the highly conserved Ser51 residue, the functional consequences of these modifications are not well characterized. We investigated the effects of a phosphomimic mutation at Ser51 on hCA I, examining its catalytic efficiency and susceptibility to inhibition by sulfonamides and anions. Using a recombinant expression system and a stopped-flow kinetic assay, we characterized the CO2 hydration activity and inhibition profiles of S51E hCA I compared to the wild type enzyme. Our results demonstrate that the S51E mutation increases the catalytic turnover rate (kcat) from 2.0 \u00d7 105 s-1 to 2.6 \u00d7 105 s-1 but significantly decreases substrate affinity, raising the Michaelis constant (KM) from 4.0 mM to 13.9 mM, reducing overall catalytic efficiency by over 50%. Inhibition studies with a panel of 41 sulfonamides revealed that the S51E mutation dramatically alters inhibitor sensitivity, particularly for the most effective inhibitors. For example, 15 of the 16 most effective sulfonamide inhibitors for hCA I (with KIs <350 nM) were an average of over 35-fold less effective in inhibiting S51E hCA I than the wild type. For example, the KI of the anticonvulsant zonisamide increased from 31 nM for the wild type hCA I to 4 \u00b5M. The inhibition profile with a panel of 37 small anions further indicated that the S51E mutant exhibited significantly reduced susceptibility to inhibition by 24 out of 37 tested anions, with some KI values increasing by up to 11,000-fold for inhibitors like hydrogen sulfide. This study underscores the significant impact that phosphorylation may have on hCA I function and inhibition. By characterizing the effects of phosphorylation on the CO2 hydration activity and inhibitor sensitivity of hCA I, these findings represent early steps in developing more selective proteoform-specific inhibitors, which could lead to more effective treatments for diseases involving carbonic anhydrases.", "date": "2024-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Glutathione (GSH) is a critical compound as it is highly concentrated intracellularly and can reduce and dissociate copper(II) from the ligand forming poorly redox-active copper(I)-thiolate clusters. Here we report that Cu-Phen2  speciation evolves in physiologically relevant GSH concentrations. Experimental and computational experiments suggest that at pH 7.4 mostly copper(I)-GSH clusters are formed, but a minor species of copper(I) bound to one Phen and forming ternary complexes with GSH (GS-Cu-Phen) is the redox active species, oxidizing quite efficiently GSH to GSSG and forming HO\u2022 radicals.

Moreover, allosteric cryptic pockets can become valuable for designing target-selective ligands when the natural ligand binding sites are conserved in variants of a protein. For example, before an allosteric cryptic pocket was discovered, KRAS was considered undruggable due to its smooth surface and conservation of the GDP/GTP binding pocket across the wild type and oncogenic isoforms. Recent identification of the Switch-II cryptic pocket in the KRASG12C mutant and FDA approval of anti-cancer drugs targeting this site underscores the importance of cryptic pockets in solving pharmaceutical challenges.

In this study, we explore the behavior of semi-core electrons in alkali fluorides (MF; M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) under compression using density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that semi-core p-orbitals in heavier alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) engage in bonding interactions in the B2 phase, forming metal-metal bonds even at low pressures (~1 GPa), while NaF requires much higher pressure (~28 GPa) for similar transitions. These findings suggest that alkali metals may exhibit a richer chemistry under pressure than previously thought, challenging the traditional core-valence distinction, and implying potential phase transitions driven by core-electron interactions.

While electronic effects serve as the dominant source of optical activity, there is a non-negligible contribution from nuclear vibrations, which changes with isotopic substitution. We employ a test set of 50 small organic molecules: three-membered rings with varying heteroatoms (PCl, PH, S, NCl, NH, O, NBr) and functional groups (Me, F), and simulations were run at the B3LYP/aug- cc-pVDZ level of theory. The objectives of this work are to determine locations of isotopic substitution that result in significant changes in the vibrational correction to the OR and to evaluate which vibrational modes and electronic response are the major contributors to the isotope effect. Molecules with more polarizable heteroatoms in the ring (e.g., S and P) have the largest change in the vibrational correction compared to the unsubstituted parent molecules. In many cases, isotopic substitution made to the hydrogens on the opposite side of the ring from the functional group provides the largest change in the OR. H/D wagging modes and C vibrations (for D\u2013C centers) are the largest contributors to the isotope effect. This is explained with a molecular orbital decomposition analysis of the OR. The relevant vibrational modes affect the orbital transitions that are already significant at the equilibrium geometry. However, this effect is only large when polarizable heteroatoms are involved, because the electron density surrounding them is diffuse enough to feel the subtle effect of change in mass due to isotopic substitution on the relevant vibrational modes.", "date": "2024-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Designing aqueous cascades outside of biology remains challenging due to the need to control multiple, sequential reactions in a single pot and manage the stability of reactive intermediates. Herein, we developed abiotic cascades using aminoacyl phosphate esters, the synthetic counterparts of biological aminoacyl adenylates, to drive sequential chemical reactions and self-assembly in a single pot. We demonstrated that the structural elements of amino acid side chains (aromatic versus aliphatic) significantly influence the reactivity and half-lives of aminoacyl phosphate esters, ranging from hours to days. This behavior, in turn, affects the number of couplings we can achieve in the network and the self-assembly propensity of activated intermediate structures. The cascades are constructed using bifunctional peptide substrates featuring side chain nucleophiles. Specifically, aromatic amino acids facilitate the formation of transient thioesters, which preorganized into spherical aggregates and further couple into chimeric assemblies composed of esters and thioesters. In contrast, aliphatic amino acids, which lack the ability to form such structures, predominantly lead to hydrolysis, bypassing elongation after thioester formation. Additionally, in mixtures containing multiple aminoacyl phosphate esters and peptide substrates, we achieved selective product formation by following a distinct pathway that favors elongation through self-assembly. By coupling chemical reactions using molecules with varying reactivity timescales, we can drive multiple reaction clocks with distinct lifetimes and self-assembly dynamics, thereby facilitating precise temporal and structural regulation.", "date": "2024-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This approach eliminates the need for water resources and reduces environmental pollution associated with traditional hydrogen production methods. It is particularly well-suited for humid environments. Currently, direct hydrogen production from air involves first capturing water using hygroscopic materials, followed by regeneration processes such as light or heat to obtain high-purity water. However, commonly used solid hygroscopic gels, despite their excellent moisture absorption properties, are limited by their inherent volume and water-holding capacity, making continuous water extraction from air and subsequent hydrogen production challenging. Here, we propose a straightforward method using a continuously flowing hygroscopic solution to achieve continuous water extraction from air for hydrogen production. We used a highly concentrated LiCl solution to capture moisture from the air, resulting in a water-enriched, lower-concentration LiCl solution. This water-enriched LiCl solution was then subjected to low-temperature membrane distillation (<333K), where water was transferred through a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane to an electrolytic cell and subsequently split into hydrogen and oxygen, effectively converting moisture from the air into hydrogen energy. We demonstrated and validated the method's ability to continuously extract moisture from the air and produce hydrogen for 100 hours in both alkaline electrolytic cells and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolytic cells. This work offers new insights into direct hydrogen production from air.

As the reaction pro-gresses, generated lactic acid further catalyzes ester hydrolysis, while the rate of the reverse esterification reaction also increases with the accumulation of acid product. The reaction sequence of lactate hydrolysis is described in three kinetic stages: initiation/neutral hydrolysis, autocatalytic hydrolysis, and equilibrium. The evolution of lactate hydrolysis was measured for varying temperatures (1.5 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C) and initial concentrations of methyl or ethyl lactate (1 to 40 mol%) to quantify the kinetic transitions between reac-tion stages. Lower temperatures resulted in a distinct induction period where negligible hydrolysis was observed. The effect of initial concentration on the length of the induction period was non-monotonic and was divided into dilute (below about 6 mol% lactate) and concentrated (above about 6 mol%) regimes. Solutions of either lower or higher lactate concentration corresponded to longer induction periods and slower reactions. A dual kinetic regime best describes the observed hydrolysis behavior. For hydrolysis of alkyl lactates below 10 mol%, a rate law derived from the conventional ester hydrolysis mechanism effec-tively modeled behavior, while at higher lactate concentrations, an additional water molecule must be in-cluded in the rate-determining step to appropriately capture the hydrolysis behavior.", "date": "2024-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

N,N\u2019-bis(2-phenylethyl)-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide (EP-PDI) is a promising SF chromophore due to its photostability, large extinction coefficient, and high triplet yield, but the energy transport mechanisms in EP-PDI solids are minimally understood. Herein, we use transient absorption microscopy to directly characterize exciton transport in EP-PDI crystals. We find evidence for singlet-mediated transport in which pairs of triplet excitons undergo triplet fusion (TF), producing spin-singlet excitons that rapidly diffuse. This interchange of singlet and triplet excitons shuttles triplets as far as 205 nm within the first 500 ps after photoexcitation. This enhanced transport comes at a cost, however, as it necessitates favoring triplet recombination and thus requires a fine-tuning of SF dynamics to balance triplet yields with triplet transport lengths. Through numerical modeling, we predict that tuning the ratio of SF and TF rate constants, k_SF/k_TF, to between 1.9 and 3.8 allows for an optimized triplet transport length (425 \u2013 563 nm) with minimal loss (7 \u2013 10%) in triplet yield. Interestingly, by adjusting the size of EP-PDI crystals we find we can subtly tune their crystal structure and thereby alter their SF and TF rates. By slowing SF within small EP-PDI crystals, we are able to boost their triplet transport length by ~20%. Although counter-intuitive, our work suggests that slowing SF by introducing moderate structural distortions can be preferential when optimizing triplet exciton transport, provided singlet exciton transport is not significantly hindered.", "date": "2024-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show, however, that the stability and cation-driven tunability of the tiara-based heterobimetallic species are quite similar to those previously measured for crown-based species. Consequently, the tiara motif appears to be at least as equally useful for constructing tunable multimetallic species as the more commonly encountered crown motif.

However, the low gastrointestinal stability of the endogenous OTR peptide ligand oxytocin (OT) is a crucial bottleneck for therapeutic development. Here, we report the rational development of the first series of fully gut-stable and potent OT analogues, laying the foundation for a new area of oral and gut-specific peptide therapeutics. Compound optimisation guided by systematic structure-gut-stability-activity relationship analysis yielded highly stable analogues (t1/2 >24 h, compared to t1/2 <10 min of OT in intestinal fluid) equipotent to native OT (~3 nM) and with enhanced selectivity for OTR. Colon-targeted local luminal administration of the lead compound significantly reduced colonic mechanical hypersensitivity in a concentration-dependent manner in an in vivo mouse model of chronic abdominal pain. Moreover, oral administration of the lead compound also significantly reduced colonic mechanical hypersensitivity in this abdominal pain model.

Recent reports on coral-derived terpene synthases (TSs) have confirmed that corals are indeed the primary producers of coral terpenoids, pointing us towards a solution for the low supply issue. However, only a few coral TSs have been functionally identified, lacking comprehensive studies on their mechanisms, phylogenetic relationships, and engineering applications. To address these gaps, we conducted genome mining to discover and study all TSs within the genome of the sea whip coral, Paramuricea clavata. We performed isotope labeling, protein crystallography, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations-guided mutations, particularly focusing on a biflorane synthase, PcTS1. These multifaceted experiments have elucidated the catalytic mechanisms of PcTS1 in detail. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis of coral TSs, which are crucial for the biosynthesis of structurally related terpene skeletons such as biflorane, eunicellane, and cembrane, has provided significant insights into the evolutionary development of terpene scaffolds. Based on these insights, we have applied evolution-based engineering efforts to PcTS1, successfully producing new terpene structures that are related to its mechanistic intermediates. This research not only establishes a connection between the chemical diversity of terpenes and coral genomes but also enhances our understanding of coral TSs from both mechanistic and evolutionary perspectives.

This oxidation has been proposed to be dependent on either O2 or H2O2 as co-substrate. Theoretical investigations have previously supported both mechanisms, although this contrasts with recent experiments. A possible explanation is that the theoretical results critically depend on how the Cu active site is modeled, i.e., which second-sphere residues were included in the QM region. This has also led to different results even when employing only H2O2 as co-substrate. In this paper, we investigate both the O2- and H2O2-driven pathways, employing LsAA9 as the underlying LPMO and a theoretical model based on a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) framework. We ensure to consistently include all residues known to be important by using extensive QM regions. We also investigate several conformers that can partly explain the differences seen in previous studies.

Depending on the rate of chemiexcitation, light emission can occur as a long-lasting, low-intensity, glow-type reaction or a rapid, highly intense flash-type reaction. Assays using a flash-type mode of action provide enhanced detection sensitivity compared to those using a glow-type mode. Recently, our group discovered that applying spiro-strain to 1,2-dioxetanes significantly increases their chemiexcitation rate, thereby transforming glow-type chemiluminescence into flash-type chemiluminescence. However, further examination of the structure-activity relationships revealed that the spiro-strain severely compromises the chemical stability of the 1,2-dioxetanes. We hypothesized that a combination of spiro-strain, steric hindrance, and an electron-withdrawing effect, will result in a chemically stable spiro-strained dioxetane with an accelerated chemiexcitation rate. Indeed, spiro-fused tetramethyl-oxetanyl exhibited a 128-fold faster chemiexcitation rate compared to adamantyl while maintaining similar chemical stability, with a half-life of over 400 hours in PBS 7.4 buffer at room temperature. Turn-on probes composed of tetramethyl-oxetanyl spiro-dioxetane exhibited significantly improved chemical stability in bacterial and mammalian cell media compared to previously developed dioxetane probes fused to a cyclobutyl unit. The superior chemical stability enables a tetramethyl-oxetanyl dioxetane probe to detect \u03b2-gal activity with enhanced sensitivity in E. coli bacterial assays and leucine aminopeptidase activity in tumoral cell lines. Overall, the development of the tetramethyl-oxetanyl dioxetane luminophore enables us to enhance the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescent probes while maintaining high chemical stability. The results obtained in this study should assist in designing of improved chemiluminescent probes and underscore the significance of strain-release techniques in enhancing the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescence assays.\n\n", "date": "2024-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Understanding the catalytic mechanism of these urethanases is crucial for enhancing their enzymatic activity and improving PU bio-recycling processes. In this study, we employed hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods to delve into the catalytic machinery of the UMG-SP2 urethanase in breaking down a model PU substrate. Our results indicate that the reaction proceeds in two stages: STAGE 1 acylation, in which the enzyme becomes covalently bound to the PU substrate, releasing an alcohol-leaving group; STAGE 2 - deacylation, in which a catalytic water hydrolyzes the enzyme:ligand covalent adduct, releasing the product in the form of a highly unstable carbamic acid, expected to rapidly decompose into an amine and carbon dioxide. We found that STAGE 1 comprises the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction, consisting of the cleavage of the substrate\u2019s urethane bond by its ester moiety and the release of the alcohol-leaving group (overall Gibbs activation energy of 20.8 kcal\u00b7mol-1). Lastly, we identified point mutations that are expected to enhance the enzyme's turnover for the hydrolysis of urethane bonds by stabilizing the macrodipole of the rate-limiting transition state.

In this work we focus on efficiently capturing global interactions ``in-model'', through long-range edge attentions with minimal memory footprints. We introduce a novel ``contextual'' message passing scheme that better captures global interactions by attending on edges from both the local and global environment of each node in an edge-update fashion. The performance of the proposed model (LiCOMPGNN) is tested on a diverse set of materials property prediction benchmarks and demonstrates competitiveness against state-of-the-art models in several prediction tasks whilst being an order of magnitude smaller in terms of trainable parameters. We further augment the framework to a multiplex graph setting for solid-state data with reciprocal space features taken into account in a multimodal message passing regime. We demonstrate the representation capacity of the proposed variant along with others in maintaining supercell invariance in crystalline property prediction tasks.

Hence, density inherently becomes mother of all properties of the matter. The Archimedes' density method presents a mathematically unsolvable, computationally non-recursive, and undecidable NP-Hard problem for non-binary alloys. Resolving underdetermined linear equations, discretizing infinite Probable Iso-density Compositions (PICs), solving NP-Hard problems, and achieving certainty from probabilities are key to its application. Non-binary alloy densities reveal multiple PIC series interconnected through \"True Composition\" (TC) in the Isopycnic Region (IR) of Vast Alloys Space (VAS), replicating as Concordant Compositions (CCs) similar to centromere replication during cell division. The Principle of Vernier coincidence in multiple dimensions echoes CCs as unique alloy fingerprints in geometrical superimposition. We modified Archimedes' equations for additional metals and developed Density Decoding System (DDS) (www.densityfingerprinting.com) to compute PICs using Successively increasing Predefined Imaginary Numerical values (SPIN-values) and standard metal densities, generating a real-time database. A perfectly symmetric C-band breaks the asymmetry of Density Genome fractals, visualizing Density Fingerprints to conclusively determine \"True Composition\" up to octonary alloys with absolute accuracy in polynomial time. The precision range of alloy density limits the chaotic Butterfly effect, creating a fractal composition space that enables self-authentication of True Compositions. The study uncovers the coexistence of chaos and order, the butterfly effect, the emergence of order from infinity, and the fractal nature of the composition space. The research reveals the manifestation of quantum-like phenomena in the classical realm of alloy compositions, challenging our understanding of the nature of matter. Our work unveils density as the genetic code for non-living matter, leading to a novel alloy classification into binary and non-binary alloys.

A onedimensional steady-state numerical model incorporating gas and liquid phase mechanisms of HMX was developed and validated against experimental data. This model enables a thorough sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of various parameters, including the reaction constant (k) of each elementary reaction, enthalpy of formation (hf), entropy (s), heat capacity (cp), collision diameter (\u03c3), and potential well-depth (\u03b5) of each species, on key combustion characteristics over a wide range of pressure. The analysis revealed that gas kinetics predominantly govern the HMX combustion compared to the liquid kinetics, particularly at high pressures.

However, Ti-MOFs remain still one of the least developed sub-class of MOF materials because of the complexity of titanium chemistry in solution hampering their rational design, despite recent progresses. Here, we present a new microporous Ti-MOFs with acs topology, labeled MIP-209(Ti) (MIP stands for Materials from Institute of Porous Materials of Paris) constructed by a nitro terephthalate ligand and Ti12O15 oxo-clusters, as revealed by continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED). MIP-209(Ti) can be obtained using various terephthalate (1,4-BDC2-) derivatives such as NO2-BDC and 2Cl-BDC using an eco-friendly solvent, suggesting the ability of Ti12-MOFs for isostructural chemistry. Alternatively, it is also possible to tune the composition of its Ti-oxo-cluster, similarly to MIP-177(Ti)-LT bearing the same Ti12O15 sub-unit. Typically, low percentage Cr3+ doping (\u2264 5 at%) in MIP-209(Ti) favorably enhances the water stability. Interestingly, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting reaction (HER) were measured for MIP-209(Ti-Cr)-NO2 and a significant hydrogen production rate, with good reusability and stability under simulated solar light irradiation, were revealed. It showed enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production performances under simulated solar light irradiation compared to the benchmark Ti-MOF IEF-11 with a fourfold enhanced hydrogen production in HER in 5h in presence of methanol (5812 \u00b5mol of H2/gcat against 1391 \u00b5mol of H2/gcat) as well as, without any noble metal co-catalyst, a 6-fold enhanced overall water splitting production (681 and 325 \u00b5mol/gcat of H2 and O2, respectively for MIP-209, against 94 and 53 \u00b5mol/gcat of H2 and O2, respectively, for IEF-11).

Yet, subtle substrate changes can significantly alter reaction pathways. The asymmetric Rh(I)-catalyzed Pauson-Khand reaction (PKR) exemplifies such a reaction, being hindered by a narrow substrate scope and competing reactivity modes. In this study, we identified parameters predictive of yield and enantioselectivity in the catalyst-controlled asymmetric PKR, using 1,6-enynes with a 2,2-disubstituted alkene. In this way, ring-fused cyclopentenones can be formed with chiral quaternary carbon centers. Using bisphosphine ligand parameters from palladium complexes, including HOMO energy and the angle formed by the phosphorous aryl groups on the ligand, we established strong correlations with experimental % ee (R2=0.94 and 0.98) for two distinct precursors. Solvent dipole moments correlated with % ee for high dipole moment precursors (R2=0.97), while Abraham\u2019s hydrogen bond basicity is more relevant for low dipole moment precursors (R2=0.93). Additionally, counterions were found to have a significant impact on PKR reactivity and selectivity, as does the steric demand of the alkyne substituent of the enyne precursor. In the latter case, %ee correlates with Sterimol B1 values for products with different alkyne substituents (R2=0.96). Furthermore, the computed C\u2261C wavenumber of the enyne precursor can be directly aligned with the yield of the asymmetric PKR.

This often restricts efficiency and product selectivity, since requirements may deviate for electrochemical- (catalyst activation) and chemical (organic synthesis) steps, as well as for paired anode- and cathode reactions. Breaking this barrier, we report ex situ electro-organic synthesis as a versatile method that enables unique product selectivity and unusual product pairs. We exemplify the concept for pairing H2 evolution (HER) with anodic alcohol oxidation. The two-step method accomplishes this by separating cathode reactions from organic substrate oxidation, and anodic electrocatalyst activation from chemical conversion of organic substrates in time and space. First, the electro-oxidation of Ni(OH)2 anodes to NiOOH is paired with H2 production by alkaline water electrolysis. Then, \u201ccharged\u201d NiOOH electrodes are removed from the electrolyzer and used in external vessels to oxidize model substrate benzyl alcohol under regeneration of Ni(OH)2. Free choice of reaction media outside the electrolyzer allows to selectively obtain benzoic acid (in water) or benzaldehyde (in n-hexane), whereas classic in situ electrosynthesis only produces the acid together with H2. Perspectively, the method enables electrosynthesis of previously inaccessible products paired to H2 generation.", "date": "2024-08-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We overcome this limitation by screening hypothetical ultrastable MOFs that have predicted high thermal and activation stability, as judged by machine learning (ML) models trained on experimental measures of stability. We enhance this set by computing the bulk modulus as a measure of mechanical stability and filter 1,102 mechanically robust hypothetical MOFs from a database of ultrastable MOFs (USMOF DB). Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations are then employed to examine the gas adsorption properties of these hypothetical MOFs, alongside a database of experimental MOFs. We identify privileged building blocks that allow MOFs in USMOF DB to show exceptional working capacities compared to the experimental MOFs. We interpret these differences by training ML models on CO2 and CH4 adsorption in these databases, showing how poor model transferability between datasets indicates that novel design rules can be derived from USMOF DB that would not have been gathered through assessment of structurally characterized MOFs.

Copolymers comprising of lipophilic cations and neutral hydrophilic co-monomers effectively complex and deliver bulky nucleic acid payloads such as plasmids (pDNA). In this work, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of lipophilic cations governs the complexation pathways, serum stability, and biological performance of polymer\u2013pDNA complexes (polyplexes). Hitherto, investigators focused predominantly on block and statistical copolymers while largely ignoring gradient copolymers, where the density of lipophilic cations diminishes (gradually or steeply) along polymer backbones. Our goal is to engineer gradient copolymers that combine the colloidal stability of polyplexes formed from block copolymers with the high transfection efficacy of statistical copolymers. We synthesized length- and compositionally-equivalent gradient copolymers (G1\u2013G3) via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization in addition to equivalent statistical (S) and block (B) copolymers. We mapped microstructure-dependent differences in pDNA loading per polyplex, pDNA conformational changes, and polymer\u2013pDNA binding thermodynamics via static light scattering, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry, respectively. B exhibited vastly different pDNA complexation profiles from the other four copolymers while loading the most pDNA per polyplex. Further, we discovered that subtle modulation of gradient steepness effectively negotiates trade-offs among pDNA delivery efficiency, cytotoxicity, and colloidal stability in serum.  For instance, G1 overcame the colloidal instability of S polyplexes in serum, while maintaining comparable transfection efficiency and cell viability. Microstructural contrasts did not elicit differences in complement activation but governed polycation-triggered hemolysis.

Discovery of novel materials could be transformative for these fields. In the past few decades, the computational science community has developed crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods with the goal to find the exact symmetry-constrained atomic arrangements in the periodic unit cell, which are globally and/or locally energetically favorable: finding the globally minimal or locally minimal crystal structure for a given chemical formula. The implementation of CSP typically involves an iteration procedure with at least two components: the sampling of the potential energy surface (PES) for generating raw/unrelaxed crystal structures, and the subsequent local energy minimization of generated structures. The latter part is typically carried out through computationally expensive density functional (DFT) calculations. A non-exhaustive but representative list of available CSP codes includes USPEX, CALYPSO, AIRSS, XtalOpt, IM2ODE; due to the nature of DFT calculations, this CSP process can be very time-consuming. Recent rapid advances of pre-trained machine-learning interatomic potentials (ML-IAPs) based on data from DFT calculations, such as, M3GNet, CHGNet and MACE (amongst others) have significantly accelerated the process of local energy minimization but have not thoroughly been tested on CSP tasks. The realization of local energy minimization using ML-IAPs, referred to as pre-relaxation when compared with using DFT calculations, plays a critical role in the CSP implementation. We present here, CrySPR, which stands for Crystal Structure Pre-Relaxation and PRediction, which is specifically designed to serve as a Python package that provides user-friendly application programming interfaces (APIs), functionalities and utilities for crystal structure generation, pre-relaxation of structures using ML-IAPs and structure prediction.

Moreover, this variant was also improved regarding activity and enantioselectivity in the ring opening of cyclohexene oxide with other nucleophiles, demonstrating even inverted enantioselectivity with cyanide and cyanate. In contrast, a complete loop deletion yielded inactive enzyme. Concomitant computational analyses of HheG M45F in comparison to wild type enzyme revealed that mutation M45F promotes the productive binding of cyclohexene oxide and azide in the active site by establishing non-covalent C-H \u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions between epoxide and F45. These interactions further position one of the two carbon atoms of the epoxide ring closer to the azide resulting in higher enantioselectivity. Additionally, stable and enantioselective cross-linked enzyme cystals of HheG M45F were successfully generated after combination with mutation D114C.

Starting from [(\u03b76-cymene)RuCl2]2 and 1-E, ligand cyclization reactions (via attack of one iPr2E moiety at the alkyne) were observed and found to afford cyclic aryl ylidic mesoionic carbenes (2-E). Attempts to ring-open these complexes were unsuccessful for E = P, but found to proceed smoothly for E = As, which led to the isolation of cis-[AsCCAs]RuCl2(MeCN) (3-As). To also gain access to the corresponding [PCCP]-coordinated derivative (3-P), the reactions between 1-E (E = P, As) and cis-(MeCN)2(COD)RuCl2 \u2219 2 MeCN were examined, which led to the envisioned complexes 3-E for E = As and E = P. Compounds cis-[ECCE]RuCl2(MeCN) (3-E) and their carbonyl derivatives cis-[ECCE]RuCl2(CO) (5-E) were oxidized using PhICl2, which led to an oxidative dichlorination of the alkyne in the case of 5-E. The latter dichlorination was found to occur trans-selective to afford complexes of the type [trans-E(Cl)C=C(Cl)E]RuCl2(CO) (6-E), while unselective oxidation processes set in upon treatment of 3-E with PhICl2. Although the envisioned Ru(III) complexes [ECCE]RuCl3 (7-E) were detectable for E = P and E = As, only the arsa-derivative 7-As was obtained in a pure form, namely via oxidation of cis-[ECCE]RuCl2(THT) (8), which is accessible for E = As only. Upon reduction of compounds 3-E, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) \u03b72-alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (9), was obtained for E = P, while multi-ple attempts to also isolate the corresponding arsa-derivative met with failure. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (9) was characterized comprehensibly and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of 9 with TlPF6, a diamagnetic \u00b5-Tl-bridged compound (10) with a nearly linear Ru\u2212Tl\u2212Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru\u2212Tl\u2212Ru moiety in 10 is best interpreted in terms of a 3c-4e\u2212 bond.

McEwan; Rebecca Beveridge", "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are important drug targets as they are key actors within cell signalling networks. Accordingly, their dysregulation is highly implicated in a range of disease states. However, the conformational plasticity of IDPs renders them challenging to characterise both experimentally and theoretically, which is a major bottleneck in the development of small molecule drugs that bind to IDPs and modulate how they behave. In relation to this, ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a useful tool in the investigation of IDPs, as it can reveal their conformational preferences when they are ionised from different conditions. It also has the potential to offer important insight to the drug discovery field as it can measure binding stoichiometry and unveil conformational shifts of IDPs exerted by the binding of small drug-like molecules, which will affect their associated pharmacology. In the current study, we have used IM-MS to investigate the effect of drug lead EPI-001 on the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the Androgen Receptor (AR-NTD). Despite structural heterogeneity rendering the NTD a challenging region of the protein to drug, this domain is responsible for most, if not all, of the transcriptional activity. We quantify the stoichiometry of EPI-001 binding to various constructs that correspond to functional domains of the AR-NTD, and show that it binds to separate constructs containing transactivation unit (TAU)-1 and TAU-5, respectively, and that 1-2 molecules bind to a larger construct containing both sequences. We also identify a conformational shift upon EPI-001 binding to the TAU-5 containing construct, and only to a much lesser extent with TAU-1. This work provides novel insight on the interactions of EPI-001 with the AR-NTD, and the structural alterations that it exerts, and positions IM-MS as an informative tool that will enhance the tractability of IDPs, potentially leading to better therapies.", "date": "2024-08-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Biomaterials are now required to have surfaces with multifunctionality such as favorable tissue integration and the ability to combat bacterial adhesion and colonization. Herein, we report on a simple approach to improving the antibacterial properties of zirconia nanotubes (ZrNT) coatings via decoration with silver nanoparticles (AgNp/Ag2O). This was done by electrochemical anodization of Zr-Ag alloy at a constant voltage in a fluoride-containing electrolyte. The modified ZrNTs were characterized using SEM, EDS, ToF \u2013 SIMS, and XPS to determine their structural morphology and chemical composition, and were further subjected to antibacterial testing The silver and zirconium ion release behavior was also monitored via ICP-MS. ZrNT decorated with AgNp/Ag2O exhibited strong antimicrobial activity (> 99 % bacterial killing) against both S. aureus and E. coli. Antimicrobial tests indicated that the antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive pathogen S. aureus could be improved by a factor of 100 compared to unmodified ZrNT while the unmodified ZrNT showed already a comparable reduction of viable Gram-negative E. coli achieved with the additional AgNp/Ag2O decoration. This modification strategy illustrates a simplified and effective approach toward optimizing the interface between the host environment and the biomaterial surface to meet the very important criteria of biocompatibility and antibacterial properties.

These property predictors hold significant potential in accelerating drug discovery by guiding generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents to explore desired chemical spaces. However, they often struggle to generalize due to the limited scope of the training data. When optimized by generative agents, this limitation can result in the generation of molecules with artificially high predicted probabilities of satisfying target properties, which subsequently fail experimental validation. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive approach that integrates active learning (AL) and iterative feedback to refine property predictors, thereby improving the outcomes of their optimization by generative AI agents. Our method leverages the Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG) criterion to select additional molecules for evaluation by an oracle. This process aims to provide the greatest reduction in predictive uncertainty, enabling more accurate model evaluations of subsequently generated molecules. Recognizing the impracticality of immediate wet-lab or physics-based experiments due to time and logistical constraints, we propose leveraging human experts for their cost-effectiveness and domain knowledge to effectively augment property predictors, bridging gaps in the limited training data. Empirical evaluations through both simulated and real human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our approach refines property predictors to better align with oracle assessments.

What drives structure-activity relationship and in vivo stability for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)? These interrelated questions are increasingly relevant due to the re-emerging importance of ADCs as an impactful therapeutic modality and the gaps that exist in our understanding of ADC structural determinants that underlie ADC in vivo stability. Complex macromolecules, such as ADCs may undergo changes in vivo due to their intricate structure as biotransformations may occur on the linker, the payload and/or at the modified conjugation site. Furthermore, dissection of ADC metabolism presents a substantial analytical challenge due to the difficulty in identification or quantification of minor changes on a large macromolecule. We employed immunocapture-LCMS methods to evaluate in vivo changes in drug-antibody ratio (DAR) profile in four different lead ADCs. This comprehensive characterization revealed that a critical structural determinant contributing to ADC design was the selection of the linker as the competition between the retro-Michael deconjugation and thio-succinimide hydrolysis reactions resulted in superb conjugation stability in vivo. These data, in conjunction with additional factors, informed the selection of AZD8205, a B7-H4-directed cysteine-conjugated ADC bearing a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, with durable DAR, currently being studied in the clinic for the potential treatment of solid malignancies (NCT05123482).

Through the inherent transformation of chemical to mechanical energy, the fluids can be driven to flow within the confined domains. Through fluid-structure interactions, the confining walls in turn are deformed by and affect this fluid flow. Imbuing synthetic materials with analogous feedback among chemo-mechanical, hydrodynamic and fluid-structure interactions could enable materials to perform self-driven communication and self-regulation. Herein, we develop computational models to determine how chemo-hydro-mechanical feedback affects interactions in biomimetic arrays of chemically active and passive micro-posts anchored in fluid-filled chambers. Once activated, the enzymatic reactions trigger the latter feedback, which generates a surprising variety of long-range, cooperative motion, including self-oscillations and non-reciprocal interactions, which are vital for propagating coherent, directional signals over net distances in fluids. In particular, the array propagates a distinct message; each post interprets the message; and the system responds with a specific mode of organized, collective behavior. This level of autonomous, remote control is relatively rare in synthetic systems, particularly as this system operates without external electronics or power sources and only requires the addition of chemical reactants to function.

However, a rigorous atomic-scale mechanistic explanation is needed. Doping also affects s_ion by modifying ion mobility - an effect that is not well understood and often overlooked. We use first-principles defect calculations to mechanistically explain and quantify the increase/decrease in Na vacancy concentration due to aliovalent doping of Na3SbS4. By focusing on isovalent doping, we reveal local and global structural effects of doping on the migration barrier, and therefore, ion mobility. In conjunction with experiments, we demonstrate the interplay between the local and global effects. Doping with heavier anions to achieve more polarizable frameworks is a common approach to enhancing s_ion. Our findings present a unique approach to enhancing s_ion by doping with smaller and lighter cations that form stiffer bonds with anions, which in turn soften the parent framework.", "date": "2024-08-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Theory - Computational; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Additionally, we show that SCINS can result in chemically intuitive grouping of medium-sized sets of bioactive compounds, which can be useful in compound selection from virtual screening campaigns as well as post- processing of experimental hit lists.

Benzazirines, which have the exceptional feature to react via two competitive QMT pathways, were used as model compounds. Three novel derivatives with increasingly stronger electron-donating substituents at C4 [R = OH, N(CH3)2, and N(CH2)4] were generated in argon matrices at 3 K. Remarkably, different QMT selectivities were observed in all benzazirines. As the electron-donating strength of the substituent increases, the QMT ring-opening to nitrene starts to compete with the QMT ring-expansion to ketenimine, becoming the dominant process for the strongest electron-donating substituent [N(CH2)4]. A theoretical analysis of the substituent effects on the QMT reactivity of benzazirines was performed and compared with the experimental data for these and other C4 derivatives.

Several current hypotheses, based on modern geochemical observations, suggest that hydrothermal fields and their associated clays could have provided such environments. My work expands on current prebiotic theories regarding the origins of high potassium concentrations by providing a geochemical basis for the empirical observations proposed by other authors. Here, I show how abiotic enrichment in potassium can occur during the acidic alteration of a wide range of aluminum silicate rocks through the formation of alum salts (KAl(SO4)2\u202212H2O).

In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic linear program to analyze the optimal operation of an integrated sugarcane mill that also produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using historical time-series commodities price data. We find currently available alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technologies require a premium price of 1.25 $ L\u22121 (6.46 R$ L\u22121) to incentivize bio-jet fuel production from sugarcane. This incentive can be reduced to 0.5 $ L\u22121 (2.58 R$ L\u22121) with emerging ATJ technologies that are undergoing scale-up. Via sensitivity analysis, we also quantify the impact of ATJ conversion, operating costs, and incentives on the fraction of weeks bio-fuel production is favorable to further guide technology and policy development. Currently, sugarcane mills are operated with little flexibility due to the structure of the Brazilian market. We estimate that a hypothetical, fully flexible sugarcane mill could gain up to 6 million R$ per year in profit; most of this value comes from the flexible operation of the ATJ process, which motivates standalone upgrading facilities. Finally, we show how analyzing the optimality conditions of the integrated sugarcane mill allows for easy communication of optimal behavior in terms of relative product prices. These results provide a basis to guide bio-jet fuel policy and technology development in the context of Brazil, and these ideas can be extended to develop bio-jet fuel capacity and supply chains globally.", "date": "2024-08-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To identify an orientational landscape of CH\u2013pi  interactions, we constructed a dataset of close contacts formed between beta-D-galactose residues and the aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, across crystallographic structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. We carried out quantum mechanical calculations to quantify their interaction strengths. The data indicate that tryptophan-containing CH\u2013pi interactions have more favorable interaction energies than those formed by tyrosine or phenylalanine. The energetic differences between these amino acids are caused by the aromatic ring system electronics and size. We use individual distance and angle features to train random forest models to successfully predict the first-principles computed energetics of CH\u2013pi interactions.

These simulations have played a pivotal role in uncovering both the structural and functional characteristics of biomolecules, particularly proteins, through sophisticated molecular modeling techniques. However, the comprehensive understanding of molecular functions hinges on the ability to thoroughly explore their conformational space. Despite the power of MD simulations, complex systems such as proteins often present challenges, as they can become trapped in local energy minima within the rugged free energy landscape. While recent advancements in hardware and distributed computing platforms have enabled longer simulations and the study of protein folding in explicit solvents, conventional MD simulations still face difficulties in adequately sampling protein configuration space due to this trapping phenomenon. To address this issue, generalized ensemble (GE) sampling algorithms like the replica exchange method (REM) and simulated tempering (ST) have been developed. These algorithms facilitate the exploration of conformational space by inducing a random walk in temperature space within an expanded ensemble. By enabling the exchange of conformations between different temperature replicas, these algorithms can help facilitate the escape from local energy minima, particularly at higher temperatures where thermal fluctuations are more pronounced. These temperature-based GE algorithms are widely employed in simulating proteins and other biological macromolecules. In this chapter, we provide an overview of replica exchange methods, followed by a detailed discussion of Hamiltonian-based replica exchange methods, with a particular focus on replica exchange with solute tempering (REST), REST2 and their variants, including generalized REST (gREST) and replica exchange with hybrid tempering (REHT).

A possible solution is to shift production pathways to use biomass, which is a sustainable feedstock and can sequester armo- spheric carbon dioxide. This study presents an optimization-based pathway analysis framework for evaluating the carbon footprints of the production of mainstream plastics from biomass and fossil feedstocks. We use the modeling framework to quickly navigate complex interdependen- cies that exist between the production pathways of different plastics and to determine pathways of minimum production cost under a range of carbon pricing scenarios. The framework interprets carbon prices as an exogenous taxation scheme or as an endogenous negative value perceived by producers. The proposed approach reveals biomass feedstock quantities needed to displace fossil counterparts and reveals plastics and technologies that should be prioritized. The frame- work can also be used for evaluating system-wide trade-offs between production costs and carbon footprints that arise from pathway interdependencies. We also evaluate hidden environmental impacts associated with the large-scale use biomass as a feedstock, such as land use and water eutrophication that results from significant increase in fertilizer use.

Starting from the Heitler-London expression of the exchange-repulsion energy, Exr, we investigate how it can be partitioned into physically relevant and comprehensible contributions. We demonstrate that a division of Exr into a positive kinetic and a negative potential part is possible. However, these contributions correlate only poorly with the actual exchange-repulsion energy. A meaningful partitioning of Exr is derived, where the kinetic energy contribution belongs to a term that vanishes for exact Hartree-Fock wave functions.  The remaining pure potential energy terms are distinguished into an exchange integral contribution, Exi, as well as contributions to the repulsion-energy with two, three and four orbital indices (Exr2, Exr3, and Exr4).   Qualitative explanations of these terms and their physical origin are proposed. The forms, relationships and absolute sizes of the four parts of Exr suggest an intuitive partitioning of the exchange-repulsion energy into orbital-pair contributions. Insight into the analytic form and quantitative size of the contributions to Exr is provided by considering the 3Sigma+u (1sigma g 1sigma u) state of the H2 molecule, the water dimer, as well as an argon atom interacting with Cl2 and N2.

Multicomponent approaches allow for the targeted simulation of electrons together with other fermions (most commonly protons) as quantum particles. These methods have become increasingly popular over the last years, particularly for the description of nuclear quantum effects (in strong hydrogen bonds, proton tunneling, and many more). However, most implementations are still based on canonical formulations of wave function theory, which we know for decades to be computationally inefficient for capturing dynamical correlation effects. Local correlation approaches, particularly with the use of pair natural orbitals (PNOs), enable asymptotically linear scaling of computational costs with very little impact on the overall accuracy. In this context, the efficient use of density fitting approximations in the integrals calculation proves essential. We start by discussing our implementation of density-fitted NEO-MP2 and NEO-PNO-LMP2, upgrading the electronic correlation treatment up to PNO local coupled cluster.

Here, we manipulate the meta-stability and redox activity of sulfide solid electrolytes to form ionically conductive interphases on the cathode surface using a simple and scalable synthesis approach. This creates a microstructure that enables high utilization and reversible electrochemical behavior with both sulfur and Li2S. Bulk and morphological characterization with X-ray absorption spectroscopy quantification is used to validate reversibility. Additionally, optimizing the cathode/catholyte microstructure by tailoring particle size to the micron-scale enhances rate performance for practical operation. The coupled (chemo)mechanical behavior of Li-S cathodes and sulfide solid electrolytes was found to alleviate internal stresses with cycling, especially when paired with high capacity anodes like silicon. As a result, this approach enables high loading sulfur cathodes up to 11 mAh cm-2 with stable operation at room temperature.

In this work, we explore various types of M-cation and X-anion substitutions in the LiMXCl4 system. We find that fluoro-chlorides may provide promising thermodynamic and electrochemical stability without compromising ionic conductivity. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations on seven substitutions and three lithium concentrations for each substitution suggest that even higher conductivity may be achieved in LiMXCl4 than has been reported. A Meyer-Neldel analysis comparing LiMXCl4, close-packed halides, and LaCl3-type systems demonstrates the potential of the LiMXCl4 family due to their high Meyer-Neldel energy, high prefactor, and low activation energy, projecting a range of conductivity of 10-100 mS/cm. An analysis of the correlation between lithium-ion hops and small-angle tilting events finds that LiMXCl4 systems exhibit a strong cradle effect where weakly bound M-octahedra often tilt their orientation in conjunction with a nearby Li-ion hop to flatten the lithium-ion energy landscape. Such an advantage originates from the fact that in the LiMXCl4 structure, one-dimensional M-octahedral chains are bound via weak van der Waals interactions which can accommodate for reduction in free volume via rotational correlation of the octahedra. Our work demonstrates an exciting direction towards further improving this class of materials in terms of ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability and provides a fundamental understanding of the factors that lead to high ionic conductivity in non-close-packed oxyhalide systems.", "date": "2024-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The effects of membrane water content and incorporation of ion-coordinating ligands have been studied via computation and experiment to develop structure-performance relationships. However, few studies systematically investigate the effects of membrane composition beyond monomer chemical identity or the balance of driving forces such as diffusion and electromigration. Here we synthesized a library of poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate membranes with varying percentages of ion-coordinating monomers (acrylic acid, 4-vinylpyridine) to investigate the influence of ligand content on ion permeabilities and permselectivities. Trends in membrane performance under electrodialysis and diffusion were compared to elucidate the relative effects of separation driving forces and to inform electrochemical operation. We observed order-of-magnitude permeability reductions with ligand content for ions capable of multidentate ligand complexation, especially for nickel in the pyridine-containing membranes. As a result, lithium/nickel permselectivity gradually increased by a factor of 1.65\u00d7 from 10 to 50 mol% pyridine membranes. We further demonstrated simultaneous improvements in lithium/nickel separation productivity (1.75\u00d7) and selectivity (2.99\u00d7) with increasing electric potential driving force.

IRAP\u2019s catalytic domain catalyzes the N-terminal peptide bond hydrolysis of the natural substrate oxytocin, a neuroactive pep-tide linked to improved cognition and other elemental brain functions. Angiotensin IV and similar peptides are recognized as cognitive enhancers due to their ability to competitively inhibit proteolytic activity of IRAP, reducing the degradation of natural neuropeptides. Despite a very similar binding complex between the substrate and the inhibitor with IRAP, especially around the scissile bond, it is unclear why the enzyme metabolizes oxytocin but does not efficiently degrade angiotensin IV. We employed enhanced sampling QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations to explore free energy landscapes for reaction of these two peptides in IRAP. A significantly higher energy barrier for the formation of the oxyanion tetrahedral intermediate (TI) and higher overall barrier for the peptide cleavage was observed for the reaction of angiotensin IV. Electronic structure analysis (NBO and NCI) revealed the reasons for different reactivity, including stabilization of the on the sigma hole of the N-terminus disulfide in oxytocin by the hybridizing lone pair of the scissile peptide nitrogen. The interplay between weak non-covalent spodium bond and strong bi-dentate coordination of the catalytic Zn2+ by angiotensin IV caused larger deviation of valine C-C\u03b1-C\u03b2 angle from the ideal tetrahedral, which destabilizes the TI.

In this contribution we explore strategies to   dope nanoporous SiO2 thin films made by atomic layer deposition and atomic etching with precise control over pore size with CdSe quantum dots. Two distinct strategies were employed for quantum dot deposition: in-situ growth of CdSe nanocrystals within the porous matrix via successive ionic layer adsorption reaction, and infiltration of pre-synthesized quantum dots. To address the impact of pore size layers with 10 nm and 30 nm average pore diameter were used as matrix. Our results show that though potentially also small pores are accessible for the in-situ approach, this strategy lacks controllability over the nanocrystal quality and size distribution. To dope layers with high quality quantum dots with well-defined size distribution and optical properties infiltration of preformed quantum dots is much more promising. It was observed that due to higher pore volume 30 nm porous silica shows higher loading after treatment than 10 nm porous silica matrix. This can be related to a better accessibility of the pores with higher pore size. The amount of infiltrated QDs can be influenced via drop casting of additional solvent on a pre-drop casted porous matrix as well as via varying the soaking time of a porous matrix in a QD solution.

Enabled by the novel supramolecular catalyst Mn(mcp)-RS2, the preferential oxidation at the fifth position on aliphatic substrates was observed.

Methods for synthesizing LaNiO3 nanoparticles of various shapes have been developed, with spherical and rod-shaped LaNiO3 showing better stability. However, LNNS-based diagnostic reagents have not been tested in nanozyme enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NLISA) or other enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and there is limited data on their synthesis. To fill this gap, it is necessary to develop a method for creating LNNS conjugates with monoclonal antibodies and to investigate the reproducibility, scalability, and applicability of these diagnostic reagents in NLISA.\nResults: We have successfully developed a method for producing novel diagnostic reagents utilizing LaNiO3 nanospheres. Our research demonstrates the application of these nanospheres in a NLISA specifically designed for the detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in real serum samples. This method is both reproducible and scalable, allowing for the efficient production of nanospheres that are functionalized with monoclonal antibodies targeting CRP, with mean diameter of approximately 270 nm. Based on the promising results obtained from our experiments, we have developed and optimized a sandwich-format NLISA for CRP detection. This assay achieved lower limit of detection at 0.178 \u00b5g/L, with a dynamic range from 12.5 to 0.195 \u00b5g/L and a linear detection range extending from 0.195 to 6.25 \u00b5g/L, showcasing its potential for clinical applications.\nSignificance and Novelty: The new NLISA method, utilizing LaNiO3 nanospheres in a sandwich format for the detection of CRP, significantly enhances sensitivity compared to similar use horseradish peroxidase-based -ELISA. In this study for the first time first the functionalization of lanthanum nickelate nanospheres with recognition elements have demonstrated.

They also have the potential to provide a route to target selectivity prediction. To date, most work has focused on soluble proteins, with relatively little focus on membrane proteins. Structural studies are increasingly revealing the presence of lipid-exposed allosteric binding sites on membrane proteins. The exposure to lipids rather than water is presumed to make ABFE calculations considerably more challenging. To investigate this and highlight other potential difficulties associated with such binding sites, we explored the performance of ABFE calculations on two G-protein-coupled receptor systems with lipid-exposed binding sites; the P2Y1 receptor and the GCGR receptor. We show that despite both proteins being GPCRs with lipid- exposed binding sites, the performance of ABFE calculations differs significantly. ABFE results for P2Y1R are in excellent agreement with experiment (mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.21 kcal/mol), but the results for GCGR were significantly poorer with the MAE 4.74 kcal/mol being the best we could achieve with current resources. Nevertheless, the GCGR system serves as an excellent vehicle to demonstrate the more problematic issues which can exist, including vastly different apo versus bound state, the presence of lipids solvating the apo state and sampling problems exacerbated by the lipid environment. We discuss how some of these aspects can be dealt with, while others will clearly require more work.

Such selection for protometabolic activity was observed in a system where trimer and hexamer replicators compete for common resources, as well as in a system of different hexamer replicator mutants. An out-of-equilibrium replication-destruction regime was implemented in a flow reactor, where replication from continuously supplied dithiol building blocks needs to keep up with \u201cdestruction\u201d by outflow. Selection occurred based on the ability of the mutants to activate a cofactor that photocatalytically produces singlet oxygen which, in turn, enhances the rate by which dithiol building blocks are converted into disulfide-based replicator precursors.

Understanding structural integrity of ADCs in vivo is critical for lead optimization. Despite of its importance, currently ADC biotransformation has not been broadly studied. High resolution accurate mass data analysis of biotransformed products has been a major bottleneck because of manual and time-consuming analyte identification process which can take days to weeks of analysis time by expert users. We developed a streamlined data analysis workflow that enables automated peak identification using various commercial software tools significantly improving data processing efficiency. A linker-payload biotransformation library was created for each new molecule and then combined with antibody sequence information for peak matching. As a proof of concept, we tested this workflow across different payload and linker types: an example using a topoisomerase I inhibitor-conjugated ADC and a comparison to a historical in vivo ADC biotransformation dataset for a pyrrolobenzodiazepine-conjugated ADC. Using this automated workflow, we were able to rapidly identify major biotransformation species that were previously found manually including loss of linker-payload, maleimide ring hydrolysis, cysteinylation at deconjugated site and partial linker-payload cleavage. Overall, this improved data-analysis workflow has demonstrated its superb effectiveness in streamlining ADC biotransformation identification and enabled quantification that was highly comparable to previously obtained results, thus demonstrating its comparability.

Herein, we introduce PeakMeister as a new software tool in the R statistical environment to enable the automated processing of serum metabolomic data acquired by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS) under positive ion mode. MSI-CE-MS takes advantage of a multiplexed separation format involving serial injection of 13 serum/plasma filtrate samples, quality controls, calibrants and/or blanks introduced within a single analytical run (< 4 min/sample).

A migration time index using a panel of internal standards was introduced to correct for large variations in apparent migration times, which allowed for reliable peak picking, peak integration and sample position assignment for serum metabolites having a single co-migrating stable-isotope internal standard or two flanking internal standards.

Polarizability contributes to important physical properties such as molecular interactions or dielectric constants; thus, it is essential to have accurate polarizabilities in molecular simulations. However, it remains a challenge to develop polarizable force fields for ions in computational chemistry. In particular, a comprehensive set of polarizabilities for ions has not been derived. Herein, we derived a systematic set of polarizabilities for atoms and ions across the periodic table based on high-level quantum mechanics calculations. These values have excellent agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the obtained polarizabilities and the van der Waals radii (R_VDW) that we previously determined (J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2023, 19, 2064). Two relationships, R_VDW\u221d\u03b1^(1/7) and R_VDW\u221d\u03b1^(1/3), proposed in previous studies were examined in the present work. Our results indicated the former relationship, which was derived based on the quantum harmonic oscillator model, prevails for atoms and cations, but neither relationship provides a satisfactory fit for anions. This is consistent with the tight-binding nature of the electrons in atoms and cations, while it is more challenging to quantify the polarizabilities of anions because of their more dispersed electron clouds. Moreover, we compared different approaches to determine the dispersion coefficients, including the London equation, Slater-Kirkwood equation, SAPT calculations, and TD-DFT method, along with the approach based on van der Waals constants. Our results indicated that although different approaches predict deviated magnitudes for the dispersion coefficients, their predictions are highly correlated, implying that each of these approaches can be used to evaluate dispersion interactions after proper scaling. Finally, we have developed a parameterization strategy for the 12-6-4 model based on our study. We specifically compared the performance of the 12-6-4 model with SAPT and SobEDA analyses to model interactions involving Na+/Mg2+ and various ligands containing He, Ne, Ar, H2O, NH3, [H2PO4]\u2212, and [HPO4]2\u2212. The results demonstrate that the 12-6-4 parameters effectively replicate both the total interaction energy and the individual energy components (electrostatics, exchange-repulsion, dispersion, and induction), highlighting the physical relevance of the 12-6-4 model and the effectiveness of our parameterization approach.

Our Macrocycles and Cages Database (MCD) was constructed by a series of steps: (1) automated identification of Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) entries likely to contain macrocycles or cages, (2) manual filtering to eliminate inaccuracies, (3) thorough verification and cleaning of the structures containing macrocycles or cages, (4) geometric optimisation of the validated experimental structures, and (5) calculation of Density-Derived Electrostatic and Chemical (DDEC6) charges for the optimised structures. Using the MCD, we performed simulations of binary CO2/CH4 competitive adsorption under industrially relevant conditions, resulting in a structure-property-function relationship that facilitates the identification of promising materials for this separation. In addition, this map supports the formulation and exploration of potential material design principles.", "date": "2024-08-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using comparative PROTAC versus ligand global proteomics analyses, we rapidly identify proteins selectively downregulated by \u201cuntargeted\u201d PROTAC probes containing an E3 ligase recruiter and various cysteine-reactive protein-of-interest (POI) ligands. In this manuscript, we showcase our approach by identifying a first-in-class acrylamide- and VHL-based PROTAC for metallothionein 2A (MT2A) \u2013 a small, cysteine-rich, metal-binding protein implicated in heavy metal detoxification, zinc homeostasis, and cellular metastasis. Notably, isoform-specific MT overexpression has been shown to augment cellular migration and invasion across several cancer cell lines, though precise mechanisms are unknown due to insufficient tools to study MTs. We show that optimized PROTAC AA-BR-157 covalently binds conserved C44, degrades overexpressed MT2A with nanomolar potency, and reduces migration and invasion of triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We further demonstrate a time-dependent increase in intracellular zinc levels following MT2A degradation as well as downregulation of protein diaphanous homolog 3 (DIAPH3), a positive regulator of actin and cell motility. Super-resolution imaging of MDA-MB-231 cells shows that downregulation of MT2A and DIAPH3 inhibits cell polarization and thereby migration, suggesting that MT2A regulates motility via DIAPH3-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling. In summary, our strategy enables the discovery of PROTACs for novel disease-related targets and lays the groundwork for expansion of the druggable proteome.", "date": "2024-08-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The first isolation of a stable free-base subporphyrin is achieved recently with mesityl groups at two of the meso positions and anthracene at the other.  X-ray studies reveal a markedly non-planar structure different from the bowl shape and is attributed to the steric hindrance of the inner N-H bonds.

MCs performed better in all the tested conditions than both coacervates and liposomes. We ascribe this behavior to the increased stability that coacervates and liposomes confer to each other when together.

Electron-electron ($e$-$e$) coupling interactions, particularly the electron spin flip-flop interaction, play a significant role in enhancing nuclear spin diffusion in DNP polarizing agents with substantial hyperfine couplings.  Using a four-spin system model, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations suggest that the $e-e$ interactions eliminate the spin diffusion barrier in the $\\alpha\\beta\\$ and $\\beta\\alpha$ coupled electron spin manifolds when the electron and nuclear states are degenerate through a concurrent four-spin flip-flop mechanism, known as the Electron-Assisted Spin Diffusion (EASD) mechanism. Experimental DNP buildup curves measured at 14.1 T under MAS conditions validate the EASD model, since a radical system with larger $e-e$ coupling shows faster spin diffusion rates. Our results provide fresh perspectives with the potential to greatly improve DNP transfer under MAS conditions. They elucidate how polarization can be diffused out of polarizing agents that otherwise would not diffuse to the bulk nuclei and lay the groundwork for designing and synthesizing more efficient DNP polarizing agents.

The requirement of relying on an enzyme for modifying mRNA incurs several limitations on the application, design, and delivery of ASOs. To address these limitations, we developed a Pt(IV)-ASO strategy that combines the reactivity of platinum with the sequence specificity of ASOs to covalently modify nucleic acids, including short RNA and mRNA,  in a selective, enzyme-free manner. Access to Pt(IV)-ASO constructs was made possible by an innovative equatorial Pt(IV) ammine functionalization strategy, allowing for conjugation of carboxylic acids directly to the Pt core. Reactivity with 21-mer RNA and full-length mRNA by Pt-ASO con-structs was demonstrated, and the covalently modified products were characterized using a suite of orthogonal techniques, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay, MALDI-TOF MS, temperature-dependent dissociation assay, and RT-qPCR. Constructs were optimized for their reactivity and selectivity, allowing for Pt(IV)-PMO constructs with sub-nanomolar IC50 values in an RNA competition assay. This Pt(IV)-ASO plat-form facilitates new avenues for RNA modification by providing a strategy for covalent modification of nucleic acids with potential applications for molecular biology research.

Due to the complexity of biological systems and their surrounding environments, the mechanism underlying phase separation-mediated supramolecular assembly is poorly understood, making the reversal of so-called irreversible fibrillization a significant challenge. Therefore, it is crucial to develop simple model systems that provide insights into the mechanistic process of monomers to phase-separated droplets to ordered supramolecular assemblies. Such models can help in investigating strategies to either reverse or modulate these states. Herein, we present a simple synthetic model system composed of three components, including a benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide-based supramolecular monomer, a surfactant, and water, to mimic the condensate pathway observed in biological systems. This highly dynamic system can undergo \u201cmicelle-droplet-fiber\u201d transition over time and space with a gradient field, regulated by competitive interactions. Importantly, manipulating these competitive interactions through guest molecules, temperature changes, and co-solvent can reverse the ordered fibers back into a disordered liquid or micellar state. Our model system provides new insights into the critical balance between various interactions among the three components that determine the pathway and reversibility of the process.

Accurate translation of chemical compounds from SMILES notation into their corresponding IUPAC names is crucial, as it can significantly streamline the laborious process of naming chemical structures.

Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework for oscillatory fields in the EDL under constant potential conditions, combining an orbital-free DFT treatment of electrons on the metal side and a statistical field theory of charged fluids on the electrolyte side. The resulting grand potential is a hybrid functional of electron density, electric potential, and solvent polarization, referred to as density-potential-polarization functional theory (DPPFT). Built on the DPPFT, an EDL model for the Ag(110)-KPF6 aqueous interface is parameterized with experimental double layer capacitance (Cdl) data. The calibrated model is then employed to study the influence of electronic, ion, and solvent properties on the EDL structure and capacitance. Cdl profiles at different crystal faces and in various electrolyte solutions are rationalized coherently. We reveal that intensified ion layering leads to elevated capacitances at the potential of zero charge (PZC) and narrowed ionic peaks in the Cdl profile.

However, as the academic community focusses on high performing solution-processed OSCs, detailed studies about the relation between morphology and device characteristics in VP-OSCs are rare. Here, we present a study on a model donor/fullerene VP-OSC system deposited at different substrate temperatures. Substrate heating results in increases in current density and fill factor (FF). The changes in morphology are characterised by grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). The increase in the degree of crystallinity and preferential orientation of the donor molecule in heated samples results in enhanced absorption increasing current density. The exciton and charge separation efficiency studied by transient absorption and photoluminescence quenching show only minor differences. To study the FF differences, charge transport and non-geminate recombination are studied by optoelectronic measurements and device simulations. The charge carrier kinetics are governed by a large density of trap states. While the energetic disorder and non-geminate recombination under open circuit conditions remain largely unchanged, the increased effective mobility and lower transport disorder observed in photocurrent transients explain the increased collection efficiency for heated devices. We relate this to the increased donor phase purity. Our results suggest that charge recombination and transport are governed by different aspects of disorder related to amorphous and crystalline donor phases.

It is composed of a beta1,6-linked glucosamine (GlcN) disaccharide that is only phosphorylated at the anomeric center. The major species of B. fragilis has five fatty acids and the amine of the distal GlcN carries the unusual (R)-3-(13-methyltetradecanoyloxy)-1.5-methylhexadecanoic acid.

This is achieved by calculating dissociation curves for excited complexes (\u2018exciplexes\u2019), whose binding strength depends on excited-state NCIs including electrostatics, Pauli repulsion, charge-transfer, exciton coupling, and London dispersion. Reference dissociation curves are calculated with the reasonably accurate wave function method SCS-CC2/CBS(3,4) which is used to benchmark a range of TD-DFT methods. Additionally, we test the effect of ground-state dispersion corrections, DFT-D3(BJ) and VV10, for exciplex binding. Overall, we find that TD-DFT methods generally under-bind exciplexes which can be explained by the missing dispersion forces. Underbinding errors reduce going up the rungs of Jacob\u2019s ladder. Further, the D3(BJ) dispersion correction is essential for good accuracy in most cases. Likewise, the VV10-type non-local kernel yields relatively low errors and has comparable performance in either its fully self-consistent implementation or as a post-SCF additive correction, but its impact is solely on ground-state energies and not on excitation energies.

This study examines the effects of in-situ and ex-situ europium doping on the structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of CsPbBr3 NCs. In-situ doping was achieved by introducing the dopant during the NC synthesis, while ex-situ doping involved adding the dopant to pre-prepared NCs via sonochemical synthesis with an ultrasonic bath. The doped NCs exhibit enhanced emission and boosted photocatalytic activity, showcasing the multifaceted benefits of Eu ions doping. The study concludes that in-situ europium doping, particularly at 5 wt%, significantly enhances the structural and functional characteristics of CsPbBr3 NCs, offering a promising approach for improving their performance in optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.", "date": "2024-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here we demonstrate that prebiotic nitriles, aminoacyl-adenylates and N-carboxyanhydrides all react with thiols (including enzyme-cofactors) to selectively yield aminoacyl-thiols, which in turn aminoacylate RNA in high yield and selectivity for 2',3'-diols.

Despite this, intermolecular reactivity, and the unique possibility to access several reaction pathways via a central triplet diradical has rendered control over reaction outcomes, an intractable challenge. Extended chromophores such as non-symmetrical dienes have the potential to undergo 2+2 cycloaddition, 4+2 cycloaddition or geometric isomerization, which, in combination with other mechanistic considerations (site- and regioselectivity), results in chemical reactions that are challenging to regulate. Leveraging spin density as a predictive tool, in combination with the use of a core functionality that can be adequately tuned to potentially modulate reactivity, would be highly enabling in revealing the intimate links between core structure and EnT induced reactivity. Herein, we utilize boron as a tool to explore reactivity of non-symmetrical dienes under EnT catalysis, paying particular attention to the impact of boron hybridization effects on the target reactivity. Through this, a highly site- and regioselective 2+2 cycloaddition was realized with the employed boron motif effecting reaction efficiency. Reaction divergence to enable 4+2 cycloaddition was achieved, while a counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed in geometric isomerization versus 2+2 cycloaddition.

The structures differ not only in the molecular packing; they also feature different molecular conformations. The template is slightly too small for the cavity of the nanoring, and this size mismatch can be accommodated by two types of distortion: either the zinc atoms are pulled away from the planes of the porphyrins, or the nanorings contract by adopting a ruffled conformation, with butadiyne links alternatingly above and below the plane of the six zinc centers. The template-bound ring forms sheets and tubular stacks with interdigitated aryl groups.

However, in the current literature, one MLP model is always specifically developed and employed for a specific system, and it is unexplored if one `general' MLP can be developed for a wide variety of structures.

After generating a training dataset comprising augmented structures generated from DFT-optimized ones, we validated the trained MLP's reliability in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on the test set that comprises chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can still reliably reproduce thermal and bulk properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many structures, the computational cost of developing MLP(s) for high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict `quantum-accurate' properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously un-investigated via expensive theoretical calculations.

Our findings from the fluorescence assays revealed that most carboxylates can spontaneously diffuse across liposomes suspended in NaNO3 solutions at pH 7, facilitated by the efflux of HNO3. The Cl-ISE assay showed chloride/carboxylate exchange in presence of an anion transporter. Clear trends were observed when the organic moiety was systematically varied, with a particular enhancement of anion transport by the presence of hydroxyl groups in the aromatic carboxylates. Our findings provide insights into the internalisation process of carboxylates into liposomes and could contribute to understanding the transport of other biologically relevant organic anions.", "date": "2024-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While major attention has been devoted to high-field applications with continuous microwave irradiation, the introduction of fast arbitrary waveform generators is gradually  increasing the opportunities to a realization of pulsed DNP. Here, we describe how  static-powder DNP pulse sequences may systematically be designed using single-spin vector effective Hamiltonian theory. Particular attention is devoted to the intricate interplay between two important parts of the effective first-order Hamiltonian, namely, the linear field (single-spin) terms, and the Fourier coefficients determining  scaling of the bilinear coupling terms mediating polarization transfer.  We address two cases. The first  operates in the regime where the microwave field amplitude is lower than the nuclear Larmor frequency. Here, we illustrate the predictive strength of single-spin vector model by comparing analytical calculations with experimental DNP results at 9.8 GHz/15 MHz on trityl radicals at 80 K. The second case operates in the high-power regime, where we combine the underlying single-spin vector design principles with numerical non-linear optimization to optimize the balance between the linear terms and the bilinear Fourier coefficients in a figure of merit function. We demonstrate, numerically and experimentally, a broadband DNP pulse sequence PLATO (PoLarizAtion Transfer via non-linear Optimization) with a bandwidth of 80 MHz and optimized for microwave field a with maximum (peak) amplitude of 32 MHz.", "date": "2024-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In addition to their applications for molecular switches, chemical sensors, spin filters, and voltage-driven catalysis, such junctions are excellent prototypes for understanding charge transport at the single-molecule level. As the interface-to-bulk ratio becomes large at the nanoscale, the molecule-electrode interface dictates the properties of single-molecule junctions. To understand the various interfacial effects of the anchor group, bridging molecule, electrode material, and electrode binding site on the conductance, we present a simple and efficient tunneling model for coherent transport that is fully parameterized using density functional theory. Using this model, we calculate several properties, such as the binding energies, binding force constants, conductance, and current-voltage characteristics of junctions containing a benzene-1,4-dithiol or benzene-1,4-diamine molecule bridged between gold, silver, or copper electrodes. Due to the implementation of an effective mass in the tunneling model and the use of a range-separated, hydrid density functional, our predicted properties agree well with results from several independent experimental studies. We found that the conductance of benzene-1,4-dithiol depends sensitively on the binding site at the electrode whereas benzene-1,4-diamine shows no such dependence. Silver electrodes produce a much weaker quantum conductance current than gold electrodes due to a lower work function, whereas junctions with copper electrodes produce conductance and current quite similar to those with silver electrodes.", "date": "2024-08-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Surface; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels were three times higher during the dry season (indoor 146 \u00b1 22 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, outdoor 153 \u00b1 23 \u00b5g/m\u00b3) than during the wet season (indoor 52 \u00b1 12 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, outdoor 50 \u00b1 11 \u00b5g/m\u00b3).

Higher infiltration factors (dry: 0.83 \u00b1 0.12; wet: 0.87 \u00b1 0.14), determined through mixed effect regression of parallel indoor and outdoor timeseries data, further highlight the substantial impact of outdoor pollution on indoor levels.

Output from the PDM can be used to bound the duration of emissions detected by snapshot measurement technologies, such as plane or satellites, that have limited ability to characterize emission duration due to the typically low temporal frequency (e.g. quarterly) at which they observe a given source. Linear regression indicates that the PDM has a bias of -4.9% (R^2 = 0.80) when evaluated on blinded controlled releases at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC), with 86.8% of estimates within a factor of 2x error from the true duration. We apply the PDM to a typical production site in the Appalachian Basin and use it to bound the duration of snapshot measurements.

Numerical values of these charge-transfer metrics can be unstable with respect to basis-set expansion and may afford nonsensical values in the presence of extremely diffuse basis functions.  In contrast, metrics based on well-defined expectation values are stable, representation-invariant, and physically interpretable.  Although the NTO representation improves the stability of these ad hoc charge-transfer diagnostics, it remains the case that an incoherent average can only be connected to an expectation value in the absence of superposition.  For the NTO representation to satisfy this condition, the particle and hole density matrices must each be dominated by a single eigenvector so that the transition density is well described a single pair of NTOs.  Counterexamples are readily found where this is not the case.

In this work, we report a solution-phase synthesis of colloidal nanoparticles of titanium-alloyed BaZrS3, Ba(Zr1-xTix)S3. The titanium alloying was achieved using reactive amide precursors in oleylamine solvent, and N,N'-diethylthiourea served as the sulfur source. Our methodology allowed for the synthesis of Ba(Zr1-xTix)S3 nanomaterials at temperatures at or below 300 oC. The resulting nanocrystals exhibited a phase transition from an orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure to a hexagonal non-perovskite phase as the Ti content surpassed x = 0.11, accompanied by a morphological evolution from nanoplatelets to nanohexagons and ultimately nanobars. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of BaZr1-xTixS3 nanoparticles exhibit increasing low-energy absorption as the Ti4+ content is increased.

This study presents a rational model that integrates density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predict the experimentally measured E_gap^exp of CPs, using 1096 data points. Through alkyl side chain truncation and conjugated backbone extension, the modified oligomers effectively capture the electronic properties of CPs, significantly improving the correlation between the DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO gap (E_gap^oligomer) and E_gap^exp (R2=0.51) compared to the unmodified side-chain-containing monomers (R2=0.15). Moreover, we trained six ML models with two categories of features as input: E_gap^oligomer to represent the extended backbone and molecular features of unmodified monomers to capture the alkyl-side-chain effect. The best model, XGBoost-2, achieved an R2 of 0.77 and an MAE of 0.065 eV for predicting E_gap^exp, falling within the experimental error margin of \u223c0.1 eV.

This paper analyzes the relationship between a nuclide\u2019s equinucleonic (Z=N) composition and its relative cosmic abundance. Structural symmetry emerges as a sensitive and specific predictor of superabundance within a proposed alternating nucleon model. The model derives from the proton\u2019s radius (r =0.8414 fm), the hadron\u2019s prolate shape (from the transition to the proton\u2019s first excited state, the \u2206+(1232) resonance), and the separation distance between a pair of bound nucleons (\u2248 0.8 fm, from the nucleon-nucleon potential). Various nucleon geometries were considered for each nuclide, with preference given to structures having optimal numbers of stable proton-neutron short-range interactions and whose model radii (derived from the regular polygon radius formula) best correlate with experimental charge radii (r(31)=.98, p<.001). Remarkably, the best-fit solutions for the eight superabundant Z=N nuclides categorically demonstrate bilateral structural symmetry, in which neutrons reflect protons on opposite sides of a bisecting chiral plane. Conversely, when an element\u2019s stable isotopes are compared, the best-fit structures in which nucleon symmetry is not possible (generally because proton and neutron numbers are unequal) are less abundant by \u2248 2 orders of magnitude.

Those are formed by enzymes such  as lipoxygenases or cyclooxygenases but also by autoxidation. While the autoxidation is stereorandom,  only individual stereoisomers are formed enzymatically. Oxylipin formation is comprehensively analyzed  by  reversed-phase  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  methods,  simultaneously quantifying > 150 oxylipins including numerous positional isomers. Enantiomers are not  separated and enantioselective methods lack sensitivity and selectivity.  Objectives:  Development  and  application  of  a  method  enabling  the  sensitive,  specific  and  enantioselective analysis of oxylipins allowing the investigation of the formation routes of hydroxy- and  dihydroxy-fatty acids in biological samples.  Methods:  An  achiral-chiral  multiple  heart-cutting  two-dimensional  (2D)-LC-MS/MS  method  was  developed.  The  separation  of  45  pairs  of  enantiomeric  hydroxy-  and  vicinal  dihydroxy-fatty  acids  is  achieved within 1.80 min with lower limits of quantification below 1 pg on column. Enantiomeric fractions  of oxylipins can be precisely (\u00b15%) determined even at low concentrations or high enantiomeric excess  of one isomer. The method was applied on the analysis of oxylipins in human cells.   Results:  In  human  M2-like  macrophages,  the  so-called  specialized  pro-resolving  mediators  (SPM)  5,15-DiHEPE and 7,17-DiHDHA as well as 5,15-DiHETE occurred as (S,S)-enantiomer, supporting their  enzymatic formation. In contrast, at least eight isomers of 10,17-DiHDHA are present in immune cells  indicating formation by autoxidation. Consistent with the literature, in human plasma of healthy subjects  these dihydroxy-fatty acids are not present. However, they quickly form by autoxidation if the samples  are stored improperly, yielding all four stereoisomers.  Conclusion: Using the first two-dimensional liquid chromatography method for the quantitative analysis  of oxylipins with chiral separation, we could show that not only the specific enantiomers of dihydroxy- PUFA described as SPM are present in biological samples but numerous isomers can be found. These  are rapidly formed during inappropriate sample storage. Thus, dihydroxy-FA should only be reported as  SPM if an enantioselective analysis has been carried out.

Two ligands are compared in this work that differ in the denticities of their secondary cation binding sites (pentadentate vs. hexadentate), enabling direct quantification of influences on the redox and vibrational properties of the uranyl moiety. The UVI/UV thermodynamic reduction potential is correlated with the effective Lewis acidity of the secondary metal cations; solid-state and solution-phase Raman spectra show that this effect can be attributed to electrostatics that effectively drive diminished electron donation to uranium in adducts of more strongly Lewis acidic cations. The heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) rates for UVI/UV redox processes, however, depend on both the strength of cation binding in the macrocycles and the Lewis acidity of the cations, suggesting opportunities for molecular design in development of reagents for nuclear fuel reprocessing/separations.

To address these challenges, we present 3DSMILES-GPT, a fully language-model-driven framework for 3D molecular generation.

Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, 3DSMILES-GPT generates molecules with superior metrics, such as Vina docking score. Notably, it achieves a 33% enhancement in the quantitative estimation of drug-likeness (QED) compared to current models.

This study investigates the performance of nine metal oxide catalysts (SnO2, SiO2, Y2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, La2O3, Cr2O3, and Al2O3) in the gas-phase ketonization of VA to 5-nonanone in the 350-450\u00b0C range. This screening reveals a correlation between the metal oxides lattice energy and their catalytic activity for valeric acid ketonization. ZrO2, TiO2, and La2O3, char-acterized by high lattice energy, demonstrate the highest catalytic activity. Y2O3, SnO2, SiO2, showing low lattice energy, are barely active. However, exceptions to this trend were ob-served: Cr2O3 and Al2O3 displayed poor catalytic performance despite their elevated lattice energy. The comprehensive characterization of the catalysts, encompassing XRD, N2-physisorption, NH3-TPD, and CO2-TPD analyses, has unveiled the crucial role of important parameters including acid-base properties in addition to lattice energy. Only oxides showing amphoteric properties can catalyse the reaction effectively. Interestingly, low-lattice energy and amphoteric oxides such as SnO2 (showing poor performance) became significantly active at higher temperature (500\u00b0C). Analysis of by-products by online GC-MS and spent catalyst characterization indicated that in this case the ketonization mechanism changed from the so-called surface mechanism to the so-called bulk mechanism.

By instead inducing reflectivity with metallization, the interference conditions are altered and different optical properties arise. Using angularly resolved far-field optical analysis and ray tracing simulations, the differences between metal-induced multibounce reflection interference and total internal reflection-induced interference are described. The incorporation of metallized optical interfaces beneficially increases microstructure reflectivity, removes the restrictions on material refractive index, and further enables the use of diverse microstructure geometries combining both concave and convex curvatures.

We studied the lipid hydrolysis kinetics of OmpLA in charge-neutral and charged membranes with symmetric or asymmetric transbilayer lipid distributions. In charge-neutral membranes, OmpLA was more active in symmetric bilayers due to the lower differential curvature stress between membrane leaflets. Strikingly, this behavior was completely reversed in charged bilayers. Measurements revealed intrinsic molecular shape changes in the charged lipids upon addition of calcium. This effectively reduces the differential curvature stress in charged asymmetric membranes leading to increased protein activity. This conclusion is further supported by similar effects observed upon the addition of sodium ions, which also alter the shape of the lipids, but do not specifically interact with the protein. Additional lipid-protein interactions likely contribute to this phenomenon.

To address this challenge, we introduce pyBinder to apply label-free quantitation (LFQ) to AS-MS data to process primary MS1 data and develop two scores to rank the peptides from the integration of their peak area: target selectivity and concentration-dependent enrichment. We benchmark pyBinder utilizing AS-MS data developed against a protein, anti-hemagglutinin antibody 12ca5, revealing that peptides that contain a motif known for target-specific high-affinity binding are well characterized by these two scores. AS-MS data from a second protein target, WD Repeat Domain 5 (WDR5), is analyzed to confirm the two pyBinder scores reliably capture the target-specific motif-containing peptides. From the results delivered by pyBinder, a list of target-selective ions is developed and fed back into subsequent MS experiments to facilitate expanded data generation and the targeted discovery of selective ligands. pyBinder analysis resulted in a four-fold increase in motif-containing sequence identification for WDR5 (from 3 ligands discovered to 14 discovered), showing the utility of the two scores.

While augmented valency has been shown with trivalent PROTACs targeting two binding sites within a given target protein, or used to recruit two different targets, the possibility of recruiting two different E3 ligases within the same compound has not been demonstrated. Here we present dual-ligase recruitment as a strategy to enhance targeted protein degradation. We designed heterotrivalent PROTACs composed of a CRBN, VHL and BET targeting ligand, separately tethered via a branched trifunctional linker. Structure-activity relationships of 12 analogues qualifies AB3067 as the most potent and fastest degrader of BET proteins, with minimal E3 ligase cross-degradation. Comparative kinetic analyses in wild-type and ligase single and double knockout cell lines revealed that protein ubiquitination and degradation induced by AB3067 was contributed by both CRBN and VHL in an additive fashion. We further expand the scope of the dual-ligase approach by developing a hetero-trivalent CRBN/VHL-based BromoTag degrader and a tetravalent PROTAC comprising of two BET ligand moieties. In summary, we provide proof-of-concept for dual-E3 ligase recruitment as a strategy to boost degradation fitness by recruiting two E3 ligases with a single degrader molecule. This approach could potentially delay the outset of resistance mechanisms involving loss of E3 ligase functionality.", "date": "2024-08-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Doping the CeOx electrodes with Gd or Pr improves both the electrochemical and thermochemical processes on the catalyst surface. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the effects of reactant gas concentration and applied reducing bias on the nature of the products formed. The electrodes were stable under strong reducing biases (-2 A/cm2), and could operate without incurring any major overpotential penalties. Operando Raman spectroscopy and online mass spectrometry (MS) were utilised in conjunction with electrochemical measurements to help establish a relationship between the catalyst structure and its chemical behaviour. The reduction of Ce4+ sites to Ce3+ (creation of oxygen defects) was found to be correlated with the production of CO on applying reducing bias. The doped materials (Ce{Pr}Ox and Ce{Gd}Ox), in general, demonstrated enhanched defect formation. In the presence of H2, Ce{Pr}Ox was found to oxidise, whereas, both CeOx and Ce{Gd}Ox exhibited reduction. In Ce{Pr}Ox, the oxidation by H2 and reduction by bias were found to compete. Coke formation was observed on the catalyst surface at high CO2 concentrations for the doped ceria electrodes. This coke formation co-incided with the removal of carbonyl peaks and Ce3+ enrichment in the Raman spectra. We have observed that increasing H2 concentration affects coke formation differently for Ce{Pr}Ox and Ce{Gd}Ox: it delays the onset bias for coke formation for the former, while expediting it for the latter with increasing H2 concentration. Through first principles-based calculations, we have correlated the counter-intuitive behaviour of Ce{Pr}Ox in H2 to the nature of the incorporated hydrogen in the Ce{Pr}Ox-H adduct in a reducing environment. Incorporation of H is found to stabilise the nearby oxygen sites for Ce{Pr}Ox, whereas it makes oxygen vacancy formation (and thereby, Ce3+ formation) easier for CeOx, Ce{Gd}Ox remains largely unaffected. We have demonstrated the role of hydrogen in improving the nearby metal-oxygen bonding.

No single-solvent electrolyte can satisfy all the requirements of LIB electrolytes. For this reason, therefore, LIB electrolytes are often complex mixtures of multiple co-solvents with optimized properties. Our study finds that the addition of EC/DMC carbonate co-solvent mixtures into [EMI][TFSI]/1M LiFSI  results in reduction in the values of the density of the mixture. By comparing the organic solvents EC/DMC with the IL solvents, the computed density of the pure IL/1M LiFSI system (no EC/DMC content) is higher than that of the EC/DMC/1M LiFSI system (no [EMI][TFSI] content). The relative increase in density with higher contents of IL/1M LiFSI system is suggestive of arising from the stronger interactions of [TFSI]-  and [FSI]- anions with the Li+ ions as compared to the interaction of EC/DMC with Li+ ions. The behavior of the MSDs for the center-of-mass of the ions as a function of IL/carbonate co-solvent mixtures indicated that the ions exhibited slow dynamics (diffusivity) with higher carbonate content. Our study on the diffusion coefficient analysis of Li+, [FSI]-  and [TFSI]-  ions have revealed that the organic solvents restrict the free motion of the ions, reducing the dynamics (diffusivity) of the electrolytes. The simulation results also revealed that the total molar ionic conductivity for the different mixing ratios of IL/carbonate blends decrease with higher contents of EC/DMC co-solvents. Furthermore, the relative ionic contribution to the total molar conductivity of each individual cationic and anionic species increase with higher contents of IL in the IL/carbonate mixture, showing that higher carbonate co-solvents have the effects of reducing the molar ionic conductivity. \nKey words: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, bis(fluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, DFT, MD, OPLS/AA.", "date": "2024-08-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Previous research has only concentrated on di-substituted six-membered lactones. In this study, a newly designed tri-substituted six-membered CO2/butadiene-derived lac-tone monomer, 3,3,6-triethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (Et-HL), was polymerized successfully through selective ring-opening polymerization (ROP) using NaOMe, tBu-P4/BnOH, or tBu-P4. The tBu-P4/BnOH affords linear-poly(Et-HL) with typical living polymerization behaviors, while a maximum number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 1050 kg mol-1 and a dispersity (\u0110) of 1.52 was achieved for cyclic-poly(Et-HL) using only tBu-P4. Similar thermal properties were found between poly(Et-HL) and polyHL derived from Et-HL\u2019s di-substituted precursor, 3,6-diethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (HL). The ceiling temperature (Tc) was calculated to be 265 K (-8\u2103) at [Et-HL]0 = 1.0 mol L-1 in THF for poly(Et-HL), which is only slightly lower than HL (Tc = -6\u2103, [HL]0 = 1.0 mol L-1). Catalytic methods were developed for monomer recycling of both linear- and cyclic-poly(Et-HL). Direct observation of key intermediates by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) reveals the mechanistic differences between Et-HL and HL. tBu-P4 efficiently promotes the deprotonation of the \u03b1-hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl in HL, presumably yielding an enolate as the nucleophile responsible for the initial ring opening in the for-mation of cyclic-polyHL. However, Et-HL's additional substituent prohibits this process, instead favoring direct attack on the ester bond of the monomer by tBu-P4 in the initial ring opening to afford cyclic-poly(Et-HL). A tail-to-head strain-releasing mechanism was proposed to rationalize the selective formation of cyclic polymers for both HL and Et-HL using only tBu-P4. In the case of linear polymers, HL and Et-HL share a similar mechanism involving initiator anion attacking the monomer ester bond.

In this work, we demonstrate that a nonheme iron enzyme, hydroxymandelate synthase from Amycolatopsis orientalis (AoHMS), is capable of generating CF3 radicals from hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and directing them for enantioselective alkene trifluoromethyl azidation. A high-throughput screening (HTS) platform based on Staudinger ligation was established, enabling the rapid evaluation of AoHMS variants for this abiological transformation. The final optimized variant accepts a range of alkene substrates, producing the trifluoromethyl azidation products in up to 73% yield and 96:4 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.). The biocatalytic platform can be further extended to alkene pentafluoroethyl azidation and diazidation by altering the iodine(III) reagent. In addition, anion competition experiments provide insights into the radical rebound process for this abiological transformation.

This structural elaboration opens up an entire new structure and property space expanding the versatility and applicability of diarylethenes. In this work, we present the second generation of our zwitterionic aza-diarylethenes, which finally allows for fully reversible photoswitching and precise control over three intrinsic switching states. Fully reversible and high-yielding photoswitching between the neutral open form and a zwitterionic Z isomer is achieved with two different wavelengths of light.

Its high energy content of >10 kcal/mol can be released thermally by deliberate solvent change as trigger mechanism, rendering aza-diarylethenes into interesting candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) applications. The third state further serves as locking state, allowing to toggle light-responsiveness reversibly between thermally labile and thermally stable switching.

The large size and complexity of LNG facilities make quantifying emissions with ground-based monitoring systems challenging, making aerial platforms one of the preferred methods for methane measurements at these sites. However, aerial measurements typically provide a snapshot of emissions at a given instance, necessitating further analytical steps to infer both annualized emissions and the range of possible emissions at different instants in time. This study uses aerial measurements at two LNG facilities from a Quantification, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification project to characterize the distribution of temporally averaged emissions (i.e., annualized inventories) and possible site-level emissions at any given point in time (``instantaneous emissions''). The former provides uncertainty on the aerial measurement component of measurement-informed inventories representing annual averages, while the latter will help contextualize future snapshot measurements (e.g., aerial surveys or high-resolution satellite platforms) at LNG facilities. We find that instantaneous emissions may fall well outside of the distribution describing uncertainty in the annual inventory.

Formation of nitric acid by directly oxidizing dinitrogen via the electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR) is an attractive alternative, but has so far largely remained elusive. Towards advancing our fundamental understanding of the limitations of the N2OR, in this work we investigated the competitive adsorption dynamics of nitrogen (N2) and water oxidation intermediates such as hydroxide (OH) on a range of transition metal oxides. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore three possible N2OR mechanisms: direct adsorption and dissociative adsorption of N2, and a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) type mechanism involving adsorption of N2 on a surface-bound atomic oxygen. We observed a strong linear scaling relation between the adsorption energy of N2 and OH on the metal-terminated transition metal oxide, suggesting that under typical highly oxidizing operating conditions for the N2OR (U<sub>RHE</sub>>1.24 V), water oxidation intermediates such as OH are likely to dominate the surface, leading to vanishingly small coverage of adsorbed N2. From this result, we find that direct or dissociative adsorption of N2 is unlikely, suggesting a MvK type mechanism for the N2OR. Probing this mechanism further using DFT, we find that the reaction energetics are largely less favorable than water oxidation due to the high activation barrier for N2 adsorption, which we find to be the rate-determining step for the process. Our experimental findings corroborate these findings, demonstrating that the majority of tested catalysts exhibited poor N2OR selectivity with a rate-determining step involving N2 (g), primarily facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, dynamic potential control emerged as a possible strategy to enhance N2OR activity, as it may limit OER and promote N2 adsorption. This work underscores the challenges in achieving efficient N2OR, highlighting the need for novel catalyst designs and operational strategies, such as electrolyte engineering and dynamic potential control, to overcome the inherent kinetic and thermodynamic barriers.", "date": "2024-08-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Plasma separation cards (PSC) collect and preserve a dried specimen, which makes them practical solutions for decentralized sample collection and transport in limited-resource settings. However, physiological variations in hematocrit levels can introduce significant variability in sample quality and lead to inaccurate test results. In addition to hematocrit-dependent sampling, the Roche PSC, the commercial standard for dried plasma collection, is also known to induce hemolysis, which further reduces specimen quality and impacts concordance with liquid plasma. We address these gaps with the development of a new patterned dried plasma spot (pDPS) card, which generates cell-free plasma with improved hematocrit independence and minimal hemolysis. This study directly compares pDPS cards to the Roche PSC to measure HIV viral load. Analysis of HIV RNA from 75 different donors revealed strong agreement in sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and viral load band placement between collection devices, with quantitative metrics suggesting improved performance for pDPS cards. In reflexive genotyping, remnant dried blood from pDPS cards exhibited greater success in amplification and sequencing (71% v. 62%) and in detecting drug resistance mutations (63% v. 42%) than Roche PSC. These results suggest that pDPS cards could be versatile across multiple analytical platforms, can integrate seamlessly into existing clinical laboratory workflows, and aid clinicians in making informed treatment decisions.

The molecular level information about the mechanism and driving forces for primary-to-secondary micelles transition is still missing. In the current study the micelle formation of 50 mM solutions of taurodeoxycholate (TDC) is studied by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that primary micelles with an aggregation number of 8-10 emerge and persist within the first 50 ns, which then coalesce to form secondary micelles with an aggregation number of 19 molecules. This transition is governed by hydrophobic interactions, which significantly decrease the solvent-accessible surface area per molecule in the secondary micelles.\nThe addition of monomers of the sodium salt of fatty acids (FA) to secondary TDC micelles results in the co-existence of mixed FA-TDC and pure FA micelles. The studied saturated FAs, with chain lengths of C14:0 and C18:0, are incorporated into the micelle core, whereas TDC molecules position themselves around the FAs, forming a shell on the micelle surface. In contrast, the tails of the C18:1 unsaturated fatty acid mix homogeneously with TDC molecules throughout the entire micelle volume. The latter creates a very suitable medium for hosting hydrophobic molecules in the micelles containing unsaturated fatty acids.", "date": "2024-08-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Aiming at large-scale applications, the procedure is implemented in our efficient local natural orbital-based coupled-cluster singles and doubles with per- turbative triples [LNO-CCSD(T)] scheme. To this end, the range-separation function, which characterizes the one-electron BSI in space, is decomposed into the sum of con- tributions from individual localized molecular orbitals (LMOs). A compact domain is constructed around each LMO, and the corresponding contributions are evaluated only within these restricted domains. Furthermore, for the calculation of the com- plementary auxiliary basis set (CABS) correction, which significantly improves the Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) energy, the local density fitting approximation is utilized. The er- rors arising from the local approximations are examined in detail, efficient prescreening techniques are introduced to compress the numerical quadrature used for DBBSC, and conservative default thresholds are selected for the truncation parameters. The effi- ciency of the DBBSC-LNO-CCSD(T) method is demonstrated through representative examples of up to 1000 atoms. Based on the numerical results, we conclude that the corrections drastically reduce the BSI error using double-\u03b6 basis sets, often to below 1 kcal/mol compared to the reliable LNO-CCSD(T) complete basis set references, while significant improvements are also achieved with triple-\u03b6 basis sets.

Our studies reveal two quantum transport characteristics unique to staffanes that emerge from their strained bicyclic structure. First, though staffanes are composed of weakly conjugated C-C \u03c3-bonds, staffanes carry a shallower conductance decay value (\u03b2 = 0.84 \u00b1 0.02 n-1) than alkane chain analogs (\u03b2 = 0.96 \u00b1 0.03 n-1) when measured with the scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM-BJ) technique. Staffanes are thus more conductive than any other \u03c3-bonded organic backbone reported in the literature on a per atom basis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest staffane backbones are more effective conduits for charge transport because their significant bicyclic ring strain destabilizes the HOMO-2 energy, aligning it more closely with the Fermi energy of gold electrodes as oligomer order increases. Second, the monostaffane is significantly lower conducting than expected. DFT calculations suggest that short monostaffanes sterically enforce insulating gauche interelectrode orientations over syn orientations; these steric effects are alleviated in longer staffanes. Moreover, we find that [2-5]staffane wires may accommodate axial mechanical strain by \u201crod-bending\u201d. These findings show for the first time how bicyclic ring strain can enhance charge transmission in saturated molecular wires.

This process can occur by a pathway that generates H2 gas from the aldehyde, known as electro-oxidative dehydrogenation (EOD) or anodic hydrogen production. The EOD process occurs with transfer of only one electron per aldehyde, whereas typical oxidation with discharge of hydrogen to form water is a two-electron process. Here, we study the catalytic activity and selectivity toward H2 of Au, Ag, and Cu electrodes using benzaldehyde with rotating disk and ring-disk electrode (RDE/RRDE) techniques. The average number of electrons per benzaldehyde molecule obtained via H2 detection by RRDE agrees with that obtained via Kouteck\u00fd-Levich analysis conducted at various rotation rates. We find that Au and Ag have much higher H2 and benzoate formation rates than Cu, but that Cu can perform the reaction at about 0.2 V lower overpotentials. On all three materials, benzaldehyde oxidation has high selectivity to anodic H2 (one-electron pathway) below ~0.5 V vs. RHE, but, with increasing potential, the selectivity shifts to H-oxidation forming water (two-electron pathway).", "date": "2024-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Analytical Chemistry; Energy; Electrochemical Analysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Identification of isomers can provide insights into drug pharmacology and contribute to better design of drug molecules. The general approaches to differentiate isomers include Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and circular dichroism. Although proven effective, a commonly used method to differentiate isomers is chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). Notably, MS is routinely applied in leucine and isoleucine differentiation to facilitate protein sequencing. This work focuses on isomer differentiation of widely applied thio-succinimide structure bridging the antibody backbone and linker-payload of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The hydrolysis of thio-succinimide stabilizes the payload-protein structure while generating a pair of constitutional isomers: thio-aspartyl and thio-isoaspartyl. \nMethods\nThis paper introduces a hybrid method using ligand binding assay (LBA) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to reveal isomerization details of thio-succinimide hydrolysis over time in plasma samples incubated with ADC. By applying two orthogonal dissociation methods, collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron-activated dissociation (EAD), this pair of isomers showed different MS/MS spectra. This observation enables a unique approach in distinguishing thio-succinimide hydrolysis isomers. \nResults\nWe observed signature [R1+Thio+57+H]+, [R2+Succ+H2O-57+H]+ and [R2+Succ+H2O-44+2H]2+ product ions that differentiated thio-aspartyl and thio-isoaspartyl isomers using EAD. A newly discovered [R2+ThioSucc+H2O-44+2H]2+ ion also served as additional evidence that further supported our findings. \nConclusions\nThis study is a first-to-date identification of thio-succinimide hydrolysis isomers without using synthesized reference materials. This approach should be applicable to all thio-succinimide-linked molecules. Correct identification of thio-succinimide hydrolysis isomers may eventually benefit the development of ADCs in the future.\n\n", "date": "2024-08-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, the transport and thermoelectric properties of the recently synthesized bulk BiN are explored, including the effects of temperature, pressure, carrier concentration, polymorphism and polycrystalline grain size. We find that the band structure is strongly dependent on pressure and the polymorph studied. Both polymorphs exhibit low thermal conductivity at 0 GPa, which rapidly increases when pressure is applied. Electronic transport properties can be finely tuned based on the effects of pressure and polymorph type on the band gap, carrier mobilities, and presence of secondary pockets. The thermoelectric figure of merit can reach values around 0.85 for both p- and n-type BiN if the power factor and lattice thermal conductivity are optimized at 600 K, making this material competitive with other well-known thermoelectric families, such as Bi2Te3 or PbX, in the low-to-medium temperature range.", "date": "2024-08-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These salts served as carbene precursors for the subsequent formation of nitrile-functionalized asymmetrical silver(I) di-NHC complexes (Ag1 \u2013 Ag9) (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) through an in-situ deprotonation method using Ag2O. Comprehensive characterization of the bis-benzimidazolium salts and their corresponding dinuclear silver(I) di-NHC complexes was performed using melting point determination, CHN elemental analyses, FTIR, and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy.

We revealed the reason why two different triplet transient species, 3CT and 3BDP, can co-exist only for BDP-PXZ as observed in the previous study with the TR-EPR measurements. It was found that the state mixing of 3CT enables the transition from 1CT to 3CT and 3BDP states only for BDP-PXZ . This mixing effect is commonly seen in the singlet states of twisted intermolecular charge transfer molecules, though the key factor that determines the mixing of the excited states of the dyes was found to be the electron-donating ability of the substituents rather than their steric hindrance. The mechanism was corroborated by comparing the spin polarization ratio of the triplet spin-sublevels measured by the TR-EPR with the theoretical predictions. The spin polarization ratio of the triplets should contain information about the transition via intersystem crossing, e.g. the twisted angle of two chromophores of the dyad, and thus it can be a powerful tool to analyze the molecular mechanism of photochemical processes at the electronic structure level.

The constant evolution of New Approach Methodologies (NAM) has inspired researchers around the globe to deviate from conventional approaches and adopt or develop new, \u201cunconventional\u201d methods. The classification Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (c-RASAR) is an unconventional approach that utilizes similarity and error-based information from the nearest neighboring compounds into a Machine Learning modeling framework, resulting in enhanced predictivity. Although this technique has so far been applied to molecular descriptors, we have applied this approach in the present study on molecular fingerprints along with conventional molecular descriptors for ML-based model development from a recently reported highly curated set of orally active nephrotoxic drugs. We initially developed ML models using nine different linear and non-linear algorithms separately on molecular descriptors and MACCS fingerprints, thus generating 18 different ML QSAR models. Using the chemical spaces defined by the modeling descriptors and fingerprints, the similarity and error-based RASAR descriptors were computed, and the most discriminating RASAR descriptors were used to develop another set of 18 different ML c-RASAR models. All 36 models were cross-validated 20 times with a 5-fold cross-validation strategy, and their predictivity was checked on the test set data. A multi-criteria decision-making strategy \u2013 the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach - was adopted to identify the best-performing model based on robustness and external validation parameters. This statistical analysis suggested that the c-RASAR models had an overall good performance, while the best-performing model was also a c-RASAR model. This model was used to screen a true external set data prepared from the known nephrotoxic compounds of DrugBankDB. These results also showed that our model efficiently identifies nephrotoxic compounds. The t-SNE analyses on the descriptors, fingerprints, and the RASAR descriptor spaces inferred that the RASAR descriptors efficiently encode the chemical information, as evident from the tight and distinct clustering of the data points.

PdnL2n cages are amongst the most structurally diverse, with subtle differences in the metal-ligand coordination vectors resulting in drastically different assemblies, however almost all rely on rigid aromatic linkers to avoid the formation of intractable mixtures. Here we exploit the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine linker groups and alkene reagents to trigger structural changes induced by post-assembly modification. The structure of the 1,4-dihydropyridazine produced by IEDDA (often an afterthought in click chemistry) is crucial; its two sp3 centers increase flexibility and non-planarity, drastically changing the range of accessible coordination vectors. This triggers an initial Pd4L8 tetrahedral cage to transform into different Pd2L4 lantern cages, with both the transformation extent (thermodynamics) and rate (kinetics) dependent on the alkene dienophile selected. With cyclopentene, the unsymmetrical 1,4-dihydropyridazine ligands undergo integrative sorting in the solid state, with both head-to-tail orientation and enantiomer selection, leading to a single isomer from the 39 possible. This preference is rationalized through entropy, symmetry, and hydrogen bonding. Subsequent oxidation of the 1,4-dihydropyridazine to the aromatic pyridazine rigidifies the ligands, restoring planarity. The oxidized ligands no longer fit in the lantern structure, inducing further structural transformations into Pd4L8 tetrahedra and Pd3L6 double-walled triangles.

Although such erroneous behavior of the D3 model is relatively rare, it can occur across a wide range of chemical species, including molecules like the [Li(C6H6)]+ complex and the dispiro(acridan)-substituted pyracene (DSAP) molecule. Our analysis reveals that the root of the problem lies in the definition of the AB atomic-pair dependent C6AB coefficients in the D3 model. To address this issue, we propose a re-parameterization of the D3 model by introducing a modified C6AB functional form that now depends on the specific pair of considered atoms. This new model, termed D3-Smooth (or D3S for short), is designed to smooth out the PES associated with the dispersion correction. By doing so, we demonstrate that D3S eliminates unphysical local minima while maintaining the quite satisfactory accuracy of the parent D3 method in interaction energy benchmark sets. For example, the RMS difference between using the D3(BJ) correction to B3LYP and the D3S(BJ) correction across the large MGCDB84 dataset of nearly 5000 data points is only 0.12 kJ/mol. Similar results are obtained for every other D3-corrected functional tested. Consistent with this result, no significant improvement could be obtained for the B3LYP-D3S(0) correction by reoptimizing the damping function.", "date": "2024-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

LCMS-based assays enable Drug-Antibody Ratio (DAR) sensitive quantification of conjugated payload. For quantitative DAR-sensitive assessment by LC-MS/MS, typically the conjugated payload is enzymatically liberated and quantified. Despite recent advances in ADC bioanalytical methods, the DAR-sensitive quantification of non-cleavable linker ADCs by LC-MS/MS remains challenging. Thus, we developed a novel digestion-free middle-down mass spectrometry (DF-MDMS) using collision-induced dissociation approach for absolute quantification of conjugated payload for four different ADCs in biological matrix with minimum sample preparation. These results demonstrate that ADCs with different linker-payload structures can be quantified, including a non-cleavable linker ADC trastuzumab emtansine.

For such ASDs, water-soluble polymer excipients, such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) or poly(vinyl pyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (P(VP-co-VA)), are employed to solubilize and stabilize the drug against crystallization. We posit that polymers bearing tertiary amides are particularly well suited to stabilizing drugs containing H-bond donors, as they offer strong H-bonding potential between the polymer and drug. The aim of this study was to compare new and established polymers with tertiary amides as excipients for ASDs. Experimental amphiphilic ABA triblock copolymers comprising poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (pMeOx), poly(2-butyl-2-oxazoline) (pBuOx) and poly(2-butyl-2-oxazine) (pBuOzi) blocks, were compared with the established excipients, PVP and P(VP-co-VA). ASDs with indomethacin as the model drug were prepared at high drug loadings via hot melt extrusion. The extrudates were studied with DSC and PXRD, revealing the ASDs to be fully amorphous up to 75wt% indomethacin, independent of the polymer used. 13C CPMAS NMR provided insights into intermolecular associations as a function of drug loading, and suggested the presence of drug dimers at 75wt% drug loading in pMeOx-pBuOzi-pMeOx and pMeOx-pBuOx-pMeOx, which could affect physical stability. Independent of the polymers, the solid-state form of the drug in the ASD was found to affect the dissolution profile of the samples, insofar as the samples containing crystalline indomethacin showed slower dissolution than the fully amorphous ones. This study shows that the polymers comprising poly(2-oxazoline) and poly(2-oxazine) are effective polymers for ASD preparation, similar to PVP and P(VP-co-VA) which merits futher investigations into these novel polymers for formulating ASDs.", "date": "2024-08-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Materials Processing; Analytical Chemistry - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This limitation has hindered the use of computational methods to develop small molecule drugs that modulate the activity of nucleic acids, including those associated with anticancer, antiviral and antibacterial effects. In recent years, significant scientific and technological advances as well as easier access to compute resources have contributed to free-energy perturbation (FEP) becoming one of the most consistently reliable approaches for predicting relative binding affinities of ligands to proteins. Nevertheless, FEP\u2019s applicability to nucleic-acid targeting ligands has remained largely undetermined. In this work, we present a systematic assessment of the accuracy of FEP, as implemented in the FEP+ software and facilitated by improvements in the OPLS4 force field, in predicting relative binding free energies of congeneric series of ligands interacting with a variety of DNA/RNA systems. The study encompassed more than 100 ligands exhibiting diverse binding modes, some partially exposed and others deeply buried.  Using a consistent simulation protocol, more than half of the predictions are within 1 kcal/mol of the experimentally measured values. Across the dataset, we report a combined average pairwise root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 1.39 kcal/mol, which falls within one log unit of the experimentally measured dissociation constants.

Modern glycoproteomic methods often employ multiple dissociation techniques within a single LC-MS/MS analysis, but this approach frequently sacrifices sensitivity when analyzing multiple glycopeptide classes simultaneously. Here we explore the utility of intelligent data acquisition for glycoproteomics through real-time library searching (RTLS) to match oxonium ion patterns for on-the-fly selection of the appropriate dissociation method. By matching dissociation method with glycopeptide class, this autonomous dissociation-type selection (ADS) generates equivalent numbers of N-glycopeptide identifications relative to traditional beam-type collisional activation methods while also yielding comparable numbers of site-localized O-glycopeptide identifications relative to conventional electron transfer dissociation-based methods.

In a variety of carboxylic acid derivatives, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) has been recognized as a binder of the largest affinity to the Yersinia PTP (YopH). Herein, the underlying specificity of ATA, as a reversible and competitive inhibitor of several PTPs (YopH, PTP1B, TCPTP, HePTP, CD45, VHR, and Cdc25A), is explored. By observing each PTP as a primary target receptor and the rest of them as simultaneous secondary receptors, the specificity factor, as a function of ligand concentration, shows at lower [ATA] (between 10-11 and 10-9 M) a 23 to 500-fold specificity in favor of YopH versus the other PTPs, indicating that the ATA-YopH interaction is the most specific. Near [ATA] = 10-8 M, the specificity factor \u22481 is associated with equal occupancy of the primary receptor YopH and the set of secondary receptors. When observing YopH as a primary receptor relative to every other single PTP as a secondary receptor at [ATA] \u03f5 (10-11, 10-9 M), the specificity to YopH is larger nearly 6, 25, 25, 40, 100, and 120 times than that to PTP1B, HePTP, CD45, TCPTP, Cdc25A, and VHR, respectively.

It is well rationalized that the binding of ATA to the active site (403-Cys-Arg-Ala-Gly-Val-Gly-Arg-Thr-410) of YopH is affected by the conformational dynamics of the proximal WPD loop (352-Gly-Asn-Trp-Pro-Asp-Gln-Thr-Ala-Val-Ser-361). The helix \u03b14 spanning loop L4 (384-Glu-Ser-Lys-Gly-Ser-Ser-Ala-Val-Ala-392) was experimentally observed as a potential second binding site in YopH structure. The association of L4 with the conformational flexibility of the WPD loop was related to the stability of the WPD loop in the closed, active conformation. Thus, the proposed cooperativity between the WPD loop and L4 in substrate recognition is herein characterized by the Hill coefficient of the log(f/1-f)-log[ligand concentration] binding isotherm, where f denotes the fraction of YopH receptors occupied by ATA. Observed positive cooperativity suggests L4 as an allosteric site in YopH structure. Although there is no YopH homology in Staphylococcus aureus, the off-target effects of ATA can not be precluded. Considering the ability of ATA to bind to the Staphylococcus aureus serine/threonine phosphatase STP1 directly, the specificity factor indicates a roughly 100-fold preference for YopH over STP1.

Although the antioxidant properties of curcumin and its derivatives have been widely studied in the literature, a systematical investigation of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction towards hydroperoxide (HOO\u2022), the standardized free radicals, has still been lacking. This work investigated the HOO\u2022 radical scavenging activities of two curcumin derivatives, namely curcumin I (Cur-I) and curcumin III (Cur-III), in water and pentyl ethanoate (PEA) solutions using Density functional theory (DFT) approaches. The antioxidant properties of the neutral and anionic forms of two tautomers, including keto-enol and diketone of curcumin, were investigated via three common mechanisms, i.e., hydrogen transfer (HT), radical adduct formation (RAF) and single electron transfer (SET). Intrinsic parameters, thermochemical parameters, and kinetics of the curcumin-HOO radical reactions were systematically characterized. As a result, the overall rate constant for the reaction in the water of Cur-I (9.36  107 M-1 s-1) is about three times higher than the one of Cur-III (2.60  107 M-1 s-1). Meanwhile, the ones in the PEA solvent are less significant, being 4.02  101 M-1 s-1 and 8.16 102 M-1 s-1, respectively. Because of the dominant molar fraction of the keto-enol form compared to that of the diketone, the reaction rates were contributed mainly by the keto-enol form. Finally, the chemical nature of the HT processes was analyzed in detail, and it was found that all the most predominant HT reactions at the phenolic -OH groups (i.e., O22H and O23H) occurred via the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process.

The smart contrast agents (SCAs) that may appear the important element of the proper diagnosis specification should become the standard in a normal clinical practice. Most widely used contrast agents are the kinetically inert and thermodynamically stable complexes of organic ligands with Gd(III) metal ion. However, known safety concerns associated with high toxicity and severe side effects due to demetallization reactions leading to the formation of free Gd(III) ion necessitate the demand in the contrast agents of new generation. It is expected that one of the alternatives will be ML complexes with essential paramagnetic metals such as the Mn(II), Mn(III) and Fe(III). In this study, the experimental data on Mn(II)-based contrast agents (CAs) including the key functional characteristics such as the relaxation enhancement characteristics, kinetic inertness and thermodynamic stability were analyzed. The machine learning methods were used in a combination with the physicochemical and substructure(topology)-based features to estimate the missed experimental data concerned the thermodynamic stability and relaxivity characteristics evaluated at certain conditions. The analysis of the experimental data has shown that the bispidine scaffold can be considered as the reference point for the ligand search as providing with a sufficient compromise for all the investigated functional characteristics of CAs. The analysis of the literature suggests using iodine and fluorine substituents for the electronic and steric hindrance thus preventing the cleavage of the bonds while the histidine residue can be recommended for the pH sensitivity of MRI CAs while targeting the OATPs (organic anion transporting polypeptides) to achieve the hepatobiliary clearance as well as for the enhanced contrast for hepatobiliary system thus personalizing the MRI investigation.

Nitriles (C\u2261N) have been widely used as VSE probes, but their application has been complicated by an anomalous hydrogen bond (HB) blueshift which is not encompassed within the VSE framework. We present an empirical model describing the anomalous HB blueshift in terms of H-bonding geometry, i.e. as a function of HB distance and angle with respect to the C\u2261N group. This model is obtained by comparing vibrational observables from density functional theory and electrostatics from the polarizable AMOEBA force field, and it provides a physical explanation for the HB blueshift in terms of underlying multipolar and Pauli repulsion contributions. Additionally, we compare predicted blueshifts with experimental results and find our model provides a useful, direct framework to analyze HB geometry for rigid HBs, such as within proteins or chemical frameworks. In contrast, nitriles in highly dynamic H-bonding environments like protic solvents are no longer a function solely of geometry; this is a consequence of motional narrowing, which we demonstrate by simulating IR spectra. Overall, when HB geometry and dynamics are accounted for, an excellent correlation is found between observed and predicted HB blueshifts. This correlation includes different types of nitriles and HB donors, suggesting that our model is general and can aid in understanding HB blueshifts wherever nitriles can be implemented.", "date": "2024-08-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Compared with C-only or N-only reduction reactions, co-electrolysis to generate structurally complicated and functionally diverse C\u2013N bonds are highly desirable yet more challenging. Oximes, which contain C=N bonds, are important precursors in medicine and fine chemical industry.

WE is particularly useful for determining kinetic properties, like rates of protein (un)folding and ligand (un)binding, where transition rates can be calculated from the flux of trajectories into a target basin of interest.   However, this flux depends exponentially on the number of splitting events that a given trajectory experiences before reaching the target state, and can vary by orders of magnitude between WE replicates.   Markov state models (MSM) are helpful tools to aggregate information across multiple WE simulations and have previously been shown to provide more accurate transition rates than WE alone.   Discrete-time MSMs are models that coarsely describe the evolution of the system from one discrete state to the next using a discrete lagtime, \u03c4.   When building an MSM using conventional MD data, longer values of \u03c4 typically provide more accurate results.   Combining WE simulations with Markov state modeling presents some additional challenges, especially when using a value of \u03c4 that exceeds the lagtime between  resampling steps in the WE algorithm, \u03c4_WE.   Here we identify a source of bias that occurs when \u03c4 > \u03c4_WE, which we refer to as \"merging bias\".   We also propose an algorithm to eliminate the merging bias, which results in merge-bias corrected MSMs, or \"MBC-MSMs\".   Using a simple model system, as well as a complex biomolecular example, we show that MBC-MSMs significantly outperform both \u03c4=\u03c4_WE MSMs and uncorrected MSMs at longer lagtimes.", "date": "2024-08-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Importantly, peptide coating did not suppress reactive oxygen species generation of TiO2 NPs, hence UV illumination triggered pronounced degradation of LPS and LTA by peptide-coated TiO2 NPs. Structural aspects of oxidative degradation were investigated by neutron reflectometry for smooth LPS, showing that degradation occurred preferentially in its outer O-antigen tails.

Chromium chalcogenide spinels are a class of materials that epitomize this dilemma; their unique magnetic and magneto-optical properties make them promising for applications in spintronics, data storage, and quantum information sciences, but only a few compositions have been synthesized as colloidal nanocrystals. Furthermore, these few existing reports lack mechanistic understanding and demonstrate little control over the physical characteristics of the final products. Here, we set forth to understand the synthesis of CuCr2Se4 nanocrystals by examining how the structure, composition, and magnetic properties evolve over the course of the reaction. We find that the material proceeds through binary copper selenide nanocrystal intermediates followed by Cr incorporation via diffusion. This process results in polycrystalline CuCr2Se4 nanocrystals that do not exhibit magnetic ordering until Cu incorporation modifies their stoichiometry and defects are annealed, which takes approximately forty minutes at 340 \u00b0C to achieve. The resulting CuCr2Se4 nanocrystals show a strongly enhanced magnetic circular dichroism signal at the bulk plasma frequency of \u210f\u03c9_pl ~ 1.0 eV with a field dependence that reflects magnetization of the Cr3+ spin sublattice.

Here we demonstrate that shake effects are prominent specifically in the K\u03b1 XES from 3d transition metal systems with nominally zero valence electrons, i.e., 3d^0 systems. First, we demonstrate that valence level shake satellites are amplified via interference due to a resonance between the 2p3/2-hole (K\u03b11) plus valence level shake state, and the 2p1/2-hole (K\u03b12) state. Second, the shake satellite from the K\u03b12 transition is indeed predicted to be weak, but is experimentally observed here, providing further independent verification of our model.

This idea, initially based on numerical analyses with the ST2 water-like empirical potential, challenged conventional understanding of water\u2019s phase behavior at the time and has since intrigued the scientific community. Over the past three decades, advancements in computational modeling \u2013 particularly through the advent of data-driven many-body potentials rigorously derived from \u201cfirst principles\u201d and augmented by the efficiency of neural networks \u2013 have significantly enhanced the accuracy of molecular simulations, enabling the exploration of the phase behavior of water with unprecedented realism. Our study leverages these computational advances to probe the elusive liquid-liquid tran- sition in supercooled water. Microsecond-long simulations with chemical accuracy, conducted over several years, provide compelling evidence that water indeed exists in two discernibly distinct liquid states at low temperature and high pressure.

Many investigations have focused on developing methodologies that provide accurate uncertainty estimates for ML-based predictions. Unfortunately, there is no UQ strategy that consistently provides robust estimates about model\u2019s applicability on new samples.

X-ray analysis revealed that Nq[10]CPP display a side by side packing via naphthoquione stacking while Aq[10]CPP adopts an intercalated conformation through anthraquinone interaction. Fluorescence investigations revealed that the quinone-based [10]CPPs display distinctive acceptor-dependent dual-emission from both the locally excited state and charge transfer state after single-wavelength excitation in organic solvents, consequently leading to multicolor emissions, in particular, white-light emission in CHCl3 for Aq[10]CPP. In THF/water mixture, quinone-based [10]CPPs and oxTh[10]CPP display a wide range of fluorescence emissions including white-light emission as increasing the fraction of water, accompanying by the formation of nanoparticles as demonstrated by Tyndall effect and SEM. Interestingly, the fluorescence of Aq[10]CPP can be switched from white to blue in CHCl3 upon redox. Our investigations demonstrate that acceptor engineering not only endows quinone-based [10]CPPs with two distint emissive states for achieving white-light emission but also highlights an effective post-synthetic strategy for functionlizing CPP nanohoops with disirable property.", "date": "2024-08-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite decades of intense research, the understanding of the detailed processes involved is still limited, particularly under photochemical conditions. Recent research has shown that the overall kinetics of water oxidation by a molecular dyad depends on the coordination between the photocharge generation and the subsequent chemical steps. This work explores similar effects by heterogeneous solar water oxidation systems. By varying a key variable, the reaction temperature, we discovered distinctly different behaviors on two model systems, TiO2 and Fe2O3. TiO2 exhibited a monotonically increasing water oxidation performance with rising temperatures across the entire applied potential range, between 0.1 V and 1.5 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In contrast, Fe2O3 showed increased performance with temperature at high applied potentials (>1.2 V vs. RHE)  but decreased performance at low applied potentials (<1.2 V vs. RHE). This decrease in performance with temperature on Fe2O3 was attributed to increased electron-hole recombination, as confirmed by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). The origin of the differing temperature dependences on TiO2 and Fe2O3 was further ascribed to their different surface chemical kinetics. These results highlight the chemical nature of charge recombination in photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, where surface electrons recombine with holes stored in surface chemical species. It also indicates that PEC kinetics are not constrained by a single rate determining chemical step, highlighting the importance of an integrated approach to studying the system. Moreover, the results suggest that for practical solar water splitting devices, higher temperatures are not always beneficial for reaction rates, especially under low driving force conditions.", "date": "2024-08-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The mechanistic aspects of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed in this study. The extent of branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or just a single generation. The absence of further branching from the initial branches is the most distinguishing characteristic of a spherulite. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on initially fast-grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive over time, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and branching. These branching forms triangular branches fully connected to the rod surface, eventually growing longer than the central rod.

There is growing interest in unraveling the roles of epitranscriptome in cancer. Among all the known RNA modifications, 6 different modifications have been individually linked to GBM. In one of those earlier studies, Zhao and his associates reported TMZ treatment would induce higher expression of METTL3, which is one of the writers for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. By combining the TMZ treatment with METTL3 silencing, the growth of TMZ-resistant xenograft was suppressed. To achieve untargeted epitranscriptome-wide analysis, our group has recently developed a mass spectrometric method that can accurately quantify each RNA modification despite its identity. \nAim: In this pilot study, we aim to use an epitranscriptome-wide approach to identify a new potential target for alleviating the resistance of GBM cells to TMZ treatment. \nMethods and Results: In this study, patient-derived GBM cell lines that were classified as TMZ-sensitive or TMZ-resistant were chosen as in vitro models. Using our developed method, the epitranscriptomes of selected GBM cell lines were profiled. By comparing the epitranscriptomic profiles, upregulated RNA modifications were identified and correlated to the TMZ resistance. One of the most upregulated modifications is N6-methyl-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (m6t6A). The association of m6t6A upregulation to TMZ resistance was confirmed by comparing the epitranscriptomes in xenografts with either primary or recurrent GBM cells. Aiming to resensitize TMZ-resistant GBM cells, the writer for m6t6A modification, known as tRNA methyltransferase O (TRMO), in selected TMZ-resistant GBM cell cultures was knocked down. The resulting cells were resensitized to lower dosages of TMZ. \nConclusion: This pilot study demonstrates the use of comprehensive epitranscriptomic profiling is a feasible approach for identifying specific RNA writer of RNA modifications as a knockdown target for resensitizing GBM cells to TMZ treatment. \n", "date": "2024-08-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For the electrochemical systems, we study how column size varies as a function of molecular properties and operating conditions, finding that parameters most closely related to CO2 uptake rates (i.e., rate constants and pKa) have the greatest impact. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the direct process can be designed to have column sizes similar to the thermochemical process, however, the CO2 uptake rate in the indirect process is too slow to enable smaller columns.

Here, we developed a large-pore mesoporous carbon with pore sizes centered around 20-30 nm using a templated technical lignin. During the soft-templating process, unique cylindrical supramolecular assemblies form from the copolymer template, distinct from other systems reported thus far. This peculiar nanostructuring takes place due to the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) segments on both the Pluronic\u00ae template and the PEG-grafted lignin derivative (glycol lignin). A large increase in CO2 uptake occurs on the resulting large-pore mesoporous carbon at 270 K close to the saturation pressure, owing to capillary condensation. This phenomenon enables outstanding CO2/CH4 selectivity, and a swift regeneration process with desorbed CO2 per unit pressure far outperforming other nanoporous carbons. We propose large-pore mesoporous carbons as a novel family of CO2 capture adsorbents, based on the phase-transition behavior shift of CO2 in the nanoconfined environment, that is, the early condensation of CO2 in mesopores below the bulk saturation pressure under relevant conditions.

However, current computer-assisted chemoenzymatic synthesis planning tools lack a heuristic method to unify step-by-step chemoenzymatic synthesis planning and molecule-by-molecule identification of chemo-/biocatalysis opportunities in synthesis routes. Here we develop an asynchronous chemoenzymatic retrosynthesis planning algorithm (ACERetro) which employs a search strategy that prioritizes the exploration of a molecule's promising catalytic methods. The suitability of a molecule to be synthesized via chemo- or biocatalysis is quantitatively evaluated by a data-driven Synthetic Potential Score (SPScore) using a neural network model. Additionally, the SPScore can be used to heuristically identify chemo-/biocatalysis opportunities in synthesis routes. For a given synthesis route, this algorithm uses SPScore to identify the molecules that offer optimization potential when synthesized by an alternative catalytic method, and then ACERetro is used to search synthesis routes. Case studies on synthesis planning for ethambutol and epidiolex demonstrate that our strategy can design concise chemoenzymatic synthesis routes by applying enzymatic steps to introduce stereochemistry and find shortcuts. Moreover, case studies on synthesis route optimization for rivastigmine and (R,R)-formoterol demonstrate how our strategy finds bypasses to form alternative, shorter chemoenzymatic synthesis routes. Our findings demonstrate that ACERetro with evaluating the synthetic potential of molecules represents a versatile and effective search framework for chemoenzymatic synthesis planning.

Consequently, they represent about half of all drug targets. Small molecule drugs have been most commonly used to target membrane proteins, particularly G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. However, these small molecules can lack selectivity and produce side effects. Biotherapeutics offer the potential to target specific conformations of proteins, thereby improving potency and selectivity. However, membrane proteins present significant challenges for biotherapeutic development, especially from their instability, insolubility, and limited expression levels. In this chapter, we explore biotherapeutic targeting of different families of membrane proteins, strategies to solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins for analysis, and mass spectrometry approaches to study their structure and interactions. Our focus will be primarily on biotherapeutic applications, but we will draw on promising emerging technologies that have been used in structural biology.", "date": "2024-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Furthermore, many in silico approaches have been developed for permeability prediction.\nMeta-analysis of publicly available databases for permeability data (MolMeDB and ChEMBL) was performed to establish their usability. Firstly, experimental data can only be measured between thresholds for the lowest and highest permeation rate obtainable within physical boundaries. These thresholds vary strongly between methods. Secondly, computed data do not obey these thresholds but, on the other hand, can produce incorrect results. Thirdly, even for the same method and molecule, there is often a strong discrepancy between individual measured values. These differences are based not only on the statistics but also on the varying approaches and evaluation of the measured data.

Consequently, there is a growing need for modeling approaches that effectively integrate the real-space molecular perspective employed by computational chemists and the reciprocal-space dispersive perspective employed by computational physicists. Here, we propose the localized active space (LAS) approach as a promising method to successfully bridge this gap. The LAS approach extends the active space concept from multiconfigurational methods such as complete active space self-consistent field theory to multiple molecular fragments via a product-form wave function ansatz. This concept is applied naturally to solid state phenomena by treating each unit cell as a molecular fragment with different sets of local quantum numbers (e.g., charge and excitation number). State interaction between these LAS states (LASSI) thus provides a comprehensive basis for the study of charge and energy transfer. We show how the LAS approach allows for the computation of multiconfigurational band structures. Additionally, we apply the approach to several one-dimensional model systems to demonstrate its capacity to treat sophisticated phenomenon such as excitation at p-n junctions and metal-to-insulator transitions.", "date": "2024-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

One critical limitation of current methods in NTA is the lack of available analytical standards for many of the compounds detected in biological and environmental samples. Computational approaches can provide estimates of concentrations by modeling the ionization efficiency of a compound expressed as the relative response factor (RRF). In this paper, we explore the application of molecular dynamics (MD) in the development of a predictive model for RRF.  We obtained measurements of RRF for 48 compounds with LC - quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS and calculated their RRF by dividing the observed peak areas by their concentrations. We used the CGenFF force field to generate the topologies and GROMACS to conduct the (MD) simulations (t = 1 ns). We calculated the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions between the analytes and all other molecules in the ESI droplet, which were then used to construct a multilinear regression model for predicting RRF.  The best performing model showed a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.13 log units. This performance is comparable to other predictive models including machine learning models. While there is a need for further evaluation of diverse chemical structures, our approach showed great promise in predictions of RRF.

Using a neutral Np(VI) complex supported by a chelating and strongly donating pentadentate ligand that was fully characterized in prior work, a clean Np(VI)/Np(V) redox couple was found to be accessible under ambient conditions. Coupled electrochemical and spectroscopic studies, as well as simulations of cyclic voltammetry data, confirm the 1e\u2212 nature of this couple and establish it to be chemically reversible and nearly electrochemically reversible as well.

Thymidylate synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtbThyX) recognizes the deprotonated substrate dUMP(d) (ionized at N3, charge = -3) involving cationic side-chain of Arg199, whereas the human analog (hThyA) select the natural substrate dUMP (charge = -2) by involving polar side-chain of Asn226 in the binding pocket. Distinctly different protonation states of the substrate and the catalytic pocket architecture make MtbThyX an attractive drug target for combating Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP) is a known inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, which is severely limited by poor selectivity (more potent against hThyA relative to MtbThyX). Using FdUMP as a template, we designed three drug-like ligands, L1, L2, and L3, by (1) removing the proton from the Watson-Crick edge and (2) substituting the ketone/hydroxyl group by fluorine and or carboxylic moiety. The absence of a proton on the N3 atom of the ligand is intended to ensure selectivity by favoring MtbThyX binding (skipping the N3 ionization requirement) but penalizing hThyA binding (disrupting the interaction with Asn226). Ionization of the carboxyl group in the ligands was expected to increase the affinity in the cationic binding pocket of MtbThyX. Alchemical simulations confirmed that the designed ligands are strongly favored and disfavored relative to the substrate (dUMP) by MtbThyX and hThyA, respectively. In contrast to hThyA, the catalytic pocket of MtbThyX proved to be relatively dry and stabilized the relatively compact conformation of the ligand (which had a noticeable effect on the sugar puckering). Favorable protein-ligand electrostatic interaction in the dry MtbThyX pocket strongly favored ligand binding. In contrast, the interaction between the Watson-Crick edge of ligands and hThyA was compromised, resulting in water exposure. Ligand L2 is particularly advantageous for its highest affinity for MtbThyX and weak affinity for hThyA. The L2:MtbThyX complex is stabilized by a new salt-bridge interaction (COO- of L2\u2026Arg107 of protein) and a bridging water molecule (between COO- of L2 and E92 of protein) in the binding pocket. Moreover, our estimated pKa of -8 unit of N3 (dUMP) in the MtbThyX catalytic pocket indicated the strong acidic nature of the uracil, corroborating previous experimental and computational claims. These findings provide insights into the protein-ligand binding affinity in atomic details and a rational approach for inhibitor design against MtbThyX.

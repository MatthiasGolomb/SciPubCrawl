Oxidation of electron-donating thioalkyl substituents to electron-withdrawing sulfoxides or sulfones is a particularly effective modification. However, so far, this reaction has not been studied for the modification of conjugated polymers used in organic electronics. Crucial questions regarding selectivity and reaction time waited to be addressed. Here, we show that the reaction is highly selective and complete within just a few minutes when using dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) for the oxidation of thioalkyl substituents attached to the well investigated conjugated polymers poly(9-(1-octylnonyl)carbazole-alt-4,7-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT). The selectivity was confirmed by comparison with polymers obtained from pre-oxidized monomers and by control experiments using related polymers without thioalkyl substituents. Using DMDO, the oxidation yields acetone as the only side-product, which reduces the work-up to mere evaporation of solvents and excessive reagent. Our results show that this oxidation is an exciting method for the preparation of electron-deficient conjugated polymers. It may even allow the preparation of electron acceptors for solar cells directly from the electron donors.", "date": "2019-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Thin Films; Conducting polymers; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Photoionization-efficiency (PIE) spectrum of molecular beam conditions in energy range 8 - 11 eV were determined by Kaiser et al. and they were analyzed using time-dependent density functional theory calculations (TDDFT). CASSCF calculations and PIE spectra simulations by one-photon excitation equations were used to optimize the cationic excited (D1) and neutral ground (S0) state structures of naphthalene isomers. The photoionization-efficiency curve was attributed to the S0 \uf0ae D1 electronic transition in naphthalene, and a curve origin was used at 8.14 eV. The ionization-induced geometry changes of the bases are consistent with the shapes of the corresponding molecular orbitals. The displaced harmonic oscillator approximation and Franck-Condon approximation were used to simulate the PIE curve of the D1 \uf0ac S0 transition of naphthalene, and the main vibronic transitions were assigned for the \u03c0\u03c0* state. It shows that the vibronic structures were dominated by one of the xxx active totally symmetric modes, with v8 being the most crucial. This indicates that the electronic transition of the D1 state calculated in the adiabatic representation effectively includes a contribution from the adiabatic vibronic coupling through Franck-Condon factors perturbed by harmonic oscillators.

These calculations were combined with the Rice\u2013Ramsperger\u2013Kassel\u2013Marcus (RRKM) calculations of reaction rate constants for predicting product-branching ratios, which depend on the collision energy under single-collision conditions. The results show that the initial reaction begins with the formation of an intermediate t-i2, with entrance barriers of 3.8 kcal/mol, and an intermediate s-i1 without entrance barriers. On the triplet surface, the t-i2 rearranged the other C6H2 isomers, including t-i3, t-i4, and t-i6, through hydrogen migration; the t-i2, t-i3, t-i4, t-i5, and t-i6 isomers lost a hydrogen atom, and produced the most stable linear isomer of C6H, with an overall reaction exothermicity of 11 kcal/mol. Hydrogen elimination from the t-i10 isomer led to the formation of the annular C6H isomer, HC3C3 + H, at 23.9 kcal/mol above l-C4 + C2H2. On the singlet surfaces, s-i1 rearranged the other C6H2 isomers, including s-i2 and s-i4, through carbon\u2013carbon bond cleavage. The s-i6 and s-i11 isomers also lost a hydrogen atom, and produced the linear C6H radical. Hydrogen elimination from the s-i4 isomer led to the formation of the annular C6H isomer. The s-i5 lost a hydrogen atom, and produced the six-member ring c-C6H isomer, at 2.1 kcal/mol higher than l-C4 + C2H2. The 1,1-H2 loss from the s-i10 isomer produced the linear hexacarbon l-C6 + H2 product, with an endothermicity of 2.3 kcal/mol and a 1,1-H2 loss from the s-i11 isomer, producing in the cyclic hexacarbon c-C6 + H2 product, with an exothermicity of 11.2 kcal/mol. The product-branching ratios obtained by solving kinetic equations with individual rate constants calculated using the RRKM and VTST theories for determining the collision energies between 5 kcal/mol and 25 kcal/mol show that l-C6H + H is the dominant reaction product, whereas HC3C3 + H, l-C6 + H2, c-C6H + H, and c-C6 + H2 are minor products with branching ratios.

This unique property of LTO offers the practical ability in controlling infrared-induced heating with minimal effect on transmission of visible light.

All of these systems suffer from non-radiative loss pathways that dissipate electronic energy as heat, which causes the overall system efficiency to be directly linked to quantum yield (\u03a6) of the molecular excited state. Unfortunately, \u03a6 is very difficult to predict from first principles because the description of a slow non-radiative decay mechanism requires an accurate description of long-timescale excited-state quantum dynamics. In the present study, we introduce an efficient semiempirical method of calculating the fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6<sub>fl</sub>) for molecular chromophores, which, based on machine learning, converts simple electronic energies computed using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) into an estimate of \u03a6<sub>fl</sub>.

Recently,\ngrowing use of the plant in the United States and concerns that kratom\nrepresents an uncontrolled drug with potential abuse liability, have\nhighlighted the need for more careful study of its pharmacological activity. The\nmajor active alkaloid found in kratom, mitragynine, has been reported to have\nopioid agonist and analgesic activity <i>in vitro</i>\nand in animal models, consistent with the purported effects of kratom leaf in\nhumans. However, preliminary research has provided some evidence that\nmitragynine and related compounds may act as atypical opioid agonists, inducing\ntherapeutic effects such as analgesia, while limiting the negative side effects\ntypical of classical opioids.

We\nfind that mitragynine is converted <i>in\nvitro </i>in both mouse and human liver preparations to the much more potent\nmu-opioid receptor agonist 7-hydroxymitragynine, and that this conversion is\nmediated by cytochrome P450 3A isoforms.

Due to their high plasticity, IDPs are very challenging in experimental and computational structural studies. To provide detailed atomic insight in IDPs dynamics governing its functional mechanisms, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely employed. However, the current generalist force fields and solvent models are unable to generate satisfactory ensembles for IDPs when compared to existing experimental data. In this work, we present a new solvation model, denoted as Charge-Augmented 3 Point Water model for Intrinsically-disordered Proteins (CAIPi3P). CAIPi3P has been generated by performing a systematic scanning of atomic partial charges assigned to the widely popular molecular scaffold of the three-point TIP3P water model. We found that explicit solvent MD simulations employing CAIPi3P solvation considerably improved the SAXS scattering profiles for three different IDPs. Not surprisingly, this improvement was further enhanced by using CAIPi3P water in combination with the protein force field parametrized for IDPs. We have also demonstrated applicability of CAIPi3P to molecular systems containing structured as well as intrinsically disordered regions/domains. Our results highlight the crucial importance of solvent effects for generating molecular ensembles of IDPs which reproduce the experimental data available. Hence, we conclude that our newly developed CAIPi3P solvation model is a valuable tool assisting molecular simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins and assessing their molecular dynamics.", "date": "2019-02-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The complex bixbyite structure of \u03b1-Mn2O3, and its subtle orthorhombic \u2192 cubic phase transformation near room temperature has made it challenging to accurately determine its electronic proper- ties. We used high-resolution X-ray diffraction to study the temperature-dependent structures of phase-pure \u03b1-Mn2O3 prisms. Our measurements show a clear change in the crystal phase from orthorhombic \u2192 cubic between 293K and 300K. We input the Rietveld refined high-resolution crystal structures collected at various temperatures (273, 293, 300, 330K) directly into density functional theory (DFT) calculations to model their electronic properties. These calculations indicate that the orthorhombic phase \u03b1-Mn2O3 is a narrow bandgap semiconductor as expected. However, temper- atures higher than 300K transform the \u03b1-Mn2O3 into the cubic phase, causing the molecular orbitals of the Mn 3d and O 2p bands to overlap and mix covalently, mak- ing the material behave as a semimetal. This subtle change in crystal structure will affect the bulk conductivity of the material as well as Mn-O-Mn bond distances that influence the quality of its catalytic active sites for oxygen electrochemistry. Elec- trochemical oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) experi- ments performed at various temperatures (\u223c 288K to 323K) using the same prepared electrode show a marked enhancement in both OER and ORR performance that is attributed to the higher activity of the cubic phase.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2019-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemical Analysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Electrocatalysis; Fuel Cells; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A benzoquinone is employed as a hydride (or two-electron and one-proton) acceptor. Moreover, a previously unknown and uncatalysed reaction between iminoiodanes and xanthene, thioxanthene and dihydroacridines (9,10-dihydro-9-hetero-anthracenes or dihydroheteroanthracenes) is disclosed. The reactions proceed via hydride transfer from the heteroarene substrate to the iminoiodane or benzoquinone, followed by conjugate addition of the sulfonamide to the oxidized heteroaromatic compounds. These findings may have important mechanistic implications for metal-catalysed C\u2012H amination processes involving nitrene transfer from iminoiodanes to dihydroheteroanthracenes. Due to the weak C\u2012H bond, xanthene is an often-employed substrate in mechanistic studies of C\u2012H amination reactions, which are generally proposed to proceed via metal-catalysed nitrene insertion, especially for reactions involving nitrene or imido complexes that are less reactive (i.e. less strongly oxidizing). However, these substrates clearly undergo non-catalysed (proton-coupled) redox coupling with amines, thus providing alternative pathways to the widely assumed metal-catalysed pathways.", "date": "2019-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we discuss how general this tenet is. We studied single-stranded DNAs (human telomeric cytosine-rich sequences with CCCTAA repeats), which fold into an intercalated motif (i-motif) structure in a pH-dependent manner, thanks to the formation of C\u2012H+\u2012C base pairs. As i-motif formation is favored at low ionic strength, we could investigate the ESI-IMS-MS behavior of i-motif structures at pH ~5.5 over a wide range of ammonium acetate concentrations (15 mM to 100 mM). The control experiments consisted of either the same sequence at pH ~7.5, wherein the sequence is unfolded, or sequence variants that cannot form i-motifs (CTCTAA repeats). The surprising results came from the control experiments. We found that the ionic strength of the solution had a greater effect on the compactness of the gas-phase structures than the solution folding state. This means that electrosprayed ions keep a memory of the charging process, which is influenced by the electrolyte concentration. We discuss these results in light of the analyte partitioning between the droplet interior and droplet surface, which in turn influences the probability of being ionized via a charged residue pathway or a chain extrusion pathway.<br />", "date": "2019-02-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Mass Spectrometry; Biophysics; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the present work, we show that 2DG is poorly suited for MS-based methods due to interfering metabolites. We therefore developed and validated an alternative C18-based LC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS method using 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (2FDG) to quantify both 2FDG and 2FDG-6-P by measuring the sodium adduct of 2FDG in the positive mode and deprotonation of 2FDG-6-P in the negative mode.

Such a key linkage between mineral and material science has been reinvigorated by the numerous successes of computational modeling. The intriguing<br />relationships between synthetic zeolites and their natural counterparts unveiled by theoretical studies have greatly contributed to improve the properties and practical applications of zeolite-based materials in various technological areas ranging from industrial catalysis, to environmental protection, up to<br />advanced optics, electronics, and solar energy harvesting. To pinpoint the key role of modeling in zeolite science, we focus herein on a simple yet instructive example of computational-driven problemsolving: can tetrahedral frameworks sustain straight (i.e. 180\u00b0) Si-O-Si bond angles? Indeed, the true crystal symmetry of zeolite ferrierite, especially in its all-silica form, has been intensely debated for 30 years before being solved in the Pmnn space group. Yet there are indications that an Immm structure, featuring energetically unfavourable flat (180\u00b0) Si-O-Si angles, could be formed at high temperature. To provide insight on this issue, we perform density functional theory optimizations and frequency calculations of all-silica ferrierite in both the Pmnn and Immm space groups. Our results indicate that Pmnn is more stable than Immm, in line with experiments. While the Pmnn structure is a true minimum in the free energy profile of ferrierite, the Immm structure has four imaginary frequency vibrations, two of which are localized on the 180\u00b0 Si-O-Si angles. This suggest that ferrierites with Immm symmetry may be classified as metastable phases. Such a designation is also supported by firstprinciples molecular dynamics on Immm FER, evidencing that the average value of 180\u00b0 actually results from Si-O-Si angle inversion. An exciting implication of this study with interesting geological and technological consequences is the possible association of flat Si-O-Si angles experimentally detected in open-framework silicates to metastable structures characterized by pore openings more circular than in the corresponding equilibrium structures. Such a lower channel ellipticity might play an important role in sorption phenomena, which are ubiquitous in geological processes and industrial applications alike. More in general, this work underlines how highly complex processes involving zeolite materials can be understood and accurately captured using theoretical techniques.<div><br /></div><div><br /></div>", "date": "2019-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Processes; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the spirit of the original CVS approximation proposed by Cederbaum, Domcke and Schirmer, pure valence excitations are excluded from the EOM target space and the frozen-core approximation is imposed on the reference-state amplitudes and multipliers. This yields an efficient, robust, and accurate EOM-CCSD framework for calculations of excitation and ionization energies as well as state and transition properties (e.g., spectral intensities, natural transition and Dyson orbitals). The accuracy of the new scheme is improved relative to the results obtained applying the CVS only during the solution of the EOM eigenvalue equations. The errors in absolute excitation/ionization energies relative to the experimental reference data are of the order of 0.2{3.0 eV, depending on the K-edge considered and on the basis set used, and the shifts are systematic for each edge.<br />", "date": "2019-02-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

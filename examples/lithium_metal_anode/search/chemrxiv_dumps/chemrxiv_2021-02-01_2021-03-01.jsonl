In <i>N</i>-naphthyl-containing PCs characterized by near-unity intersystem crossing, the T<sub>1</sub> is certainly an important driver for efficient DET. However, at DBMM concentrations common to polymer synthesis, the S<sub>1</sub> is also active and drives 33% of DET reaction events. Even in systems with low yields of ISC, such as in <i>N</i>-phenyl-containing PCs, reaction yields can be driven to useful values by exploiting the S<sub>1</sub> under high DBMM concentration conditions. Finally, we have quantified photochemical reaction quantum yields, which take into account potential product loss processes after electron-transfer quenching events. Both S<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> reactant states produce the PC<sup>\u00b7+</sup> radical cation with a common yield of 71%, thus offering no evidence for spin selectivity in deleterious back electron transfer. The sub-unity PC<sup>\u00b7+</sup> yields suggest that some combination of solvent (DMAc) oxidation and energy-wasting back electron transfer is likely at play and these pathways should be factored in subsequent mechanistic considerations.", "date": "2021-02-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Photocatalysis; Redox Catalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This turnover can be used to drive active processes such as growth, and provide an insight into the chemical requirements underlying (proto)cellular behaviour.

Here we present a minimal, nucleotide-based coacervate model for active droplets, and report three key findings that make these droplets into evolvable protocells. First, we show that coacervate droplets form and grow by the fuel-driven synthesis of new coacervate material. Second, we find that these droplets do not undergo Ostwald ripening, which we attribute to the attractive electrostatic interactions within complex coacervates, active or passive. Finally, we show that the droplet growth rate reflects experimental conditions such as substrate, enzyme and protein concentration, and that a different droplet composition (addition of RNA) leads to altered growth rates and droplet fitness. These findings together make active coacervate droplets a powerful platform to mimic cellular growth at a single-droplet level, and to study fitness at a population level.<br />", "date": "2021-02-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Kinetics; Interfaces; Self-Assembly; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, these reactions can generate a mixture of regioisomeric products that are often difficult to separate. While investigating the Pd- catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates, we observed that the addition of a substoichiometric quantity of TESCF3 significantly improves both the efficiency and the regioselectivity of the fluorination process. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational study on the mechanism of this transformation focused on the role of TESCF3. We found that in the absence of additives such as TESCF3, the transmetalation step produces predominantly the thermodynamically more stable trans isomer of the key LPd(vinyl)F complex (L = biaryl monophosphine ligand). This intermediate, rather than undergoing reductive elimination, preferentially reacts through an intramolecular \u03b2-deprotonation to form a Pd-cyclohexyne intermediate. This undesired reactivity is responsible for the low efficiency (11% yield) and poor regioselectivity (1.8:1) of the catalytic reaction. When TESCF3 is added to the reaction mixture, the cis-LPd(vinyl)F complex is instead formed, through a pathway involving an unusual dearomatization of the ligand by nucleophilic attack from a trifluoromethyl anion (CF3\u2013). In contrast to the trans isomer, this cis-LPd(vinyl)F complex readily undergoes reductive elimination to provide the vinyl fluoride product with desired regioselectivity, without the generation of Pd-cyclohexyne intermediates.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2021-02-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we demonstrate efficient ultraviolet (UV) photoredox chemistry between CO2 and sulfite\n(SO3\n2\u2013) that generates organics and sulfate (SO4\n2\u2013  ). The chemistry is initiated by electron\nphotodetachment from SO3\n2\u2013 giving sulfite radicals and hydrated electrons, which reduce CO2 to its radical anion. By subjecting individual products and putative intermediates to the reaction conditions and analyzing the resultant mixtures, a network of ensuing  reactions that can rationalize the products was revealed.

The simplicity of this carboxysulfitic chemistry and the  widespread occurrence and abundance of its feedstocks suggest that it could have readily taken place on the early Earth as well as on the surfaces of many rocky planets.

Yet the discovery of novel hydriding materials has historically been a manual process driven by chemical intuition or experimental trial-and-error. Data-driven materials' discovery paradigms provide an alternative to traditional approaches, whereby machine/statistical learning (ML) models are used to efficiently screen materials for desired properties and significantly narrow the scope of expensive/time-consuming first-principles modeling and experimental validation. Here we specifically focus on a relatively new class of hydrogen storage materials, high entropy alloy (HEA) hydrides, whose vast combinatorial composition space and local structural disorder necessitates a data-driven approach that does not rely on exact crystal structures in order to make property predictions. Our ML model quickly screens hydride stability within a large HEA space and permits down selection for laboratory validation based not only on targeted thermodynamic properties, but also secondary criteria such as alloy phase stability and density. To experimentally verify our predictions, we performed targeted synthesis and characterization of several novel hydrides that demonstrate significant destabilization (70x increase in equilibrium pressure, 20 kJ/molH<sub>2</sub> decrease in desorption enthalpy) relative to the benchmark HEA hydride, TiVZrNbHfH<sub>x</sub>. Ultimately, by providing a large composition space in which hydride thermodynamics can be continuously tuned over a wide range, this work will enable efficient materials selection for various applications, especially in areas such as metal hydride based hydrogen compressors, actuators, and heat pumps.", "date": "2021-02-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Molecular dynamics simulations are the method of choice for providing complementary insight to experiments. However, the force fields used to simulate the interaction between molecules and oxide surfaces tend to capture only weak physisorption interactions, discarding the stabilizing Lewis acid/base interactions. We here propose an improvement of the usual molecular mechanics description (based on Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions) by addition of an attractive Gaussian potential between reactive sites of the surface and heteroatoms of adsorbed organic molecules, leading to the GLJ potential. The interactions of four oxygenated and four amine molecules with the typical and widespread hematite and \u03b3-alumina surfaces are investigated. The total RMSD for all probed molecules decreases from 29.2 to 5.7 kcal/mol, and the corresponding percentage from 107.4 to 22.6% over hematite, while on \u03b3-alumina the RMSD decreases from 21.5 to 7.6 kcal/mol, despite using a single parameter for all five chemically inequivalent surface aluminum atoms. Applying GLJ to the simulation of n-octadecanamine and N-tetradecyldiethanolamine adsorbed films on hematite and alumina respectively demonstrates that mobility of the surfactants is overestimated by the common LJ potential, while GLJ shows a strong structuration and slow dynamics of the surface films, as could be expected from the first-principles adsorption energies for model head-groups.", "date": "2021-02-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we put forward an\n\u201call-in-one\u201d design principle and demonstrate its feasibility in developing\nhigh-performance fluorescent probes which are specific to A<i>\u03b2</i> fibrils/plaques\nand promising for super-early <i>in</i>-<i>vivo</i> diagnosis of AD. As a proof\nof concept, a simple rod-like amphiphilic NIR fluorescent AIEgen, i.e., AIE-CNPy-AD,\nis developed by taking the specificity, BBB penetration ability, deep-tissue\npenetration capacity, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) into consideration. AIE-CNPy-AD\nis constituted by connecting the electron-donating and accepting moieties through\nsingle bonds and tagging with a propanesulfonate tail, giving rise to the NIR\nfluorescence, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect, amphiphilicity, and rod-like\nstructure, which in turn result in high binding-affinity and excellent\nspecificity to A<i>\u03b2</i> fibrils/plaques, satisfactory ability to penetrate BBB\nand deep tissues, ultrahigh SNR and sensitivity, and high-fidelity imaging\ncapability. <i>In-vitro, ex-vivo,</i> and\n<i>in-vivo</i> <a>identifying of A<i>\u03b2</i> fibrils/plaques</a>\nin different strains of mice indicate that AIE-CNPy-AD holds the universality\nto the detection of A<i>\u03b2</i> fibrils/plaques. It is noteworthy that AIE-CNPy-AD is even able to trace the small and sparsely\ndistributed A<i>\u03b2</i> fibrils/plaques in very young\nAD model mice such as 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice which are reported to be the youngest\nmice to have A<i>\u03b2</i> deposits in brains, suggesting\nits great potential in diagnosis and intervention of AD at a super-early stage.", "date": "2021-02-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Imaging", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite shared catalytic mechanisms and transition states for the chemical steps of catalysis, catalytic rates within the PTP family vary over several orders of magnitude. These rate differences have been implied to arise from differing conformational dynamics of the closure of a protein loop, the WPD-loop, which carries a catalytically critical residue. The present work reports computational studies of the human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and YopH from <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, for which NMR has demonstrated a link between both their respective rates of WPD-loop motion and catalysis rates, which differ by an order of magnitude. We have performed detailed structural analysis, both conventional and enhanced sampling simulations of their loop dynamics, as well as empirical valence bond simulations of the chemical step of catalysis. These analyses revealed the key residues and structural features responsible for these differences, as well as the residues and pathways that facilitate allosteric communication in these enzymes. Curiously, our wild-type YopH simulations also identify a catalytically incompetent hyper-open conformation of its WPD-loop, sampled as a rare event, previously only experimentally observed in YopH-based chimeras. The effect of differences within the WPD-loop and its neighbouring loops on the modulation of loop dynamics, as revealed in this work, may provide a facile means for the family of PTP enzymes to respond to environmental changes and regulate their catalytic activities.  </p>", "date": "2021-02-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The most important enzyme inhibited by OP compounds is acetylcholinesterase (AChe). Inactivation of AChe function results in the accumulation of neurotransmitter, leading to death due to serious respiratory disorders. Organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH), also called phosphotriesterase, is a homo-dimeric metalloenzyme that can hydrolyze various OP agents in the circulatory system, resulting in products that are generally of reduced toxicity. The best OPH substrate found to date is the insecticide diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon). Most structural and kinetic studies assume that the binding orientation of paraoxon is identical to that of diethyl 4-methylbenzylphosphonate, which is the only substrate analog co-crystallized with OPH. In the current work, we used a combined docking and molecular dynamics (MD) approach to predict the likely binding mode of paraoxon in the OPH active site. We identified a potential binding mode of paraoxon that does not match the binding mode of diethyl 4-methylbenzylphosphonate. Then, we used the predicted binding mode to run MD simulations on the wild type (WT) OPH complexed with paraoxon, and OPH mutants complexed with paraoxon. Additionally, we identified 3 hot-spot residues (D253, H254, and I255) involved in the stability of the OPH active site. To further assess these predictions, we then experimentally assayed single and double mutants involving these residues (D253E, H254S, I255S, D253E-H254R and D253E-I255G) for hydrolytic activity against paraoxon. Computational structural analysis of protein-substrate dynamics shows different hydrogen bonding profiles for mutants involving D253 (D253E, D253E-H254R, and D253E-I255G) compared to WT OPH. Additionally, the binding free energy calculations and the experimental kinetics (particularly, <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> and <i>K<sub>M</sub></i>) of the reactions between each OPH mutant and paraoxon show that mutated forms D253E, D253E-H254R, and D253E-I255G exhibit enhanced activity over WT OPH. Interestingly, our experimental results show that the activity of the double mutant D253E-H254R increased by 19-fold compared to WT OPH.</p>", "date": "2021-02-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Overall, development of these model membrane nanodiscs reveals new insights into the assembly of complex nanodiscs and provides a useful toolkit for studying membrane protein, peptide, and lipid interactions in model biological membranes.", "date": "2021-02-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 mutates rapidly as the virus replicates. The world health organization is now closely monitoring the emergence of a new variant, N501Y, on the spike protein.

It was recently reported that the N501Y variants reduce neutralization sensitivity to convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies.

Because only 6 of 19 carbon atoms in the monomeric aglycon unit are proton-attached, their structure determination by NMR spectroscopic analysis is non-trivial. Prior structure elucidation efforts established that the two halves of the lomaiviticins are joined by a single carbon\u2013carbon bond appended to an oxidized cyclohexenone ring. This ring was believed to comprise a 4,5-dihydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. The bridging bond was positioned at C6. This structure proposal has not been tested because none of the lomaiviticins have been prepared by total chemical synthesis or (to the best of our knowledge) successfully analyzed by X-ray crystallography. Here we disclose microED studies which establish that (\u2013)-lomaiviticin C contains a 4,6-dihydroxy-cyclohex-2-en-1-one residue, that the bridging carbon\u2013carbon bond is located at C5, and that the orientation of the cyclohexenone ring and configuration of the secondary glycoside are reversed, relative to their original assignment. High-field (800 MHz) NMR analysis supports the revised assignment and suggests earlier efforts were misled by a fortuitous combination of a nearzero 3JH4,H5 coupling constant and a 4-bond HMBC correlation that was interpreted as a 3-bond coupling. DFT calculations of the expected 13C chemical shifts of the original and revised structures of the aglycon and (\u2013)-lomaiviticin B provide further robust support for the structure revision. Because the interconversion of lomaiviticins A, B, and C has been demonstrated, these findings apply to each isolate.

Apparently, in case of DUT-13 the contraction is crystallite size-dependent, similarly as in a number of other switchable MOFs, which should be investigated more in detail in the future. Methane adsorption at varying temperatures showed a wide hysteresis at the temperatures between 111 K and 140 K. The hysteresis width decreases until it disappears completely at 170 K leading to a reversible isotherm, typical for rigid frameworks. The fact that breathing is observed in a broader temperature range in comparison to DUT\u201149 demonstrates that thermodynamics and kinetics favour the DUT-13 contraction.

We use lipid vesicles as transport carriers, which are co-encapsulated in double emulsions and release their cargo upon addition of an external trigger, here the anionic surfactant SDS. The reagent present inside the lipid vesicles stays isolated from the remaining content of the DE vessel until SDS enters the DE lumen and solubilizes the lipid bilayer. We demonstrate the versatility of the method with two critical applications, chosen as representative assays for high throughput screening. First, we trigger enzymatic reactions after releasing a reactant and second, we encapsulate bacteria and induce gene expression at a delayed time. The presented technique is compatible with the high throughput analysis of individual DE droplets using conventional flow cytometry as well as with microfluidic time-resolved studies.

To cope with this situation, several adaptive QM/MM schemes have been proposed. However, these methods either add significantly to the computational cost or introduce artificial restraints to the system. In this work, we developed a novel adaptive QM/MM scheme and applied it to a study of a nucleophilic addition reaction. In this scheme, the configuration sampling was performed with a small QM region (without solvent molecules), and the thermodynamic properties under another potential energy function with a larger QM region (with a certain number of solvent molecules and/or different levels of QM theory) are computed via extrapolation using the reference-potential method. Our simulation results show that this adaptive QM/MM scheme is numerically stable, at least for the case studied in this work.

To exploit the potential of previously reported antiviral microbial metabolites, we explored the antagonistic prospects of myxobacterial secondary metabolites against receptor-binding domains (RBD) to host cell receptors namely angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), basigin (CD147) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as well as the binding site of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using in silico molecular interaction based approaches such as molecular and protein-protein docking along with an investigation of their pharmacokinetic profiles.

A series of diasteroisomerically pure (1\u00ae2), (1\u00ae3), and (1\u00ae4)-macrolactonized rhamnolipids were also\nsynthesized through intramolecular glycosylation and their anomeric\nconfigurations as well as ring conformations were solved using molecular\nmodeling in tandem with NMR studies. We show that ananatoside B is a more\npotent surfactant than its macrolide counterpart. We present evidence that\nmacrolactonization of rhamnolipids enhances their cytotoxic and hemolytic\npotential, pointing towards a mechanism involving the formation of pores into\nthe lipidic cell membrane. Lastly, we demonstrate that ananatoside A and\nananatoside B as well as synthetic macrolactonized rhamnolipids can be\nperceived by the plant immune system, and that this sensing is more pronounced\nfor a macrolide featuring a rhamnose moiety in its native <sup>1</sup><i>C</i><sub>4</sub> conformation. Altogether\nour results prove that macrolactonization of glycolipids can dramatically\ninterfere with their surfactant properties and biological activity.</p>", "date": "2021-02-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Natural Products; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has become a widely used approach in structural biology since it provides rapid measurements of collision cross sections (CCS), which inform on the gas-phase conformation of the biomolecule under study. Gas-phase ion/ion reactions target amino acid residues with specific chemical properties and the modified sites can be identified by MS. In this study, electrostatically reactive, gas-phase ion/ion chemistry and IM-MS are combined to characterize the structural changes between ubiquitin electrosprayed from aqueous and denaturing conditions. The electrostatic attachment of sulfo-NHS acetate to ubiquitin via ion/ion reactions and fragmentation by electron-capture dissociation (ECD) provide the identification of the most accessible protonated sites within ubiquitin as the sulfonate group forms an electrostatic complex with accessible protonated side chains. The protonated sites identified by ECD from the different solution conditions are distinct and, in some cases, reflect the disruption of interactions such as salt bridges that maintain the native protein structure. This agrees with previously published literature demonstrating that a high methanol concentration at low pH causes the structure of ubiquitin to change from a native (N) state to a more elongated A state. Results using gas-phase, electrostatic cross-linking reagents also point to similar structural changes and further confirm the role of methanol and acid in favoring a more unfolded conformation. Since cross-linking reagents have a distance constraint for the two reactive sites, the data is valuable in guiding computational structures generated by molecular dynamics. The research presented here describes a promising strategy that can detect subtle changes in the local environment of targeted amino acid residues to inform on changes in the overall protein structure.", "date": "2021-02-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Often, the competition for fuel implies that a competitor decreases the lifetime of these products.

For the lithium argyrodites Li<sub>6</sub>PS<sub>5</sub><i>X</i> (<i>X</i> = Cl,Br,I), the choice of the halide, <i>X</i>, strongly affects the ionic conductivity, with room-temperature ionic conductivities for <i>X</i> = {Cl, Br} \u00d710<sup>3</sup> higher than for <i>X</i> = I. This variation has been attributed to differing degrees of S/<i>X</i> anion disorder. For <i>X</i> = {Cl, Br} the S/<i>X</i> anions are substitutionally disordered, while for <i>X</i> = I the anion sublattice is fully ordered. To better understand the role of substitutional anion disorder in enabling fast lithium-ion transport, we have performed a first-principles molecular dynamics study of Li<sub>6</sub>PS<sub>5</sub>I and Li<sub>6</sub>PS<sub>5</sub>Cl, with varying amounts of S/<i>X</i> anion-site disorder. Considering the S/<i>X</i> substructure as a tetrahedrally close-packed lattice, we identify three partially occupied lithium sites that form a contiguous three-dimensional network of face-sharing tetrahedra. The active lithium-ion diffusion pathways within this network, however, depend on the S/<i>X</i> anion configuration. For anion-disordered systems, the active site\u2013site pathways give a percolating three-dimensional diffusion network; whereas for anion-ordered systems, critical site\u2013site pathways are inactive, giving a disconnected diffusion network with lithium motion restricted to local orbits around S positions. Analysis of the lithium substructure and dynamics in terms of the lithium coordination around each sulfur site shows a mechanistic link between substitutional anion disorder and lithium disorder, which enables fast lithium diffusion. In anion-ordered systems the Li-ions are pseudo-ordered, with preferential 6-fold coordination of sulfur sites. Long-ranged lithium diffusion disrupts this SLi<sub>6</sub> pseudo-ordering, and is therefore disfavoured. In anion-disordered systems, a uniform 6-fold S\u2013Li coordination is frustrated due to Li\u2013Li Coulombic repulsion. Lithium positions become disordered, giving a range of S\u2013Li coordination environments. Long-ranged Li diffusion is now possible with no net change in S\u2013Li coordination numbers. This gives rise to superionic lithium transport in the anion-disordered systems, which is effected by a concerted string-like diffusion mechanism.", "date": "2021-02-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Solid State Chemistry; Theory - Inorganic; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our group previously discovered that PC4 selectively binds to a double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN) damaged by a trans-platinum anticancer complex, trans-[PtCl2(NH3)(thiazole)] (trans-PtTz). However, the molecular basis of this unique recognition and interaction remained unclear. In this work, amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was applied to dissect the interaction interface between PC4 and a 15-mer double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide crosslinked by trans-PtTz (trans-PtTz-dsODN). Global deuterium uptake suggested a 1:1 binding stoichiometry of PC4 to trans-PtTz-dsODN. Local deuterium uptake revealed that the flexible N-terminal loop and the \u03b23 \u2013 \u03b25-sheet played key roles in the recognition and interaction between PC4 and trans-PtTz-dsODN. In order to locate the key amino acid residues, molecular dynamics simulation was employed, demonstrating that PC4 binds to the trans-PtTz-dsODN at the minor groove via strong H-bonds with the nucleobases of the complementary strand. The minor groove width was broadened to adapt for the binding of PC4. Arg86 residue in PC4 was shown to dominate the recognition and interaction, which was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This work profiles the detailed interaction mechanism of PC4 with trans-PtTz damaged dsODN, and the combination use of HDX-MS and molecular dynamics simulation provides a new paradigm for the future research of the cellular response to the platinum induced DNA damage.</p>", "date": "2021-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We compare the CCSD results with those from two density functionals, B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP, on a test set of 22 chiral molecules.

Apparent rates of O<sub>2</sub> activation depend both on the intrinsic kinetics of distinct Cu site types and the distributions of such sites within a given zeolite, which depend on the density and arrangement of the framework Al atoms. Here, we use hydrothermal synthesis methods to control the arrangement of framework Al sites in chabazite (CHA) zeolites and, in turn, the distinct Cu site types formed. Time-resolved in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals the kinetics of O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation within these well-defined Cu-CHA materials and the concomitant structural evolution of copper-oxygen (Cu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>) complexes, which are interpreted alongside Cu(I) oxidation kinetics extracted from in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Raman spectra of several plausible CuxOy species simulated using density functional theory suggest that experimental spectra (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 532 nm) capture the formation of mono(\u03bc-oxo)dicopper species (ZCuOCuZ). Transient experiments show that the timescales required to form Cu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> structures that no longer change in Ra-man spectra correspond to the durations of oxidative treatments that maximize CH<sub>3</sub>OH yields in stoichiometric PMO cycles (approximately 2 h). Yet, these periods extend well beyond the timescales for the complete conversion of the initial Cu(I) intermediates to their Cu(II) states (<0.3 h, reflected in XANES spectra), which demonstrates that Cu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> complexes continue to evolve structurally following rapid oxidation. The dependence of ZCuOCuZ formation rates on O<sub>2</sub> pressure, H<sub>2</sub>O pressure, and temperature are consistent with a mechanism in which ZCuOH reduce to form ZCu<sup>+</sup> sites that bind molecular oxygen and form ZCu-O<sub>2</sub> intermediates. Subsequent reaction with proximate ZCu<sup>+</sup> form bridging peroxo dicopper complexes that cleave O-O bonds to form ZCuOCuZ in steps facilitated by water. These data and interpretations provide evidence for the chemical processes that link rapid and kinetically irrelevant Cu oxidation steps (frequently probed by XAS and UV-Vis spectroscopy) to the relatively slow genesis of reactive Cu complexes that form CH<sub>3</sub>OH during PMO. In doing so, we reveal previously unrec-ognized complexities in the processes by which Cu ions in zeolites activate O<sub>2</sub> to form active Cu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> complexes, which under-score the insight afforded by judicious combinations of experimental and theoretical techniques.", "date": "2021-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Inorganic; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Reaction Engineering; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Chemical Kinetics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of 6 non-enzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes. Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test its ability to reproduce free energy profiles generated from a target QM model. We perform comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2 semiempirical models because they produce free energy profiles which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free energy profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6 \u00c5. We further find that the model's initial training benefits from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce 4 different reactions and yielded good agreement with the free energy profiles made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free energy surfaces and 1D free energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs, but was sped up almost 100-fold when using an NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free energy applications ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.<br />", "date": "2021-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The majority of biochar nanostructures produced after\nexfoliation are stacked nanosheets containing between 2-8 layers (average 15 nm thickness). Correlations between\neffective LPE of biochar in solvents and different solvent parameters, including Kamlet-Taft, were established and allowed\ngreener solvents to be used. Surface modification of biochars (e.g. via oxidation) has potential to increase their dispersibility\nin more benign solvents. LPE of oxidized biochars is more efficient in hydrogen-bond accepting solvents due to the\nincreased concentration of carboxylic acid and alcohol functional groups on the surface of particles, when compared to non-\nfunctionalized biochars.

Herein the insulator-metal transition of LCO is investigated by <i>operando</i> Raman spectroscopy complemented with DFT calculations and a newly-developed sampling volume model. We confirm the presence of a Mott insulator \u03b1-phase at dilute Li-vacancy concentrations (x > 0.87) that transforms into a metallic \u03b2-phase at x < 0.75.

A feed forward back propagation - artificial neural network model based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was constructed with seven input parameters for solubility prediction, the network architecture was optimized to be [7-7-1] with mean absolute error, mean square error, root mean square error and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient to be 0.026, 0.0016, 0.04 and 0.9588 respectively. Further, Pearson-product moment correlation analysis was performed to assess the relative importance of the parameters considered in the ANN model. A total of twelve prevalent semiempirical equations were also studied to analyze their efficiency in correlating to the solubility of the prepared sample. Mendez-Teja model was found to be relatively efficient with root mean square error and mean absolute error to be 0.094 and 0.0088 respectively. Furthermore, Grey relational analysis was performed and the optimum regime of temperature and pressure were identified with dye solubility as the higher the better performance characteristic.

In a recent study employing the replica exchange Monte Carlo method, the equilibrium Y configurations at typical sintering temperatures were shown to deviate from the random configuration assumed in earlier theoretical studies. In the present study, we took this observation into account and evaluated the effect of the Y configuration on the proton diffusivity. Using the master equation approach based on local diffusion barriers calculated from first principles, the proton diffusivities under realistic Y configurations were estimated to be higher than those in the random configuration. This is explained by the fact that realistic Y configurations have fewer trap sites with deep potential wells compared to the random configuration due to the isolation trend of Y dopants. In addition, the effects of proton-proton interaction and the abundance of preferential conduction pathways are discussed; it is found that both are relatively minor factors compared to the trap site effect in determining the dependence of the proton diffusivity on the Y configurations.<br />", "date": "2021-02-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Ceramics; Theory - Computational; Fuel Cells; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

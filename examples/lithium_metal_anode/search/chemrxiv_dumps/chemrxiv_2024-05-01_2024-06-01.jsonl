Although previous imidazole-M(II) parameters established the flexibility and reliability of the 12-6-4 Lennard-Jones (LJ)-type nonbonded model by simply tuning the ligating atom\u2019s polarizability, they have not been applied to multiple-imidazole complexes. To fill this gap, we systematically simulate multiple-imidazole complexes (ranging from one to six) for five metal ions (Co(II), Cu(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)) which commonly appear in metalloproteins. Using extensive (40ns per PMF window) sampling to assemble free energy association profiles (using OPC water and standard HID imidazole charge models from AMBER) and comparing them to DFT calculations, a new set of parameters was developed to focus on energetic and geometric features of multiple-imidazole complexes. The obtained free energy profiles agree with the experimental binding free energy and DFT calculated distances. Further investigation of the simulations revealed the existence of ligand-ligand hydrogen bonds and partial \u03c0-stacking while one ligand dissociates from the complex. To validate our model, we show that we can close the thermodynamic cycle for metal-imidazole complexes with up to six imidazole molecules in the first solvation shell. Given the success in closing the thermodynamic cycles, we then used the same extended sampling method for six other metal ions (Ag(I), Ca(II), Cd(II), Cu(I), Fe(II), and Mg(II)) to obtain new parameters. Since these new parameters can reproduce the one-imidazole geometry and energy accurately, we hypothesize that they will reasonably predict the binding free energy of higher-level coordination numbers. Hence, we did not extend the analysis of these ions up to six imidazole complexes. Overall, the results shed light on metal-protein interactions by emphasizing the importance of ligand-ligand interaction and metal-\u03c0-stacking within metalloproteins.

In this context, maintaining the proximity of the readout reagents to the cell surface is crucial to prevent crosstalk and ensure that short-lived radical species react before diffusing away. Here we investigated improvements to tyramide/peroxidase proximity labeling for enzyme screening. We modified chitosan (Cs) chains with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and evaluated the effects of these conjugates on the efficiency of proximity labeling reactions on yeast cells displaying D-amino acid oxidase. By tethering HRP to chitosan through different chemical approaches, we localized the auxiliary enzyme close to the cell surface and enhanced the sensitivity of tyramide/peroxidase labeling reactions.

This study explores the potential of all-silica zeolites for separation of 1,4-dioxane from water. These zeolites are highly hydrophobic and can preferentially adsorb nonpolar molecules from mixtures. We investigated six zeolite frameworks (BEA, EUO, FER, IFR, MFI, MOR) using Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble.

However, it is costly, sometimes time-consuming, and it requires a considerable degree of expertise. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy resolves these limitations, while also exhibiting substantial sensitivity to subtle modifications in the conformation and molecular packaging in the solid state. This study showcases VCD's ability to differentiate between various crystal structures of the identical molecule (polymorphs, cocrystals). We examined the most effective approach for producing high-quality spectra and unveiled the intricate link between structure and spectrum via quantum-chemical computations. We rigorously assessed, using alanine as a model compound, multiple experimental conditions on the resulting VCD spectra, with the aim of proposing an optimal and efficient procedure. The proposed approach, which yields reliable, reproducible and artifact-free results with maximum signal-to-noise ratio, was then validated using a set comprising of three amino acids (serine, alanine, tyrosine), one hydroxy acid (tartaric acid), and a monosaccharide (ribose) to mimic active pharmaceutical components. Finaly, the optimized approach was applied to distinguish three polymorphs of the antiviral drug sofosbuvir and its cocrystal with piperazine. Our results indicates that solid-state VCD is a prompt, cost-effective, and easy-to-use technique to identify crystal structures, demonstrating potential for application in pharmaceuticals. We also adapted the cluster and transfer approach to calculate the spectral properties of molecules in a periodic crystal environment. Our findings demonstrate that this approach reliably produces solid-state VCD spectra of model compounds.

Previous work has shown that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen-bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen-bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to the dynamics of its non-fluorinated analog, 2-propanol. Time-resolved and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy show that the dynamics of single hydrogen-bonds (occurring on a time scale of a few picoseconds) is about twice as slow in HFIP as in 2-propanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the collective hydrogen-bond dynamics: the time scale for collective hydrogen-bond rearrangements is 3 times faster in HFIP than in 2-propanol, with a characteristic time scale of 140~ps. This difference in time scales indicates that the hydrogen-bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in 2-propanol. The smaller cluster size can contribute to the enhanced reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen bonds between reactants and these terminal OH groups. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen-bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant-solvent hydrogen bonding resulting in a reaction.", "date": "2024-05-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Lately, KRAS(G12C) switch-II pocket (SII-P)-targeting covalent small molecule inhibitors have finally reached the clinical practice. Sotorasib (AMG-510) was the first FDA-approved covalent inhibitor to treat KRAS(G12C)-positive non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), followed soon by adagrasib (MRTX849). Both drugs target the GDP-bound state of KRAS(G12C), exploiting the strong nucleophilicity of the acquired cysteine. Here, we evaluate the similarities and differences between sotorasib and adagrasib in their RAS SII-P binding by applying biochemical, cellular, and computational methods. Exact knowledge on SII-P engagement can enable targeting this site by reversible inhibitors for KRAS mutants beyond G12C. We show that adagrasib is strictly KRAS- but not KRAS(G12C)-specific, due to its strong and unreplaceable interaction with H95. Unlike adagrasib, sotorasib is less dependent on H95 for its binding, making it a RAS isoform-agnostic compound. Our results emphasize the accessibility of the SII-P beyond oncogenic G12C and aid in understanding the molecular mechanism behind the clinically observed drug resistance, associated especially with secondary mutations on KRAS H95 and Y96.", "date": "2024-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Current IUPAC refenced guidance indicates that absorbance be limited to between 0.1 and 1.0 a.u. and that optimal performance (minimum relative standard deviation (RSD)) will be obtained at 0.43 a.u. or 0.86 a.u. depending on the type of limiting noise.

Optimal RSD approached neither extreme with minima varying depending on wavelength. We could find no evidence justifying guidance restricting absorbance to between 0.1 and 1.0 a.u. Measured RSD and light intensity are more important than absorbance values for assuring good quality measurements. Recovering light intensity estimates is a difficult inverse problem when I and I0 are not available, and the modern commercial instruments tested did not provide these.

These compounds include potent signaling molecules (e.g., octadecanoids, eicosanoids) that can exert essential functions in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases including asthma. While some oxylipin signaling cascades have been unraveled using LC-MS/MS-based methods, measurements in homogenate samples do not represent the spatial heterogeneity of lipid metabolism. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) directly detects analytes from a surface, which enables spatial mapping of oxylipin biosynthesis and migration within tissue. MSI has lacked the sensitivity to routinely detect low abundant oxylipins; however, new multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM)-based MSI technologies provide increased sensitivity. In this study, we developed a workflow to apply desorption electrospray ionization coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (DESI-MRM) to spatially map oxylipins in pulmonary tissue. The targeted MSI workflow screened guinea pig lung extracts using LC-MS/MS to filter oxylipin targets based on their detectability by DESI-MRM. A panel of 6 oxylipins was then selected for DESI-MRM imaging derived from either arachidonic acid (TXB2, 11-HETE, 12-HETE), linoleic acid (12,13-DiHOME) or alpha-linolenic acid (16-HOTrE). To parse this new data type, a custom build R package (quantMSImageR) was developed with functionality to label regions-of-interest as well as quantify and analyze lipid distributions. The spatial distributions quantified by DESI-MRM were supported by LC-MS/MS analysis, with both indicating that 16-HOTrE and 12-HETE were associated with airways, while 12,13-DiHOME and arachidonic acid mapped to parenchyma.

In particular, the formation of C(sp2)\u2013C(sp3) bonds is crucial for constructing biologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In this study, we present the previously elusive coupling between gaseous alkanes and (hetero)aryl bromides, achieved through a combination of Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) photocatalysis and nickel-catalyzed cross coupling at room temperature. Utilizing flow technology allowed us to conduct this novel coupling reaction with reduced reaction times and in a scalable fashion, rendering it practical for widespread adoption in both academia and industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the oxidative addition constitutes the rate-determining step, with the activation energy barrier increasing with smaller alkyl radicals. Furthermore, radical isomerization observed in propane and butane analogues could be attributed to the electronic properties of the bromoarene coupling partner, highlighting the crucial role of oxidative addition in the observed selectivity of this transformation.", "date": "2024-05-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Homogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, attaching the CF3 group to heteroatoms such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen poses significant challenges due to the lack of general synthetic methods and reliance on bespoke reagents. In this study, we present a unified approach to address this issue by employing a modular flow platform that streamlines the synthesis of heteroatom-CF3 motifs. Our method utilizes readily available organic precursors in combination with cesium fluoride as the primary fluorine source, facilitating the rapid generation of NCF3(R), SCF3, and OCF3 anions on demand. Despite their reactivity and atom economy, the instability of these anions has previously hindered their widespread application. However, our platform overcomes this limitation, enabling the subsequent coupling of these nucleophiles with a diverse range of electrophiles. This capability allows for the late-stage modification of various drug intermediates, offering a versatile and efficient synthetic route. A notable advantage of our approach is its sustainability. Unlike traditional methods reliant on polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as reagents, our strategy bypasses their use, resulting in a more environmentally friendly synthesis of trifluoromethyl(heteroatom)-containing molecules. Furthermore, our method expands the chemical space available for the heteroatom-CF3 group, with the potential for scalability in manufacturing processes facilitated by flow technology.

In the specific case of  CrO3/SiO2, CO has been particularly used both as a reductant to generate the expected low valent Cr sites and a probe to understand surface Cr sites.

In particular, redox-active molecules that can capture carbon dioxide when electrochemically reduced and release carbon dioxide when electrochemically re-oxidized are under active development. To prepare a carbon capture device these molecules can be incorporated in a solid electrode in a battery-like cell. In this work we explore the scope of a recently developed method where anthraquinones are covalently attached to porous carbon supports to obtain electrodes for electrochemical carbon dioxide capture. We functionalize four different porous carbon materials with varying porosities and surface chemistries, and use gas sorption analysis and solid-state NMR spectroscopy to probe the location of the grafted anthraquinones. All four functionalized materials show electrochemically mediated capture and release of carbon dioxide and we explore the factors that determine their performance. While the anthraquinone-functionalized mesoporous carbon, f-CMK-3, showed the highest quinone loading, it showed poor quinone utilization for CO2 capture, and poor long-term cycling stability. In contrast, the predominantly microporous functionalized carbon, f-YP-80F, showed a higher quinone utilization and improved cycling stability. Finally, thermal annealing experiments were conducted to remove pre-existing functional groups on a third carbon, but this did not improve the cycling stability of the resulting anthraquinone-functionalized material. Overall our measurements suggest that the pore environments in which anthraquinones are grafted play a crucial role in determining the electrochemical CO2 capture performance.

This process is made possible by the presence of biotin, a unique molecule that consists of a sulfur-containing tetrahydrothiophene ring fused to a ureido group. It is covalently attached to the en- zyme via a flexible linker allowing for its functionality. Biotin-dependent carboxylases consist of two distinct domains. The first domain facilitates biotin carboxylation by utilizing ATP, while the second domain transfers CO2 to the substrate. The process of ATP-dependent carboxylation using bicarbonate in the biotin carboxylase domain is well known. However, the precise mechanism by which CO2 is released in the carboxy- transferase domain is still not fully understood. We employed advanced computational chemistry methods to investigate the decarboxylation process of carboxy-biotin in vari- ous molecular environments and different protonation states. Regardless of the polarity of the molecular surroundings, decarboxylation only occurs spontaneously in the pro- tonated form. To determine the protonation state of biotin in different environments, we established an accurate computational chemistry method for calculating the pKa value of carboxy-biotin reaching sub-kcal mol\u22121 accuracy. Based on our findings, non- polar environments, such as the active site of the carboxy-transferase domain, have the ability to cause the spontaneous release of CO2 from carboxy-biotin.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyze the IRI activity of carrageenans with defined chemical structures and associated cations. For this purpose, pure \u03ba  and \u03b9-carrageenans as well as several hybrid carrageenans showing broad heterogeneity with regards to the molecular structure and the cations present were investigated. The selected commercial samples were subsequently converted into their potassium, calcium and (in part) sodium forms. Chemical characterization of the modified carrageenans demonstrated that the molecular structure was unaltered by the applied procedures and that the carrageenans were successfully converted into the different cation forms. The analysis of the IRI activity demonstrated that both molecular structure and associated cations had an influence on carrageenan functionality. Pure \u03ba-carrageenan and hybrid carrageenans with consecutive \u03ba-units showed a high IRI activity, whereas \u03b9-carrageenan was less active.

Counterintuitive to the conventional HP chemistry, synthesis of 2D DPA2PbI4 HP is indeed feasible when the steric hindrance is mediated by minute incorporation of 3D HPs. Furthermore, a Moir\u00e9 superlattice is observed from the DPA2PbI4 flakes, indicating the spontaneous formation of twisted stacks of 2D HPs \u2013 the first time to the best our knowledge. We hypothesize that the unconventional van der Waals surface of DPA2PbI4 facilitates the self-assembly of the twisted stacks of 2D HPs. This work exemplifies how high-throughput experimentation can discover unconventional material systems where the synthetic principle lies beyond the conventional chemical intuition. Furthermore, these findings provide hints on how to \u2018chemically\u2019 manipulate the twist stacking in 2D HPs, thus rendering a straightforward way for bespoke realization of functionalities in exotic materials systems via bottom-up approach.

One of the most stockpiled CWAs is sulfur mustard (SM) gas. The most effective way to detoxify stockpiled SM is to oxidize the thioether functionality to its benign sulfoxide (SMO) state. However, overoxidation to the corresponding sulfone (SMO2), itself a potent toxin, should be avoided. Thus, cat-alysts for SM detoxification must be precisely tuned to promote the sluggish oxidation of SM while avoiding overoxi-dation of SMO to SMO2. In this study, Mo and W dithiolene catalysts, [MO2(dithiolene)2]2- (M = Mo or W), inspired by the active site structures of oxotransferase enzymes such as DMSO reductase were used as catalysts for oxidation of the SM research analogue, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), with aqueous H2O2 as a green oxidant. Under optimized conditions, [WO2(mnt)2]2- and [MoO2(bdt)2]2- (mnt = maleonitriledithiolate, bdt = 1,2-benzenedithiolate) were found to promote selective CEES oxidation to sulfoxide CEESO without overoxidation to sulfone CEESO2 in as little as 5-15 min with catalyst loadings as low as 0.015 mol%.

In this work, we developed an ex situ carbon coating method by rapidly decomposing the precursors through flash Joule heating (FJH). A uniform, amorphous carbon layer was achieved on LFP by depositing carbon-heteroatom species in a confined space within 10 seconds. Simultaneously, different heteroatoms can be introduced into the surface carbon layer to facilitate a uniform cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI).

However, by segmenting the molecules into smaller fragments and ensuring that each fragment is transferable to other systems, the process of parameterizing large molecules such as fatty acids can be simplified without compromising accuracy. In this study, we present a fragment- based AMOEBA FF development for long-chain fatty acid ionic liquids (LCFA-ILs). AMOEBA enables us to incorporate polarization to measurably enhance the precision in modeling these large highly charged systems. This is of significant importance since the computational investigation of ILs needs accurate modeling. Additionally, to leverage the tunability of ILs, it is essential to test numerous anion and cation combinations to identify the most suitable formulation for each application. However, conducting such experiments can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, but accurate molecular modeling can expedite the exploration process. Here, the newly developed parameters were evaluated by comparing the decomposed intermolecular interaction energies for ion pairs with energies determined by quantum mechanics calculations as a reference. By employing this FF in molecular dynamics simulations, we predicted bulk and structural properties including density, enthalpy of vaporization, diffusion coefficient, and radial distribution function of diverse LCFA-ILs. Notably, the good agreement between the experimental data and those calculated using our parameters validates the accuracy of our methodology.

While the properties of both INS classes have been studied in the laboratory, the amounts in the atmosphere are still poorly constrained.

First, INS suspensions were separated into a high-density isolate containing inorganic INSs and a low-density isolate containing organic INSs using density gradient centrifugation, and then INSs were quantified in each isolate using a droplet freezing technique. Inorganic K-feldspar and organic Snomax INSs were used to test our method. The average K-feldspar INS recovery in the high-density isolate was 54%, with no evidence of K-feldspar INSs in the low-density isolate. The average Snomax INS recovery in the low-density isolate was 27%, with small amounts of Snomax contaminating the high-density isolate. A mixture of K-feldspar and Snomax was successfully separated, with recoveries comparable to those observed for K-feldspar and Snomax individually.

Despite their ever-increasing potential applications, the intricate details underlying their photoexcited charge carrier dynamics are yet to be elucidated. In this study, nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanodots (NgCNDs) are selectively excited in the presence of methyl viologen (MV2+, redox mediator) and different electron donors, namely ascorbic acid (AA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The consequent formation of the methyl viologen radical cation (MV\u00b7+) is investigated, and the excited charge carrier dynamics of the photocatalytic system are understood on a 0.1 ps to 1 ms time range, providing spectroscopic evidence of oxidative or reductive quenching mechanisms experienced by optically excited NgCNDs (NgCNDs*) depending on the electron donor implemented. In the presence of AA, NgCNDs* undergo oxidative quenching by MV2+ to form MV\u00b7+, but is short-lived due to dehydroascorbic acid, a product of photoinduced hole quenching of oxidized NgCNDs. The EDTA-mediated reductive quenching of NgCNDs* is observed to be at least two orders of magnitude slower due to screening by EDTA-MV2+ complexes, but the MV\u00b7+ population is stable due to the irreversibly oxidized EDTA preventing a back reaction. In general, our methodology provides a distinct solution with which to study charge transfer dynamics in photocatalytic systems on an extended time range spanning 10 orders of magnitude. This approach generates a mechanistic understanding to select and develop suitable electron donors to promote photocatalytic reactions.\n", "date": "2024-05-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Photocatalysis; Physical and Chemical Processes; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One of the most promising methods for computing optical spectra of chromophores embedded in complex environments from the first principles is the cumulant approach, where both (generally anharmonic) vibrational degrees of freedom and environmental interactions are explicitly accounted for. In this work, we verify the capabilities of the cumulant approach in describing the effect of complex environmental interactions on linear absorption spectra by studying Crystal Violet (CV) in different solvents. The experimental absorption spectrum of CV strongly depends on the nature of the solvent, indicating strong coupling to the condensed-phase environment. We demonstrate that these changes in absorption lineshape are driven by an increased splitting between absorption bands of two low-lying excited states that is caused by a breaking of the D3 symmetry of the molecule, and that in polar solvents this symmetry-breaking is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions with the condensed phase environment, rather than distortion of the structure of the molecule, in contrast with conclusions reached in a number of previous studies. Our results reveal the importance explicitly including a counterion in the calculations in nonpolar solvent due to electrostatic interactions between CV and the ion. In polar solvent, these interactions are strongly reduced due to solvent screening effects, thus minimizing the symmetry breaking. Computed spectra in methanol are found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment, demonstrating the strengths of the outlined approach in modeling strong environmental interactions.

We show that quantitative control of frontier orbital energies of prototypical Au-PPh3 nanoclusters is driven by resonance effects reaching from the exterior of the ligand shell to the HOMO and LUMO orbitals that are nominally located in the cluster core.  Hammett studies of Au-PPh3 ligands with para- and meta- methyl and methoxy groups indicate that electronic resonance effects dominate electrostatic effects, but do not specify whether resonance effects stop at the Au-P bond or extend into the cluster core.  Quantum chemical calculations show no significant trend in charge on the Au atoms, but do show a pattern of alternating shortened and lengthened bonds that includes the Au-P bond, consistent with resonance effects spanning the full cluster.  Computed orbitals show a substantial contribution from atomic orbitals of the ligand substituent to the cluster-core-based HOMO orbital for the para- case, mediated by phenyl ring and phosphorous orbitals.  These results suggest that a resonance picture must exist to rationalize ligand effects in nanoclusters and, potentially, nanoparticles, even in the ground state.

Here we demonstrate the carbon capture ability of niobium polyoxometalates (POMs) as aqueous solutions, specifi-cally [Nb6O19]8-, Nb6. Upon exposure of Nb6 solutions to CO2, Nb6 fragments and binds carbonate, evidenced by crystalliza-tion of Nb-carbonate POMs including [Nb22O53(CO3)16]28-and [Nb10O25(CO3)6]12\u2212. While Rb/Cs+ counter cations yielded crystal structures to understand the chemisorption processes, K+ counter cations enabled higher capture efficiency (based on CO3:Nb ratio), as determined by CHN analysis and thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry of the isolated solids. Sum fre-quency generation (SFG) spectroscopy also showed higher carbon capture efficiency of the K-Nb6 solutions at the air-water interface, while small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provided insight into the role of the alkalis in influencing these process-es. Tetramethylammonium counter cations (TMA), like K+, demonstrated high efficiency of carbonate chemisorption at the interface, but SAXS and Raman of the bulk showed a predominance of a Nb24-POM (HxNb24O72, x~9) that can bind car-bonate only minimally, and any carbonate present is likely free bicarbonate instead of Nb-bound. Control experiments show that all carbonate present at the interface is Nb-bound, and the Nb-carbonate species are stabilized by alkalis, demon-strating a synergistic role of alkalis and high oxidation state metal cations in chemisorption of CO2.

Expansion of the reaction space permits catalysts to be as-sessed for generality and this provides another useful metric for measuring the effectiveness of a catalyst. The catalyst generality algorithm will assign quantitative generality values to catalyst structures but such broad assessments are applied with the assumption that the reactions under evaluation are more or less the same by disregarding any inherent challenges associated with a particular reaction class. To address this limitation, we introduce two new met-rics, relative generality and risk. These are designed to correct for variations in reaction difficulty and enable a more nuanced evaluation of catalyst performance relative to the specific demands of each reaction. We show in a number of challenging examples that these metrics allow researchers to distinguish between catalysts genuinely exhibiting superior performance and those appearing favorable due to application toward less demanding reactions.

The prevailing idea that life originated from a sequence of chemical reactions, starting from very simple active molecules and evolving into progressively more complex systems, might be incorrect for two reasons: First, after 70 years of experiments, we still lack robust experimental demonstration of such networks; second, small reactive molecules typically do not exist in high concentrations and readily react to form tars and other complex mixtures. Here I adopt an alternative approach, demonstrating that numerous primary metabolites can be derived from tar-like mixtures through the Advanced Reduction Process (ARP). Tars are formed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are widespread in the Universe and likely were the main source of organic carbon on early Earth.  Under conditions thought to exist on the prebiotic Earth\u2014characterized by sunlight, an anoxic sulfur-rich atmosphere, and iron-rich dust - PAH suspensions in water are decomposed to  succinic, lactic, malonic, and glycolic acids, all known as primary metabolites in all living systems and main components of ubiquitous citric acid cycle. The sum of reaction yields for these biologically important metabolites reaches up to 40%, with individual product yields ranging from 1-15%. The simplicity of this reaction and the ubiquity of PAHs on prebiotic Earth make this process particularly appealing, suggesting it could have occurred on a vast scale on sunlit planetary surfaces.

We investigate the occupation of active sites, the hydrogen bond network at the interface and the structural response of the surfaces to water adsorption. On both terminations, water adsorbs via a partial dissociative mode. The contact layer is populated by molecular water as well as OH groups and surface OH resulting from proton transfer to the surface. The B-termination is more reactive, with a higher degree of dissociation in the contact layer with water (46%). On the B-terminated surface water barely adsorbs on the Co2+ sites and almost exclusively binds and dissociates on the Co3+ sites. The interaction with the surface consists mostly, of Co3+-Ow bonds and proton transfer exclusively to the 3-fold unsaturated surface Os1. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules in the aqueous film dominate the hydrogen bond network and no hydrogen bonds between water and the surface is observed. The A-terminated surface is less reactive. Water binds covalenlty on Co2+ sites, with a dissociation degree of 13% . Proton transfer occurs mostly on the 3-fold unsaturated surface oxygens Os1. Besides, short-lived surface OH arising from proton transfer to 3-fold unsaturated surface oxygens Os2 are observed. H-bonding to surface Os1 and Os2 constitute 12.7% and 19.8% of the H-bond network, respectively, and the largest contribution is found among the water molecules (67.4%). On both surfaces, the coordination number of the active sites drives the relaxations of the outermost atoms positions to the their bulk counterparts.

Recently, small-molecule\nligands have been developed that have some selectivity for and covalently inhibit cyclin dependent kinase 12 (CDK12). CDK12 is involved in the transcription of elongated RNA\nsections that results in the DM1 condition. The covalent bond is achieved after nucleophilic addition to a Michael acceptor warhead. Previous studies of the conformational preferences of thio-Michael additions have focused on characterizing the reaction profile based on the distance\nbetween the sulfur and \u03b2-carbon atoms. Rotamerism, however, has not been investigated extensively and can have a large impact on reaction rates and adduct yields. Here, we use high-level quantum chemistry calculations, up to coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative\ntriple excitations [CCSD(T)], to characterize the gas-phase nucleophilic addition of an archetypal nucleophile, methanethiolate, to various nitrogen-containing Michael acceptors which are representative of the small-molecule CDK12 inhibitors. By investigating the structural,\nenergetic, and electronic properties of the enolate intermediates, we show that synclinal additions are energetically favored over antiperiplanar additions due to the greater magnitude of attractive non-covalent interactions permitted by the conformation. The calculated transition states associated with the addition process indicate that synclinal addition proceeds via lower energetic barriers than antiperiplanar addition and is the preferred reaction pathway.

Fuelled by the recent progress in deep learning methodology and the abundance of new algorithms, it is tempting to chase benchmarks and incrementally build ever more capable machine learning (ML) models. While model evaluation has made significant progress, the intrinsic limitations arising from the underlying experimental data are often overlooked. In the chemical sciences data collection is costly, thus datasets are small and experimental errors can be significant. These limitations of such datasets affect their predictive power, a fact that is rarely considered in a quantitative way. \nIn this study, we analyse commonly used ML datasets for regression and classification from drug discovery, molecular discovery, and materials discovery. We derived maximum and realistic performance bounds for nine such datasets by introducing noise based on estimated or actual experimental errors. We then compared the estimated performance bounds to the reported performance of leading ML models in the literature. Out of the nine datasets and corresponding ML models considered, four were identified to have reached or surpassed dataset performance limitations and thus, they may potentially be fitting noise. More generally, we systematically examine how data range, the magnitude of experimental error, and the number of data points influence dataset performance bounds. Alongside this paper, we release the Python package NoiseEstimator and provide a web- based application for computing realistic performance bounds. This study and the resulting tools will help practitioners in the field understand the limitations of datasets and set realistic expectations for ML model performance. This work stands as a reference point, offering analysis and tools to guide development of future ML models in the chemical sciences.  \n", "date": "2024-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Through detailed kinetic measurements on MoOx/SiO2, we validate a dynamic site renewal and decay cycle, analogous to WOx/SiO2, which operates in tandem with the Chauvin cycle and can be effectively modulated by co-feeding 4MEs.

These libraries were panned against the -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting stimulatory sequence (FSS) RNA pseudoknot of SARS-CoV-2, which revealed specific macrocyclic peptide sequences that bind this essential motif with high affinity and selectivity.  Peptide binding localizes to the FSS dimerization loop based on chemical modification analysis and binding assays.  This work introduces a novel system for the generation and high-throughput screening of topologically diverse cyclopeptide scaffolds (multiplexed MOrPH-PhD), and it provides a blueprint for the exploration and evolution of genetically encoded macrocyclic peptides that target specific RNAs.", "date": "2024-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Combinatorial Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previously, we have shown that polymer chains with sufficient stiffness and intermolecular attractions can undergo an emergent, polymerization-driven nematic alignment of nascent oligomers during a step-growth polymerization process. Both the extent of alignment and the point in the reaction at which it occurs impacts the kinetics and the sequence development of the growing polymer. Of particular interest is the emergence of a characteristic block length in the ensemble of sequences, resulting in unusually peaked block length distributions. Here we explore the emergence of this characteristic block length in time and investigate how changes in activation energy, solution viscosity, and monomer density influence the sequence and block length distributions of stiff copolymers undergoing step-growth polymerization. We find that emergent aggregation and nematic ordering restricts the availability of longer chains to form bonds, thereby altering the propensity of chains to react in a length dependent fashion, which changes as the reaction progresses, and promoting the formation of chains and blocks of a characteristic length. Further, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale which emerges is sensitive to the relative timescales of reaction kinetics and reactant diffusion, shifting in response to changes in the activation energy of the reaction and the viscosity of the solvent. Our observations suggest the potential for biasing characteristic lengths of sequence repeats in stiff and semi-flexible copolymer systems by targeting specific non-bonded interactions and reaction kinetics through the informed adjustment of reaction conditions and the selection or chemical modification of monomer species.", "date": "2024-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers); Polymerization kinetics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this contribution, an experimental method that can simultaneously monitor the ultrafast dynamics at the surface and above the surface in photoinduced heterogeneous reactions is presented. The method relies on a combination of mass spectrometry and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. As a model system, the photoinduced reaction of methyl iodide on and above a cerium oxide surface is investigated. The species that are simultaneously detected from the surface and gas-phase present distinct features in the mass spectra, such as a sharp peak followed by an adjacent broad shoulder. The sharp peak is attributed to the species detected from the surface while the broad shoulder is due to the detection of gas-phase species above the surface, as confirmed by multiple experiments. By monitoring the evolution of the sharp peak and broad shoulder as a function of the pump-probe time delay, transient signals are obtained that describe the ultrafast photoinduced reaction dynamics of methyl iodide on the surface and in gas-phase.

The y-intercept values obtained from the linear regressions are in good agreement with the range of absolute reduction potentials reported in the literature for the SCE but reveal several sources of systematic error. The y-intercepts from Q\u25cf\u2212/Q2\u2212  calculations are lower than those of Q/Q\u25cf\u2212 by around 400 mV for PCM and SM12 and 200 mV for COSMO.

However, developing NDSS also requires proving that the performance obtained during this first validation remains valid when conditions change. This generic problem is referred to as robustness in chemometrics. When the measurement conditions change, the measured spectrum is subject to a deviation. The reproducibility of the model, and thus of the sensor, with respect to this deviation, defines its robustness. The application of NDSS involves a large number of processes, and thus deviation sources. Instrument cloning, between laboratory instruments or from a benchtop to an online device, is certainly the most concerning issue for deploying NDSS-based applications. This problem has been studied for many years in chemometrics, under the paradigm of calibration transfer, through geometric corrections of spectra, spectral spaces, or calibration model corrections. The same problem has been addressed in the machine learning community under the domain adaptation paradigm. Although all these issues have been addressed separately over the last twenty years, they all fall under the same topic, i.e., model maintenance under dataset shift.

Biochemical measurement of these sterols is important for correct diagnosis and sometimes monitoration of treatment. Existing methods to measure sterols in blood, particularly plant sterols, are often laborious and time consuming. Partly as a result, clinical access to sterol measurements are limited in many parts of the world.\n\nMETHODS. \nA simple and rapid method to extract free sterols from human serum and quantitate their concentration using isotope-dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) without derivatization was developed. The method was designed to be \u201ccompatible\u201d with routine workflows (eg. 96-well format) in a clinical lab and was extensively validated. Serum from 73 controls were analyzed and used to estimate the upper reference limits for sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, desmosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC), lathosterol and cholestanol. Serum from patients with the rare lipid disorders sitosterolemia (n=7), Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome (SLOS; n=1) and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX; n=1) were analyzed.\n \nRESULTS. \nAll seven sitosterolemia patients were measured to have greatly elevated levels of free plant sterols (sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol) compared to the controls. The SLOS serum contained massively increased concentrations of 7DHC and an unidentified compound (likely 8-dehydrocholesterol). CTX serum contained greatly increased concentrations of cholestanol, as well as 7DHC and lathosterol. Spiking experiments indicated that the method is likely also useful in the diagnosis of desmosterolosis and lathosterolosis.\n\nCONCLUSION. \nThe reported method is a relatively simple and fast method capable of quantitating diagnostically important sterols and differentiating patients with several rare lipid disorders from controls.\n", "date": "2024-05-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The magnitude of the observed shifts correlated with the alkyl chain length of the alcohol solvents and with their polarizability and solvent-accessible surface area. Control experiments under off-resonance conditions in which none of the vibrational bands of interest were coupled to the cavity showed no shifts. We interpreted these experiments as evidence that strong coupling is responsible for the observed shifting, and that the change in solvent polarity was due to the impact of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on London dispersion forces within the coupled solvent.  However, additional experiments and transfer matrix simulations (TMS) to mimic the transmission of light through the optical Fabry Perot (FP) cavity have caused us to revisit this interpretation. We now believe that the observed shifts for Reichardt\u2019s dye were an optical artifact caused by neglecting reflection when measuring absorbance in transmission mode. Unfortunately, the parameters found to modulate the magnitude of the shift in our experiments were also found to do the same in the TMS. We regret to not have identified the underlying reason for the shift in the absorption spectrum and hope that the simulation results presented here will be instructive for the Strong Coupling community.

Here, water-stable macroporous hydrogels were fabricated using alginate and TEMPO-oxidized cellulose via a new approach involving ice templating and topotactic ion-crosslinking with Ca2+. This approach allows to fully avoid the energy-intensive lyophilization process and results in composite hydrogels with pore sizes akin to those found in celery xylem, a model we chose for plant stems. Importantly, the pore size could be tailored by adjusting both the ice-growth velocities and the ratios of alginate to oxidized cellulose. The resulting hydrogels displayed remarkable water stability along with viscoelastic properties and wettability that depend on the alginate and oxidized cellulose ratios. Mechanical properties, such as compression stress and toughness, consistently increased with higher alginate contents. In addition, liquid transport measurements on crosslinked hydrogels with varying compositions and ice growth velocities revealed comparable rising speeds to those observed in celery, confirming the ability of polysaccharide-based hydrogels obtained by ice templating and topotactic crosslinking as relevant materials to mimic the function of plant stems.

We have previously shown the potential of the aerobic oxidation for a functionalization of several model p-tolyl-siloxanes to corresponding p-carboxyphenyl-derivatives. Unfortunately, this method has several drawbacks: limited scope, time and energy consumption, as well as scaling problems. We now present their solution. Mild and highly effective liquid-phase [M]-/organo-catalyzed aerobic functionalization of alkylaryl-siloxanes was developed. Reactions proceed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure within 0.5-24 h yielding products in quantitative conversions and high yields. Components of the catalytic system are simple, cheap and commercially available: Co(OAc)2 as earth-abundant metal-catalyst, and N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) as an organo-catalyst. A unique combination of solvents with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) being both co-solvent and process activator (usually in small quantities, 10-25%), provided high efficiency. HFIP allows to overcome scope limitations (most substrates were not oxidized in the absence of HFIP). It also dramatically increases process efficiency minimizing time and energy consumption (reaction time is 0.5-24 h, at r.t. and 1 atm) and solving scalability problems (\u2265100 g). Method allows to obtain a wide range of both carboxy-, carbonyl- and hydroxy-aryl-containing silanes/siloxanes of linear, hyperbranched, cyclic and cage (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes or spherosilicates) structure.

These systems store electricity via electrochemically active organic molecules in an aqueous solvent, which offers superior safety and renewability compared to organic solvents. Furthermore, AORFBs provide a cost-effective alternative to aqueous vanadium-based redox flow batteries. However, designing molecules with adequate electrochemical properties that are also soluble in water and stable during long-term cycling remains a challenge. In this study, we investigate the impact of PEGylation as a potential solution to address these issues. A simple and efficient synthetic approach was used to prepare PEG-containing viologens, with different chain lengths, counterions and symmetries. Their physical and electrochemical properties, including solubility, viscosity, redox potential and heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant, were studied. The results demonstrate that PEG chains enhance solubility in water, and that the chloride counterion increases solubility by 25% compared to the tosylate counterion. None of the studied modifications had a significant impact on the electrochemical properties, demonstrating the usefulness of N-substitution in tuning the solubility without compromising the use of the viologens as negolytes. Although asymmetric derivatives yielded higher solubilities (up to 2.7 M), the most stable organic negolyte under cycling conditions at high concentration (1 M) was a symmetric viologen containing two PEG units (12 days with 0.29% of capacity loss per day).

Molecular dynamics show that the binding pocket remains intact upon adsorption. We find that, if the net negative charge on the peptide results in a negatively charged complex, excess cations are recruited to the interface by non-selective Coulombic interactions that compromise selective REE capture.

We analyzed optimal flow conditions and network structures for power-law fluids in linear, parabolic, hyperbolic, hyperbolic cosine and sinusoidal converging-diverging dendritic networks of tubes and rectangular channels, and aiming to maximize flow conductance under volume and surface-area constraints. This model shed light on strategies to achieve efficient fluid transport within these complex dendritic networks. Our study focused on steady, incompressible, 2D planar and axisymmetric laminar flow without considering network losses. We found that the flow conductance is highly sensitive to network geometry. The maximum conductance occurs when a specific radius/channel-height ratio $\\beta$ is achieved. This value depends on the constraint as well as on the vessel geometry such as tube or rectangular channel. However independent of the kind of the  converging-diverging profile along the length of the vessel.

However, introducing a slight taper to channel walls leads to a qualitatively different clogging mechanism. Clogs of rigid particles do not grow continuously in these tapered pores. Instead, new clogs form upstream of pre-existing clogs, truncating their growth, and thereby creating multiple distinct clogs within a channel. We refer to this novel phenomenon as discontinuous clogging. Here, we investigate its features by analyzing the dimensions and locations of discontinuous clogs in parallel tapered pores. Measurements reveal the discontinuity of clog growth depends strongly on flow driving pressure and particle volume fraction. Increasing volume fraction increases clogging frequency and positions the clogs upstream, in wider regions of the channels. Two regimes of driving pressure appear to exist as the discontinuous clogs are observed to become dramatically longer above a critical pressure. Interestingly, these long clogs are located downstream, towards the channel outlet, at the lowest volume fraction. However, they are increasingly located upstream as volume fraction increases. The dependence of clog location on pressure and volume fraction lends insight into bridging mechanism. Particles arriving simultaneously to a given location can span the channel width to form a bridge, which happens easily at higher volume fractions. Permanent clogs form when driving pressure is lower than the force the bridges can sustain. As driving pressure increases, however, it can overcome the force chains, preventing formation of new permanent clogs, and pushing particles further downstream.", "date": "2024-05-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Fluid Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

When biased under hydrogen evolution conditions, EIS shows that two simultaneous processes occur in a-TiO2 protected photocathodes, which introduces an ambiguity in choosing the correct equivalent circuit to describe the operating device.

We start with a field of surfactant microliter-droplets floating on water, that upon the release of surfactant drive local, outbound Marangoni flows and myelin filament growth. Next, we introduce a competing surfactant based on a hydrolysable amide, which is more surface active than the myelin surfactant and thereby inhibits the local Marangoni flows and myelin growth from the droplets. Upon introducing a pH gradient, the amide surfactant hydrolyses in the acidic region, so that the local Marangoni flows and myelin growth are reestablished.

This review focuses on MHAT/radical-polar crossover (MHAT/RPC) conditions, offering a novel perspective on generating electrophilic intermediates and facilitating various intramolecular reactions. Upon using cobalt hydrides, the MHAT mechanism displayed exceptional chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance, making it invaluable for the construction of complex biologically relevant molecules under mild conditions. Recent developments have enhanced regioselectivity and expanded the scope of MHAT-type reactions, enabling the formation of cyclic molecules via hydroalkoxylation, hydroacyloxylation, and hydroamination. Notably, the addition of an oxidant to traditional MHAT systems enables the synthesis of rare cationic alkylcobalt(IV) complexes, bridging radical mechanisms to ionic reaction systems. This review culminates with examples of natural product syntheses and exploration of asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation, highlighting the ongoing challenges and opportunities for future research to achieve higher enantioselectivity.

Thiamine pyrophosphate 2a (TPP, the bioactive form of 1) functions as a coenzyme of a variety of enzymes. To understand the role of vitamin B1 in these diseases, a chemical approach is to use coenzyme analogues to compete with TPP for the enzyme active site, abolishing the coenzyme function. Exemplified by oxythiamine 3a and triazole hydroxamate 4, chemical probes require the coenzyme analogues to be membrane-permeable and of broad inhibitory activity to the enzyme family (rather than being too selective to particular TPP-dependent enzymes). In this study, using biochemical assays, we show that changing the hydroxamate metal-binding group of 4 to a 1,3-dicarboxylate moiety leads to potent inhibition of multiple TPP-dependent enzymes. We further demonstrate that this di-anionic thiamine analogue when masked in its diester form becomes membrane-permeable and can be unmasked by esterase treatment.

We synthesized and characterized a range of acetylated (acPEI, 10-50%) and succinylated (zPEI, 2-40%) PEIs, assessing their capacity to condense and deliver DNA effectively. Both acetylation and succinylation modify the colloidal and charge properties of PEI polyplexes, enhance DNA release, and alter transfection efficacy. In particular, low levels of succinylation substantially improve transgene expression in the presence of serum proteins.  Structurally, acetylation consistently reduces DNA packaging density, while succinylation exhibits a more complex behavior where DNA packing density first decreases then increases with higher levels of modification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the internal structure of PEI polyplexes is profoundly affected by pH during condensation and the pH environment during transfection. Lower pH conditions strengthen PEI-DNA interactions, resulting in polyplexes that are not only more stable, but also exhibit tighter DNA packaging.

Their efficiency relies on the assembly of INPs into large functional aggregates, with the size of ice nucleation sites determining activity. Experimental freezing spectra have revealed two distinct, defined aggregate sizes, typically classified as class A and C ice nucleators (INs). Despite the importance of INPs and years of extensive research, the precise number of INPs forming the two aggregate classes and their assembly mechanism have remained enigmatic. Here, we report that bacterial ice nucleation activity emerges from more than two prevailing aggregate species and identify the specific number of INPs responsible for distinct crystallization temperatures. We find that INP dimers constitute class C INs, tetramers class B INs, and hexamers and larger multimers are responsible for the most efficient class A activity. We propose a hierarchical assembly mechanism based on tyrosine interactions for dimers, and electrostatic interactions between INP dimers to produce larger aggregates. This assembly is membrane-assisted: increasing the bacterial outer membrane fluidity decreases the population of the larger aggregates, while preserving the dimers. Inversely, DPBS buffer increases the population of multimeric class A and B aggregates 200-fold and endows the bacteria with enhanced stability towards repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Our analysis suggests that the enhancement results from the better alignment of dimers in the negatively charged outer membrane, due to screening of their electrostatic repulsion. This constitutes the first demonstration of enhancement of the most potent bacterial INs.

However, due to Pt cost, there is a need for cheaper alternatives. Indeed, highly active ruthenium nanoparticles are promising alternative. In this contribution, we use DFT (PBE-D2) calculations to understand the differences in the catalytic activities of Ru and Pt materials by considering slab models containing crystalline close packed planes, terraces, steps, islands and adatoms. Results reveal that the strong adsorption of isolated H atoms on either material and on various sites prevents the hydrogen evolution reaction from taking place. Regardless of the model considered, the formation of a monolayer is also too favorable, thus suggesting that higher coverages are needed before HER onset. The adsorption energies of H atoms exceeding the monolayer on platinum's crystalline surfaces, defective steps and terraces are very close to the ideal value, consistent with platinum's high catalytic activity.  These results outline that the presence of lowly coordinated metal centers has little effect on the reactivity of Pt. The adsorption energy of extra H on Ru surfaces depends on the adsorption site: On non-defective sites, the adsorption of the extra H is unfavorable, leading to inefficient catalysts. In contrast, the adsorption on defective sites is favorable and close to the ideal value, thus suggesting an enhancement of the catalytic activity when Ru coordination decreases. These results outline that the reactivity toward hydrogen of Ru materials is more sensitive to surface morphology than Pt-based ones. Indeed, the presence of low coordinated centers is larger on Ru nanoparticles, thus rationalizing their high HER catalytic activity.

Metallic NC superlattices can enhance vibrational signals under far-field detection by generating a myriad of intensified electric field hot spots between the NCs. Yet, their effectiveness is limited by the fixed electron concentration dictated by the metal composition and inefficient hot spot creation due to the large mode volume. Doped metal oxide NCs, such as tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), could overcome these limitations by enabling broad tunability of resonance frequencies in the mid-infrared range through independent variation of size and doping concentration. This study investigates the potential of close-packed ITO NC monolayers for surface enhanced infrared absorption by quantifying trends in the coupling between their plasmon modes and various molecular vibrations. We show that maximum vibrational\nsignal intensity occurs in monolayers composed of larger, more highly doped NCs, where the plasmon resonance peak lies at higher frequency than the molecular vibration. Using finite element and mutual polarization methods, we establish that near-field enhancement is stronger on the low-frequency side of the plasmon resonance and for more strongly coupled plasmonic NCs, thus rationalizing the design rules we experimentally uncovered.

The reaction network of two CIs with different functionality, i.e. acetaldehyde oxide (CH3CHOO) and glyoxal oxide (CHOCHOO) formed in the ozone-assisted oxidation reaction of crotanaldehyde (CA), is investigated over a temperature range between 390 K and 840 K in an atmospheric pressure jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at a residence time of 1.3 s, stoichiometry of 0.5, and 89% Ar dilution. Molecular-beam mass spectrometry in conjunction with single photon tunable synchrotron vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) radiation is used to identify elusive intermediates by means of experimental photoionization energy scans and ab initio threshold energy calculations for isomer identification. Addition of ozone (1000 ppm) is observed to trigger the oxidation of CA already at 390 K, which is below the temperature where the oxidation reaction of CA was observed in the absence of ozone. The observed CA + O3 product, C4H6O4, is found to be linked to a ketohydroperoxide (2-hydroperoxy-3-oxobutanal) resulting from the isomerization of the primary ozonide. Products corresponding to the CIs uni- and bi-molecular reactions were observed and identified. A network of CI reactions is identified in the temperature region below 600 K, characterized by CIs bimolecular reactions with species like aldehydes, i.e., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and crotonaldehyde and alkenes, i.e., ethene and propene.

Due to their well-defined structure, homogeneous catalysts can be fine-tuned to optimize reactivity, stereoselectivity, and positional selectivity, but they often suffer from instability and non-recyclability. Heterogeneous catalysts are generally highly robust but continue to lack active-site specificity and are challenging to rationally improve through structural modification. Known single-site heterogeneous catalysts for alkene isomerization utilize precious metals and bespoke, expensive, and synthetically intense supports. Additionally, they generally have mediocre reactivity, inspiring us to develop a heterogeneous catalyst with an active site made from readily available compounds made of Earth-abundant elements. Previous work demonstrated that a very active homogeneous catalyst is formed upon protonation of Ni[P(OEt)3]4 by H2SO4, generating a [Ni\u2013H]+ active site. This catalyst is incredibly active, but also decomposes readily, which severely limits its utility. Herein we show that by using a solid acid (sulfated zirconia, SZO300), not only is this de-composition prevented, but high activity is maintained, improved selectivity is achieved, and a broader scope of functional groups is tolerated. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the catalytic reaction likely goes through an intermolecular, two-electron pathway. A detailed kinetic study comparing the state-of-the-art Ni and Pd isomerization catalysts reveals that the highest activity and selectivity is seen with the Ni/SZO300 system. The reactivity of Ni/SZO300, is not limited to alkene isomerization; it is also a competent catalyst for hydroalkenylation, hydroboration, and hydrosilylation, demonstrating the broad application of this heterogeneous catalyst.

As an initial step towards that goal, we designed a rotaxane whose ring is decorated with two azobenzene photoswitches. We investigated its operation in solution and within lipid bilayers of large unilamellar vesicles. In solution, two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy showed that the photoswitches can be stochastically shuttled along the axle at 0.114 Hz. Remarkably, the azobenzene units retain their photoreversibility and fatigue resistance when integrated into the rotaxane. Moreover, a 55% increase in the hydrodynamic radius (RH) of the vesicles was induced by consecutive cycles of azobenzene photoswitching at a 10 mol% concentration of rotaxane. Initial molecular dynamic simulations suggest water accumulates near the rotaxanes in the bilayer. Therefore, it is plausible that continuous rearrangement of the lipid packing induced by each azobenzene photoisomerization could facilitate further water penetration and vesicle swelling. However, other mechanisms could also contribute to the increase in RH. Future large-scale simulations and complementary experimental techniques will offer a better understanding of the observed phenomenon and determine if shuttling occurs within the bilayer.

By examining the energy barrier heights for transitions between isomers, we determined that many of these structures are unlikely to exhibit interconversion in the ISM, outside of hotter circumstellar environments. Although Boltzmann population ratios at approximate circumstellar temperatures suggest the presence of higher energy minima, it is likely that once interconversion happens, as molecules travel away from a star and cool, they will get kinetically trapped in the potential energy well they inhabit, making how the ratios freeze out dependent on the time and pathways the molecules take to cool down.

Methyl radical (CH3), a highly reactive and short-lived key intermediate, is generally involved in direct-methane-conversion processes, but its reaction is difficult to control, especially at elevated temperatures in the presence of oxygen. The uncontrollable homogeneous transformation of CH3 in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) places an inherent upper bound on single-pass C2 yield (~ 28%) independent of catalyst, which is the major obstacle for its large-scale utilization. Here we report that surface-confined CH3 coupling represents a general strategy for the design of selective oxidative coupling of methane (SOCM) to perform controllable radical reactions. We show that tungstate sub-nanoclusters, embedded within ZrO2 matrix, can efficiently capture  highly reactive CH3 and selectively convert them into C2 products. Experimental results and kinetic modeling unambiguously show that combining catalysts for CH3 generation versus capture can be an effective approach for improving OCM catalyst performance and breaking away from limits imposed by gas-phase kinetics.

It is found that a NiII-hydride is sufficiently hydridic to facilitate the efficient transfer of hydride to the carbon center of CO2, leading to the HCOO\u2212 production. Importantly, the direct hydride transfer path proposed here bypasses the conventional CO2 insertion into a metal-hydride bond. This mechanism is elucidated through a detailed analysis of the free energy changes of the reaction and the activation barriers, where key parameters such as reduction potentials, pKa values, and the thermodynamics of hydride transfer are thoroughly evaluated. The thermodynamic hydricity of the NiII-hydride, calculated to be \u0394GH\u2212 = 19.2 kcal/mol, is in sharp contrast with the less effective NiIII-hydride with \u0394GH\u2212 = 52.4 kcal/mol, highlighting the enhanced reactivity of NiII-hydride in HCOO\u2212 formation. Additionally, an examination of the competitive formation of CO and H2 reveals the preferential tendency of NiII-hydride to produce HCOO\u2212 over these byproducts. Insights into the influence of the pKa for the proton source on the feasibility of H2 production and HCOO\u2212 selectivity are also provided, suggesting a way to optimize reaction conditions for improved selectivity and efficiency.

Furthermore, the existing models are unable to predict the variations in FROMP kinetics with changes in the resin composition and as a result are of limited utility towards accelerated discovery of new resin formulations. In this manuscript, we formulate a chemically meaningful model grounded in the established mechanism of ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP).

Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our mechanism-based model accurately predicts FROMP behavior across various resin compositions, including polymerization front velocities and thermal characteristics (e.g., Tmax). Additionally, we introduce a semi-inverse workflow that predicts FROMP behavior from a single experimental data point.

We demonstrate a concise synthesis of two novel unsymmetrical chiral PDOs on 20-40 g scale, together with eight structurally differing polyesters with excellent thermal stability; as reflected by high melting (270 oC, 277 oC), and glass transition temperatures (90 oC, 121 oC)  for two of the polymers. The steric hindrance of the intact bicyclic \u03b1-pinene ring structure protruding from the backbone of the polymers can also aid in the degradation process, manifested by facile chemical recycling of these polyesters under mild conditions to recover both monomers. Finally, our results show how the generated rigid polymers are prone to enzymatic degradation by PETase and cutinase without any chemical pre-treatment. Our results illuminate the potential of expanding the currently available chemical space in bio-based monomers to bicyclic diols to generate biomaterials with tailormade properties.", "date": "2024-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Biopolymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, we propose a multiphase nanocomposite characterized by a highly disordered microstructure and high cationic intermixing as a result from thin-film self-assembly of a perovskite-based mixed ionic-electronic conductor (lanthanum strontium cobaltite) and a fluorite-based pure ionic conductor (samarium-doped ceria) as an oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells.

The disordered nanostructure was implemented as a standalone oxygen electrode on commercial anode-supported cells, resulting in high electrical output in fuel cell and electrolysis mode for active layer thicknesses of only 200 nm (>95% decrease in critical raw materials with respect to conventional cathodes).

The results show that the reaction is initiated by a Knoevenagel-Cope condensation, followed by opening of the elemental sulfur, leading to polysulfide formation. The polysulfide intermediates can interconvert and decompose using various mechanisms including unimolecular cyclization, nucleophilic degradation, and scrambling. Protonation of the polysulfides changes their electrophilic behavior and provides a kinetically favorable pathway for their decomposition. This protonation-induced intermolecular degradation is feasible for polysulfides of all lengths, but unimolecular decomposition is kinetically favored for long polysulfides (>5 sulfur atoms). None of the pathways provide any thermodynamic benefit due to the lack of resonance-stabilized leaving group, and a complex equilibrium of polysulfides of all lengths is expected in solution.

We employ a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, encompassing many-body interactions and confinement.

Under these phase gradients, solitons transition to states with reduced amplitude and expanded spatial profiles.

This dual functionality stems from distinctly different, active forms of the catalyst, at different temporal stages of irradiation. We employ in situ NMR spectroscopy to monitor potential catalytic intermediates at various time points of irradiation by visible light.

In recent years, the investigation of Li-rich materials has revealed employing multielectron redox that couples cation and anion redox is a method to improve capacity. Coupling anion and cation redox could be a way to improve the low energy density of Na-ion cathodes, but the influence of the large Na+ on these electrochemical processes is not well understood. Here, we leverage the mixed-alkali nature of LiNaFeS2  to compare its behavior in Li vs. Na half cells. LiNaFeS2  is known to support multielectron redox by virtue of cation and anion redox in Li half cells. We now demonstrate that LiNaFeS2 can also be used as a multielectron Na cathode. Elemental analysis of the cathodes at various states of charge verify Na as the dominant mobile ion after first charge, which correlates to different structural responses that cause deviations in the electrochemistry compared to the material cycled in a Li half cell. Notably, cycling with a Na electrolyte causes the particles to roughen and amorphize. Fe and S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy show that the charge compensation mechanisms from an electronic structure point of view are fundamentally the same independent of cell configuration. The disparate electrochemical behavior is entirely due to structural rather than electronic effects, which is further probed with synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry coupled with b-value analysis.

This route offers a versatile and efficient approach to synthesize aza[1n]paracyclophanes (APCs) featuring diverse functionalities and lumens. The method operates at mild reaction temperatures (40 \u00b0C) and short reaction times (~2 h), delivering excellent isolated yields (>75% macrocycles) and up to 30% of the 6-membered cyclophane, all under non-high-dilution concentrations (35-350 mM). Structural insights into APCs reveal variations in product distribution based on different endocyclic substituents, with steric properties of exocyclic substituents having minimal influence on the macrocyclization. Aryl-type endocyclic substituents predominantly yield 6-membered macrocycles, while polycyclic aromatic units such as fluorene and carbazole favor 4-membered species. Experimental and computational studies support a proposed mechanism of ring-walking catalyst-transfer that promotes the macrocycle formation.

In this study, we present a straightforward method for resolving inter- and intra- molecular interactions in cell adhesive machinery, using quantum dot (QD) based F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. Using mechanosensitive protein Talin, one of the major components of focal adhesions, we are investigating mechanosensing ability of proteins to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. First, we quantified the distances separating Talin and a giant unilamellar vesicle membrane for three Talin variants. These variants differ in molecular length. Second, we investigated the mechanosensing capabilities of Talin, i.e., its conformation changes due to mechanical stretching initiated by cytoskeleton contraction. Our results suggest that in early focal adhesion, Talin undergoes stretching, corresponding to a decrease in the Talin-membrane distance of 2.5 nm. We demonstrate that QD-FRET nanosensors can be applied for the sensitive quantification of mechanosensing with sub-nanometer accuracy.", "date": "2024-05-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Biophysics; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Dysregulation of CA levels contributes to neurological disorders and heart diseases. Thus, detecting imbalances in CAs levels is crucial for diagnosing early stages of CA-associated diseases. Here, we present innovative fluorescent sensors designed for rapid and selective detection of CAs within cells and tissue, overcoming the limitations of conventional diagnostic methods that necessitate cell destruction. The sensor operates by a dual-reaction trigger, leveraging the exceptional selectivity of o-phenylenediamine for aldehyde and phenylboronic acid for catechol, resulting in the production of a FRET signal exclusively for CAs in the presence of other aldehydes and catechols within cells. To circumvent issues such as spectral cross-talk, excitation intensity fluctuations, inner filtering, photobleaching, and detector sensitivity, we employed Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) combined with FRET (FLIM-FRET) to accurately measure CAs levels at a nanosecond scale. This makes FLIM-FRET highly proficient for live cell and tissue imaging. Remarkably, we utilized this dual-reaction trigger FLIM-FRET system to detect endogenous CAs levels within cells in response to enzyme activators and inhibitors and within diseased-model mice tissue.

It is challenging to modify a catalyst's electronic structure without changing its geometric structure. Recent studies found that the second-order ferromagnetic to paramagnetic (FM-PM) phase transition could promote catalytic performance without altering the geometric structures of active sites, which was also known as the magneto-catalytic effect (MCE). However, the understanding of the MCE is still incomplete. Herein, we conducted systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to clarify the complex reaction mechanisms for conversions of nitrogen-containing small molecules on both FM and PM Ni (111) surfaces. Our microkinetic modeling (MKM) results demonstrate that FM-PM phase transition promotes the N2O decomposition activity of FM Ni catalyst but decreases its activity for NO decomposition while showing a negligible influence on the activity of ammonia decomposition. These results indicate the promotion, inhibition, and disappearance mechanisms of MCE on the catalytic activity, which further changes the selectivity of different products. We anticipate the MCE will work as an effective strategy for fine-tuning the activity and selectivity of ferromagnetic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, providing an extra basis for rational catalyst design.", "date": "2024-05-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, employing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the driving force and the thermodynamic barrier of Li+ ion adsorption onto Li0.5CoO2 (104) in LiClO4-, LiPF6-, and LiTFSI-based EC/EMC (3:7) electrolytes. The weaker cation-anion pairing in LiTFSI compared to LiClO4 was found to enhance the driving force for adsorption from -0.48 eV in LiClO4 to -1.26 eV in LiTFSI for an electrode-electrolyte interface with zero cation coverage, which was accompanied by an increased thermodynamic barrier from 0.33 eV in LiClO4 to 0.43 eV in LiTFSI at equilibrium surface coverage of Li+ ions. The hindered diffusivity of the solvent molecules in the electric double layer (EDL) at the electrode-electrolyte interface was the main contributor to the thermodynamic barrier for ion transport. The entropic component of the thermodynamic barrier was found to be more than one order of magnitude smaller for ClO4  compared to the TFSI-, which can be attributed to the presence of more ClO4  than TFSI- in EDL, causing more structural changes in EDL. The strong dependence of the entropic component of the thermodynamic barrier on the EDL structure enables its decoupling from the enthalpic components (e.g., ion-pairing that can be tuned independently) and thus can be used to control the kinetics of the interfacial transport.

Here, employing first-principles calculations based on a nanoreactor scheme, we study the cBN epitaxial nucleation on the diamond (001) surface under a limited-H condition. The discovered mechanism is initiated by inserting BN units into the surface dimer bond, leading to an island formation, which initially expands laterally - along the diamond surface - but rapidly switches to out-of-plane 3-dimensional growth. A high reaction barrier on the surface (~0.4-0.8 eV, 1300 K) aligns with challenging nucleation observed in experiments. Examining the environment hydrogen concentration effect revealed the origin of diverse BN phases experimentally, i.e., hydrogen deficiency favors amorphous BN (aBN) growth, whereas excessive hydrogen significantly raises sp2 bonding fraction, resulting in hexagonal BN (hBN) layers.

In this work we present the first example of all-visible, all-light responsive, path independent, and fully orthogonal photoswitching. By combining two recently developed indigoid photoswitches - peri-anthracenethioindigo and rhodanine-based chromophore - a four-state system is established and each state can be accessed in very high yields completely independently and also with visible light irradiation only. The four states give rise to four different colors, which can be transferred to a solid polymer matrix yielding a multi-state photochromic material of high versatility. Further, combination with a fluorescent dye as third component is possible elevating applicability in all-photonic molecular logic behavior and information processing with this orthogonal photoswitching system.", "date": "2024-05-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Photochemistry (Org.); Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, QM calculations are often time-insensitive and prone to basis set dependence. Alternatively, fluctuating charge (FQ) models offer a promising avenue for partial charge derivation, boasting significant speed advantages conducive to large-scale screening. Building upon our previous work, which tailored an FQ model for zinc-containing complexes, we have extended this model to include additional 3d transition metals integral to the life sciences, namely chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel. Employing CM5 charges as reference points for parameterization, our FQ model accurately reproduces partial charges for 3d metal complexes featuring biologically relevant ligands. Furthermore, by using atomic charges derived by our FQ model, MD simulations have been performed, and the results show excellent performance in simulating proteomic metal sites housing multiple metal ions. Specifically, our simulations accurately capture the behavior of a metalloprotein containing an iron-sulfur cluster and another containing a di-manganese metal site.

Five different ligands derived from the Keggin structure (HBW11O398-, PW11O397-, SiW11O399-, GeW11O399-, and GaW11O399-) were successfully crystalized with six different cations (Na+, Sr2+, Ba2+, La3+, Ce4+, Th4+) and characterized by single crystal XRD.

Despite having a similar first-coordination sphere geometry (i.e., 8-coordinated), the nature of the central cation was found to impact the long-range geometry of the complexes. This unique crystallographic dataset shows that, despite the traditional consensus, the local geometry of the cation (i.e., metal-oxygen bond distance) is not enough to depict the full impact of the complexed metal ion. The bending and twisting of the complexes, as well as ligand-ligand distances were all impacted by nature of the central cation. We also observed that counterions play a critical role by stabilizing the geometry of the M(XW11)2 complex and directing complex-complex interactions in the lattice. We also define certain structural limits for this type of complex, with the large Ba2+ ion seemingly approaching those limits.

This new strategy of vibrational strong coupling (VSC), if feasible, will offer a paradigm shift in synthetic chemistry through cavity-enabled bond-selective chemical transformations. This so-called VSC regime operates in the absence of any light source, occurs under the resonance condition when cavity frequency matches the molecular vibrational frequency, and only occurs at the normal incidence when considering in-plane momentum inside a Fabry-Perot cavity. In this work, we provide a potential mechanism that explains all observed phenomena. Using numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations and an analytic rate theory, we have demonstrated the resonant suppression of the rate constant when coupling the cavity mode to a vibrational spectator mode in a model reaction. Both the analytic theory and the simulations can explain previously observed phenomena, including the non-linear change of the rate constant when increasing Rabi splitting, modification of both reactive enthalpy and entropy, and for a reason why with a very low barrier, there is a lack of the cavity modification.

Our results predict the existence of multiple peaks in the photon frequency-dependent rate profile for a strongly anharmonic molecular system with multiple vibrational transition energies.

The peak intensity is determined jointly by kinetic factors. Going beyond the single-molecule limit, we examine the effects of the collective coupling of two molecules to the cavity. We find that when two identical molecules are simultaneously coupled to the same resonant cavity mode, the reaction rate is further increased. This additional increase is associated with the activation of a cavity-induced intermolecular reaction channel.

Subtype-selective OXR PET ligands have not yet been reported. The present work deals with the development of 18F-labeled OXR ligands dervived from selective OX1R antagonist JH112.\nMethods: Applying computational analysis, medicinal chemistry, integrated OXR binding studies, Cu-mediated 18F-fluorination and initial small animal PET studies, we evaluated a series of OXR ligands (1a-1f), varying the heteroarene scaffold of FH112 by 5-fluorobenzoxazole, 5-/6-fluorobenzthiazole and 6-fluoroquinoxaline. Receptor binding studies were preformed on HEK293T cells transiently expressing the OX1R and OX2R. Cu-mediated 18F-fluorination was performed on BPin and boroxine precursors. In vitro assays for logD7.4, stability in plasma, plasma-protein binding and potential P-gp-mediated transport in the Caco-2 monolayer model were performed. The brain uptake of 18F-labeled ligands was studied by dynamic PET imaging in rats.\nResults: Computational analysis predicted that fluorine substitution (1e) and introduction of the fluorobenzothiazole scaffold (1f) would be suitable for maintaining high OX1R affinity. After multi-step synthesis of 1a-1f, in vitro OXR binding studies confirmed molecular dynamics calculations and revealed single-digit nanomolar OX1R affinities for 1a-f, ranging from 0.69 nM-2.5 nM. The benzothiazole 1f showed high OX1R affinity (Ki = 0.69 nM), along with 77-fold subtype selectivity over OX2R. Cu-mediated 18F-fluorination of the nonselective OXR ligands benzothiazole [18F]1c and quinoxaline [18F]1d yielded RCY of 44% and 56%, respectively, after 10 min, compared to low RCY for benzoxazole [18F]1a of 12% after 20 min. The nonselective OXR ligand [18F]1c and the selective OX1R ligand [18F]1f gave total activity yields of 14% and 22%, respectively, using boroxine precursors for Cu-mediated 18F-fluorination with 5 min reaction time and a total synthesis time of 50-60 min. [18F]1c and [18F]1f were stable in plasma and serum in vitro, with logD7.4 of 2.28 ([18F]1c) and 2.37 ([18F]1f), and high plasma-protein binding of 66% and 77%, respectively, reflecting only marginal differences in brain uptake of [18F]1c (0.17 %ID/g) and [18F]1f (0.15 %ID/g). 1c showed higher passive permeability than 1f in vitro, which was consistent with the faster brain clearance of [18F]1c compared to [18F]1f. However, preinjection of the OXR antagonist suvorexant did not significantly block [18F]1c or [18F]1f uptake in the rat brain. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A to study the role of P-gp in limiting brain accumulation moderately increased brain uptake of [18F]1c and [18F]1f. Accordingly, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the P-gp inhibitor zosuquidar only moderately inhibited polarized, basal to apical transport of 1c (p<0.05) and had no influence on transport of 1f (n.s.), indicating that P-gp does not play a relevant role in brain accumulation of [18F]1c and [18F]1f in vivo.\nConclusions: The in vitro and in vivo results of [18F]1c and [18F]1f provide a solid basis for further development of suitable OXR PET ligands for brain imaging. This could be achieved through structural changes that would result in lower blood protein binding and 18F labeling methods that would allow for improved molar activities.\n", "date": "2024-05-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Many structural motifs with a variety of non-covalent interactions have been proposed for advanced adhesive properties. Here, we propose a new materials class of liquid crystalline pressure-sensitive adhesive (LC-PSA). Without the aid of hydrogen bonding or Coulomb force, a cyclooctatetraene(COT)-fused electron-deficient dipyridophenazine dimer (dppz-FLAP) forms a tight twofold columnar-stacking based on its V-shaped molecular structure (\u03c0-\u03c0 distance: 3.32 \u00c5). With the dppz-FLAP core as a mesogen of liquid crystal, a high shear LC-PSA bearing a well-defined packing structure in a hexagonal columnar phase has been developed. Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic glass substrates can be easily bonded at room temperature by simply pressing a flake sample of the molecular adhesive between the substrates. Tensile shear strengths reached approximately 1 MPa for glass, SUS and Fe substrates based on dispersion interaction with significant ductility, while the easy peelability on a PET tape was confirmed. The rigid columnar structure formed by the shape-assisted assembly results in the high cohesive force of the material, while the soft liquid crystalline properties provide sufficient fluidity as a PSA.

Ewen; Efstratios M. Kritikos; Andrea Giusti; Daniele Dini", "abstract": "Phosphate esters are important lubricant additives that decompose on metal surfaces and form protective polyphosphate films. For many applications, such as electric vehicles and wind turbines, an understanding of the molecular decomposition of lubricant additives in the presence of electric fields is urgently required. Experimental investigations have yielded contradictory results, with some suggesting that electric fields improve tribological performance, while others report the opposite effect. Here, we use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to study the decomposition of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP) molecules nanoconfined between ferrous surfaces (iron and iron oxide) under electrostatic fields. The reactive force field (ReaxFF) method is used to model the effects of chemical bonding and molecular dissociation. We study high temperatures (1000-1350 K) and electric field strengths (0.25-1.00 V/\u00c5) to accelerate decomposition. We show that the charge transfer with polarization current equalization (QTPIE) method leads to a more accurate prediction of the dissociation behaviour than the standard charge equilibration (QEq) method under applied electric fields. The rate of TNBP decomposition via carbon-oxygen bond dissociation is faster in the nanoconfined systems than in the bulk due to the catalytic action of the surfaces. In all cases, the application of an electric field accelerates TNBP decomposition due to elongation of the carbon-oxygen bonds and increased molecule-surface collisions. When electric fields are applied to the confined systems, the phosphate anions are pulled towards the surface with high electric potential, while the alkyl cations are pulled to the surface with lower potential. Analysis of the temperature- and electric field strength-dependant dissociation rate constants using the Arrhenius equation suggests that, on reactive iron surfaces, the increase in reactivity is driven mostly by an increase in the pre-exponential factor, which is linked to the number of successful collisions. Conversely, the increase in reactivity on iron oxide surfaces is attributable to a reduction in the activation energy with increasing electric field strength. Single-molecule nudged-elastic band (NEB) calculations also show a linear reduction in the energy barrier for carbon-oxygen bond breaking with electric field strength, through stabilisation of the charged transition state. The simulation results are consistent with experimental observations of enhanced tribofilm growth under electrostatic fields.

It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate-based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. It has been shown previously that alpha-synuclein fibril amplification is strongly promoted by acidic pH. Here, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets.

To identify short-comings and improve the methodology, we previously established the STGABS27 benchmark set with highly accurate experimental references for the adiabatic energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (\u2206EST). Here, we diversify this set to the STGABS27-EMS benchmark by including experimental emission energies (Eem) and use this new set to (re)-evaluate various DFT-based approaches. Surprisingly, these tests demonstrate that a state-specific (un)restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (U/ROKS) DFT coupled with a polarizable continuum model for perturbative state-specific non-equilibrium solvation (ptSS-PCM) provides exceptional accuracy for predicting Eem over a wide range of density functionals. In contrast, the main workhorse of the field, Tamm-Dancoff-approximated TD-DFT (TDA-DFT) paired with the same ptSS-PCM, is distinctly less accurate and strongly functional dependent. More importantly, while TDA-DFT requires the choice of two very different density functionals for good performance on either \u2206EST or Eem, the time-independent U/ROKS/PCM approaches deliver excellent accuracy for both quantities with a wide variety of functionals.", "date": "2024-05-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The phenomena involve the aggregation of MNPs inside the drop and the consequent extraction of the MNPs out of the drop with the drop retaining its original shape post-extraction. We define this latter phenomenon as de-encapsulation. This is the first study, which to the best of our knowledge, demonstrates such a removal of NPs from the interior of a drop (where the NPs, which were originally inside the drop, breach the drop interface, and get completely separated from the drop) without any permanent deformation of the drop.

The investigated methods encompassed density functional theory (DFT), the random phase approximation (RPA), coupled cluster (CC) theory, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte-Carlo (AFQMC) method, as well as the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method and the respective on-top methods second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT). Different strategies for selecting active spaces were explored and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach was used to solve the largest active spaces. Despite somewhat ambiguous multi-reference diagnostics, most methods gave relatively good agreement with experimental data for the chemical reactions connected to the selectivity, which only involved transition-metal complexes in their high-spin state. CC methods yielded the highest accuracy followed by range-separated DFT and AFQMC. We discussed in detail that even higher accuracies can be obtained with NEVPT2, under the prerequisite that consistent active spaces along the entire chemical reaction can be selected, which was not the case for reactions involving Fe(III). A bigger challenge for electronic-structure methods was the prediction of the spin-state energetics, which additionally involved lower spin states that exhibited larger multi-reference diagnostics. Conceptually different, typically accurate methods ranging from CC theory via DMRG-NEVPT2 in combination with large active spaces to AFQMC agreed well that the high-spin state is energetically significantly favored over the other spin states.

Although thousands of AMPs have been discovered, their molecular mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. One broad mechanism for membrane disruption is the formation of membrane-spanning hydrophilic pores which can be stabilized by AMPs. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the thermodynamics of pore formation in model single-component lipid membranes in the presence of one of three AMPs: aurein 1.2, melittin and magainin 2. To overcome the general challenge of modeling long timescale membrane-related behaviors, including AMP binding, clustering, and pore formation, we develop a generalizable methodology for sampling AMP-induced pore formation. This approach involves the long equilibration of peptides around a pore created with a nucleation collective variable by performing coarse-grained simulations, then backmapping equilibrated AMP-membrane configurations to all-atom resolution. We then perform all-atom simulations to resolve free energy profiles for pore formation while accurately modeling the interplay of lipid-peptide-solvent interactions that dictate pore formation free energies. Using this approach, we quantify free energy barriers for pore formation without direct biases on peptides or whole lipids, allowing us to investigate mechanisms of pore formation for these 3 AMPs that are a consequence of unbiased peptide diffusion and clustering. Further analysis of simulation trajectories then relates variations in pore lining by AMPs, AMP-induced lipid disruptions, and salt bridges between AMPs to the observed pore formation free energies and corresponding mechanisms. This methodology and mechanistic analysis have the potential to generalize beyond the AMPs in this study to improve our understanding of pore formation by AMPs and related antimicrobial materials.

The mechanisms by which oil-filled micelles influence interfacial tensions of non-equilibrium interfaces is poorly understood and requires deeper molecular understanding.

For an aqueous surfactant solution in contact with an oil, like an oil-in-water emulsion, this effect can alter the surfactant concentration at the interface of the two phases thereby changing the interfacial energy. Alteration of interfacial energy is expected to affect morphology of a complex system consisting of three immiscible phases. Experiments: A drop of crosslinkable silicone liquid was placed on a glass slide and was immobilized by partial crosslinking. An aqueous solution of surfactant, with SiO2 microspheres dispersed in it, was dispensed on this drop to create a liquid pool. It was then confined between two parallel plates to create a meniscus. Finding: Consequently, the particles got embedded at the oil-water interface to different extent, depending on the degree of confinement. Force balance along tangents to different interfaces showed that the interfacial energy of silicone-water (aqCTAB 0.3 mM) interface increases from 33.3 \u00b1 0.5 mJ/m2 for an unconfined system to 45.4 \u00b1 2.2 mJ/m2 for the confined one.

Corresponding radioactivity concentrations were evaluated using an NaI scintillator in a low background environment. The contamination levels were considerably lower in areas shielded from rain compared with outdoor areas exposed to rain. Contamination within concrete can be primarily attributed to radioactive Cs enrichment in specific concrete aggregates and further influenced by carbonation of the cement paste. In non-carbonated sections, radioactive Cs was concentrated in aggregates near the surface, hindering the penetration of detection into the cement paste. Concrete samples subjected to rain exhibited reduced contamination over time. Thus, rain exposure, aggregate properties, and the degree of carbonation emerged as pivotal in predicting concrete contamination.

The (PSP)Mo unit is isoelectronic with the (PNP)Mo (PNP = 2,6-bis(di-t-butylphosphinomethyl)pyridine) fragment found in the family of catalysts for the reduction of N2 to NH3 first reported in 2011 by Nishibayashi and co-workers. Under an atmosphere of N2 the reaction of 1-Cl3 with three reducing equivalents yields the dinuclear penta-dinitrogen Mo complex [(PSP)Mo(N2)2](-N2), 2. Electrochemical studies reveal that 1-Cl3 is significantly more easily reduced than (PNP)MoCl3 (with a potential ca. 0.4 eV less negative). The bridging-nitrogen complex 2 shows no indication of undergoing N2 cleavage to Mo nitride complexes. The reaction of 1-Cl3 with only two reducing equivalents, however, under N2 atmosphere and in the presence of iodide, affords the product of N2 cleavage, the nitride complex (PSP)Mo(N)(I). DFT calculations implicate another N2-bridged complex, [(PSP)Mo(I)]2(N2), as a viable intermediate in facile N2 cleavage to yield (PSP)Mo(N)(I). Conversion of the nitride ligand to NH3 has been studied. If considering sequential addition of H atoms to the nitride, formation of the first N-H bond is by far the thermodynamically least favorable of the three N-H bond formation steps. The first N-H bond was formed by reaction of (PSP)Mo(N)(I) with [LutH]Cl, where coordination of Cl\u2013 to Mo plays an essential role. Computations suggest that a second protonation, followed by a rapid and very favorable one-electron reduction, and then a third protonation, furnishes ammonia. In agreement with calculations, ammonia can be generated using either mild H-atom transfer reagents or mild reductants/acids.

In this work, we solved the co-crystal structure of the essential malarial kinase PfCLK3 with the reversible inhibitor TCMDC-135051 1. This facilitated the rational design of covalent inhibitors of this validated drug target. An allosteric cysteine residue (Cys368) that is poorly conserved in the human kinome was targeted to improve the selectivity of hit molecules. Structure-based drug design yielded chloroacetamide 4, which displays low nanomolar potency and covalent inhibition in both recombinant protein and P. falciparum killing assays. Efficacy in parasites was maintained when 4 was washed out 6 hours after exposure. Compound 4 showed significantly improved kinase selectivity relative to TCMDC-135051 1, and cell viability experiments in HepG2 cultures also demonstrated an over 500-fold selectivity index relative to P. falciparum parasites.

Like other bacteria, the pathogen produces a number of virulence factors that promote its pathogenicity. Of these, metallophores constitute an important group, able to scavenge metal ions from the surrounding environment to secure the metabolic functions of the bacterium. Pseudomonads produce the iron-chelating metallophore (siderophore) pyochelin (PCH), which, in addition to its iron scavenging ability, is an effector for the transcriptional regulator PchR in its Fe\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35-bound form (ferripyochelin). In the present study, docking studies predicted a major ferripyochelin binding site in PchR, which prompted the exploration of nor-pyochelin analogs to produce tight binding to PchR, and thereby establish a lasting effector response associated with upregulation of the genes involved in the PCH metabolism. In addition, we investigated the effects of using the analogs to bind the antimicrobial cations Ga\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35 and In\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35, leading to enhanced uptake and further disruption of the cell machinery. Selected analogs of nor-pyochelin (nor-PCH) were synthesized and their Ga\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35 and In\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35-based complexes were assessed for antimicrobial activity. The results indicate that the Ga\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35-complexes inhibit the pathogens under iron-limited conditions, while the In\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35-based systems are more effective in iron-rich media.

Similarly, two of the In\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35-based systems were particularly effective against the isolate, with an MIC of 8 \u00b5g/mL. These results show high promise in comparison with other, traditionally potent antibiotics. Preliminary mechanistic investigations of the antimicrobial activity using pseudomonal transposon mutants suggested that the inhibitory effects of the In\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35-based systems could be due to acute iron deficiency as a result of In\u1d35\u1d35\u1d35-bound bacterioferritin (BfrB).

Transient measurements were made to measure the Li+ /Li reduction potential at zero  current in pure LiCl-KCl eutectic relative to a Li-alloy reference electrode to validate the  reference potential of the LEE. Literature-reported electromotive force (emf) measurements  against Li-alloy reference electrodes were used to generate a relationship between the LEE and  the standard chlorine electrode (SClE) and this relationship was used to evaluate measured and  reported formal potential measurements for the LiCl-KCl-GdCl3 system. This work demonstrates  the general framework for defining CDEs for any molten salt system and a method for  calibrating external reference electrodes against a CDE standard reference electrode, improving  the ease of obtaining thermochemical and electrochemical measurements in any molten salt  system.", "date": "2024-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Importantly, delocalization, i.e., polaritons possess delocalized wavefunctions, is one of the hallmarks of polaritons which enables energy transport and chemical dynamics. Delocalization in polariton systems has been long assumed to be robust against energy disorder that is ubiquitous in real molecular systems. However, this study reveals that disorder destroys delocalization in polaritons. In order to mitigate the impact of disorder, a collective coupling strength exceeding 3 times the inhomogeneous linewidth is necessary. When the coupling strength is smaller, the delocalization properties of polaritons are significantly compromised both in a static picture and from a dynamic point of view. This observation indicates a more stringent criterion for preserving the unique characteristics of polaritons compared to the conventionally adopted standard (collective coupling strengths larger than photonic and molecular spectral linewidths). This work sheds lights on previous works to explain why the onset of modified dynamics is larger than the strong coupling criteria, and also serves as an important consideration for existing and future polariton studies involving high levels of energy disorder.", "date": "2024-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Quasiparticles and Excitations", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

To supplement the coverage of nonradiative transition topics, we provide here a set of active learning exercises to help students develop an intuitive understanding of the factors that determine the rate of nonradiative transitions. We start by outlining the theoretical background through the formulation of the Franck-Condon factor and its relation to the rate of nonradiative transition. We then introduce three teaching modules, with associated MATLAB and Python codes, to explore how 1) the excited state nuclear displacement, 2) the electronic energy gap between excited and ground state, and 3) the excited/ground state vibrational mode frequencies affect the magnitude of the Franck-Condon factor and thereby the rate of nonradiative transitions.

The outcome of FFLUX simulations is highly dependent on the predictive accuracy of the underlying models whose training entails determining the optimal set of model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, traditional direct learning (DL) procedures do not scale well on this task, especially when the hyperparameter search is initiated from a (set of) random guess solution(s). Additionally, the complexity of the hyperparameter space (HS) increases with the number of geometrical input features, at least for anisotropic kernels, making the optimization of hyperparameters even more challenging. In this study, we propose a transfer learning (TL) protocol that accelerates the training process of anisotropic GPR models by facilitating access to promising regions of the HS. The protocol is based on a seeding-relaxation mechanism in which an excellent guess solution is identified by rapidly building one or several small source models over a subset of the target training set before readjusting the previous guess over the entire set. We demonstrate the performance of this protocol by building and assessing the performance of DL and TL models of atomic energies and charges in various conformations of benzene, ethanol, formic acid dimer and the drug fomepizole. Our experiments suggest that TL models can be built one order of magnitude faster while preserving the quality of their DL analogs. Most importantly, when deployed in FFLUX simulations, TL models compete or even outperform their DL analogs when it comes to performing FFLUX geometry optimization and computing harmonic vibrational modes.

However, the support may undergo significant chemical changes during synthesis that could influence the behavior of the synthesized material. This work proposes to use the coefficient alfa as an indicator of the changes that the support undergoes in a synthesis via impregnation.\nMethods: After developing a mathematical equation to obtain the value of the coefficient alfa experimentally, we calculated the value of the coefficient alfa in the synthesis of a composite material obtained by wet impregnation. In addition, we calculated the value of the coefficient alfa in a negative control group.  \nResults: The coefficient alfa calculated for the material obtained by wet impregnation indicates that the carbonaceous support experienced significant mass loss during synthesis (p < 0.0001). In the case of the negative control group, the coefficient alfa shows that significant mass loss (p < 0.0001) also occurs when the support is treated with the solvent (instead of the particulate precursor solution). The mass loss of the carbonaceous support is significantly higher (p < 0.0013) during the synthesis of the composite material than during the synthesis of the negative control group.\nConclusion: The coefficient alfa is an indicator that allows one to verify the mass changes that the carbonaceous support undergoes during the synthesis of particulate material supported on carbon. Since a mass change implies a chemical modification of the support, these chemical changes should be taken into account when explaining the behavior of composite materials.", "date": "2024-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This is a simple, fundamental, but unsolved question in chemistry. It is key for solving many important molecular optimization problems, for example in lead optimization in drug discovery under the similarity principle assumption. Generative models can sample virtual molecules from a vast theoretical chemical space, but so far have lacked explicit knowledge about molecular similarity. This means that a generative model needs to be guided by reinforcement learning or another learning mechanism to be able to sample a relevant similar chemical space. Correspondingly the generative model provide no mechanism for quantifying how completely it can sample a particular region of the chemical space. To overcome these limitations, a novel source-target molecular transformer model is proposed, regularized via a similarity kernel function. It has been trained on, to the best of our knowledge, the largest data set of molecular pairs so far consisting of \u2265 billion pairs. The regularization  term enforces a direct relationship between the probability of generating a target molecule and its similarity to a given source molecule. The model is able to systematically sample compounds ordered by their probability and accordingly by their similarity. In combination with a deterministic sampling strategy, beam search, it is possible for the first time to comprehensively explore the near-neighborhood around a specific compound. Our results show that the regularization term helps to substantially improve the correlation between the probability of generating a target molecule and its similarity to the source molecule.

By studying a set of 104 molecules, a close to perfect agreement between quantum chemical evaluations of iso-density surfaces for a cut-off density of 0.0016 a.u. and experimental results obtained via thermodynamic phase change data is demonstrated, with a mean unsigned percentage deviation of 1.6% and a correlation coefficient of 0.995. Accordingly, we suggest the iso-density surface contoured at an electron density value of 0.0016 a.u. as a representation of the surface of atoms and molecules.", "date": "2024-05-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Quantum Mechanics; Structure; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While this research has been insightful, there are stipulations on how applicable many of these results are to real world applications.

For example, biomolecules, such as proteins, rapidly coat nanoparticles with a shell, called a corona, that can modulate the toxicity of the core materials or aid the internalization into cells. This additional layer of complexity and the non-covalent nature of the corona has made it difficult to identify consistent trends in the study of nanotoxicity using traditional methods.

Training strategies and sampling approaches are efficiently assessed using empirical potentials and subsequently relabeled via DFT in a highly parallelized fashion for high-fidelity NNP training. Our results reveal that relying solely on energy and force for NNP training is inadequate to prevent overfitting, highlighting the necessity of incorporating stress terms into the loss functions.

Eleveld; Yannick Geiger; Juntian Wu; Armin Kiani; Ga\u00ebl Schaeffer; Sijbren Otto", "abstract": "The transition of chemistry into biology is poorly understood. One of the key questions in this transition is how the inherently divergent nature of chemical reactions can be curtailed, allowing product mixtures to become enriched in only a limited subset of all possible reaction products. Another seemingly unrelated question is whether Darwinian principles from biology extend to chemistry. Addressing both questions simultaneously, we now show that the evolutionary principle of competitive exclusion, which states that a single niche can only be stably occupied by one species, also applies to self-replicating chemical systems, and that this principle diminishes the tendency of chemistry to diversify. Specifically, we report two systems in which three different self-replicator quasi-species emerge in a largely stochastic fashion from a mixture of two building blocks (resources). To enable their evolution, these replicator mixtures were subjected to an out-of-equilibrium replication-destruction regime, implemented by serial transfer. Out of the many different products initially produced, competitive exclusion leads to the selection of only a single quasi-species when all replicators rely to the same extent on both resources. When, on the other hand, one of the quasi-species preferentially uses one resource and another quasi-species specializes in the other (resource partitioning), these replicator quasi-species effectively occupy different niches and were found to coexist in an evolutionary stable steady state. The ability to escape from competitive exclusion through resource partitioning is important for future efforts on addressing a major evolutionary challenge on the path to life\u2019s emergence: Eigen\u2019s paradox, which requires evolutionary stable communities of co-existing replicators with specific community dynamics.", "date": "2024-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here, we have provided a new approach for developing giant vesicles (GVs) through the molecular design and synthesis of amphiphiles having/not having amide linkages in the hydrophobic moiety. From the 1H NMR analysis and fluorescence spectrum of environmental-responsive probes, intermolecular hydrogen bonding between amide linkages in the membrane contributed to enhance structural stability of GVs. Moreover, by adding amphiphiles having photoresponsive azobenzene moiety to GVs composed of amphiphiles having/not having amide linkages, a different manner in photoresponsive deformation was observed: the former exhibited irreversible deformation, but the latter reversible manner due to photoisomerisation of azobenzene under ultraviolet and the subsequent visible light illumination.

A routinely used method for binding free energy calculations with MD is umbrella sampling (US), which calculates the potential of mean force (PMF) along a single reaction coordinate. Surprisingly, in spite of its wide-spread use, few validation studies have focused on the convergence of the free energy computed along a single path for specific cases, not addressing the reproducibility of such calculations in general.   In this work, we therefore investigate the reproducibility and convergence of US along a standard distance-based reaction coordinate for various protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes, following commonly used guidelines for the setup. We show that repeating the complete US workflow can lead to differences of 2-20~kcal/mol in computed binding free energies. We attribute those discrepancies to small differences in the binding pathways. While these differences are unavoidable in the established US protocol, the popularity of the latter could hint at a lack of awareness of such reproducibility problems. To test if the convergence of PMF profiles can be improved if multiple pathways are sampled simultaneously, we performed additional simulations with an adaptive-biasing method, here the accelerated weight histogram (AWH) approach. Indeed, the PMFs obtained from AHW simulations are consistent and reproducible for the systems tested. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to attempt a systematic assessment of the pitfalls in one the most widely used protocols for computing binding affinities. We anticipate therefore that our results will provide an incentive for a critical reassessment of the validity of PMFs computed with US, and make a strong case to further benchmark the performance of adaptive-biasing methods for computing binding affinities.", "date": "2024-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The developed process consumes electricity during the daytime\u2014when renewable electricity is available\u2014to desorb CO2 and charge the cell, and it can regenerate the absorbent for further CO2 absorption while releasing electricity to the grid during nighttime when solar power is unavailable. This research explores the process fundamentals and scalability potential, through an extensive study of the system's thermodynamics, transport phenomena, kinetics, and bench-scale operations. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized to study the thermodynamics of the process, mapping the redox profiles to identify ideal potential windows for operation. The CV results pinpointed a 0.3 V Nernstian overpotential as the thermodynamic minimum required for cell operation. Additionally, polarization studies were conducted to select the practical operating potential, identifying 0.5 V as optimal for the CO2 desorption cycle to provide sufficient polarity to overcome activation barriers in addition to the Nernstian potential. Mass transfer analysis balanced conductivity and desorption efficiency, with a 1:1 ratio identified as optimal for redox-active species and background electrolyte concentration. To further enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions, plasma treatment of electrode surfaces was implemented, resulting in a 43% decrease in charge transfer resistance, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis.

Our classical MD simulations reveal a correlation between increased protein\u2013heme contact and improved reactivity, confirming the importance of geometry, while ab initio MD simulations provide insight into the electronic environment, showing the electrostatic potential (ESP) at the metal center also correlates with reactivity. Quantum mechanical calculations of sulfoxidation and hydroxylation reactions demonstrate that the negative ESP at the metal center and active site electric field stabilize the highest-energy intermediate. Furthermore, using ML classifiers, we identify critical residues such as Lys12 and Asp18 in MC6*a that demonstrate charge-coupling patterns that explain differences in reactivity.

In the first step, a smart pyrolysis of polyolefin waste yields oils, containing long-chain olefins as the major components. Then, for the next transformation step, tailored BICAAC-Ru olefin metathesis catalysts were used in combination with an alkene isomerization catalyst (RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3) for the transformation of the pyrolysis oil to propylene via isomerization metathesis (ISOMET) reaction in ethylene atmosphere.

The detection of dissolved Cu species during electrolysis confirms the intermediates mediated Cu0(s) dissolution mechanism at ECR potential, namely -0.8 to -1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. A dynamic equilibrium between dissolution and subsequent redeposition leads to morphological restructuring. Additionally, our findings suggest that the electrodeposition of dissolved Cu species is biased towards less active sites due to their lower coverage by reaction intermediates such as adsorbed CO. The iterative cycles of the dissolution-redeposition mechanism at ECR potential lead to the growth of the less-active Cu surface at the cost of the more-active one.

Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash-type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow-type chemiexcitation rate, predominantly due to the higher number of photons produced within a given time interval. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non-strained six-member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron-withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four-member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro-fused six-member rings with inductive electron-withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro-dioxetane with a six-member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293-fold faster than that of spiro-adamantyl-dioxetane. A turn-ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme \u03b2-galactosidase, containing the six-member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth media.

Here, we quantified nutricline depths from a global database of observed vertical nitrate and phosphate profiles (1972 - 2022) to assess contemporary trends in global nutrient availability. We found strong evidence that the P-nutricline (phosphacline) is mostly deepening, especially throughout the southern hemisphere, but the N-nutricline (nitracline) remains mostly stable. Earth System Model simulations support the hypothesis that reduced iron stress and increased nitrogen fixation buffer the nitracline, but not phosphacline, against increasing stratification.

These 1:1 adducts either form a co-crystal with a hydrogen-bonded motif or a salt by transfer of proton from the acid to the base. As a rule of thumb if the difference in pKa between the protonated base and the acid (\u0394pKa) is \u2264 1, a co-crystal is expected while \u0394pKa > 3 leads to a salt. The preferred crystalline form for 1:1 adducts of pyridine, pyridazine, pyrazine and furan with formic acid are elucidated using genetic algorithm assisted first-principles crystal structure predictions (CSP). In agreement with the \u0394pKa rule, all the adducts stabilize as H-bonded co-crystals under ambient pressure. However, under isotropic pressure formic acid transfers the protons to the three nitrogenous bases forming salts of pyridinium formate, pyridazinium formate and pyrazinium formate. External pressure is found to dictate the co-crystal \u2013 salt equilibrium. The critical pressure (Pc) required to induce co-crystal \u2192 salt conversion for formic acid\u2026 pyridine/pyridazine/pyrazine is 3 GPa, 5 GPa and 15 GPa respectively.

This raises the question of how the acceleration of a chemical reaction can enable the energy released from that reaction to be transduced, and thereby work to be done, by a molecular catalyst. Here we demonstrate the molecular-level transduction of chemical energy to mechanical force in the form of the powered contraction and powered re-expansion of a crosslinked polymer gel driven by the directional rotation of embedded artificial catalysis-driven molecular motors. Continuous 360\u00b0 rotation of the rotor about the stator of motor-molecules incorporated within the polymeric framework of the gel, twists the polymer chains of the crosslinked network around one another (either clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on the chirality of the fuelling system). This progressively increases writhe and tightens entanglements, causing macroscopic contraction of the gel to ~70% of its original volume. The limit of contraction corresponds to the stall force of the motor; the point at which, despite catalysis continuing, the untwisting force exerted by the entwined strands balances conformation selection in the motor\u2019s catalytic cycle. Subsequent addition of the opposite enantiomeric fuelling system powers rotation of the motor-molecules of the contracted gel in the reverse direction, unwinding the entanglements and causing the gel to re-expand. Continued powered twisting of the strands in the new direction causes the gel to contract once again.

Nevertheless, the precise positioning of hydrogen-bonding units within the molecular structure of p-conjugated segments, can significantly shape the supramolecular architectures that dictate the pathways for charge carriers and ultimately, device efficiency. We elucidate this scenario by exploring diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) molecules featuring amide units strategically positioned at varying distances from the DPP core. Using a comprehensive combination of spectroscopy, structural and microscopy tools, we rationalize the charge transport properties through a contactless technique. Our results reveal that the proximity of the amide units to the DPP core governs the suppression or promotion of intermolecular hydrogen-bonding, resulting in materials exhibiting distinct crystalline or amorphous structures, along with divergent values of photoconductivity and charge carrier lifetimes. More importantly, the strategic positioning of hydrogen-bonding units represents the next step towards integrating hydrogen-bonded small molecules into practical optoelectronic devices", "date": "2024-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Aggregates and Assemblies; Dyes and Chromophores; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inhibition of microbial MIP proteins leads to reduced viability and proliferation in pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Burkholderia pseudomallei. The parasitic pathogen of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, also expresses a MIP protein, presumably involved in host cell invasion.

There is a controversy in the photochemical mechanisms that give rise to the fast and slow components in the photofragment translational kinetic energy distributions. Herein, we demonstrate that the transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TXAS) at the O K-edge is effective for tracking the ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics in photochemical processes, by multi-configurational simulations along different reaction pathways in the potential energy surfaces (PESs) along the O-H distance $R_\\text{OH}$. PESs were generated for the lowest 3 singlet valence states (S$_0$--S$_2$) and 30 O1s core-excited states (e$_1$--e$_{30}$), and TXAS spectra in three nonradiative reaction pathways were simulated  showing distinct spectral signatures. The direct dissociation into the H atom and the first excited-state ($~{A}$) of phenoxyl (PhO$\\cdot$) residue (path 1) associates with a strong peak observed at 527-528 eV and a weak peak at 540-541 eV which vanishes rapidly along the dissociation coordinate. In comparison, the channel of dissociation into the ground state of PhO$\\cdot$ (path 2) leads to a medium peak at 528-529 eV, and two weak peaks at 531-534 and 535-536 eV, respectively. Concerning the recrossing pathway (path 3), all peaks show obvious shifts when the photo-excited phenol decays along the S$_0$-state PES. The mechanisms underlying the photodissociation of phenol thus can be sensitively encoded in the O1s TXAS signals.  The early-stage dynamics of photo-excited phenol were also investigated to explore the reaction pathways in S$_1$ and direct internal conversion into the high internal energy S$_0$ state, followed by decay with the increase of $R_\\text{OH}$.

Films of this material remain optically opaque in the unswelled state of the embedded hydrogel, but, when placed inside water for prolonged period, water diffuses through the silicone phase and gets absorbed by gelatin. At this, gelatin swells with consequent change in transparency with time. We show that the size of dispersed microspheres and the extent of crosslinking of the PDMS, both affect the kinetics of this process. In fact, for some range of parameter values, the rate of change in transparency turns more pronounced than would have been expected for simple Fickian diffusion of water through the film.

Here, we report the patterns of reactivity and cross-reactivity displayed by a model system in which oxo-activating conditions have been tested that involve either i) electrochemical or chemical reduction, or ii) coordinating or non-coordinating solvents. In acetonitrile (CH3CN), a complex of the uranyl(V) monocation [UO2+] can be formed reliably through treatment of the U(V) species with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF), but it also results in a mixture of products arising in part due to direct electron transfer to BCF. In dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), attempts to chemically reduce and functionalize U(VI) revealed undesired cross-reactivity that precludes reduction of U(VI); Cp*2Co can undergo cross-reactions with both CH2Cl2 and BCF, evidently by electron transfer from Co(II) followed by further reactions. Despite the cross reactivity in CH2Cl2, one uranium-containing product could be crystallized, and was characterized by solid-state X-ray diffraction analysis. This complex features a trinuclear, formally [UV,UIV,UV] core, but contains only four of the total of six oxo equivalents that were expected on the basis of the U(VI) starting material, confirming that electrophilic reactivity can proceed in this system upon reduction. Along this line, computational studies have been used to establish the baseline electronic properties of the U(V) and U(IV) centers in the trinuclear product, as well as gain insight to structural changes induced by the reduction of this compound.

Here, we explore the use of a modular family of sulfur-functionalized metal bis(terpyridine) complexes ([M(tpy-R)2]2+(PF6\u2013)2) to prepare mixed SAMs, considering that the comparable structure, dimensions, and ionic composition of these species should render them interchangeable within the adsorbed surface layer. While surface voltammetry experiments show these SAMs do exhibit compositions representative of their assembly solutions, they also suggest, in line with previous reports, that adjacent complexes in the monolayer are separated by a gap of ~1 nm. Remarkably, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies reveal no F 1s peak features that would confirm the proliferation of PF6\u2212 counterions on the surface. We propose that the loose packed structure of these SAMs results from the loss or exchange of PF6\u2013 counterions which introduces significant repulsive Coulomb interactions between the adsorbed 2+ charged complexes. The hypothesis is supported by an electrostatic model which indicates these complexes should form close packed SAMs if mobile counterions are present. First-principles calculations demonstrate that complex-counterion binding interactions are weakened by charge transfer to the gold substrate, suggesting this may play an important role in the formation of such low coverage SAMs. Together, this study raises important questions regarding the assembly, organization, and composition of charged SAMs, and highlights new opportunities in the design of multicomponent monolayer assemblies with free volume, for example, to facilitate surface-based reactions or support molecular switches.", "date": "2024-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Self-Assembly; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Chiral-selective sum frequency generation spectroscopy (chiral SFG) is unique among vibrational spectroscopies because it can selectively probe water molecules that form chiral hydration structures around biomolecules. However, interpreting chiral SFG spectra is challenging since both water and the biomolecule can produce chiral SFG signals. Here, we combine experiment and computation to establish a theoretical framework for rigorous interpretation of chiral SFG spectra of DNA. We demonstrate that chiral SFG detects the N-H stretch of DNA base pairs and the O-H stretch of water, exclusively probing water molecules in the DNA first hydration shell. Our analysis reveals that DNA transfers chirality to water molecules only within the first hydration shell, so they can be probed by chiral SFG spectroscopy. Beyond the first hydration shell, electric field-induced water structure is symmetric and therefore precludes chiral SFG response.

To date, deterministic positioning of single-photon sources in large-scale photonic structures remains a challenge. In this context, colloidal quantum dots (QDs), particularly core/shell configurations, are attractive due to their solution processability. However, traditional QDs are typically small, about 3 to 6 nm, which restricts their deterministic placement and utility in large-scale photonic devices. The largest existing core/shell QDs are the family of giant CdSe/CdS QDs, with total diameters ranging from about 20 to 50 nm. Pushing beyond this size limit, we introduce a synthesis strategy for colossal CdSe/CdS QDs, with sizes ranging from 30 to 100 nm, using a stepwise high-temperature continuous injection method. Electron microscopy reveals a consistent hexagonal diamond morphology composed of twelve semipolar {101 \u03051} facets and one polar (0001) facet. We also identify conditions where shell growth is disrupted, leading to defects, islands, and mechanical instability, which suggest synthetic requirements for growing crystalline particles beyond 100 nm. The stepwise growth of thick CdS shells on CdSe cores enables the synthesis of emissive QDs with long photoluminescence lifetimes of a few microseconds and suppressed blinking at room temperature. Notably, QDs with 100 CdS monolayers exhibit high single-photon emission purity with second-order photon correlation g(2)(0) values below 0.2. Our findings indicate that colossal core/shell QDs can efficiently emit single photons, which paves the way for quantum photonic applications that require deterministic placement of single-photon sources.", "date": "2024-05-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, core-to-valence excitation energies are significantly underestimated when standard exchange-correlation functionals are used, which is partly traceable to systemic issues with TD-DFT's description of Rydberg and charge-transfer excited states.  To mitigate this, we have implemented an empirically modified combination of configuration interaction with single substitutions (CIS) based on Kohn-Sham orbitals, which is known as \"DFT/CIS\".   This semi-empirical approach is  well-suited for simulating x-ray near-edge spectra,  as it contains sufficient exact exchange to model charge-transfer excitations yet retains DFT's low-cost description of dynamical electron correlation.  Empirical corrections to the matrix elements enable semi-quantitative simulation of  near-edge x-ray spectra without the need for significant a posteriori shifts; this should be useful in complex molecules and materials with multiple overlapping x-ray edges.  Parameter optimization for use with a specific range-separated hybrid functional  makes this a black-box method intended for both core and valence spectroscopy.

Many important reacting systems (atmosphere, combustion, pyrolysis, partial oxidations) involve a large number of reactions occurring simultaneously, and reaction intermediates that have never been observed, making this goal even more challenging. Improvements in our ability to compute rate coefficients and other important parameters accurately from first principles, and improvements in automated kinetic modeling software, have partially overcome many challenges. Indeed, in some cases quite complicated kinetic models have been constructed which accurately predicted the results of independent experiments. However, the process of constructing the models, and deciding which reactions to measure or compute ab initio, relies on accurate estimates (and indeed most of the numerical rate parameters in most large kinetic models are estimates.) Machine-learned models trained on large datasets can improve the accuracy of these estimates, and allow a better integration of quantum chemistry and experimental data. The need for continued development of shared (perhaps open-source) software and databases, and some directions for improvement, are highlighted.

However, optimizing phototherapy agents, refining treatment conditions, and addressing misuse of agents, remain a formidable challenge. This study introduces a novel concept leveraging the unique customizability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to house size-matched dye molecules in \u201csingle rooms\u201d. The mesoporous iron(III) carboxylate nanoMOF, MIL-100(Fe), and the hydrophobic heptamethine cyanine photothermal dye (Cy7), IR775, are selected as model systems. Their combination is predicted to minimize dye-dye interactions, leading to exceptional photostability and efficient light-to-heat conversion. Furthermore, MIL-100(Fe) preserves the antimicrobial nature of hydrophobic IR775, enabling it to disrupt bacterial cell envelopes. Through electrospinning, MIL-100(Fe)@IR775 nanoparticles are shaped into a gelatin-based film dressing for the treatment of skin wounds infected by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Activation of the dressing requires only a portable near-infrared light-emitting diode (NIR LED) and induces both low-dose photodynamic therapy (LPDT) and mild-temperature photothermal therapy (MPTT). Combined with the antimicrobial properties of IR775 and ferroptosis-like lipid peroxidation induced by MIL-100(Fe), the photoactive dressing eradicates MRSA and the healing is as quick as the uninfected wounds. This safe, cost-effective, and multifunctional therapeutic wound dressing offers a promising solution to overcome the current bottleneck in phototherapy.", "date": "2024-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Microbiology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the interaction between the electron beam and standard aromatic or aliphatic thiolate SAMs on gold has been well studied, the behavior of more complex systems such as N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which are recently attracting growing attention due to their ultra-high chemical and thermal stability, remains completely unknown. In the current work, we analyze the low-energy electron irradiation of SAMs on gold based on the series of NHC molecules featuring different number of benzene moieties (0, 1 and 2), and different size of the nitrogen side groups (methyl, isopropyl) to modify their packing density. The changes in monolayer thickness and composition are carefully analyzed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a function of electron dose. Our results provide design rules to optimize NHC SAMs structure for their effective modification by the electron irradiation. Such optimization becomes particularly interesting considering that the analyzed NHC monolayers exhibit a much higher stability of their bonding with the metal substrate towards electron irradiation compared to standard thiols or recently applied carboxylic acids. Thus, the NHC SAMs offer an interesting alternative for chemical lithography where structural modification of SAMs by electron or photon beams should be limited mainly to the functional group. Moreover, delamination and transferring of electron irradiated NHC monolayers on holey TEM grid reveals formation of carbon nanomembranes (CNMs). As we show this process is also very sensitive to the structure of NHC SAMs and for properly designed system enables formation of continuous, freestanding CNMs, which are sulfur free and thus much more suitable for some ultrafiltration applications compared to standard CNMs fabricated from thiols and therefore contaminated with reactive sulfur.", "date": "2024-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This vision was partially achieved with the pioneering suggestion of J. D. van der Waals of modeling the gas and liquid states with a continuous polynomial. van der Waals' work spawned a century of development of equations of state (EoSs) for fluid phases and fluid phase equilibria. However, the extension to  include the solid phase has largely been ignored, presumably out of the inherent difficulties in expressing the corresponding thermodynamic surface analytically. In this contribution, we resolve this century-old problem by presenting a procedure where an equation of state based on artificial neural networks is built based on an extensive database of accurate molecular dynamics data.  The use of this EoS is exemplified here for the Mie particle, providing a single thermodynamically consistent model that continuously represents the fluid (gas, liquid and supercritical) and crystalline states. Apart from accurately predicting the derivative properties, the equation exhibits metastable regions characterized by van der Waals loops that correctly quantify the existence of vapor-liquid, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor equilibria along with the position of the critical and triple points. This new paradigm in EoS development is a pathway for the rapid deployment of models for complex matter and its interpretation opens doors to studying the transition regions between different aggregation states.

To address this question, we achieved a de novo synthesis of bulged CDR-H3 mimics excised from their full antibody context.

A major challenge of such models is their limited accuracy in predicting molecules with targeted properties in the data scarce regime, which is the regime typical of the prized outliers that inverse models are hoped to discover. For example, activity data for a drug target or stability data for a material may only number in the tens to hundreds of samples, which is insufficient to learn an accurate and reasonably general property-to-structure inverse mapping from scratch. We\u2019ve hypothesized that the property to structure mapping becomes unique when a sufficient number of properties are supplied to the models during training. This hypothesis has several important corollaries if true. It would imply that data scarce properties can be completely determined by a set of more accessible molecular properties. It would also imply that a generative model trained on multiple properties would exhibit an accuracy phase transition after achieving a sufficient size\u2014a process analogous to what has been observed in the context of large language models. To interrogate these behaviors, we have built the first transformers trained on the property to molecular graph task, which we dub \u201clarge property models\u201d (LPMs).

Experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal that the LUMO symmetries of the substrates control the oxidative addition mechanism.

This demonstration was achieved for metal-loaded Ga2O3 photocatalysts under steam methane reforming conditions. Although it has long been conventionally believed that loaded metal cocatalysts function as sinks for reactive photogenerated electrons and active sites for reduction reactions, we found that the free electrons in the metal cocatalysts were not directly involved in the reduction reaction. Alternatively, the electrons shallowly trapped in the in-gap states of Ga2O3 contributed to enhancing the hydrogen evolution rate upon the loading of metal cocatalysts.

Typically, top-down mass spectrometry has been performed starting from highly charged precursor ions obtained via electrospray ionization under denaturing conditions (i.e., in the presence of organic solvents and acidic pH). Here we systematically benchmark four distinct ion dissociation methods \u2013 namely higher-energy collisional dissociation, electron transfer dissociation, electron transfer dissociation/higher-energy collisional dissociation, and 213 nm ultraviolet photodissociation \u2013 in their capability to characterize a therapeutic monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, starting from denatured and native-like precursor ions. Interestingly, native top-down mass spectrometry results in higher sequence coverage than the experiments carried out under denaturing conditions, with the exception of ultraviolet photodissociation. Globally, electron transfer dissociation followed by collision-based activation of product ions generates the largest number of backbone cleavages in disulfide protected regions, including the complementarity determining regions, regardless of electrospray ionization conditions. Overall, these findings suggest that native mass spectrometry can certainly be used for the gas-phase sequencing of whole monoclonal antibodies, although the dissociation of denatured precursor ions still returns a few backbone cleavages not identified in native experiments. Finally, a comparison of the fragmentation maps obtained under denaturing and native conditions strongly points towards disulfide bonds as the primary reason behind the largely overlapping dissociation patterns.", "date": "2024-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We revealed the photophysical properties that (1) the intersystem crossing occurs with a time constant of ~20 ps, which is more than 50 times faster than that of zinc (II) porphyrin, and (2) the charge density in the excited singlet and triplet states is mainly localized on ZnP, which means the excited state is assignable to the \u03c0 -\u03c0* transition in ZnP. The one electron reduction using the reductant, 1,3-dimethyl-2-,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), occurs via the triplet excited state with time constant of ~170 ns and directly from the ground state by the deprotonated BIH with the time constant of ~3 \u03bcs. The charge in the one electron reduction species spans ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand and the dihedral angle between ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand is rotated by ~24\u00b0 with respect to that in the ground state, which presumably offers an advantage for proceeding to the next CO2 reduction reaction step.

Here, we leverage the atomically precise nature of zirconium and hafnium oxo clusters to gain fundamental insight into the thermodynamics of ligand binding. Through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental spectroscopic techniques, we determine the multifaceted interaction between the [M6O8]8+ (M = Zr, Hf) cluster surface and various ligands: carboxylates, phosphonates, dialkylphosphinates, and monosubstituted phosphinates. We refute the common assumption that the adsorption energy of an adsorbate remains unaffected by the surrounding adsorbates. We find that dialkylphosphinic acids are too sterically hindered to yield complete ligand exchange, even though a single dialkylphosphinate has similar binding affinity to a phosphonate. On the other hand, monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphinic acids replace carboxylates quantitatively and we obtained the crystal structure of M6O8H4(O2P(H)Ph)12  (M = Zr, Hf), giving a unique insight into the exact binding mode of monoalkylphosphinate. Finally, phosphonic acids cause a partial structural reorganization of the metal oxo cluster into amorphous metal phosphonate as indicated by pair distribution function analysis. These results rationalize the absence of phosphonate-capped M6O8 clusters and the challenge in preparing Zr phosphonate metal-organic frameworks.

Our atomic scale understanding of this class of reactions has been significantly improved by developments in density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The ultimate goal of such simulations is to intelligently predict rates of CPET reactions at the electrified double layer, leading to the design of new catalysts. These studies often utilize harmonic transition state theory (HTST), which assumes that quantum tunneling through energy barriers is negligible. In this study, we present a simple evaluation of the contribution of quantum tunneling in the adiabatic limit of CPET reactions. We investigate the effect of different potential profiles on tunneling probabilities and compare these profiles with calculated CPET minimum energy paths (MEPs). We find that the calculated CPET MEPs can be significantly stiffer than the commonly used Eckart profile, and study the effect of changing barrier height and width on overall zero curvature tunneling correction factors. Depending on the reaction of interest and the bulk pH, proton tunneling can be a non-negligible phenomenon for CPET reactions at the electrified double layer. In particular, reactions involving large barriers are predicted to have significant contributions from non-classical tunneling, possibly explaining observed kinetic isotope effects for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Our model choices are significantly simplified -- for example, neglecting the effects of reaction coordinate curvature and vibronic coupling -- suggesting that our predicted tunneling contributions may be underestimated.

Here we show that S31N M2 persists in a dimer-of-dimers structurein different lipid preparations independent of the amount of solvating lipids up to at least 180 lipids per tetramer. Two isoleucine residues with upfield shifted alpha carbon resonances, which are typically associated with extended conformations, are shown to be compatible with a particular side-chain rotameric state and helical backbone geometry. These chemical shifts are therefore compatible with the expected native transmembrane helical fold. Symmetry breaking at the pH sensing H37 residues, detected via peak doubling, is a stable feature of S31N M2 based on the reference strain Udorn/1972(H3N2). By contrast, the spectrum is dramatically altered for Columbia/2014/(H3N2) M2, which differs in sequence in the amphipathic helices.

In the present work, dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are employed to study the interaction of 5-FU with faujasite-type zeolites having different Si/Al ratios. Comparing distinct local arrangements of Al atoms and charge-balancing protons, it is evaluated to what extent \u201cmulti-site\u201d interactions, i.e., interactions of 5-FU with more than one proton, affect the adsorption energy. While the most pronounced increase in interaction strength occurs when moving from an all-silica zeolite to a protonic zeolite having a single proton in one twelve-membered ring, a significant additional stabilisation arises if a second framework proton is present in the same ring. Typically, several hydrogen bonds are formed between 5-FU and protonic zeolite frameworks, with 5-FU simultaneously acting as donor and acceptor. AIMD simulations confirm the stability of these hydrogen bonds at room temperature in the absence of water. Additionally, infrared spectra are predicted for selected low-energy configurations in order to facilitate an experimental identification of different bonding environments. AIMD simulations probing the competitive adsorption of 5-FU and water show that the high affinity of water to the framework protons causes a breaking of hydrogen bonds, framework deprotonation, and a displacement of 5-FU from its initial position.

Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule-stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high-precision reagent: i.e., a low potency and biochemically stable non-illuminated state; then efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; and good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule-stabilizing reagent, that combines these needs. Its potency increases ~100-fold upon violet/blue irradiation to reach low-nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high-performance tool compound that can support high-precision research into many microtubule-associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.", "date": "2024-05-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Natural Products; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In the presence of excess formate as the stoichiometric reductant, a complex polyheterocyclic hybrid of a 2,5-methanobenzo[b]azepine and a tetrahydroisoquinoline is formed in a net-reductive manner, whereas in the presence of a trialkylamine instead of formate, sequential dimerization and skeletal rearrangement occurs to afford 4-(3-indolylmethyl)quinolines in a redox-neutral manner.

First, we demonstrate that at the molecular level, no prebiotic synthesis or hydrolysis path- way would have enabled the selection of natural phosphatidic acids. Second, we report that at the supramolecular level, natural phospholipids display a greater tendency to self-assemble in more packed and rigid membranes than non-natural analogues of the same chain length.

In these clusters, the protons bind to the polyhedral clusters, acquiring hydride character and providing chemically non-rigidity that manifests through metal vertex-to-thiaborane pseudo-rotations and concomitant proton tautomerisms.

The scaling relation between *OH and *OOH is one of the most studied and best understood.

The situation can be different for reactions at multi-atom surface sites. In the reaction between O* and *CO to form CO2, the species interact with more surface atoms at the initial state compared to the transition state, so for a given reaction energy, HEAs allow for lower activation energies than pure metals.

To overcome these challenges, we present a novel and highly selective protocol for the ortho-arylation of N-aryl amides and ureas.

This is also crucial when working with biopolymers in the context of engineered biomaterials in view of medical applications. Here, we show how oriented linear dichroism (OLD) spectroscopy, coupled with other techniques, is used to probe the ordering of chiral collagen molecules in the dense state. Collagen triple helices were aligned by solvent evaporation, relying on the high aspect ratio of the triple helices (ca. 300 nm in length, 1.5 nm in diameter). The high-order packing of the helical structure in the dense state gives rise to a strong LD signal that changes sign and intensity with varying sample orientations with respect to the linear polarized beam. LD, which allows to identify orientation of samples, is complementary to circular dichroism (CD), which is routinely used to probe the structure of chiral (bio)molecules. LD allows to shift from the molecular to the supramolecular scale, and from the investigation of the conformation to interactions. In this work, supported by two-photon microscopy and X-ray scattering, we show that LD spectroscopy provides a straightforward route to probe the alignment of collagen triple-helices packed in the dense state, determine the packing density, and monitor the denaturation process. This approach could be readily adapted to any biological chiral molecule and assembly, as well as synthetic polymers, with a key advantage being its ability to detect large-scale assemblies with high specificity to both aligned and chiral molecules, and improved sensitivity compared to more conventional techniques.", "date": "2024-05-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Physical and Chemical Properties; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Accurately modeling complex reactions is crucial for understanding the chemical processes involved in, for example, organocatalysis, autocatalytic cycles, and one-pot molecular assembly. Our prior research demonstrated that discretizing PESs using heuristics based on bond breaking and bond formation produces a reaction network representation with a low-dimensional structure (metric space). We now find that these reaction networks possess additional, though approximate, structure and resemble low-dimensional regular lattices with a small amount of random edge rewiring. The heuristics-based discretization thus generates a nonlinear dimensionality reduction by a factor of ten with an a posteriori error measure (probability of random rewiring). The structure becomes evident through a comparative analysis of CHNO reaction networks of varying stoichiometries against a panel of size-matched generative network models, taking into account their local, metric, and global properties. The generative models include random networks (Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and bipartite random networks), regular lattices (periodic and non-periodic), and network models with a tunable level of \"randomness\" (Watts-Strogatz graphs and regular lattices with random rewiring). The CHNO networks are simultaneously closely matched in all these properties by 3-4-dimensional regular lattices with 10% or less of edges randomly rewired. The effective dimensionality reduction is found to be independent of the system size, stoichiometry, and rule set, suggesting that search and sampling algorithms for PESs of complex chemical reactions can be effectively leveraged.", "date": "2024-05-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

RA\u2013TFSIs are designed to allow spontaneous perovskite passivation via the HTM deposition process; leveraging the high reactivity of RA cations toward the perovskite surface, these additives spontaneously and effectively suppress the defects over the perovskite surface and thereby enhance photovoltaic (PV) performance. Moreover, this perovskite passivation negates the need for conventional post-passivation processes, thereby improving the fabrication efficiency of PSCs. Although the advantages of these PSC fabrication processes have been less discussed than methods aimed at enhancing PV performance, they are crucial for further advancement of PSCs, especially in the context of spontaneous heterointerface modulation techniques. A key aspect is the concentration sensitivity of RA\u2013TFSI; excessive OA\u2013TFSI in the HTM solution leads to some OA cations failing to attach to the perovskite surface during spontaneous passivation, remaining in the HTM core and hindering carrier collection. To address this issue, we herein developed RA\u2013TFSIs and synthesized ethylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EA\u2013TFSI) for the first time. EA\u2013TFSI not only enhanced the PV properties of PSCs but also significantly mitigated the concentration sensitivity owing to its small cation size, reducing the risk of poor carrier collection. In the case of OA\u2013TFSI, increasing its concentration to twice the optimal amount decreased power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 14%, accompanied by drops in fill factor (FF). However, upon EA\u2013TFSI addition, PCE decreased by only 4%, with FF values remaining unchanged (i.e., nearly 100% retention). This research offers insights into designing nascent yet potent spontaneous heterointerface modulators for PSCs, including RA\u2013TFSI, to facilitate a broad process window, which is critical yet rarely discussed aspect.

Here, we investigate two-dimensional porous sheets that exfoliate into isolated monolayers, but aggregate upon oxidation, giving rise to tunable interlayer charge transfer absorption and Stokes-shifted photoluminescence. This optical behavior resembles interlayer excitons, now intensely studied due to their long-lived emission, but which remain difficult to tune through synthetic chemistry. Instead, the interlayer excitons of these framework sheets can be modulated through control of solvent, electrolyte, oxidation state, and the composition of the framework building blocks. In comparison to other two-dimensional materials, these framework sheets display the largest known interlayer binding strengths, attributable to interactions between specific components within the sheets.

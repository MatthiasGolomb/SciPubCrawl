This failure occurs because the reduction of O2 is thermodynamically favored over the reduction of CO2. Consequently, O2 must be removed from the CO2 feed prior to entering an electrolyzer, which is an expensive process. Here, we show the use of liquid bicarbonate feedstocks (e.g., aqueous 3.0 M KHCO3), rather than gaseous CO2 feedstocks, enables efficient and selective CO2 reduction without additional procedures for removing O2. This advance is made possible because liquid bicarbonate solutions deliver high concentrations of captured CO2 to the cathode, while the low solubility of O2 in aqueous media maintains a low O2 concentration at the same cathode surface. Consequently, electrolyzers fed with liquid bicarbonate feedstocks create an environment at the cathode that favors the reduction of CO2 over O2. We validate this claim by electrochemically converting CO2 into CO with reaction selectivities of ~65% at 100 mA cm-2 using 3.0 M KHCO3 solution bubbled with 100% CO2 or 100% O2. Similar experiments performed with a gaseous CO2 feedstock showed that merely 1% of O2 in the feedstock reduced CO selectivity to 11 \u00b1 3.7%. Our findings demonstrate that a liquid bicarbonate feedstock enables efficient CO2 reduction without the need for expensive O2 removal steps.", "date": "2023-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we report stable and easy-to-synthesize sulfone-functionalized molecular single crystals (FSOCA) as efficient hydrophilic photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. Its structure was determined by 3D electron diffraction technique with atomic resolution. The introduction of the sulfone groups favors the decrease of exciton binding energy, resulting in better exciton separation ability. FSOCA is highly hydrophilic in nature enabling it to efficiently drive sacrificial hydrogen evolution (760 \u00b5mol h\u22121; 76 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121). Interestingly, FSOCA remains stable in photocatalytic process for at least 400 hours showing negligible structure change, has and can cumulatively produce 179.2 mmol (about 4 L) of hydrogen. Employing transient spectroscopy, we find that the highly coplanar structure greatly enhances the transport of charge carriers to hole scavengers. In-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculation shows that hydrogen bonding between sacrificial agent (ascorbic acid) with sulfone group is energetically favorable for the adsorption of ascorbic acid on FSOCA, thereby significantly improving the oxidation reaction kinetics and the photocatalytic performance.

Our analysis reveals that the primary decay pathway for photo-excited bis-phosphanyl-bridged stil- bene is the intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state and nonradiative.

These materials can be synthesised via self-assembly of organic or metal-organic building blocks. Their bottom-up synthesis and the diversity in building block chemistry allows for fine-tuning of their shape and properties toward a target property. However, it is not straightforward to predict the outcome of self-assembly, and, thus, the structures that are practically accessible during synthesis. Indeed, such a prediction becomes more difficult as problems related to the flexibility of the building blocks or increased combinatorics lead to a higher level of complexity and increased computational costs. Molecular models, and their coarse-graining into simplified representations, may be very useful to this end. Here, we develop a minimalistic toy model of cage-like molecules to explore the stable space of different cage topologies based on a few fundamental geometric building block parameters. Our results capture, despite the simplifications of the model, known geometrical design rules in synthetic cage molecules and uncover the role of building block coordination number and preorganisation on the stability of cage topologies.

Here, we address this deficit by carrying out the first interlaboratory study of the analysis of supercapacitor electrochemistry data. We find that the use of incorrect formulae and researchers having different interpretations of key terminologies are the primary causes of variability in data reporting.

Streaming data-driven process control systems can be valuable in lowering the cost of production or discovering novel reaction pathways. Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) is an inexpensive spectroscopy technique that has characteristics that make it appropriate for on-line, high-throughput measurement of metabolic changes in a bioreactor vessel. Future quantitative NMR (qNMR) advancements for processing this type of streaming data could grant a unique possibility for in-situ bioprocessing applications. One significant challenge for 1D 1H qNMR is that the spectrum of a compound can deviate from its spectrum in a reference setting, especially across the various spectrometer frequency and concentration profile of metabolite mixture in the biofluid sample. A robust predictive or constraint model on the generative mechanism of the measured NMR signal can help guide future qNMR developments. We present an approximated 1D 1H NMR signal model that shows promise in fitting chemical shifts and other interpretable parameters for small mixtures of compounds. Our model use reference chemistry parameters of compounds to derive patterns between its nuclei via spin Hamiltonian simulations and hierarchical convex clustering on a spin angular momentum feature between the nuclei, which are quantum subsystems. These patterns are used to construct a surrogate model of the compound mixture with a lower degrees-of-freedom. Our approach does not require any phase or baseline correction techniques to pre-process the data, making it a generative model that fully accounts for the relative phase information, which is usually attenuated in a heuristic manner and ignored in conventional NMR data processing.

Due to the dynamic and structurally complex properties of RNA, both experimental and traditional computational methods have difficulty in determining RNA\u2019s 3D structure. Herein, we introduce TAPERSS (Theoretical Analyses, Prediction, and Evaluation of RNA Structures from Sequence), a physics-based fragment assembly method for predicting 3D RNA structures from sequence. Using a fragment library created using discrete path sampling calculations of RNA dinucleoside monophosphates, TAPERSS can sample the physics-based energy landscapes of any RNA sequence with relatively low computational complexity. We have benchmarked TAPERSS on 21 RNA tetraloops, using a combinatorial algorithm as a proof-of-concept. We show that TAPERSS was successfully able to predict the apo-state structures of all 21 RNA hairpins, with 16 of those structures also having low predicted energies as well. We demonstrate that TAPERSS performs most accurately on GNRA-like tetraloops with mostly stacked loop-nucleotides, while having limited success with more dynamic UNCG and CUYG tetraloops, most likely due to the influence of the RNA force field used to create the fragment library. Moreover, we show that TAPERSS can successfully predict the majority of the experimental non-apo states, highlighting its potential in anticipating biologically significant yet unobserved states. This holds great promise for future applications in drug design and related studies. With discussed improvements and implementation of more efficient sampling algorithms, we believe TAPERSS may serve as a useful tool for a physics-based conformational sampling of large RNA structures.", "date": "2023-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our strategy involves adding nucleotide sequences to adjacent staple strands so that, upon origami assembly, the add-on sequences form short hairpin duplexes targetable by psoralen-labelled triplex-forming oligonucleotides (pso-TFOs) bearing other functionality. Subsequent irradiation with UVA light generates psoralen adducts with one or both hairpin staples leading to site-specific attachment of the pso-TFO to the origami with >80% efficiency.

However, the physical modification of zeolites with reducing agents subject to static magnets and biological trappers is yet to be explored. In this laboratory-based work, we partly gel-coated raw ZSM-5 pellets with zinc coarse powder and tested their performance in copper extraction from a polluted medium with copper sulfate. We also examined the performance subject to the presence of a neodymium magnet, with and without faba bean, Vicia faba, as a copper bio-trap. Additionally, on a limited scale, we plasma-sputtered ZSM-5 pellets with zinc and tested their copper extraction under the magnet effect. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP) revealed that the reinforced zeolite led to the fastest copper extraction, outperforming the raw zeolite and the bio-trap, especially as time advanced. Accompanying the reinforced zeolite with the bio-trap was the most effective over time, followed by having both the magnet and the bio-trap to accompany the reinforced zeolite. However, interestingly, having the magnet as a sole companion of the reinforced zeolite was always better than using raw zeolite, but slightly of a lesser yield than having the reinforced companionless. The bio-trap was a better companion than the magnet, but after 20min having both companions was more beneficial than having the magnet alone and less yielding than having the bio-trap solo in the long term, indicating a synergistic effect between the reinforced zeolite and the bio-trap. Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX), and X-ray diffraction analyses, provided supportive information that underscored the stability yet the differential performance of ZSM-5. Although the extraction efficacy deteriorated sharply over time, the zinc-sputtered zeolite showed promising early results, exceeding those of the raw and the reinforced zeolites when the magnet was absent and almost identical to the outcome when the magnet accompanied the reinforced zeolite. Our amalgamative approach provides user-friendly novel methods of notable copper extraction, with high applicability potential for the extraction of other heavy metals from aquatic media.   \n\n", "date": "2023-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Water Purification", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Our analysis reveals that the B\u00fcrgi-Dunitz angle emerges from a delicate balance between two key factors: strain energy and interaction energy. High strain energy, as a result of the carbonyl compound distorting to avoid Pauli repulsion, is encountered at high angles, thus setting the upper bound.

New design concepts are indispensable to improving the performance of SPEs. Using molecular dynamics simulation,  we examine SPEs under nanoscale confinement, which has been demonstrated to accelerate the diffusion of neutral molecules such as water. While ion diffusion indeed shows an acceleration by more than two orders when the channel diameter decreases from 15~nm to 2~nm, the ionic conductivity does not show a paralleling increase. Instead, as the nanochannel diameter decreases,  ionic conductivity shows a non-monotonic variation, with an optimal value above yet on the same order as its bulk counterparts. The reason for this trend is due to enhanced ion association with decreasing channel size, which leaves a smaller amount of effective charge carriers. This effect competes with accelerated ion diffusion, leading to  the non-monotonicity in ion conductivity. We further show that this trend also appears in two-dimensional nanoslit pores.

The composition of the protein corona is governed by nanoparticle properties, incubation media and parameters related to the environment in which nanoparticle incubations are performed. In this study, we investigated the formation of protein corona on polystyrene nanoparticles which have different surface chemistries and the impact of experimental incubation parameters, including centrifugation-resuspension protocols, incubation duration and shear flow rate conditions. The particle characteristics measured include size distribution, zeta potential and total protein content. \nOur findings show significant differences in nanoparticle size following exposure to media containing proteins across the three different nanoparticle surface chemistries. These findings were also confirmed by total protein concentration measurements performed on nanoparticles recovered from bulk media, and measurements of the composition of surface-adsorbed proteins by gel electrophoresis. We also found that exposure to different shear flow conditions alters both the thickness and the composition of surface-adsorbed protein coronas. In parallel to analysis of nanoparticles isolated using the centrifugation-resuspension protocol, we performed in situ analysis of nanoparticle size in media containing proteins. Results obtained from these measurements highlight that the recovery procedure is disruptive to the protein corona and therefore the need for investigative methods that do not alter the properties of the nanoparticle coronas. \nNanomedicines are generally intended for administration via injection, and our findings show that parameters such as shear flow and media composition can significantly alter nanoparticle physicochemical parameters.

By virtue of its balanced treatment of static and dynamic correlation, the calculations have provided some of the most authoritative information available to date on low- versus high-spin states of different classes of heme-nitrosyl complexes. Thus, the calculations indicate low doublet-quartet gaps of 1\u20134 kcal/mol for {FeNO}7 complexes, and high singlet-triplet gaps of \u227320 kcal/mol for both {FeNO}6 and {FeNO}8 complexes. In contrast, DFT calculations yield widely divergent spin state gaps as a function of the exchange-correlation functional. DMRG-CASSCF calculations also help calibrate DFT spin densities for {FeNO}7 complexes, pointing to those obtained from classic pure functionals as the most accurate. The general picture appears to be that nearly all the spin density of Fe[P](NO) is localized on the Fe, while the axial ligand imidazole (ImH) in Fe[P](NO)(ImH) pushes a part of the spin density onto the NO moiety. An analysis of the DMRG-CASSCF wave function in terms of localized orbitals and of the resulting CSFs into resonance forms with varying NO(\uf070*) occupancies has allowed us to address the long-standing question of local oxidation states in heme-nitrosyl complexes. The analysis indicates NO(neutral) resonance forms [i.e., Fe(II)-NO0 and Fe(III)-NO0] as the major contributors to both {FeNO}6 and {FeNO}7 complexes. This finding is at variance with the common formulation of {FeNO}6 hemes as Fe(II)-NO+ species, but is consonant with an Fe L-edge XAS analysis by Solomon and coworkers.

So, hydrazine is largely used as a liquid propellant in the launch vehicles technologies, which is known to decompose over a shell 405 commercial catalyst to make done the space mission successful. Catalytic hydrazine decomposition over catalysts happens in two ways, indirect pathway which goes via (NH3/N2) intermediate to yield (H2/N2), and direct pathway to (N2/H2). This reaction products might be influenced by catalysts selectivity and reaction conditions such as temperature in the reactor room. Especially, in the satellite motor thruster, it is well known nowadays that metallic supported irridium catalyst plays a fantastic job to make this fuel decomposition, as the shell 405 case. Analysis shows that monometallic (Ir/Al2O3) and bimetallic (Ir-Ru/Al2O3) catalysts behave similarly as to shell 405 catalyst for hydrazine decomposition reaction (HzDR) in the satellite thruster. Also, forms of Ir composite catalysts have shown as powerful candidate for this special catalytic reaction.

Deciphering the relationship between the promoter in Ni-based catalysts and the corresponding catalytic performance in CO2 methanation mechanism is of great meaning for the development of highly active catalysts. Herein, a series of model bimetallic catalysts were prepared by sol-gel chemistry to address this fundamental challenge. Compared to Ni/SiO2 catalyst, the Mn-doped and Co-doped catalysts showed a higher methanation activity, with the former showing better performance below 250 \u00b0C and the latter showing better performance over 300 \u00b0C. On the contrary, the Cu-promoted catalyst showed a lower CO2 conversion with a lower CH4 selectivity in the whole temperature range. A comprehensive characterization study (TEM, XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, in situ DRIFTS, and TPSR analyses) suggests that the effect of promoters is not directly related to improvement of dispersion, reducibility, or basicity.

Besides interaction with primary therapeutic targets, JAK inhibitor drugs frequently interact with unintended, often unknown, biological off-targets, leading to associated effects. Nevertheless, the relevance of JAK inhibitors off-target interactions in the context of AD remains unclear. Methods: Putative off-targets of baricitinib and tofacitinib were predicted using a machine learning (ML) approach. After screening scientific literature, off-targets were filtered based on their relevance to AD. Targets that had not been previously identified as off-targets of baricitinib or tofacitinib were subsequently tested using biochemical or cell-based assays. From those, active concentrations were compared to bioavailable concentrations in the brain predicted by physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. Results: With the aid of ML and in vitro activity assays, we identified two enzymes previously unknown to be inhibited by baricitinib, namely casein kinase 2 subunit alpha 2 (CK2-alpha-2) and dual leucine zipper kinase (MAP3K12), both with Kd values of 5.8 uM. Predicted maximum concentrations of baricitinib in brain tissue using PBPK modelling range from 1.3 to 23 nM, which is two to three orders of magnitude below the corresponding binding constant. Conclusion: In this study, we extended the list of baricitinib off-targets that are potentially relevant for AD progression and predicted drug distribution in the brain. The results suggest a low likelihood of successful repurposing in AD due to low brain permeability, even at the maximum recommended daily dose. While additional research is needed to evaluate the potential impact of the off-target interaction on AD, the combined approach of ML target prediction, in vitro confirmation, and PBPK modelling may help prioritise drugs with a high likelihood of being effectively repurposed for AD.", "date": "2023-08-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, such NNPs can perform poorly outside their training domain and often fail catastrophically in predicting rare events in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The rare events in atomistic modeling typically include chemical bond breaking/formation, phase transitions, and materials failure, which are critical for new materials design, synthesis, and manufacturing processes. In this study, we develop an automated active learning (AL) capability by combining NNPs and enhanced sampling methods for capturing rare events to derive NNPs for targeted applications. We develop a decision engine based on configurational similarity and uncertainty quantification (UQ), using data augmentation for effective AL loops to distinguish the informative data from enhanced sampled configurations, showing that the generated data set achieves an activation energy error of less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we have devised a strategy to alleviate training uncertainty within AL iterations through a carefully constructed data selection process that leverages an ensemble approach.

Electrosynthetic oxidations often may be performed \"reagent-free\", generating H2 derived from the substrate as the sole byproduct at the counter electrode. Electrosynthetic reductions, however, require an external source of electrons. Sacrificial metal anodes are commonly used for small-scale applications, but more sustainable options are needed at large scale. Anodic water oxidation is an especially appealing option, but many reductions require anhydrous, air-free reaction conditions. This constraint motivates the growing interest in the electrochemical hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under non-aqueous conditions. Here, we report a mediated H2 anode that achieves indirect electrochemical oxidation of H2 by pairing thermal catalytic hydrogenation of an anthraquinone mediator with electrochemical oxidation of the anthrahydroquinone. This quinone-mediated H2 anode is used to support nickel-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling (XEC), a reaction class gaining widespread adoption within the pharmaceutical industry. Initial validation of this method in small-scale batch reactions is followed by adaptation to a recirculating flow reactor that enables hectogram-scale synthesis of a pharmaceutical intermediate.

Redox chemistry enables access to elusive cross-coupling mechanisms through single-electron processes as an alternative to classical two-electron strategies, which are predominated by palladium catalysis. The hallmark of this redox platform is the systematic modulation of transition-metal oxidation states by a photoredox catalyst or at a heterogeneous electrode sur-face. Electrocatalysis and photocatalysis enhance transition metal catalysis\u2019 capacity for bond formation through electron- or energy-transfer processes. Cross-coupling conditions promoted by electrocatalysis and photocatalysis are mild and bond formation proceeds with exceptionally high chemoselectivity and wide functional group tolerance. The interfacing of abundant first-row transition-metal catalysis with electrocatalysis and photocatalysis has brought about a paradigm shift in cross-coupling technology. In particular, the merger of Ni catalysis with electro- and photochemistry ushered in a new era for carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom cross-couplings. We have developed enabling photo- and electrochemical methods throughout our research experience in industry (BMS, AstraZeneca), academia (Professor Baran, Scripps Research), and cross-disciplinary collaborative environments. In this Account, we will outline recent progress from our past and present labs in photo- and electrochemically mediated Ni-catalyzed cross-couplings.

While the latter reaction is effectively catalyzed by Sn-based heterogeneous catalysts, the former reaction can be carried out with Au-based catalysts. The overall process, however, is penalized by a limited selectivity of supported gold nanoparticles in the first reaction, which strongly restrains the overall lactate yield. To avoid transitional purification steps, it appears interesting to run the process as a cascade reaction, in one step, and ideally with bifunctional catalysts. The preparation of such catalysts, however, remains a challenge. Here, bifunctional catalysts are prepared in one step, through a straightforward aerosol-assisted sol-gel route. The catalysts feature small Au nanoparticles (3-4 nm) embedded at the surface of mesoporous Sn-doped silica microspheres. The preparation successfully leads to insert both active sites in their most active forms, and in close proximity. With the bifunctional catalysts, the selectivity for the final product of the cascade reaction (methyl lactate) is higher than the DHA selectivity when only the first reaction is carried out. This highlights a beneficial substrate channeling effect which helps avoiding side reactions. Interestingly, the bifunctional catalysts also markedly outcompeted mechanical mixtures of the corresponding Au- and Sn-based catalysts. Thus, the spatial proximity between the two active sites in bifunctional catalysts is identified as a key to stir the cascade reaction towards high yield.

This is usually determined by drawing a valid resonance structure (one with no more than 2 formal charges) where all atoms are sp2-hybridized for the compound of interest, but we propose a new method intuitively suggesting resonance (if the atom of interest is determined to be sp2-hybridized) involving the comparison of inclusive vs. non-inclusive steric number calculation. We define inclusive steric number calculation as the number of sigma bonds plus the number of lone pairs bonded to the atom (both localized and delocalized), and define non-inclusive as the number of sigma bonds plus the number of localized lone pairs only. In the non-inclusive steric number calculation, the delocalized lone pairs count towards the Huckel number of pi electrons in the compound (4n+2 where n is an integer). Once both are calculated for the atom of interest and the rest of the following requirements for aromaticity are evaluated (i.e. compound is planar, cyclic, and has Huckel number of electrons) the version of the compound with the most stable aromatic configuration is selected as the correct configuration. For alkyne-containing compounds, we devised an alternative method for determining sp2-hybridization of atoms involved in an alkyne to ultimately reveal a conjugated pi system in the compound that agrees with our inclusive vs. non-inclusive steric number calculation. This approach involves the idea that the pi electrons of a pi bond within an alkyne that are not involved in the conjugated pi system (due to these p-orbitals being perpendicular relative to the parallel p-orbitals contributing to conjugation) can occupy a single atom in the alkyne, but the specific atom they occupy is unclear. Therefore, we present a \u201clone pair hybrid\u201d that accounts for both atoms being equally able to receive the pi electrons as a lone pair. These hypothetical lone pairs are localized due to an alkene still bonding the atoms and makes the steric number calculation for both the inclusive and non-inclusive approach 2 sigma bonds + 1 lone pair = 3, sp2, making the atoms sp2-hybridized and thus revealing the conjugated pi system.", "date": "2023-08-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Chemical Education", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To surmount these constraints, we designed and developed custom in-house multi-user VR software and created a VR digital twin model of the HPLC instrument in a training environment containing multiple HPLCs, aiming to simulate a realistic, interactive, and immersive learning environment. The investigation included a group of undergraduates with no previous HPLC experience, assessing the effectiveness of the VR digital twin model juxtaposed with conventional teaching methods.

In this work, we investigate the linear rheology of polybutadiene (PB) vitrimers bearing cross-links that exchange via dioxaborolane metathesis. PB vitrimers are cross-linked in solution using photoinitiated thiol-ene click chemistry. As the targeted cross-link density is increased, both the insoluble fraction and glass transition temperature increase. Linear viscoelasticity is studied using a combination of small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), creep, and stress relaxation measurements. In SAOS, the elastic modulus is approximately constant while the viscous modulus increases as angular frequency decreases. In creep, the compliance displays power law behavior that persists for at least 8 hrs. In stress relaxation, the modulus transitions from a rubbery plateau into a power law regime. Both SAOS and creep data are visually superposed into master curves using horizontal shift factors that exhibit Arrhenius behavior. However, application of these determined shift factors to stress relaxation curves fail to align the data into a single master curve. SAOS shift factors (a_SAOS) collapse the short time relaxation data and their activation energy (E_a^SAOS) matches the effective Williams-Landel-Ferry activation energy for PB homopolymer, indicating that the short time dynamics correspond to network strand segment relaxations. Creep shift factors (a_creep) collapse the long time relaxation data and their activation energy (E_a^creep) is significantly larger than the energies predicted by established theoretical models for transient networks.

Within model compounds and disordered peptides, the diastereotopic fluorines of Dfp exhibit similar chemical shifts (\u0394\u03b4FF = 0\u20133 ppm) when a trans X\u2013Dfp amide bond is present. In contrast, the diastereotopic fluorines exhibit a large (\u0394\u03b4FF = 5\u201312 ppm) difference in chemical shift in a cis X\u2013Dfp prolyl amide bond. DFT calculations, X-ray crystallography, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy indicated that the \u0394\u03b4FF directly reports on the relative preference of one proline ring pucker over the other: a fluorine which is pseudo-axial (i.e. the pro-4R-F in an exo ring pucker, or the pro-4S-F in an endo ring pucker) is downfield, while a fluorine which is pseudo-equatorial (i.e. pro-4S-F when exo, or pro-4R-F when endo) is upfield. Thus, when a proline is disordered (a mixture of exo and endo ring puckers, as at trans-Pro in peptides in water), it exhibits a small \u0394\u03b4. In contrast, when the Pro is ordered (i.e. when one ring pucker is strongly preferred, as in cis-Pro amide bonds, where the endo ring pucker is strongly favored), a large \u0394\u03b4 is observed. Dfp can be used to identify inherent induced order in peptides and to quantify proline cis-trans isomerism. Using Dfp, we discovered that the stable polyproline II helix (PPII) formed in the denatured state (8 M urea) exhibits essentially equal populations of the exo and endo proline ring puckers. In addition, the data with Dfp suggested the specific stabilization of PPII by water over other polar solvents. These data strongly support the importance of carbonyl solvation and n\u2192\u03c0* interactions for the stabilization of PPII. Dfp was also employed to quantify proline cis-trans isomerism as a function of phosphorylation and the R406W mutation in peptides derived from the intrinsically disordered protein tau. Dfp is minimally sterically disruptive and can be incorporated in expressed proteins, suggesting its broad application in understanding proline cis-trans isomerization, protein folding, and local order in intrinsically disordered proteins.", "date": "2023-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Biochemistry; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The oxidative bulk electrolysis of furfural is here investigated on platinum electrodes in acidic media. The effects of potential, concentration, pH, and supporting anion are studied, and selectivity trends are coupled with attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) to illuminate adsorbate structures that influence the catalysis. Increasing potential is found to shift selectivity from primarily C5 products to C4 products, coincident with oxidation of the Pt surface. Selectivity changes are also observed moving from pH 1 to pH 4, with an increase in C5 products at higher pH. Changing from the weakly adsorbing perchlorate anion to the specifically-adsorbing phosphate anion results in a number of changes that manifest differently depending on potential and pH. Selectivity to furoic acid is found to be highest above the pKa of phosphoric acid due to the strongly adsorbed phosphate ions suppressing flat-lying configurations of furfural that lead to C-C cleavage. These results point toward opportunities to use electrolyte engineering to tune selectivity and optimize surface conditions to disfavor binding of inhibitory products.

Respiratory viruses account for the majority of ARIs. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a host homeostatic defence mechanism primarily activated in response to aberrant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein accumulation in cell stresses including viral infection. The UPR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several respiratory diseases, as the respiratory system is particularly vulnerable to chronic and acute activation of the ER stress response pathway. Many respiratory viruses therefore employ strategies to modulate the UPR during infection, with varying effects on the host and the pathogens. Here, we review the specific means by which respiratory viruses affect the host UPR, particularly in association with the high production of viral glycoproteins, and the impact of UPR activation and subversion on viral replication and disease pathogenesis. We further review the activation of UPR in common co-morbidities of ARIs and discuss the therapeutic potential of modulating the UPR in virally induced respiratory diseases.", "date": "2023-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The methodology is then used to evaluate the Br\u00f8nsted acidity of the OH sites of representative oxide materials using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP-)enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy.", "date": "2023-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Organometallic Compounds; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The quality of the embedding potential is critical to provide accurate results, e.g., for spectroscopic properties and dynamical processes. High-quality embedding-potential parameters can be obtained by dividing the classical region into smaller fragments and deriving the parameters from ab-initio calculations on the fragments. For solvents and other systems composed of small molecules, the fragments can be individual molecules, while a more complicated fragmentation procedure is needed for larger molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. One such fragmentation strategy is the molecular fractionation with conjugate caps (MFCC) approach. As is widely known, hydrogen bonds play a key role in many biomolecular systems, e.g., in proteins, where they are responsible for the secondary structure. In this work, we assess the effects of including hydrogen-bond fragmentation in the MFCC procedure (MFCC(HB)) for deriving the embedding-potential parameters. The MFCC(HB) extension is evaluated on several molecular systems, ranging from small model systems to proteins, directly in terms of molecular electrostatic potentials and embedding potentials and indirectly in terms of selected properties of chromophores embedded in water and complex protein environments.", "date": "2023-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Tensor decomposition techniques such as Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC2/PARAFAC2\u00d7N) allow analysts to deconvolve closely eluting signals for quantitative and qualitative purposes. These techniques make relatively few assumptions about chromatographic peak shapes or the relative abundance of noise and allow for highly accurate representations of the underlying chemical phenomena using well-characterized and scrutinized principles of chemometrics. However, expert intervention and supervision is required to select appropriate Regions of Interest (ROI) and numbers of chemical components present in each ROI.

Here, we present an extension of this work to automatically detect ROIs in GC\u00d7GC-MS chromatograms, while making no assumptions about peak shape. First we calculate the probabilities of each acquisition being in a ROI, then apply connected components segmentation to discretize the regions of interest. For sparse chromatograms we found the algorithm detected spurious peaks.

The incorporation of cleavable bonds in the polymer backbone is a solution to make a commodity polymer degradable. When radical polymerization is used, this approach is made possible by the radical ring-opening polymerization (rROP) of a cyclic monomer that allows the introduction of a weak bond into the polymer backbone. Among the various cyclic monomers that could be used in rROP, thionolactones are promising structures due to the efficiency of the C=S bond to act as radical acceptor. Nevertheless, only few structures were reported to be efficient. In this work, we used DFT calculations to gain better understanding of the radical reactivity of thionolactones and in particular we focused on the transfer rate constant ktr value and its ratio with the propagation rate constant kp of the vinyl monomer. The closer to 1, the better the statistical incorporation of the two comonomers into the backbone. With this approach, we identified and prepared the 7-phenyloxepane-2-thione (POT) thionolactone. The copolymerization of styrene and various acrylate derivatives with POT led to statistical copolymers that were efficiently degraded under accelerated conditions (KOH in THF/MeOH, TBD in THF or mCPBA in THF), confirming the theoretical approach. The compatibility with RAFT polymerization was established as well as the homopolymerization behavior of POT.

Data-driven approaches, in contrast to screening procedures based on intuition, have the potential to reduce the time and resources needed for reaction optimization by more rapidly identifying an ideal catalyst. These approaches, however, are often non-transferable and cannot be applied across different reactions. To overcome this drawback, we introduce a general featurization strategy for bidentate ligands that is coupled with an automated feature selection pipeline and Bayesian ridge regression to perform multivariate linear regression modeling. This approach, which is applicable to any reaction, incorporates electronic, steric, and topological features (rigidity/flexibility, branching, geometry, constitution) and is well-suited for early-stage ligand optimization. Using only a limited number of points per dataset, our workflow capably predicts the enantioselectivity of four metal-catalyzed asymmetric reactions. Uncertainty estimates provided by Bayesian ridge regression permit the use of Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore pools of prospective new ligands.

The study was conducted to evaluate the potential of Syzgium aromaticum oil as a safe alternative to synthetic agrochemicals currently used for the control of Callosobruchus maculatus, the principal post-harvest pest of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)- a major plant protein source in Africa. Pulverised dried flower buds of Syzgium aromaticum were extracted by hydrodistillation using Clevenger apparatus to obtain clove oil. The oil was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique and the major components of the oil were eugenol (72.8%) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (19.5%). Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the potency of the clove oil in the control of Callosobruchus maculatus. The repellency of the oil was evaluated using the area of preference method. Adults Callosobruchus maculatus were released separately at the center of the Whatman No.1 filter infused with 1mL of 100 ppm- 400 ppm clove oil in covered petri dishes. Ethanol was used as control. The treatments were assigned in a completely randomized design. The number of insects present on the control and treated papers were recorded 1 hr and 2 hr after exposure and percent repellency was calculated. In the second experiment, 20 g of the cowpea seeds were treated with 100-400 ppm clove oil, with ethanol as a negative control and pirimiphos-methyl as positive control. They were exposed to C. maculatus in a jar covered with mesh. Mortality was recorded 24, 48, 72 hr after infestation. The highest repellency of 35% occurred after 2 hrs of exposure to 200 ppm clove oil. Thus, clove oil did not significantly repel C. maculatus. Nonetheless, exposure of C. maculatus to 300 ppm clove oil for 72 hours after infestation inflicted high mortality of 64.6% comparable to that of the synthetic insecticide pirimiphos-methyl (75%).

However, bridging the gap between playing computer games with thousands of simulated episodes and solving real scientific problems with complex and involved environments (up to actual laboratory experiments) requires improvements in terms of sample efficiency to make the most of expensive information. The discovery of new drugs is a major commercial application of RL, motivated by the very large nature of the chemical space and the need to perform multiparameter optimization (MPO) across different properties. In silico methods, such as virtual library screening (VS) and de-novo molecular generation with RL, show great promise in accelerating this search. However, incorporation of increasingly complex computational models in these workflows requires increasing sample efficiency. Here, we introduce an active learning system linked with an RL model (RL-AL) for molecular design, which aims to improve the sample-efficiency of the optimization process. We identity and characterize unique challenges combining RL and AL, investigate the interplay between the systems, and develop a novel AL approach to solve the MPO problem. Our approach greatly expedites the search for novel solutions relative to baseline-RL for simple ligand- and structure-based oracle functions, with a 1000-75 000%-increase in hits generated for a fixed oracle budget and a 14-65-fold reduction in computational time to find a specific number of hits. Furthermore, compounds discovered through RL-AL display substantial enrichment of a multi-parameter scoring objective, indicating superior efficacy in curating high-scoring compounds, without a reduction in output diversity. This significant acceleration improves the feasibility of oracle functions that have largely been overlooked in RL due to high computational costs, for example free energy perturbation methods, and in principle is applicable to any RL domain.

Since their poor ionization, derivatization reagents, such as dansylhydrazine, are usually used to improve the sensitivity and/or to facilitate quantification. However, most current carbonyl derivatization reagents only have two channels, one is isotopically labeled and the other one is non-labeled. To quantify more samples in a run and using data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode to get comprehensive and unbiased mass fragmentation, we proposed a fragment-controlled isotopic tag, called DiMe-FP-NHNH2 (FP) which has five channels: \u03940, \u03943, \u03946, \u03949, and \u039412, thus up to 5 samples can be analyzed in a run. Results:. The most important improvement is that the FP tag can produce multiple characteristic signals in tandem mass, diagnostic ions and neutral losses, which helps to selectively detect aldehydes/ketones for targeted and untargeted analysis. To exhibit all capabilities of the FP tag, we mimicked an untargeted metabolomics experiment, which comprises two steps. First, discovery step, using Data-Independent Analysis (SWATH-MS) and the labeling of two channels (\u03940 and \u03943), we picked out aldehyde/ketone from the pooled urine samples based on three characteristic signals, including isotope patterns, diagnostic ions, and neutral losses. Second, five-plex quantification, relative and absolute quantification were achieved in a single LC-MS analysis. Notably, because of different nominal masses, the FP tag can be used on any low or high resolution mass spectrometers Significance: The benefits and performance of the FP tag are demonstrated by the analysis of urine samples collected from patients from a prostate cancer study, in which more than a thousand features were found based on MS1 fingerprint, but only around 120 aldehyde/ketone candidates were confirmed with characteristic signals and nine of which were quantified showing significant differences from healthy and reference urine samples.

This could stem from a historical perception regarding the lack of unique reactivity/selectivity that would result from using such a waveform, as well as the absence of readily available instrumentation to remove the engineering barrier for mass adoption. A breakthrough in this area is the introduction of rapid alternating polarity (rAP), which alternates the polarity of an electrode in the millisecond timescale.

Here, we investigate whether different ML models for property predictions benefit from the aggregation of large databases into smaller repositories. To do this, we probe three different aggregation strategies prioritizing training size, element diversity, and composition diversity. For classic ML models, our results consistently show a reduction in performance under all the considered strategies. Deep Learning models show more robustness, but most changes are not significant. Furthermore, to assess whether this is a consequence of a distribution mismatch between datasets, we simulate the data acquisition process of a single dataset and compare a random selection with prioritizing chemical diversity. We observe that prioritizing composition diversity generally leads to a slower convergence toward better accuracy.

Methods of artificially producing freshwater include desalination, which is a well-established technology in which water is extracted from a saline solution (typically seawater). Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is an alternate emerging approach in which water vapor is extracted from ambient air and condensed into freshwater. AWH has recently attracted attention for decentralized water production, but a comparative analysis of these different technologies using the same performance (kWh/m3) and cost metrics ($/m3) does not exist. Herein we develop the first thermodynamic and technoeconomic framework for clean water production that considers the population and water risk across all global locations. We find that AWH consumes more energy than practical desalination with subsequent water transport for roughly 90% of the global population, even when AWH operates under reversible (albeit impractical) operation. Furthermore, a practical AWH system is far more expensive (6\u00d7 \u2013 40\u00d7 depending on the location and AWH technology used) than seawater desalination on a levelized cost of water (LCOW) basis, even after accounting for the costs associated with transporting desalinated water inland. The one exception is when water transport costs are increased by 5\u00d7, resulting in sorbent AWH becoming the lowest cost option for arid locations far from the coast (e.g., Sahara Desert).

Due to its high value, some producers adulterate olive oil with cheaper edible oils or mislabel cheaper oils to increase profitability. These other edible oils can have chemical profiles similar to extra virgin olive oil but can cause allergies in sensitive individuals. Given these consequences, there is a need for methods to rapidly authenticate olive oils. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been used for this purpose, as it requires minimal sample preparation and is non-destructive. By utilizing NMR spectra of the samples and machine learning models trained on known olive oil and edible oils, oil samples can be classified and authenticated. While high-field NMRs are commonly used due to their superior resolution and sensitivity, they are generally prohibitively expensive to purchase and operate, for routine screening purposes. Low-field benchtop NMR presents an affordable alternative. Here, we compared the predictive performance of partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) models trained on low-field 60 MHz benchtop 1H NMR and high-field 400 MHz 1H NMR spectra. We demonstrated that PLS-DA models trained on low-field spectra perform comparably to those trained on high-field spectra.", "date": "2023-08-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we investigate the picosecond hydrogen-bond dynamics of a model biocondensate consisting of a peptide Poly-L-Arginine and the nucleic acid adenosine monophosphate (AMP) using ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. We investigate three vibrational modes, the arginine side chain C=N stretches, an AMP ring mode, and the amide backbone carbonyl stretches, to provide different perspectives.  In general, dynamics slow down considerably between the dilute phase and the condensate phase for each vibrational probe. For example, the arginine side chain C=N modes slows from 0.38 ps to 2.26 ps due to strong electrostatic interactions. Hydrogen bond lifetime computed from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations provide an atomistic interpretation. Simulations predict that a significant fraction of water molecules are highly constrained within the condensate. We attribute this slowdown in dynamics to a highly disordered and extremely crowded water environment.", "date": "2023-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The results of the spectroscopic analysis suggest that the Fenton reaction occurs ideally in acidic environments (p = 0.00354) with low temperature dependence.

Conventionally, however, recording the C\u03b2 chemical shift of solid proteins with relatively short transverse relaxa-tion time is often limited by the long delay required for the magnetization transfer to C\u03b2 spins and its evolution, i.e., by the sensitivity drop. In this paper, we propose a new method that encodes the C\u03b2 chemical shifts into the intensities of the sca-lar-coupled C\u03b1 signals, by combining an optimal-control-based spin manipulation pulse and a spin-state filter. This reduced the total required transverse evolution to less than half of that for the previously proposed method, opening up the concept of the C\u03b2-encoding nearest-neighbor NMR, for the first time, to solid proteins. Also, the total measurement time was shorter than that required for the explicit C\u03b2 shift evolution.

Here we carefully analyse the room temaperature time-resolved emission of a neat liquid singlet fission chromophore, 5,12-bis(n-octyldiisopropylsilylethynyl)tetracene.

In this work we present a different concept for the generation and use of molecular photoswitches. It allows not only simultaneous establishment of photochromism and functionalization, but also full recyclability of a non-photochromic precursor material. Using a high-yielding and reversible ammonium salt formation, a functional group is introduced into a symmetric precursor while at the same time a strong electronic push-pull character is established in the structure. The resulting desymmetrization leads to efficient photoswitching capacity and the functional group can be fully removed subsequently by a simple heating step recovering the precursor for another functionalization round.

However, several technical challenges such as polysulfide shuttling remain. As liquid polysulfide diffusion into the electrolyte causes a loss of capacity, different material classes have been explored to anchor lithium polysulfides and reduce active material loss. The metal-organic framework (MOF) UiO-66 has been identified as one candidate material due to its porosity, high surface area, and zirconium oxide nodes that could anchor liquid polysulfides. MOFs also allow for post-synthetic modifications that can increase their adsorption specificity towards liquid polysulfides and reduce shuttling. In this work, we combined atomistic simulations and experimental characterization to probe the molecular interactions between lithium polysulfides and functionalized UiO-66 nodes. We explored how lithium polysulfides adsorb to open sites caused by missing linker defects, as well as sites functionalized with alkali cations. Our results demonstrate that lithium polysulfides adsorb favorably to UiO-66 through Li-O electrostatic interactions. In addition, we found that nodes functionalized with alkali metals demonstrated stronger adsorption of long chain lithium polysulfides (Li2S4-8) by facilitating charge transfer to the nodes. Experimental UV-Vis and 7Li-NMR measurements on Zr polyoxometallates and UiO-66 provided further evidence that lithiation favors adsorption of long chain polysulfides. Our findings show how UiO-66 functionalization may inhibit the shuttle effect through polysulfide adsorption, and consequently im-prove Li-S battery performance.

Recently emerging low-dimensional hybrid halide perovskites have much more enhanced long-term stability, but their wide bandgap and strong quantum well confinement severely hinder various optoelectronic applications. How to tackle these issues without sacrificing long-term stability, therefore, has been emerging as a crucial materials science concern. Based on the first principal calculations, we have investigated the impact of spacer cation on the properties of 2D monolayer hybrid halide perovskites in depth. Our simulations reveal that strong interactions of spacer cation with each other and with MX{_6}{^4\u2013} backbone not only enhance the thermo stability of MX{_6}{^4\u2013} backbone and protect it against water molecules, but also modulate the electronic properties via altering the crystalline structure. More importantly, the delocalized orbitals and relatively high dielectric constants of spacer cation resulting from the conjugated benzene ring weaken the quantum well confinement and potential barrier well, thus allowing the efficient electron-hole separation and photo-generated carrier out-of-plane transport. The comprehensive effect of spacer cations on the properties of 2D monolayer hybrid halide perovskites observed here, thereby, clearly demonstrates the importance of finely selected spacer cations in adopting their photophysical properties.", "date": "2023-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Next, an experimental design for retention measurements made using mobile phase gradient elution conditions is proposed for the purpose of obtaining accurate and precise NK parameters. Simulated retention data for mobile phase gradient elution conditions with two different levels of noise, as well as an essentially zero noise level were fit with the re-parameterized model.  The results showed that the re-parameterized fits yielded average (absolute value) prediction errors for the parameters at the highest noise level of 7.16 % for S1,ref, 17.5 % for S2,ref and 6.19 % for kref.  These errors were significantly smaller than those for the original parameterization of the NK model, where the errors were 23.2 % for S1, 24.9 % for S2 and 159 % for kw. Furthermore, isocratic retention factors predicted using these model parameters were found to have an average magnitude of error of 0.509 % for the re-parameterized model, as opposed to 6750 % for the model with the original parameterization. A further test of this approach was carried out for independent experimental measurements for five solutes and a C18 column. The average magnitude of error of the isocratic retention factors predicted from parameters obtained from fits of gradient data was 1.59 %, provided that the range of organic solvent compositions that the solute sampled in the mobile phase gradient experiments was consistent with the isocratic experiments.

Both represent site-selective conjugates and are shown to be stable when challenged with glutathione under physiological conditions, and upon incubation in serum.  Furthermore, the NBT reaction is tested on the more challenging context of a full antibody, and all four disulfide bonds are effectively modified by these new one-carbon bridging reagents.

However, device measurements are described by a complex array of design and parameter choices, many of which are sparsely reported. For example, the mobility of a polymer-based organic field-effect transistor (OFET) may vary by several orders of magnitude for a given polymer, as a plethora of parameters related to solution processing, interface design/surface treatment, thin-film deposition, post-processing, and measurement settings have a profound effect on the value of the final measurement. Incomplete contextual, experimental details hamper the availability of reusable data applicable for data-driven optimization, modeling (e.g., machine learning), and analysis of new organic devices. To curate organic device databases that contain reproducible and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) experimental data records, data ontologies that fully describe sample provenance and process history are required. However, standards for generating such process ontologies are not widely adopted for experimental materials domains. In this work, we design and implement an object-relational database for storing experimental records of OFETs. A data structure is generated by drawing on an international standard for batch process control (ISA-88) to facilitate the design. We then mobilize these representative data records, curated from literature and laboratory experiments, to enable data-driven learning of process-structure-property relationships.

This motivates the development of predictive computational models that can be used to optimize compounds on the basis of their kinetics. The structural details underpinning these computational models are not only found in the bound state, but also in the short-lived ligand binding transition state: the highest free energy point along the (un)binding pathway. Although this transition state cannot be directly observed experimentally, due to its extremely short lifetime, recent successes have demonstrated that modeling of the ligand binding transition state is possible with the help of enhanced sampling methods for molecular dynamics. In our previous work we analyzed the transition state ensemble for an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) with a residence time of 11 minutes. Here we computationally modeled unbinding events for five additional inhibitors of sEH with residence times ranging from 14.25 to 31.75 minutes, with our results recapitulating these experimental residence times to within an order of magnitude. The unbinding ensembles are analyzed in detail, focusing on features of the ligand binding transition state. We find that ligands with similar structures and similar bound poses can show significant differences in their ligand binding transition states, in terms of their spatial location and their interactions with specific protein residues.

Here we present a comprehensive investigation of rhodium-modified polycrystalline nickel as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen electrode reactions in alkaline media. The surface modification of nickel electrodes was achieved by facile galvanic displacement (up to 30 seconds) from a highly concentrated acidic Rh3+ solution. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the Rh-modified Ni electrodes, positioning galvanic displacement as a viable approach to engineering advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy applications. On the other hand, the hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities of the Rh-modified electrodes are lower compared to polycrystalline platinum. It is suggested that semiconducting Rh2O3 has a detrimental role on the HOR and ORR performance, while the activities of HER and OER, dominantly taking place on metallic Rh and conductive RhO2, are very high.

It is generally assumed that the composition of individual GUVs is the same as the nominal stock composition, however, there may be significant compositional variability between individual GUVs. Although this compositional heterogeneity likely impacts phase behavior, the function and incorporation of membrane proteins, and the encapsulation of biochemical reactions, it has yet to be directly quantified. To assess heterogeneity, we use secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to probe the composition of individual GUVs using non-perturbing isotopic labels. Both 13C- and 2H-labeled lipids are incorporated into a ternary mixture, which is then used to produce GUVs via gentle hydration or electroformation. Simultaneous detection of seven different ion species via SIMS allows for the concentration of 13C- and 2H-labeled lipids in single GUVs to be quantified using calibration curves, which correlate ion intensity to composition. Additionally, the relative concentration of 13C- and 2H-labeled lipids is assessed for each GUV via the ion ratio 2H-/13C-, which is highly sensitive to compositional differences between individual GUVs and circumvents the need for calibration using standards. Both quantification methods suggest that gentle hydration produces GUVs with greater compositional variability than those formed by electroformation.

We find sufficient accuracy in inferences when comparing predictions using the full energy point spectra to the reduced energy point subspectra recommended by feature selection. As a representative test case in the hard X-ray regime, we find that the total experimental time of nano-XANES imaging can be reduced by ~80% for a study of Fe-bearing mineral phases. These improvements capitalize on using the most common analysis procedure \u2013 linear combination fitting onto a reference library \u2013 to train the feature selection algorithm and thus learn the optimal measurements within this analysis context. We compare various feature selection algorithms such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), random forest, and decision tree, and find that RFE produces moderately better recommendations. We further explore practices to maintain reliable feature selection results, especially when there is large uncertainty in the system, thus requiring a more expansive reference library, resulting in high linear mutual dependence within the reference set. More generally, the class of spectroscopic imaging experiments that scan energy by energy (rather than collecting an entire spectrum at once) is well-addressed by feature selection, and our approach is equally applicable to the soft X-ray regime via Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) experiments.

In the present work, several bioreductive prodrugs for class I HDACs were designed and synthesized based on known selective HDAC inhibitors. The zinc-binding group of the HDAC inhibitors was masked with various nitroarylmethyl residues to make them substrates of nitroreductase (NTR). The developed prodrugs showed very weak HDAC inhibitory activity compared to their parent inhibitors. The prodrugs were also tested against wild-type and NTR-transfected THP1 cells. Cellular assays showed that both 2-nitroimidazole-based prodrugs 5 and 6 were best activated by the NTR prodrug system and exhibited potent activity against NTR-THP1 cells. Compound 6 showed the highest cellular activity (GI50 = 77 nM) and also exhibited a moderate selectivity window. Moreover, activation of the prodrug by NTR was confirmed by LC-MS analysis, which showed the release of the parent inhibitor after incubation of prodrug 6 with E. coli NTR.

With this approach, concrete can be turned into a functional carbon sink (C-sink). Until now, biochar has been used without modification to replace part of the cement or of the aggregates in concrete. However, this technology comes with a number of practical problems, which include the high water absorption of the biochar (due to its high specific surface) and hazards (dust, risk of combustion).  In this paper we present an alternative approach in which biochar is first processed into lightweight aggregates in a cold-bonding process. To this end, biochar is pelletized together with a small amount of hydraulic binder and with water and forms round pellets that further harden with hydration time. In this way, carbon-rich lightweight aggregates (C-LWA) are obtained that are easier to handle than the pure biochar. The C-LWA pellets have similar porosity and strength as conventional LWA and can be used for similar applications. Yet, the CO2 emissions from sintering traditional LWA are avoided and the C-LWA are instead an effective C-sink. We demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate in the pellets and eventually in the concrete a sufficient amount of carbon to compensate for the original emissions of concrete. The net-zero emissions concrete obtained with this approach possesses mechanical performance sufficient for typical structural applications in buildings.

Controlled potential spectroelectrochemical studies of 1 in wet acetonitrile at 1.45 V vs. NHE revealed quantitative formation of 2 within 10 min. The high-valent oxomanganese(IV) transient exhibited remarkable stability and could be reverted to the starting complex (1) by switching the potential to 0.25 V vs. NHE. The formation of 2 via PCET oxidation of 1 demonstrates an alternate pathway for the generation of the oxomanganese(IV) transient (2) without the requirement of redox-inactive metal ions or acid additives as proposed earlier. Theoretical studies  predict that one-electron oxidation of [(dpaq)MnIV(O)]+ (2) forms a  manganese(V)-oxo (3) species, which can be oxidized further by one-electron to a formally manganese(VI)-oxo transient (4). Theoretical analyses suggest that the first oxidation event (2 to 3) takes place at the metal-based d-orbital whereas, in the second oxidation process (3 to 4), the electron eliminates from an orbital composed of equitable contribution from metal and ligand, leaving a single electron in the quinoline-dominated orbital in the doublet ground spin state of the manganese(VI)-oxo species (4). This mixed metal- ligand (quinoline)-based oxidation is proposed to generate a formally Mn(VI) species (4), a non-heme analogue of the species \u2018compound I\u2019, formed in the catalytic cycle of cytochrome P-450. We propose that the highly electrophilic species 4 catches water during cyclic voltammetry experiments and results in O\u2015O bond formation leading to electrocatalytic oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide.", "date": "2023-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Small Molecule Activation (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we prepared and characterized a three-component hydrogel system comprising cytidine, boric acid, and silver nitrate. The gelation occurs rapidly within a minute at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which makes the system more convenient to use. Reduction of Ag+ by the in situ generated ascorbic acid by ALP allows the development of colorimetric sensor based on the gel-coated paper, enabling quantification of ALP concentration.

Such radicals are important intermediates in reactions catalyzed by synthetic metal complexes and metalloenzymes, but their high reactivity can lead to undesired side reactions such as quenching by solvent, oxygen, or other radicals. In this work, we show that confinement of a CoII porphyrin complex in a large porphyrin-walled M8L6 nanocage allows for the taming of radical reactivity to enable clean oxidative alkylation of the cobalt center with tetraalkyltin reagents via an unexpected process mediated by O2 and light, which usually promote homolytic decomposition of porphyrin-supported CoIII\u2013alkyl bonds. Indeed, analogous CoIII\u2013alkyl complexes in free solution degrade too quickly under the alkylating conditions to enable their clean formation. The nanocage also acts as a size-selective barrier for alkylating agents, allowing CoIII\u2013alkyl formation using SnMe4 and SnEt4 but not SnBu4.

A quantum mechanical density functional theory assisted by machine learning was used to investigate the relationship between the chemical features of diazo compounds and the activation energy required for the N2 dissociation. Our results suggest that diazo molecules possessing a higher positive partial charge on the carbene carbon and more negative charge on the terminal nitrogen, encounter a lower energy barrier.

Unlike previous strategies, our method does not need prior\nknowledge of reaction networks or training multiple MLPs for uncertainty estimation.\nCompared with the recent proposed methods HAIR and DP-GEN, our approach gives\nsignificant improvement of sampling efficiency with less requirements with the initial\ntraining data, to realize > 10 ns MLPMD simulation using ab initio MD (AIMD)\ntrajectory of just a few ps. We introduce the concept underlying instability consis\u0002tency by showing the accuracy of reaction mechanisms and radial distribution function (RDF) can be improved by SIS-MLPMD, although their information is not explicitly\nused in our sampling decision. Furthermore, we show that long-time MLPMD simu\u0002lation of Lithium metal battery (LMB) can not only reproduce some well-known SEI\ncomponents including LiF, Li2O, LiOH, LiS and the incomplete N-S breaking in high\u0002concentration systems, but also ionic aggregation structures of LiF, which is not shown\nin our AIMD training data but matches previous results of electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy.

To demonstrate the power of our approach, we used BICePs to reweight conformational ensembles of the mini-protein chignolin simulated in nine different force fields with TIP3P water, using a set of 158 experimental measurements (139 NOE distances, 13 chemical shifts, and 6 vicinal $J$-coupling constants for H$^{\\text{N}}$ and H$^{\\alpha}$.

Conductive electrodes on soft substrates open a broad spectrum of possibilities such as electrical and electrochemical sensing coupled with the flexibility, elasticity and transparency of the underlying substrate. Single layer graphene on a soft substrate as a candidate for such flexible electrodes brings the additional advantage that the active area of the sensor is transparent and conformal to the underlying substrate. Here, we overcome several challenges facing the routine realization of graphene cell sensors on a canonical soft substrate namely poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Specifically, we have systematically studied the effect of surface energy before, during and after the transfer of graphene. Based on this, we have identified a suitable support polymer, optimal substrate (pre-) treatment and an appropriate solvent for the removal of the support. Using this procedure, we can reproducibly obtain stable and intact graphene sensors in millimeter-scale on PDMS, which can withstand continuous measurements in cell culture media for several days. From local nanomechanical measurements with an AFM, we infer that the softness of the substrate is slightly affected after graphene transfer. However, we can modulate the stiffness using PDMS of differing composition. Finally, we show that graphene sensors on PDMS can be successfully used as electrodes for real-time monitoring of cell adhesion kinetics on a soft substrate. The routine availability of single layer graphene electrodes on a flexible soft substrate with tunable stiffness will open a new avenue for a range of studies, where the PDMS-liquid interface is made conducting with minimal alteration of the intrinsic material properties such as softness, flexibility, elasticity and transparency.", "date": "2023-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Carbon-based Materials; Biochemical Analysis; Electrochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Benchmark-quality data is required for testing existing theoretical methods and for developing new ones but is complicated to obtain for many transition metal compounds due to the potential presence of both strong dynamical and static electron correlation. In this regime, it is questionable whether the so-called gold standard, coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), provides the desired level of accuracy -- roughly 1-3 kcal/mol.   In this work, we compiled a test set of 28 3d metal-containing molecules relevant to homogeneous electrocatalysis (termed 3dTMV) and computed their vertical ionization energies (ionization potentials) with CCSD(T) and phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) in the def2-SVP basis set. A substantial effort has been made to converge away the phaseless bias in the ph-AFQMC reference values.   We assess a wide variety of multireference diagnostics, and find that spin-symmetry breaking of the CCSD wavefunction and in the PBE0 density functional correlate well with our analysis of multiconfigurational wavefunctions.   We propose quantitative criteria based on symmetry breaking to delineate correlation regimes inside of which appropriately-performed CCSD(T) can produce mean absolute deviations from the ph-AFQMC reference values of roughly 2 kcal/mol or less, and outside of which CCSD(T) is expected to fail.

However, designing synthesis pathways remains challenging for existing machine learning models which are trained for single-step prediction. In this manuscript, we propose a new approach by recasting the retrosynthesis problem as a string optimization problem, leveraging the similarity between chemical reactions and multidimensional geometrical vectors. Based on this premise, multi-step complex synthesis can be conceptualized as sequences that link multidimensional vectors (fingerprints) representing individual chemical reaction steps. We extracted an extensive corpus of chemical synthesis from patents and converted them into multi-dimensional strings. While optimizing the retrosynthetic path, we use the Euclidean metric to minimize the distance between the expanded trajectory of the growing retrosynthesis string and the corpus of extracted strings. By doing so, we promote the assembly of synthetic pathways that, in the chemical reaction space, will be more similar to existing retrosynthesis, thereby inheriting the strategic guidelines designed by human experts.

Recently, nacre-like materials have been developed by solvent evaporation methods that are scalable and attain advanced functionalities. However, understanding the alignment mechanisms of 2D-fillers, nanosheets or platelets, remains challenging. This work explores the possible pathways for nanocomposite ordering via orientation distribution functions. We demonstrate how the immobilization of 2D-materials via a (pseudo)-network formation is crucial to alignment based on evaporation. We show a modified affine deformation model that describes such evaporative methods. In this, a gel network develops enough yield stress and uniformly deforms as drying proceeds, along with the immobilized particles, causing in-plane orientation. Herein, we tested the dominance of this approach by using a thermo-reversible gel for rapid montmorillonite (MMT) particle fixation. We researched gelatin/MMT as a model system to investigate the effects of high loadings, orientational order, and aspect ratio. The nacre-like nanocomposites showed a semi-constant order parameter (<P2> ~0.7) over increasing nanofiller content up to 64 vol.% filler. This remarkable alignment resulted in continuously improved mechanical and water vapor barrier properties over unusually high filler fractions. Some variations in stiffness and diffusion properties were observed, possibly correlated to the applied drying conditions of the hybrid hydrogels. The affine deformation strategy holds promise for developing next-generation advanced materials with tailored properties even at (very) high filler loadings. Furthermore, a gelling approach offers the advantages of simplicity and versatility in the formulation of the components, which is useful for large-scale fabrication methods.", "date": "2023-08-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Composites; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The maximum entropy method is a useful tool for the retrieval of complex spectra from the intensity spectra; however, one caveat is that an understanding of the error phase is required. Here we provide a physically motivated understanding of the error phase, where we show that for broadband vSFG spectra such as the silica/water, the good spectral overlap between water in the diffuse and Stern (or bonded interfacial) layers results in the absolute phase correlating with the error phase. This correlation makes the error phase sensitive to changes in Debye length from varying the ionic strength amongst other variations at the interface. Furthermore, the change in the magnitude error phase can be related to the absolute SHG phase permitting the use of an error phase model that can utilize the SHG phase to predict the error phase and hence the complex vSFG spectra. We highlight limitations of the model for narrow vSFG spectra with poor overlap between the diffuse and Stern layer spectra, such as the silica/HOD in D2O system.

By analyzing the interaction energies and their individual components, we demonstrate that there exists variability across different systems for empirical dispersion models, which are calibrated for reproducing the interaction energies of specific systems. Thus, parameter fitting may undermine the underlying physics, as dispersion models rely on error compensation among the different components of the interaction energy. Energy decomposition analyses reveal that, the accuracy of revPBE-D3 for some aqueous systems originates from significant compensation between dispersion and charge transfer energies. However, revPBE-D3 is less accurate in describing systems where error compensation is incomplete, such as the benzene dimer. Such cases highlight the propensity for unpredictable behavior in various dispersion-corrected density functionals across a wide range of molecular systems, akin to the behavior of force fields. On the other hand, we find that SCAN-rVV10, a targeted-dispersion approach, affords significant reductions in errors associated with the lattice energies of molecular crystals, whilst it has limited accuracy in reproducing structural properties.

One is the preparation of a high entropy alloy supported system/catalyst where unlike the conventional sol-gel process one of the components (metal) is already in a final form of metallic nanoparticle and the other component (oxide) needs to be prepared from its precursor. Second key concept is the demonstration of metal support interaction (MSI) in high entropy alloys (HEA) catalysis. CoCuFeMnNi, which is a FCC structured HEA alloy becomes an active dry reforming catalyst only when it is supported over CeO2 oxide, a clear demonstration of metal support interaction. Importantly, the CoCuFeMnNi supported CeO2 catalyst (CoCuFeMnNi/CeO2) displays noteworthy features of substitutional effects where XPS is unable to identify the surface concentration of majority of the HEA entities. This is further corroborated by TEM where substantial demonstrations of HEA substitution in CeO2 is visibly clear. It is envisaged that this substitutional effect is the one which causes the lattice oxygen activation, an important active species during dry reforming reaction. Transient studies are carried out to understand the surface chemistry of the interaction of methane and CO2 and this study establishes that CoCuFeMnNi/CeO2 \u00acfollows the conventional DRM mechanism where methane decomposes first to give hydrogen and carbon and CO2 reacts with the deposited carbon to give CO. Overall, CoCuFeMnNi/CeO2 \u00ac represents good activity and reasonable stability, much higher than that of CeO2 or CoCuFeMnNi alone. This study can be taken as a proof of concept to demonstrate that MSI can be generated in the HEA catalysts and the preparation methodology adopted in this study is a handy tool to achieve this.

Herein, we suggest a novel approach to overcome this issue by changing only one variable at the time, while keeping all others constant before investigating the lignin performance. Indulin, a softwood Kraft lignin, was chosen as model substrate for this study.

As its synthesis usually requires toxic and costly organic templates, the discovery of alternative Cu-based zeolite catalysts with organotemplate-free synthesis and comparable or even superior NH3-SCR activity to Cu-SSZ-13 is of great academic and industrial significance. Herein, we, for the first time, demonstrated that the Cu-T catalyst with an intergrowth structure of offretite (OFF) and erionite (ERI) synthesized with organotemplate-free method showed better catalytic performance than Cu-ERI and Cu-OFF as well as Cu-SSZ-13. Structure characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the intergrowth structure promoted more isolated Cu2+ located at 6MR of intergrowth interface, resulting in a better hydrothermal stability of Cu-T than Cu-ERI and Cu-OFF. Strikingly, the low-temperature activity of Cu-T significantly increased after hydrothermal aging, while that of Cu-ERI and Cu-OFF substantially decreased. On the basis of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) analysis and DFT calculations, the reason can be attributed to that the NH4NO3 formed on the CuxOy species within ERI polymorph of Cu-T underwent fast SCR reaction pathway with the assistance of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites at the intergrowth interfaces under standard SCR reaction conditions.

Although the structural details of translation are well studied, especially base-pairing, the role of nucleobase-specific inter-RNA stacking interactions is still not fully appreciated. Herein, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the stacking interactions between different RNA components in the available crystal structures of the bacterial ribosome caught at different stages of translation. Analysis of tRNA||rRNA stacking interactions reveals distinct stacking behaviour; both the A-and E-site tRNAs exhibit unique stacking patterns with 23S rRNA bases, while P-site tRNAs stack with 16S rRNA bases. Furthermore, E-site stacks exhibit diverse face orientations and ring topologies\u2015rare for inter-chain RNA interactions\u2015with higher average interaction energies than found in either A or P-site rRNA||tRNA stacks. This suggests that stacking may be essential for stabilizing tRNA progression to and through the E-site. Additionally, examination of mRNA||rRNA stacking interactions reveals other stacking geometries, which depend on the site of tRNA binding; A-site mRNA||rRNA stacks exhibit more frequent interactions with high stability, suggesting they play an essential role in mRNA positioning within the translational complex. Similarly, analysis of 16S rRNA||23S rRNA stacks highlights the importance of specific bases in maintaining the integrity of the translational complex by linking the two rRNAs. Furthermore, tRNA||mRNA stacking interactions exhibit distinct geometries and energetics at the E-site, indicating their significance during tRNA translocation and elimination. Overall, the analysis demonstrates that both A and E-sites display a broader and more diverse distribution of inter-RNA stacking interactions compared to the P-site. Notably, P-site stacking interactions are the least stable, suggesting their diminished role due to the need for interactions to be dominated by codon:anticodon base pairing to avoid misreading the mRNA. Stacking interactions in the active ribosome are not simply accidental byproducts of biochemistry but are invoked to compensate and support the integrity and dynamics of translation.

Arylazoisoxazoles, unlike analogous arylazopyrazoles, fail to draw much attention as MOST materials due to poor photoisomerization yields in both directions and utilization of UV light for trans-cis isomerization. With the para-thioalkyl substitution in the phenyl ring, we have demonstrated that the photoswitching yields in both directions can be drastically improved under visible light irradiations. Additionally, the long thioalkyl chain permitted solid-liquid phase transition followed by very high trans-cis photoisomerization and liquid-solid transition associated with high cis-trans photoconversion at various temperatures (10-35oC). The solid liquefication enabled the storage of the latent heat along with the isomerization energy in the charged state.

Using this strategy, we surveyed the literature and chemical databases for reactions that can be organized into CompACs that consume some chemical species as food to synthesize more autocatalysts. 226 CompACs and 44 Broad-sense CompACs were documented, and it was found that each of the 18 groups, lanthanoid series, and actinoid series in the periodic table has at least two CompACs. Our findings demonstrate that stoichiometric relationships underpinning abiotic autocatalysis could broadly exist across a range of geochemical and cosmochemical conditions, some of which are substantially different from the modern Earth. At the same time, the observation of some autocatalytic systems requires effective spatial or temporal separation between the food chemicals while allowing comproportionation and auxiliary reactions to proceed, which may explain why naturally occurring autocatalytic systems are not frequently observed. The collated CompACs and the conditions in which they might plausibly support complex, \u201clife-like\u201d chemical dynamics, can directly aid an expansive assessment of life\u2019s origins and provide a compendium of alternative hypotheses concerning false-positive biosignatures.", "date": "2023-08-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using haloketone chemistry as an alternative to maleimide chemistry, which carries reaction risks, we successfully produced site-specific antibody conjugates.

The resultant bispecific antibodies were rigorously evaluated, and surface plasmon resonance measurements and flow cytometry analyses confirmed that antigen binding remained intact. Additionally, the affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was retained after conjugation. Further cytotoxicity evaluation emphasized the pronounced activity of the generated bi-specific antibodies.

On the molecular scale, the copolymer is composed of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and a specifically synthesized diazocine (a bridged azobenzene) as photoswitchable cross-linking unit. iCVD enables in this connection a combination of both comonomers while preserving their chemical functionalities as well as the individual structure of the t-ZnO templates without pore clogging.

We identify and differentiate specific properties of the fabricated structures, originating from the switchable copolymer and the highly porous tetrapodal conformation, for a comprehensive description of the overall aero-structures.

Large-pore MOFs provide high water capacity, but their significant hysteresis between sorption and desorption makes them unsuitable for AWH. Co2Cl2(BTDD) is a noteworthy exception. This MOF has large, 2.2 nm diameter one-dimensional pores, and combines both record-high water capacity and minimal hysteresis, making it an excellent material for water capture in arid areas. Sorption reversibility in Co2Cl2(BTDD) has been attributed to continuous water uptake. However, the sharp adsorption/desorption in the isotherms supports a discontinuous first-order transition. Here we use molecular simulations to compute the water adsorption and desorption pathways and isotherms in a Co2Cl2(BTDD) model, to elucidate how does this MOF achieve reversibility despite its large pore size. The simulations reveal a multi-stage mechanism of discontinuous water uptake facilitated by spatial segregation of rows of hydrophilic metal sites bridged by ~1 nm hydrophobic ligands. The multi-stage mechanism breaks the barrier of capillary condensation into smaller, easier to surmount ones, resulting in a facile process despite the sharp density discontinuity between confined liquid and vapor. Our results explain why exchanging Co2+ for Ni2+ or Cl- for F- in the MOF have minimal impact on the condensation and desorption pressures. On the other hand, we predict that a decrease in hydrophilicity of the MOF vertices would strongly increase the hysteresis.

Solution state NMR experiments are straightforward to implement without an excessive amount of sample, while direct combination of spin relaxation data to MD simulations enables detailed interpretation of the dynamic landscapes of both peptide and membrane mimics. The interpretation of NMR data from transmembrane, peripheral, and tail anchored peptides indicate that peptides and detergent molecules do not rotate together as a rigid body.

Historically, exceptionality has been achieved through serendipity, but recently, machine learning (ML) and automated experimentation have been widely proposed to accelerate target identification and synthesis planning.  In this Perspective, we argue that the data-driven methods commonly used today are well-suited for optimization but not for realizing new exceptional materials or molecules. Finding such outliers should be possible using ML, but only by shifting away from using traditional ML approaches that tweak the composition, crystal structure, or reaction pathway. We highlight case studies of high-Tc oxide superconductors and superhard materials to demonstrate the challenges of ML-guided discovery and discuss the limitations of automation for this task. We then provide six recommendations for the development of ML methods capable of exceptional materials discovery: (i) Avoid the tyranny of the middle and focus on extrema; (ii) When data is limited, qualitative predictions that provide direction are more valuable than interpolative accuracy; (iii) Sample what can be made and how to make it, and defer optimization; (iv) Create room (and look) for the unexpected while pursuing your goal; (v) Try to fill-in-the-blanks of input and output space; (vi) Do not confuse human understanding with model interpretability.

This established that the N \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Se chalcogen bond distance is well within the sum of the van der Waals radii of Se and N and is sensitive to the electronic nature of the substituent. Thus N \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Se distances ranging from 2.2424(5)\u20132.4496(9) \u00c5 were observed with the shorter distances being observed in co-crystals of ebselen substituted with electron withdrawing groups. Associated with trends of the N \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Se distance as a function of the 4\u2032-substituent was lengthening of the internal Se\u2212N bond distance consistent with a significant covalent contribution to N \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Se chalcogen bonding in these derivatives.

A value of 0.31 was obtained implying a significant covalent contribution to N \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Se chalcogen bond. A similar result was obtained by an analysis of chalcogen bonded selenium containing molecules harvested from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database. The covalency quotient is extended to the general case for sigma-hole interactions including halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding, and we show that the covalent component of such interactions can be inferred from the lengthening of the donor bond. The degree of charge transfer in a smaller number of chalcogen bonded co-crystals of ebselen was established by measuring experimental electron density using high-resolution x-ray diffraction to more accurately measure the degree of electron transfer and hence covalency. This showed that in the most strongly bound systems, up to 1 electron worth of charge is transferred from the Lewis base to the Ch-bond donor, which again clearly points to significant covalent character.

High-resolution relaxometry (HRR) experiments can be performed on conventional high-field NMR magnets equipped with a sample shuttle. During the experiment, the sample shuttle transfers the sample between the high-field magnetic center and a chosen position in the stray field for relaxation during a variable delay, thus using the stray field as a variable field. As the relaxation delay occurs outside of the probe, HRR experiments cannot rely on the control of cross-relaxation pathways, which is standard in high-field relaxation pulse sequences. Thus, decay rates are not pure relaxation rates, which may impair a reliable description of the dynamics. Previously, we took into account cross-relaxation effects in the analysis of high- resolution relaxometry data by applying a correction factor to relaxometry decay rates in order to estimate relaxation rates. These correction factors were obtained from the iterative simulation of the relaxation decay while the sample lies outside of the probe and a preceding analysis of relaxation rates which relies on the approximation of a priori multi-exponential decays by mono-exponential functions. However, an analysis protocol matching directly experimental and simulated relaxometry decays should be more self consistent. Here, we introduce Matching INtensities for the Optimization of Timescales and Amplitudes of motions Under Relaxometry (MINOTAUR), a framework for the analysis of high-resolution relaxometry that takes as input the intensity decays at all fields. This approach uses the full relaxation matrix to calculate intensity decays, allowing complex relaxation pathways to be taken into account. Therefore, it eliminates the need for a correction of decay rates and for fitting multi-exponential decays with mono-exponential functions. The MINOTAUR software is designed as a flexible framework where relaxation matrices and spectral density functions corresponding to various models of motions can be defined on a case-by-case basis. The agreement with our previous analyses of protein side-chain dynamics from carbon-13 relaxation is excellent, while providing a more robust analysis tool. We expect MINOTAUR to become the tool of choice for the analysis of high-resolution relaxometry.

We have studied human serum albumin as a model protein, and report the interaction of 41 excipients (polysorbates, fatty alcohol ethoxylates, fatty acid ethoxylates, phospholipids, glucosides, amino acids, and others) in terms of the reduction of solvent accessible surface area of aggregation-prone regions, proposed as a mechanism of aggregation prevention. Polyoxyethylene sorbitan had the greatest degree of interaction with aggregation-prone regions, decreasing the solvent accessible surface area of APRs by 20.7 nm2. Physicochemical descriptors generated by Mordred are employed to probe the structure-activity relationship using partial least squares regression. A leave-one-out cross-validated model had a root mean square error of prediction of 4.1 nm2. Generally, longer molecules with a large number of alcohol-terminated PEG units tended to interact more, with qualitatively different protein interaction, wrapping around the protein, and would have a lesser protective effect on stability. Shorter or less ethoxylated compounds tend to form hemimicellar clusters at the protein surface. We propose that an improved design would feature many short chains of five to ten PEG units in many distinct branches and at least some hydrophobic content in the form of medium-length or greater aliphatic chains (i.e., six or more carbon atoms).

Whereas previous machine learning approaches to ATPS prediction used physicochemical properties of each solute as a descriptor, in this work, we show how to impute missing miscibility outcomes directly from an incomplete collection of pairwise miscibility experiments. We use graph-regularized logistic matrix factorization (GR-LMF) to learn a latent vector of each solution from (i) the observed entries in the pairwise miscibility matrix and (ii) a graph (nodes: solutes, edges: shared relationships) indicating the general category of the solute (i.e., polymer, surfactant, salt, protein). For an experimental dataset of the pairwise miscibility of 68 solutions from Peacock et al. [ACS Appl. Mater.

GR-LMF obviates the need for features of the solutions/solutes to impute missing miscibility outcomes, but it cannot predict the miscibility of a new solution without some observations of its miscibility with other solutions in the training data set.

In this study, we demonstrate a fully first-principles modelling approach to calculating the properties and thermoelectric figure of merit ZT and apply it to the orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases of GeS and GeSe. We predict a large ZTmax = 2.12 for n-doped Pnma GeSe at 900 K, which would make it a good match for p-type SnSe in a thermoelectric couple.

Oxide-based TEs are desirable due to their low cost, high chemical stability, and low toxicity, but are generally limited by a low electrical conductivity and high thermal conductivity. In this study, we employ a fully ab initio approach to study the electrical and thermal transport and thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of the oxide perovskites CaTiO3, SrTiO3 and BaTiO3.

In the case of Cryptococcus neoformans, a WHO fungal critical priority pathogen, infection results in antibodies targeting capsular glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). These antibodies produce diverse outcomes, however the molecular basis for antigen recognition remain unknown. To address this, we constructed a microarray containing twenty-six glycans representative of those found in highly virulent cryptococcal strains and utilised it to study sixteen monoclonal antibodies with distinct in vivo functions. Notably, protective and non-protective antibodies shared conserved reactivity to the M2 motif of GXM, irrespective of their origin from infection or vaccination. Interestingly, only two antibodies (12A1 and 18B7) exhibited diverse tri-valent GXM motif reactivity. Additionally, IgG subclass antibodies associated with protective responses showed cross-reactivity to at least two GXM motifs. The specificity and affinity of glycan binding were modulated by somatic mutation (12A1) and isotype switching (3E5 and 4H3), subsequently influencing their functional effects. This enhanced understanding of antibody binding epitopes was used to map the antigenic diversity of two Cryptococcus neoformans strains.

Breakthrough adsorption measurements reveal that while 2-butylammonium on a Br\u00f8nsted acid site is irreversibly adsorbed, it readily undergoes molecular desorption when exposed to a distinct alkylamine like 2-propylamine.

To this end, model Ni-Ga-based catalysts, with varying Ni:Ga ratios, were prepared by a surface organometallic chemistry approach. In situ differential pair distribution function (d-PDF) analysis revealed that catalyst activation in H2 leads to the formation of nanoparticles based on a Ni-Ga face-centered cubic (fcc) alloy along with a small quantity of GaOx. Structure refinements of the d-PDF data enabled to determine the amount of both alloyed Ga and GaOx species. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments confirmed the presence of alloyed Ga and GaOx and indicated that alloying with Ga affects the electronic structure of metallic Ni (viz. Ni-). Both the Ni:Ga ratio in the alloy and the quantity of GaOx are found to minimize methanation and to determine methanol formation rate and the resulting methanol selectivity. The highest formation rate and methanol selectivity are found for a Ni-Ga alloy having a Ni:Ga ratio of ~ 75:25 along with a small quantity of oxidized Ga species (0.14 molGaOx molNi-1). Furthermore, operando infrared spectroscopy experiments indicate that GaOx species play a role in the stabilization of for-mate surface intermediates, which are subsequently further hydrogenated to methoxy species and ultimately to methanol.

We find that only an approach that retains two thirds of the translational entropy of the adsorbate upon adsorption compares favorably with AIMD simulations. However, comparison to experimental measurements of Gibbs free energies of adsorption reported in the literature implies that we might not have captured the full complexity of alkane adsorption in our model. We expect that results in this work will help to develop a better understanding of alkane adsorption in zeolites, and that the provided data will serve as a benchmark for free energy calculations of alkane adsorption in zeolites in the future.

This mechanism was validated through studies comparing the proteomes of the standard HeLa and South African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos, where a >90% yolk proteome has historically challenged deep proteomics. The proteome was digested and barcoded before mixing with an isobarically tagged diluent proteome. This diluent carrier was prepared by depleting embryonic tissue of yolk platelets. Compared to the standard multiplexing carrier approach, YODEC more than doubled the detectable X. laevis proteome, allowing for the identification of ~4,200 proteins.

As proof of concept, we applied the strategy to quantify the proteome in cell clones that were isolated from the neurula-stage embryo by dissection or fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

The approach consists of transferring the high polarization of electron spins to nuclear spins via microwave irradiation at low temperatures (1.0-1.5 K) and moderate magnetic fields (3.3-7 T). The solid sample is then dissolved and transferred to an NMR spectrometer or MRI scanner for detection in the liquid state. Common dDNP protocols use direct hyperpolarization of13C spins reaching polarizations of >50% in ~1-2 hours. Alternatively, 1H spins are polarized before transferring their polarization to 13C spins using cross-polarization (CP), reaching similar polarization levels as direct DNP in only ~20 min. However, it relies on more complex instrumentation, requiring highly skilled personnel. Here, we explore an alternative route using 1H dDNP followed by an inline adiabatic magnetic field inversion in the liquid state during the transfer. 1H polarizations of >70% in the solid-state are obtained in ~5-10 min. As the hyperpolarized sample travels from the dDNP polarizer to the NMR spectrometer, it goes through a field inversion chamber, which causes 1H\u219213C polarization transfer. This transfer is made possible by the J-coupling between the heteronuclei, which mixes the Zeeman states at zero-field and causes an anti-level crossing.

Because of these unique properties, taken together with improved technologies for their biosynthetic production, lasso peptides are emerging as a designable scaffold for peptide-based therapeutic discovery and development. Although the defined structure of lasso peptides is recognized for its remarkable properties, the role of the motif for imparting bioactivity is less understood. For example, sungsanpin and ulleungdin are natural lasso peptides that similarly exhibit encouraging cell migration inhibitory activities in A549 lung carcinoma epithelial cells despite sharing only one-third sequence homology.

These studies demonstrate that the lasso motif is not a required feature to slow cancer cell migration, and more generally show that these non-threaded isomers can retain similar activity to the natural lasso peptide despite the differences in their overall structures.", "date": "2023-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Brute force computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations are commonly used to predict surface erosion by directly solving the Navier Stokes equations for the fluid and particle dynamics; however, these numerical approaches often require significant computational resources. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches using machine learning (ML) have shown immense promise for more efficient and accurate predictions to sidestep the computationally demanding CFD calculations. To this end, we have developed FLUID-GPT (Fast Learning to Understand and Investigate Dynamics with a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), a new hybrid ML architecture for accurately predicting particle trajectories and erosion on an industrial-scale steam header geometry. Our FLUID-GPT approach utilizes a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the first time to predict surface erosion using only information from five initial conditions: particle size, main-inlet speed, main-inlet pressure, sub-inlet speed, and sub-inlet pressure. Compared to the Long- and Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ML techniques used in previous work, our FLUID-GPT model is much more accurate (a 54% decrease in mean squared error) and efficient (70% less training time). Our work demonstrates that FLUID-GPT is an accurate and efficient ML approach for predicting time-series trajectories and their subsequent spatial erosion patterns in these complex dynamic systems.", "date": "2023-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Fluid Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, challenges arise when carrying out assessments of their time-dependent inhibitory properties as well as making correlations with values reported in the literature. Given the prominent focus on the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in oncology, and the diverse structures and binding modes of covalent EGFR inhibitors, this perspective seeks to explore various broadly relevant factors that arise in the measurement of kinetic parameters within this class of drugs. A review of several studies indicates that variable literature potency values require investigators to include appropriate reference molecules and consistent substrate conditions for experimental consistency and proper benchmarks. The impact on covalent inhibitor potency with respect to common buffer conditions and compound liquid handling is surveyed highlighting the importance of multiple experimental variables when conducting these assays. Additionally, when assessing the potency for inhibitor selectivity in targeting EGFR mutants over wild-type (WT), it is ideal to consider ratios of true potency due to the variable ATP substrate binding affinities.

Through the analysis of gelation kinetics, equilibrium swelling ratio and storage modulus, it was found that incorporation of the degradable units in both cases did not significantly impact the mechanical properties of the prepared gels compared to non-degradable controls. While both types of networks were found to readily degrade, either by thiol\u2013disulfide exchange or aminolysis, they produced degradation fragments of different topology, namely monodisperse linear chains in the case of degradable crosslinkers and branched polydisperse fragments in the case of degradable strands. A simple oxidation of thiols to disulfide bonds in air at 30 \u00baC was successfully used to repolymerise both types of degraded fragments back to solid networks through multiple degradation/regelation cycles. Interestingly, the branched, disperse fragments from degradation of the DOT-containing networks repolymerised more readily and produced networks with properties closer to the original material. This is in contrast to polyacrylate gels made by conventional free radical polymerisation (FRP) which do not degrade through cleavable crosslinks, only through cleavable strands.

The diboryl stabilized carbon-centered radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide highly substituted diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselec- tivity. In contrast to the trans-diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of cis-cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The cis-stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid frameworks. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one-pot VCP ring-opening, cy- cloaddition-oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mecha- nism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity.

Chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy can restrict tumor progression and repolarize the tumor microenvironment towards an anti-tumor milieu, improving clinical outcome in TNBC patients. The chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel had been shown to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), whereas inhibitors of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), whose expression is shared in immune regulatory and tumor cells, have been revealed to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. However, poor bioavailability and pharmacokinetic, off-target effects and hurdles in achieving therapeutic drug concentrations at the target tissue often limit the effectiveness of combination therapies. This work describes the development of novel biomimetic and carrier-free nanobinders (NB) loaded with both paclitaxel and the IDO1 inhibitor NLG919 in the form of bioresponsive prodrugs, and capable of hijacking human serum albumin (HSA). A fine tuning of the preparation conditions allowed to identify NB@5 as the best-performing prodrugs-based nanoformulation. Our data show that NB@5 effectively binds with HSA, demonstrating its protective role in the controlled release of drugs in vitro and suggesting that NB could exploit the protein as the endogenous vehicle for targeted delivery to the tumor site. Our study successfully demonstrates that the drugs encapsulated within the nanobinders are preferentially released under the altered redox conditions commonly found in the tumor microenvironment, thereby inducing cell death, promoting ICD, and inhibiting IDO1.

Compositions and chemical orderings of the surfaces with only one adsorbate under certain reaction condition are linked to their stablity, activity, and selectivity towards CO2RR and HER in our previous work. In fact, various coverages, types, and mixture of the adsorbates as well as state variable such as, temperature, pressure, applied potential, and chemical potential could have an impact on their stability, activity, and selectivity.

Gareth Williams; Fernando B Dias; Valery Kozhevnikov", "abstract": "The high luminescence efficiency of cyclometallated iridium(III) complexes, including those widely used in OLEDs, is typically attributed solely to the formally spin-forbidden phosphorescence process being facilitated by spin-orbit coupling with the Ir(III) centre. In this work, we provide unequivocal evidence that an additional mechanism can also participate, namely a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) pathway. TADF is well-established in other materials, including in purely organic compounds, but has never been observed in iridium complexes. Our findings may transform the design of iridium(III) complexes by including an additional, faster fluorescent radiative decay pathway. We discover it here in a new dinuclear complex, 1, of the form [Ir(N^C)2]2(u-L), where N^C represents a conventional N^C-cyclometallating ligand, and L is a bis-N^O-chelating bridging ligand derived from 4,6-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-pyrimidine. Complex 1 forms selectively as the rac diastereoisomer upon reaction of [Ir(N^C)2(u-Cl)]2 with H2L under mild conditions, with none of the alternative meso isomer being separated. Its structure is confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 displays deep-red luminescence in solution or in polystyrene film at room temperature (\u03bbem = 643 nm). Variable-temperature emission spectroscopy uncovers the TADF pathway, involving thermally activated re-population of S1 from T1. At room temperature, TADF reduces the photoluminescence lifetime in film by a factor of around 2, to 1 s.

In a collective effort from several Latin American countries, herein we introduce the first version of Latin American Natural Products Database (LANaPDB), a public compound collection that gathers the chemical information of NPs contained in diverse databases from this geographical region. The current version of LANaPD unifies the information from six countries and contains 12,959 chemical structures. The structural classification showed that the most abundant compounds are the terpenoids 63.2%, phenylpropanoids 18% and the alkaloids 11.8%. From the analysis of the distribution of properties of pharmaceutical interest, it was observed that many LaNaPDB compounds satisfy some drug-like rules of thumb for physicochemical properties. The concept of the chemical multiverse was employed to generate multiple chemical spaces from two different fingerprints and two dimensionality reduction techniques. Comparing LaNaPDB with FDA-approved drugs and the major open-access repository of NPs, COCONUT it was concluded that the chemical space covered by LaNaPDB completely overlaps with COCONUT and in some regions with FDA-approved drugs.

BrC composition, absorption properties, and their evolution are poorly represented in climate models, especially for aqueous media (e.g., fog, clouds). Aqueous phenomena such as clouds and fog are quite prevalent during wintertime in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). In this study, we examined the evolution of water-soluble BrC (WS-BrC) mass absorption efficiency at 365 nm (MAEWS-BrC-365) and chemical characteristics, viz., low-volatile fraction of organic carbon and water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) to water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) ratio (org-N/C) on diurnal scale and under varying aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and relative humidity (RH) conditions during wintertime in central IGP. Diurnally, highest MAEWS-BrC-365 was observed during late night and morning time and was coincided with enhanced WSON formation and relative abundance of low-volatile organics. The lower MAEWS-BrC-365 during the afternoon time was due to photochemical aging; whereas fresh WS-BrC emissions due to increased biomass burning and vehicular emissions activities caused lower MAEWS-BrC-365 values during evening and early night time. Further, we observed that MAEWS-BrC-365 and org-N/C ratio increased with decrease in ALWC and RH, signifying that drying of bulk aerosol particle and aqueous droplets would be potentially accelerating the formation of nitrogen containing organic chromophores resulting in enhancement in WS-BrC absorptivity. We also obtained that direct radiative forcing of WS-BrC relative to that of EC was ~19% during wintertime at Kanpur and ~40% of this contribution was in UV-region.

In this work, we address this issue by relying on a quantitative and comparative electrochemical study of low-valence crystalline MnOx cathodes in a range of aqueous electrolytes, with a primary focus on spinel Mn3O4. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the oxidation state of Mn in MnOx structures as well as their degree of crystallinity have little impact on the electrochemical reactivity, all MnOx being fully converted into soluble Mn2+ upon discharge. We further reveal that this electrodissolution mechanism is affected by Mn3O4 dismutation in the most acidic electrolytes. Accordingly, the true thermodynamics and kinetics of Mn3O4 are only accessible at mildly acidic to neutral pH values. In addition, we confirm the phase transformation of Mn3O4 to Mn5O8 upon galvanostatic oxidation, and demonstrate that this transformation only proceeds in Mn2+-free electrolytes, since otherwise amorphous MnO2 electrodeposits on top of Mn3O4. Finally, we conclude that regardless of the starting MnOx material, after the first discharge or a first charge/discharge cycle, subsequent charge/discharge cycles rely exclusively on a reversible proton-coupled electrodeposition of amorphous MnO2.", "date": "2023-08-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

They offer benefits such as firm sealing without leakage, easy and rapid application, and the provision of mechanical support and flexibility. However, their in vivo durability is often compromised by excessive swelling and unforeseen degradation, which presents a challenge for widespread use. In this study, we addressed the durability issues of the adhesive hydrogels by incorporating Acrylamide Polyethylene glycol N-hydroxysuccinimide (PEG-NHS) moieties (max 2 wt%) into hydrogels based on hydroxy ethyl acrylamide (HEAam). The results showed that the addition of PEG-NHS significantly enhanced the adhesion performance, achieving up to 2-fold improvement on various soft tissues including skin, trachea, heart, lung, liver, and kidney. We further observed that the addition of PEG-NHS into adhesive hydrogel network improved their intrinsic mechanical properties.

These hydrogels also exhibited improved durability under the enzymatic and oxidative biodegradation induced conditions without causing any toxicity to the cells. \n\nFor a clinical point of view, we found that PEG-NHS-based hydrogels effectively addressed tracheomalacia, a condition characterized by inadequate mechanical support of the airway due to weak/malacic cartilage rings.

We design and synthesize linear-associative-linear (LAL) triblock copolymers; the middle block is an associative polymer carrying amide groups that form double hydrogen bonding, and the end blocks aggregate to hard glassy domains that effectively act as physical crosslinks. The amide groups do not aggregate to form nanoscale clusters and only slow polymer dynamics without changing the shape of the linear viscoelastic spectra; this enables molecular control over energy dissipation by varying the fraction of the associative groups.

To address the fundamental challenge of describing broad conformational ensembles, we developed a model system of peptidomimetics comprised of polar glycine and hydrophobic N-butylglycine to characterize using a suite of analytical techniques, including replica exchange molecular dynamics atomistic simulations and liquid chromatography coupled to ion mobility spectrometry, which allowed us to distinguish the conformations of compositionally identical model sequences.

The complete exchange-correlation kernel is applied, including the direct contribution of the field-dependent basis functions and the reorthonormalization contribution from the perturbed overlap matrix. Additionally, the finite nucleus model is available for the electron-nucleus potential and the vector potential throughout. Efficiency is ensured by the diagonal local approximation to the unitary decoupling transformation (DLU) in X2C as well as the (multipole-accelerated) resolution of the identity approximation for the Coulomb term (MARI-J, RI-J) and the seminumerical exchange approximation. Errors introduced by these approximations are assessed and found to be clearly negligible. The applicability of our implementation to large-scale calculations is demonstrated for for a tin pincer-type system as well as low-valent tin and lead complexes. Here, the calculation of the Sn NMR shifts for the pincer-type ligand with about 2400 basis functions requires less than one hour for hybrid density functionals. Further, the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the nucleus-independent chemical shifts and the corresponding ring currents of all-metal aromatic systems is studied.

This has restricted the applicability of ML-derived BDE predictions, particularly for molecules of medicinal relevance, since the heteroatoms S, Cl, F, P, Br, and I are commonly found in approved pharmaceuticals. Atmospherically and environmentally relevant molecules containing multiple halogen atoms have been similarly inaccessible. In this study, we considerably expand the size, elemental composition, and bond types of an extensive BDE database and train a new ML BDE model that includes C, H, N, O, S, Cl, F, P, Br, and I. We curate a new quantum chemical dataset of 531,244 unique zero-point energy inclusive homolytic dissociations of organic compounds.

Generative models have emerged as powerful tools for traversing data manifolds comprised of images, sounds, and text, and offer an opportunity to dramatically improve the drug discovery and design process. To create generative optimization methods that are more useful than brute-force molecular generation and filtering via virtual screening, we propose that four integrated features are necessary: large, quantitative datasets of molecular structure and activity, an invertible vector representation of realistic accessible molecules, smooth and differentiable regressors that quantify uncertainty, and algorithms to simultaneously optimize properties of interest. Over the course of 12 months, Terray has collected a dataset of 2 billion quantitative binding measurements, which directly motivates multi-parameter generative optimization of molecules conditioned on this data. To this end, we present COATI, a pre-trained, multi-modal encoder-decoder model of druglike chemical space. COATI is constructed without any human biasing of features, using contrastive learning from text and 3D representations of molecules to allow downstream use with structural models. We demonstrate that COATI possesses many of the desired properties of a universal molecular embedding: fixed-dimension, invertibility, autoencoding, accurate regression, and low computation cost. Finally, we present a novel metadynamics algorithm for generative optimization using a small subset of our proprietary data collected for a model protein, Carbonic Anhydrase, designing molecules that satisfy the multi-parameter optimization task of potency, solubility, and druglikeness.

Increasing yield stress also leads to increasing the yield surface height and the solid plug in the central region due to which decreasing in the flow rate.

In this contribution, the identification and size determination of an isolated RNA virus with an atomic force microscope (AFM) in combination with conventional fluorescence microscopy is presented. Despite all the advantages of AFM for imaging individual viruses, discrimination by chemical composition and reliable differentiation of morphologically similar structures at the single particle level is hardly possible with the current state of the art. An effective method for identifying single virus particles based on their chemical structure is specific labeling and subsequent conventional fluorescence microscopic investigation. However, this method lacks morphologic information, and the resolution is generally above the virus size, impeding size determination. As a result, labeled hollow particles or viral fragments cannot be distinguished from intact particles of a similar size. \nIn our experiments, the goal was to characterize and investigate the morphology, particularly the height of a model virus, here SARS-CoV-2 as an example, and unambiguously differentiate it from other sample components such as debris. The first step was topography mapping of inactivated virus samples using AFM. In the second step, the RNA-containing core and the spike proteins on the virus surface were labeled, and conventional fluorescence images were correlated with the topographic height images of the same particles, providing an accurate information about the actual stages of the viruses. As a main achievement, the experiments allow identification of individual intact SARS-CoV-2 particles and a distinction between viral fragments and potential false staining. The height range of virus particles under our specific inactivation conditions with paraformaldehyde treatment could be determined to be 60-110 nm. Following our results, pre-selection and distinction of viral particles from other sample components will be feasible by morphological characteristics alone, with a precision comparable to staining methods, prior to further specific identification. In general, our correlative approach combining information from scanning probe and conventional fluorescence microscopy can be applied to other virus strains as well, taken that virus-specific antibodies are known. \n", "date": "2023-08-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Imaging; Microscopy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

However, current methods face challenges in rigorously interpreting experimental data and ensuring thermodynamic consistency between successive pKa values.  This study puts forward a protonation ensemble framework to address these limitations by modeling the full space of possible protonation microstates.  Within this framework, we derive rigorous definitions connecting experimental macro-pKas to underlying micro-pKa equilibria.  Under this new framework, we develop Uni-pKa, an accurate and reliable pKa predictor. Uni-pKa first pretrains on over 1 million predicted pKas from ChemBL to learn expressive molecular representations.  It is then finetuned on experimental datasets that enforce consistency with the protonation ensemble definitions.  The high-quality experimental pKa datasets are fitted to this framework by recovering underlying microstates from macro-pKas. Modeling the complete ensemble enables rigorous interpretation of macro-pKa data, and inherently preserves thermodynamic consistency, improving the prediction accuracy of Uni-pKa.  Experiments demonstrate that Uni-pKa achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods. This novel protonation ensemble approach significantly advances machine learning for pKa prediction and molecular property modeling.

Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of SenB, the first known Se-glycosyltransferase that was recently found to be involved in the biosynthesis of the Se-containing metabolite selenoneine. SenB catalyzes C\u2013Se bond formation using selenophosphate and an activated uridine diphosphate sugar as a Se and glycosyl donor, respectively, making it the first known selenosugar synthase and only one of four bona fide C\u2013Se bond-forming enzymes discovered to date. Our crystal structure, determined to 2.25 \u00c5 resolution, reveals that SenB is a type B glycosyltransferase, displaying the prototypical fold with two globular Rossmann-like domains and a catalytic interdomain cleft. By employing complementary structural biology techniques, we find that SenB undergoes both local and global substrate-induced conformational changes, demonstrating a significant increase in \u03b1-helicity and a transition to a more compact conformation.

Using this principle, we introduce compound similarity network (CSN) as a novel data mining strategy to identify degradation pathways using MS data collected in LC-MS based non-targeted analysis of complex wastewater samples. We demonstrated this strategy by non-targeted identifying potential degradation products of organic pollutants in leather industrial wastewater during laboratory-scale activated carbon adsorption (ACD) and ozonation processes. Using LC-MS based non-targeted analysis and the CSN strategy, we putatively identified 4324 compounds in the untreated leather industrial wastewater, 3246 after ACD, and 3777 after ACD/ozonation. We located 145 potential degradation pathways of organic pollutants in the ACD/ozonation process using CSN and validated 9 pathways with 21 commercial standard compounds.

However, this approach has not yet been realised, presumably due to the difficulty of implementing a solution process to convert a robust and complex solid (lignocellulose) with a barely soluble and stable gas (CO2). Herein, we present the complete oxidative valorisation of lignocellulose coupled to the reduction of low concentration CO2 through a three-step fractionation-photocatalysis-electrolysis process. Lignocellulose from white birch wood was first pre-treated using an acidic dioxane solution to generate predominantly cellulosic- and lignin-based fractions. The solid cellulosic-based fraction was solubilised using cellulase (a cellulose depolymerising enzyme), followed by photocatalytic oxidation to formate with concomitant reduction of CO2 to syngas (a gas mixture of CO and H2) using a phosphonate-containing cobalt(II) bis(terpyridine) catalyst immobilised onto TiO2 nanoparticles. Photocatalysis generated 27.9\u00b12.0 \u00b5molCO gTiO2\u20131 (TONCO = 2.8\u00b10.2; 16% CO selectivity) and 147.7\u00b112.0 \u00b5molformate gTiO2\u20131 after 24 h solar light irradiation under 20 vol% CO2 in N2.

There is consensus that post-translational modification (PTM) of side chains has a large impact on the biomineralization process. Thus, it is imperative to understand the precise mechanisms that dictate the formation of SiO2 from R5 peptide, including the effects of PTM on peptide aggregation and peptide-surface adsorption. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the aggregation of R5 dimer with multiple PTMs, with the presence of different ions in solution. Since this system has strong interactions with deep metastable states, we use parallel bias metadynamics with partitioned families to efficiently sample the different states of the system. We find that peptide aggregation is a prerequisite for biomineralization. We observe that the electrostatic interactions are essential in the R5 dimer aggregation; for wild type R5 that only has positively charged residues, phosphate ions HPO42- in the solution form a bridge between two peptides and are essential for peptide aggregation. Alternatively, the post translational modification phosphorylation, which renders neutral serine residues negative, enables R5 to aggregate without phosphate ion. The extent of phosphorylation and location of phosphorylated residues on R5 peptide results in different behavior and extent of aggregation - the aggregation trend of R5 peptide that we observe is in line with SiO2 precipitation observed in previous experimental studies, proving that peptide aggregation is a prerequisite for biomineralization.

In these mechanisms, the reactant and the product states are connected by a transition state, in the simplest cases. In general, however, there  are many steps that constitute a reaction pathway. Therefore, starting from the reactant, the reactant and the product states are connected through intermediates and transition states, in an alternating order. Generally, the reactivity of a given pathway is determined by the overall barrier height. Sometimes, a comparison becomes necessary for a given step with another possible step that can be realized within the same mechanism, and in this case as well the step with the lowest-lying transition state is preferred. However, there are some exceptions in the order of these states. There are states known as pre-reaction complexes that reside between a reactant, or an intermediate, and a transition state. The effect of the pre-reaction complex on the reaction mechanism is generally not discussed, and the barrier heights become the main considerations, as usual.  In this work, a mathematical model that allows obtaining the rate constant of a pathway without a pre-reaction complex, and that of a pathway with a pre-reaction complex was described. The model was built using quantum perturbation theory and quantum time-correlation functions.

This method is termed the time-dependent adaptive density-guided approach (TD-ADGA) and is a method for constructing a PES on the fly during a dynamics simulation. This is achieved by acquisition of new single point (SP) calculations and refitting of the PES depending on the need of the dynamics. The TD-ADGA is a further development of the adaptive density-guided approach (ADGA) for PES construction where the placement of SPs is guided by the density of the nuclear wave function. In TD-ADGA, the ADGA framework has been integrated into the time-propagation of the time-dependent nuclear wave function and we use the reduced one-mode density of this wave function to guide when and where new SPs are placed. The PES is thus extended or updated if the wave function moves into new areas or if a certain area becomes more important. We here derive equations for the reduced one-mode density for the time-dependent Hartree (TDH) method and for multi configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) methods, but the TD-ADGA can be used with any time-dependent wave function method as long as a density is available. The TD-ADGA method has been investigated on molecular systems containing single- and double-minimum potentials and on single- and multi-mode systems. We explore different approaches to handle the fact that the TD-ADGA involves a PES that changes during the computation and show how results can be obtained that are in very good agreement with results obtained by using an accurate reference PES. Dynamics with TD-ADGA is essentially a black box procedure, where only the initialization of the system and how to compute SPs must be provided. The TD-ADGA thus makes it easier to carry out quantum molecular dynamics and the quasi-direct framework opens up the possibility to compute quantum dynamics accurately for larger molecular systems.", "date": "2023-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this review, we aim to clarify the reported mechanical properties of state-of-the-art tough hydrogels by providing a comprehensive library of fracture and mechanical property data. First, we briefly discuss modes of energy dissipation at work in tough hydrogels, which we use to categorize the individual data sets. Next, we introduce common methods for mechanical characterization of high-performance hydrogels, followed by a detailed analysis of the current materials and their (fracture) mechanical properties. Finally, we consider several current applications, compare high-performance hydrogels with natural materials, and discuss promising future opportunities of tough hydrogels.", "date": "2023-08-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Hydrogels; Polymer scaffolds; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Notably, we successfully detected and quantified cis-2-OOH-3-(1,2-dioxane)-SQ in the human skin. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism governing the formation of these compounds remained elusive. Therefore, in the current study, we set to determine the reaction\u2019s mechanism. To this end, a comprehensive analysis of the precise conditions involved in the onset and propagation of this conversion was carried out by oxidizing total SQ-OOHs under different conditions, including singlet oxygen (1O2), thermal, and photoinduced oxidations monitored by quantifying the generated 2-OOH-3-(1,2-dioxane)-SQ using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Radical intermediates were thoroughly investigated using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) with the aid of spin traps and radical references. Moreover, calculations of SQ-OOHs\u2019 electrostatic charges were performed on Spartan 18 software. We found that the reaction is ideally induced and favored under photooxidation in the presence of 3O2 in hexane, and that superoxide radical (O2\u2022\u2212) is the first key intermediate in this mechanism, whereas peroxyl radicals were the major species observed throughout the oxidation. Chemical calculations provided an explanation for the targeting of tertiary SQ-OOHs by this reaction and gave further evidence on the proposed heterolytic cleavage initiating the reaction. The novel oxidation mechanism suggested herein offers new insights into understanding lipid secondary oxidation and is a promising finding for further studying lipid cyclic peroxides in general.", "date": "2023-08-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Addition of noble metals to mixed oxides is a common practice to promote H2 dissociation but it inadvertently reduces methanol selectivity by simultaneously promoting CO formation. Herein, we show an alternative approach of doping Co in ZrO2 to create a separate site for adsorption of CO2 and counter the poisoning effect. We synthesized a ternary oxide of Co and In doped ZrO2 (Co-In-ZrO2), which showed higher methanol productivity and selectivity (65%) as compared to individual binary oxides of Co-ZrO2 and In-ZrO2 (29% and 44%). Detailed analysis showed that Co site was responsible for CO2 and formate adsorption while neighboring In atom was responsible for H2 dissociation to promote the hydrogenation of adsorbed CO2 to methanol over Co site. The cooperative effect reduced the activation energy for methanol formation to 80 kJ mol-1 over Co-In-ZrO2 in comparison to 139 and 116 kJ mol-1 over binary oxides. Moreover, CO formation was also suppressed leading to increased methanol selectivity. This cooperative effect was not unique to Co-In system but was also be extended to Co-Zn and Co-Ga doped ZrO2 catalysts.

To reach target properties efficiently, these platforms are increasingly paired with intelligent experimental design. When solving optimization problems, Bayesian-based optimizers are often chosen for their ability to solve a global optimum while allowing both exploration and exploitation. However, for problems with complex constraints that require achieving multiple conflicting objectives rapidly, Bayesian-based optimizers are less effective, and this necessitates the development of new algorithms. Here, we devise a hybrid Evolution-Guided Bayesian Optimization (EGBO) algorithm that introduces selection pressure to decrease sampling wastage; this not only solves the Pareto Front (PF) efficiently but also achieves better coverage of the PF while limiting sampling in the unfeasible space.  The algorithm was developed together with a custom self-driving lab for seed-mediated silver nanoparticle synthesis, targeting 3 objectives (1) optical properties, (2) fast reaction, and (3) minimal seed usage alongside complex constraints. In a parallel experimental campaign in our self-driving lab, we evaluate the performance of EGBO against the q-Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement optimizer proposed by Daulton et al. and show 14% better performance with 15 runs of experimentation and 72 datapoints.

In this sense, the contact angle is a key parameter for the assessment of surface chemistry but its quantification in pores is challenging and requires a combination of various experimental techniques. This work demonstrates that combining water adsorption and intrusion measurements allows for the determination of the effective contact angle of adsorbed water on the pore walls for wetting, partial wetting, and non-wetting situations.

This technique allows for the measurement of the changes that ions cause in both the diffusive dynamics and the vibrations of the hydrogen-bond structure of water.

The slowing down of the dynamics of the water molecules in the solvation shell of each ion was found to depend on its charge density at infinite dilution conditions and on its position in the Hofmeister series at higher concentrations. It is also observed that all cations weaken the hydrogen bond structure of the solution and that this weakening depends only on the size of the cation.

In silico mass spectrometry databases have become mainstays in lipidomics experiments; however, 13C-TrEnDi modified PC and PE species have altered m/z and fragmentation patterns from their native counterparts. To build a database of 13C-TrEnDi modified PC and PE species, a lipid extract from nutritional yeast was derivatized and fragmentation spectra of modified PC and PE species were mined using diagnostic fragmentation filtering by searching 13C-TrEnDi modified headgroups with m/z 199 (PC) and 202 (PE). Identities of 25 PC and 10 PE species were assigned after comparing to predicted masses from the Lipid Maps Structure Database with no false positive identifications observed; neutral lipids could still be annotated after derivatization. Collision energies from 16 to 52 eV were examined, resulting in three additional class-specific fragment ions emerging, as well as a combined sn1/sn2 fragment ion, allowing sum-composition level annotations to be assigned. Using the Lipid Blast templates, a NIST-compatible 13C-TrEnDi database was produced based on fragmentation spectra observed at 36 eV and tested on HEK 293T cell lipid extracts, identifying 47 PC and 24 PE species, representing a 1.8-fold and 2.2-fold increase in annotations, respectively.

The most common weedkiller glyphosate (GLY) has been used exponentially worldwide, leading to the emergence of GLY-resistant weeds. This has prompted a need for effective alternatives, leading to the development and increasing use of phosphinothricin, also known as glufosinate (GLUF). As the agricultural application of GLUF rises, the potential for long-term residual exposure in the food chain increases, highlighting the need for improved analytical strategies for its detection, as well as its main breakdown product 3-(methylphosphinico)propionic acid (MPPA). Chemical derivatization strategies have been developed to improve the detection of GLUF and MPPA via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS) analyses. In this article, we expand the use of trimethylation enhancement using diazomethane (TrEnDi) to quantitatively derivatize these analytes into permethylated GLUF ([GLUFTr]+) and MPPA ([MPPATr+H]+). Comparing [GLUFTr]+ and [MPPATr+H]+ to underivatized counterparts, TrEnDi yields 2.8-fold and 1.7-fold improvements in reversed-phase chromatographic retention, respectively, while MS-based sensitivity is enhanced 4.1-fold and 11.0-fold, respectively. Initial analytical improvements were performed on commercial standards; however, successful analyte derivatization (with >99% yields) was also demonstrated on a commercial herbicide solution imparting consistent analytical enhancements. To investigate the benefits of TrEnDi in a bona fide agricultural scenario, the quantities of GLUF and MPPA were determined in aqueous extracts from field-grown canola plants before and after TrEnDi derivatization. In their underivatized forms, GLUF and MPPA were undetectable in all field samples whereas [GLUFTr]+ and [MPPATr+H]+ were readily quantifiable using the same analysis conditions. Our results demonstrate that TrEnDi continues to be a useful tool to enhance the analytical characteristics of organic molecules that are traditionally difficult to detect.", "date": "2023-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The redox behaviors of uranium species impact these processes, but use of electrochemical methods to drive reactions of well-defined precursors and to obtain molecular insights into the outcomes has received less attention than it deserves. Here, we show that electro-reduction of the uranyl ion (UO22+) can be used to promote stepwise functionalization of the typically unreactive oxo groups with exogenous triphenylborane (BPh3) serving as a moderate electrophile. Parallel electroanalytical, spectrochemical, and chemical reactivity studies, supported by spectroscopic findings and structural data from X-ray diffraction analysis on key reduced and borylated products, demonstrate that our electrochemical approach largely avoids undesired cross reactions and disproportionation pathways; these conventionally impact the multicomponent systems needed for uranyl functionalization chemistry. Joint computational studies have been used to map the mechanistic pathways involved in this U\u2013O activation, and to quantify free energy changes associated with key reactions.

This leads to some fundamental differences between the two. We uncover here the broken electron-hole symmetry in non-alternant NGRs as one fundamental difference closely related to distorted Dirac points (cones) and their diradical open-shell character. We also show by higher level calculations beyond common DFT that the alternant series of peri-acenes (bisanthene, peri-tetracene, peri-pentacene, \u2026 etc.), contrary to opposite reports in the literature, have clearly closed singlet ground states, in contrast to their non-alternant isomers based on Stone-Wales (SW) defects. This is experimentally supported by sub-molecularly resolved STM images. The misconceptions in the literature are due to insufficient correlation. For non-alternant NGRs/GNRs with antiaromatic rings the driving force for open-shell states and distorted Dirac points (involving localized electrons and delocalized holes) is antiaromaticity, which is a sufficient but not always necessary condition. This is in juxtaposition to the aromaticity of the alternant isomers with closed shell states. Thus, in both cases sublattice problems lead to open shell magnetic states; ferromagnetic in cases of sublattice imbalance (e.g. triangulenes), antiferromagnetic for non-sublattice cases (e.g. SW3x2, SW4x2), and non-magnetic (diamagnetic) for balanced sublattices (e.g. AGNRs). Obviously, similar results are expected for larger NGRs/GNRs obtained by concatenation of such SW-motifs.", "date": "2023-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we employ high resolution electron microscopy and spectroscopies to investigate the nanoscale origins and impact on performance of intragranular cracking (within primary crystals) in Ni-rich LTMOs. We find that intragranular cracking is widespread in charged specimens early in cycle life, but uncommon in discharged samples even after cycling. The distribution of intragranular cracking is highly inhomogeneous. We conclude that intragranular cracking is caused by local stresses that can have several independent sources: neighbouring particle anisotropic expansion/contraction, Li- and TM-inhomogeneities at the primary and secondary particle levels and interfacing of electrochemically active and inactive phases. Our results suggest that intragranular cracks can manifest at different points of life of the cathode and can potentially lead to capacity fade and impedance rise of LTMO cathodes through plane gliding and particle detachment that lead to exposure of new surfaces to the electrolyte and loss of electrical contact.

The roots for the common grain sorghum produce multiple small molecules that are released via root exudates into the soil to compete with other plants.  Sorgoleone is one such compound, which suppresses weed growth near sorghum by acting as a quinone analog and interferes with photosynthesis.  Since sorghum also grows photosynthetically, and may be susceptible to sorgoleone action if present in tissues above ground, it is essential for sorgoleone to be excreted efficiently.  However, since the P450 enzymes that synthesize sorgoleone are intracellular, the release mechanism for sorgoleone remain unclear. In this study, we conducted an in silico assessment for sorgoleone and its precursors to passively permeate biological membranes. To facilitate accurate simulation, CHARMM parameters were newly optimized for sorgoleone and its precursors.  These parameters were used to conduct one microsecond of unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to compare the permeability of sorgoleone with its precursors molecules. We find that interleaflet transfer is maximized for sorgoleone, suggesting that the precursor molecules may remain in the same leaflet for access by biosynthetic P450 enzymes. Since no sorgoleone was extracted during unbiased simulations, we compute a permeability coefficient using the inhomogeneous solubility diffusion model. The requisite free energy and diffusivity profiles for sorgleone through a sorghum plasma membrane model were determined through Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling (REUS) simulations.  The REUS calculations highlight that any soluble sorgleone would quickly insert into a lipid bilayer, and would readily transit. When sorgleone forms aggregates in root exudate as indicated by our equilibrium simulations, aggregate formation would lower the effective concentration in aqueous solution, creating a concentration gradient that would facilitate passive transport.  This suggests that sorgoleone synthesis occurs within sorghum root cells and that sorgoleone is exuded by permeating through the cell membrane without the need for a transport protein.

The rapid collection of the full elemental mass spectra promotes non-target approaches, fast imaging as well as inquiries of particle stoichiometry. However, one shortcoming often associated with ICP-ToF-MS is a lack of detection power due to lower duty cycles relative to sequentially operating mass analysers. The sensitivity of ICP-ToF-MS can be increased using two strategies, which are detailed in this study. First, instead of analysing full mass spectra, elements in the low and high mass range were excluded from analysis using a Bradbury-Nielsen gate. The resulting restricted mass range was acquired up to 5 times faster increasing duty cycles and sensitivity accordingly. Second, isotopes of polyisotopic elements recorded simultaneously were accumulated to increase signal to noise ratios.\nIn a proof of concept, we applied SP ICP-ToF-MS for the first time for the characterisation of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) which contained Gd and Yb. Both signal amplification strategies were combined and the consequences for detection limits and signal to noise ratios were considered and compared to a standard method. Sensitivities were increased up to factor 27 when accumulating all Gd and Yb isotopes at 177 kHz, and size detection limits decreased by a factor of approximately 3. Improved figures of merit promoted more accurate investigations of UCNPs, which were characterised regarding size distributions and composition.\nAs second application, we demonstrated the utility of the described strategies in LA-ICP-ToF-MS. Mo and Se were targeted as relatively rare elements in rat brain tissue. Increased acquisition frequencies of 185 kHz and isotope accumulation resulted into drastically improved signal to noise ratios and enabled the mapping of both while still considering relevant neuroanatomical elements such as Fe and Zn.\n", "date": "2023-08-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Apparatus; Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite this growing interest in these nanometer-sized ions, a simple conceptual extension of the Hofmeister series towards nanoions has not been achieved, because an extrapolation of the one-dimensional surface charge density scale does not lead to the superchaotropic regime. In this work, we discuss a generic model that is broadly appli- cable to ions of nearly shperical shape and thus includes polyoxometallates and boron clusters. We present a qualitative classification scheme, in which the ion size appears as a second dimension. Ions of different size but same charge density differ in their bulk solvation free energy. As the ions grow bigger at constant surface charge density, they become more stable in solution, but the adsorption behavior is still governed by the surface charge density.

In this study, we present a novel approach to further enhance the properties of porous polymer membranes emerging from MOFs through crosslinking of the organic linker molecules and subsequent metal-atom removal. To ensure reproducibility of the multi-step synthesis process and high quality of the resulting polymeric membranes, we automated the process and followed a machine learning optimization approach. The high-quality MOF-thin films (SURMOFs) were prepared in a layer-by-layer fashion directly on gold-coated porous alumina substrates. This direct synthesis proved crucial to preserve the structural integrity of the membranes and thus avoiding defect formation caused by a substrate-transfer process, which is usually required when advanced materials are used to fabricate a membrane. The initial SURMOF membrane exhibits moderate gas separation performance, once crosslinked, its gas selectivity could be significantly enhanced although with the compromise of lower gas permeance. Interestingly, once we removed the metal centers and thereby converted the SURMOF into a purely organic polymeric membrane, the membrane gas permeance could be restored almost to its initial condition while preserving the enhanced selectivities. In particular, the resulting polymeric membrane outperforms most commercially available polymer membranes for H2 /CO2 gas separation.

However, our comparison of the supercapacitor performance of a porous carbon and a state-of-the-art MOF highlights a number of challenges for MOF supercapacitors, including low potential windows, limited cycle lifetimes, and poor rate performances. We propose that the well-defined and tuneable chemical structures of MOFs present a number of avenues for improving supercapacitor performance. We also discuss recent experimental and theoretical work on charging mechanisms in MOF-based supercapacitors, and find a need for more studies that elucidate the charge storage and\ndegradation mechanisms. Ultimately, a deeper understanding will lead to design principles for realising improved supercapacitor energy storage devices.", "date": "2023-08-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The reaction involves the replacement of oxide ions with fluoride ions as well as the insertion of fluoride ions at interstitial sites. From the characterization via powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld analysis as well as automated electron diffraction tomography (ADT) it is deduced that the fluorination results in a symmetry lowering from I4/mmm (139) to monoclinic C2/c (15) with an expansion perpendicular to the perovskite layers and a strong tilting of the octahedra in the ab plane. Disorder of the anions on the apical and the interstitial sites seems to be favored. The most stable configuration for the anion ordering is estimated based on an evaluation of bond distances from the ADT measurements via bond valence sums (BVSs). The observed disordering of the anions in the oxyfluoride results in changes of the optical properties and thus shows that the topochemical anion modification can present a viable route to alter optical properties. Partial densities of states (PDOSs) obtained from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a bandgap modification upon fluoride-ion introduction which originates from the presence of the oxide anions on the interstitial sites.

This drive for material innovation continues to captivate a burgeoning community of early-career researchers with backgrounds in chemistry and material science. However, new to the field, they are often equipped only with the insight provided by the original Bychkov-Rashba model. Furthermore, daunted by the tight-binding perspective on the non-vanishing orbital angular momentum (OAM), they struggle to accurately account for the atomic spin-orbit iteration (SOI) in the formation of GSS. To address these challenges and equip young chemists with better-suited tools, this review aims to provide a more intuitive perspective on atomic interactions (orbital hybridization), structure symmetry, and atomic SOI in the formation of GSS. In pursuit of this goal, the review explores the Bychkov-Rashba model, its advantages, and limitations. Subsequently, it introduces the orbital framework, wherein GSS is modulated by atomic SOI and the interplay of OAM with the surface electrostatic field. Given the explicit dependence of both these factors on OAM, the review examines why OAM is typically quenched in crystal structures and how chemical bonds involving different orbital types can lead to its non-zero values in the presence of inversion symmetry breaking. Finally, with this chemistry-focused perspective, the review examines the rise of GSS in selected examples in selected materials.", "date": "2023-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study, we evaluated how four characteristics of influent wastewaters (electrolyte pH, composition, sulfide concentration, and buffer strength) affect sulfide removal metrics (sulfide removal rate, sulfide removal efficiency) and sulfate production metrics (sulfate production rate, sulfate production selectivity). We identified that electrolyte pH (3x differences in sulfide removal rate within the studied pH range) and sulfide concentration (16x difference in removal rate) were the most influential factors for electrochemical sulfide removal. Sulfate production was most sensitive to buffer strength (6x difference in sulfate production rate) and insensitive to electrolyte composition. Together, these results provide recommendations for the design of wastewater treatment trains and the feasibility of applying electrochemical methods to varying sulfide-containing wastewaters.

Within the field of batteries, redox-active organic materials (ROMs) such as quinones have received increased attention as promising electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. However, experimental determination of the crystal structure of intermediate species formed during the discharge/charge cycle can often be challenging. Incomplete X-ray diffraction patterns can also lead to difficulties in crystal structure determination for ROMs used in batteries. Use of a semiempirical electronic structure method for CSP helps to avoid force field reparameterization for different species, sometimes with complex electronic structure, formed during battery operation. It also helps to significantly lower the computational cost compared to the widely used density functional theory (DFT). The goal of this study is to systematically investigate the ability of a DFT-based semiempirical method, third-order density functional tight-binding (DFTB3), to predict the most stable crystal structures of organic molecules with different kinds of intermolecular interactions ranging from hydrogen bonding to -stacking. Here, DFTB3 in conjunction with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, as implemented in the CALYPSO software, is also used to predict the most stable crystal structures of selected quinones relevant to organic batteries.

However, a challenge associated with PROTACs is the difficult optimisation required to identify new degraders, thus the development of high-throughput platforms for their synthesis and biological evaluation is required. In this study, we establish an ultra high-throughput experimentation (ultraHTE) platform for PROTAC synthesis, followed by direct addition of the crude reaction mixtures to cellular degradation assays without any purification. This \u2018Direct-to-Biology\u2019 (D2B) approach was validated, then exem-plified in a medicinal chemistry campaign to identify novel BRD4 PROTACs from a BRD4-binding scaffold previously unexplored for targeted protein degradation. Using the D2B platform, the synthesis of over 600 PROTACs was carried out in a 1536-well plate and subsequent biological evaluation of these candidates was performed by a single scientist in less than one month, to identify a set of picomolar BRD4 degraders. Due to its ability to hugely accelerate the optimisation of new degraders, we anticipate our platform to transform the synthesis and testing of PROTACs.", "date": "2023-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Pharmaceutical Industry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The proposed workflow is designed to tackle two key challenges for bias-free mechanistic explorations on large databases of catalysts: (1) automated exploration of the chemical space around each catalyst with unique structural and chemical features and (2) automated analysis of the resulting large chemical datasets. To address these challenges we have extended the application of our previously developed ReNeGate method for bias-free reactivity exploration and implemented an automated analysis procedure to identify the classes of reactivity patterns within specific catalyst groups. Our procedure applied to an extended series of representative Mn(I) pincer complexes revealed correlations between structural and reactive features pointing to new channels for catalyst transformation under the reaction conditions. Such an automated high-throughput virtual screening of systematically generated hypothetical catalyst datasets opens new opportunities for the design of high performance catalysts as well as an accelerated method for expert bias-free high-throughput in silico reactivity exploration.

In particular, redox-active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently emerged as promising electrodes due to their structural versatility, insolubility in electrolyte, and modulable porosity. In this Feature article, we review some recent strategies to improve the energy density, power density and cycling stability of COF-based electrodes from the perspective of molecular design and electrode optimisation. Some other aspects such as scalability and recycling are also discussed. Finally, the main challenges to improve their performance and future prospects for COF organic batteries are highlighted.

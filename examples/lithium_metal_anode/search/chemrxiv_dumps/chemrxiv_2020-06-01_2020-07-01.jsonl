Liao\u2019s photoacid (1) represents the archetype of mPAHs, and is being widely used on account of its unique capability to change the acidity of aqueous solutions reversibly. The behavior of 1 in water, however, still remains poorly understood. Herein, we provide in-dept insights on the thermodynamics and kinetics of 1 in water through a series of comparative 1H NMR and UV-Vis studies and relative modelling. Under dark conditions, we quantified a three-component equilibrium system where the dissociation (Ka) of the open protonated form (MCH) is followed by isomerization (Kc) of the open deprotonated form (MC) to the closed spiropyran form (SP) \u2013 i.e., in the absence of light, the ground state acidity can be expressed as KaGS = Ka(1+Kc). On the other hand, under powerful and continuous light irradiation we were able to assess, for the first time experimentally, the dissociation constant (KaMS) of the protonated metastable state (cis-MCH). In addition, we found that thermal ring-opening of SP is always rate-determining regardless of pH, whereas hydrolysis is reminiscent of what is found for Schiff bases. The proposed methodology is general, and it was applied to other two compounds bearing a shorter (ethyl, 2) and a longer (butyl, 3) alkyl-1-sulfonate bridge. We found that the pKa remains constant, whereas both pKc and pKaMS linearly increase with the length of the alkyl bridge. Importantly, all results are consistent with a four-component model cycle, which describes perfectly the full dynamics of proton release/uptake of 1\u20123 in water. The superior hydrolytic stability and water solubility of compound 3, together with its relatively high pKaGS (low Kc), allowed us to achieve fully reversible jumps of 2.5 pH units over 18 consecutive cycles (6 hours).", "date": "2020-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Photochemistry (Org.); Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Tailoring channelrhodopsins for such applications includes the tuning of the absorption maximum. In order to establish rational design and to obtain a desired spectral shift, a basic understanding of the absorption spectrum is required. We have studied the chimera C1C2 as a representative of this protein family and the first member with an available crystal structure. For this purpose, we sampled the conformations of C1C2 using QM/MM molecular dynamics, and subjected the resulting snapshots of the trajectory to excitation energy calculations using ADC(2) and simplified TD-DFT.

The \u03b2-ionone ring rotation was identified as another important contributor. Yet the most important factor was found to be the bond length alternation and bond order alternation that were linearly correlated to the absorption maximum by up to 62 % and 82 %, respectively.

Although many policies and regulations on air quality have been promulgated worldwide over the past decades, airborne pollution still negatively affects health and therefore the life-style of human beings. One of the strategies to challenge this problem might be reducing the amount of airborne pollutant by mineralising them via photoinduced reactions. Photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous pollutants <i>via</i> titanium dioxide is one of the most investigated solar photochemical reactions. In this research work, by means of a green sol-gel procedure, we have coupled titania to graphene (0.5 and 1.0 wt%) aiming to increase the solar photocatalytic activity of the produced hybrid materials. The photocatalytic reactions were assessed by monitoring the removal of nitrogen oxides and two different volatile organic compounds (benzene and isopropanol). Photocatalytic mechanism was investigated by means of EPR\nspin trapping experiments.Our results highlight the exceptional characteristics of the TiO2/graphene hybrid material (1.0 wt% graphene), and its suitability for multi-purpose applications in the field of environmental remediation. Compared to unmodified titania, the hybrid material with 1.0 wt% graphene shows a clear enhancement in the photocatalytic removal of those hazardous pollutants \u2013 corresponding to more than twice the photocatalytic degradation rate. In addition, the same material is highly stable and shows fully recyclability over repeated tests. Hybrid titania-graphene materials could thus be exploited to grant a safer outdoor and indoor environments, having a beneficial impact on public health and thus on the quality of our lives.", "date": "2020-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Carbon-based Materials; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These are lightweight, human-readable, and easy to import into databases or statistical software. ProtyQuant reads validated pepXML from proteomic workflows such as the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), which makes it compatible with many commercial and free search engines. For protein inference and quantification, a modified version of the PIPQ program (He et al. 2016) was integrated. In contrast to simple spectral-counting, PIPQ sums up peptide probabilities. For assigning peptides to proteins, three algorithms are available: Multiple Counting, Equal Division, and Linear Programming. The accumulated peptide probabilities (app) are used for both tasks, protein probability estimation, and quantification. ProtyQuant was tested using a reference dataset for label-free shotgun proteomics, obtained from different concentrations of 48 human UPS proteins spiked into yeast lysate. Compared to ProteinProphet, ProtyQuant detected up to 126 (15%) more proteins in the mixture, applying an equal false positive rate (FPR). Using the app values for label-free quantification showed suitable sensitivity and linearity. Strikingly, the app values represent a realistic measure of \u2018Protein Presence,\u2019 an integral concept of protein probability and quantity.

The accuracy of solid state density functional theory (DFT) calculations is often required, but hundreds or more structures can be present in the low energy region of interest, so that the associated computational costs are prohibitive. Here, we apply statistical machine learning to predict expensive hybrid functional DFT (PBE0) calculations using a multi-fidelity approach to re-evalute the energies of crystal structures predicted with an inexpensive force field. The method uses an autoregressive Gaussian process, making use of less expensive GGA DFT (PBE) calculations to bridge the gap between the force field and PBE0 energies. The method is benchmarked on the crystal structure landscapes of three small, hydrogen bonding organic molecules and shown to produce accurate predictions of energies and crystal structure ranking using small numbers of the most expensive calculations; the PBE0 energies can be predicted with errors of less than 1 kJ/mol with between 4.2-6.8% of the cost of the full calculations. As the model that we have developed is probabilistic, we discuss how the uncertainties in predicted energies impact on assessment of the energetic ranking of crystal structures.", "date": "2020-06-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics; Self-Assembly; Structure; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To fill in this gap, we performed in silico analyses of immune system protein interactome network, single-cell RNA sequencing of human tissues, and artificial neural networks to reveal potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing against COVID-19. As results, the high-confidence protein interactome network was conformed by 1,588 nodes between immune system proteins and human proteins physically associated with SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, we screened all these nodes in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells according to the Alexandria Project, finding 75 potential therapeutic targets significantly overexpressed (Z score > 2) in nasal goblet secretory cells, lung type II pneumocytes, and ileal absorptive enterocytes of patients with several immunopathologies. Then, we performed fully connected deep neural networks to find the best multitask classification model to predict the activity of 10,672 drugs for 25 of the 75 aforementioned proteins. On one hand, we obtained 45 approved drugs, 16 compounds under investigation, and 35 experimental compounds with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROCs) for 15 immune system proteins.

However, the thermoelectric efficiency of flagship oxide materials remains comparatively low, and most materials only reach the maximum figure of merit, <i>ZT</i>, at very high temperatures, above those where the majority of low-grade industrial heat is emitted. It is important to identify thermoelectrics with high conversion efficiency closer to room temperature, particularly for lower-temperature applications such as in domestic heating, consumer electronics and electric vehicles. One of the main factors limiting the efficiency of oxide thermoelectrics is their large lattice thermal conductivities, which has inspired research into more structurally complex materials. In this study, we apply first-principles modelling to assess the low-temperature polymorph of Bi<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (\u03b1-Bi<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) as a potential thermoelectric material, due to its complex crystal structure, which should suppress phonon transport, and the presence of Bi <i>p</i> and Sn <i>s</i> states in the conduction band, which should yield high electrical conductivity when donor (<i>n</i>) doped.

An interaction between the dimethylamine end of toremifene and residues Q954 and N955 in heptad repeat 1 (HR1) perturbs the structure, causing a shift from what is normally a long, helical region to short helices connected by unstructured regions. Additionally, we found a strong interaction between toremifene and the methyltransferase non-structural protein (NSP) 14, which could be inhibitory to viral replication via its active site.

Herein we study the effects of materials synthesis, applied mechanical stress (37-520 MPa), varying temperature (20-100\u00b0C), and guest encapsulation on the frequency-dependent dielectric response (4 Hz to 1 MHz) and AC conductivity of the HKUST-1 MOF.

This is especially useful for detecting implant associated infection and elucidating how the local biochemical environment changes during infection and treatment. To acquire one pixel in the image, a focused X-ray beam irradiates a small region of scintillators coated on the implant and the X-ray excited optical luminescence spectrum is modulated by indicator dyes to provide a chemically sensitive measurement with low background. Scanning the X-ray beam across the implant surface generates high spatial resolution chemical measurements. Two associated challenges are 1) to make robust sensors that can be implanted in tissue to measure local chemical concentrations and specifically for metal orthopedic implants, and 2) to conformally coat the implant surface with scintillators and pH indicator dyes in order to make measurements over a large area. Previously, we have physically pressed or glued a pH-sensitive hydrogel sensor to the surface of an implant, but this is impractical for imaging over large irregular device areas such as an orthopedic plate with holes and edges. Herein we describe a chemically sensitive and biocompatible XELI sensor material containing scintillator particles (Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu) and a pH sensitive hydrogel coating using a roughened epoxy coating. A two-part commercial grade epoxy film was tested and found to make the coating of pH sensitive layer adhere better to the titanium surface. Sugar and salt particles were added to the surface of the epoxy as it cured to create a roughened surface and increase surface area. On this roughened surface, a secondary layer of diacrylated polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel, containing a pH sensitive dye, was polymerized. This layer was found to adhere well to the epoxy-coated implant unlike other previously tested polymer surfaces which delaminated when exposed to water or humidity. The focused X-ray beam enabled 0.5 mm spatial resolution through 1 cm thick tissue. The pH sensor coated orthopedic plate was imaged with XELCI through tissue with different pH to acquire a calibration curve. The plates were also imaged through tissue with low pH region from a Staphylococcus aureus biofilm grown on one section.

Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural\ncompounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations\nresulted in five potential inhibitors, including 3 natural compounds and two\navailable HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise\nmethod, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five\ncompounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, <i>cannabisin </i>A and <i>isoacteoside</i>, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, <i>darunavir</i>, exhibit large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro,\nwhich is larger than that of <b>13b</b>, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro\ninhibitor recently reported. The binding free energy largely arises from van\nder Waals (vdW) interaction. We also found that Glu166 form H-bonds to all the\ninhibitors. Replacing Glu166 by an alanine residue leads to ~ 2.0 kcal/mol\ndecreases in the affinity of <i>darunavir </i>to\nSARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Our results could contribute to the development of potentials\ndrugs inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. </p>", "date": "2020-06-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the main hallmark of AD is\nthe deposition of amyloid plaques\nconsisting of the \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide, transition metal ions are also\nknown to play a significant role in disease pathology by expediting the\nformation of neurotoxic soluble \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) oligomers, reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS), and oxidative stress.

However, the MAE for both TPSSh and DFT+U are dominated by a single material - if this is excluded from the set then DFT+U achieves chemical accuracy.

In particular, layered two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) halide perovskites have shown non-linear optoelectronic properties. Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is commonly used to screen for non-centrosymmetric and ferroelectric materials, however, SHG  measurements of perovskites are complicated by their intense multiphoton photoluminescence (mPL) which can be mistaken for SHG signal. In this work, we introduce multidimensional harmonic generation as a method to eliminate the complications caused by mPL. By scanning and correlating both excitation and emission frequencies, we un-ambiguously assess whether a material supports SHG by examining if an emission feature scales as twice the excitation frequency. Careful multidimensional harmonic generation measurements of a series of n=2 and n=3 RP perovskites reveal that, contrary to previous belief, n-butylammonium (BA) RP perovskites display no SHG, thus they have inversion symmetry; but RP perovskites with phenylethylammonium (PEA) and 2-thiophenemethylammonium (TPMA) spacer cations display SHG. Multidimensional harmonic generation is also able to confirm the SHG and thus non-centrosymmetry of a recently reported ferroelectric RP perovskite even in the presence of an obscuring mPL background. This work establishes multidimensional harmonic generation as a definitive method to measure the SHG properties of materials and demonstrates that tuning organic cations can allow the design of new non-centrosymmetric or even ferroelectric RP perovskites.<br />", "date": "2020-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being administered for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treatment. China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an anti-influenza drug, Arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports indicate that Arbidol could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with Arbidol is found superior to Lopinavir-Ritonavir or Favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19. In the SARS-CoV-2, Arbidol acts upon interfering in virus binding to host cells. However, the detailed understanding of Arbidol induced inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the Arbidol-induced SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion inhibition and propose a model of inhibition. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that Arbidol binds and stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with RBD than ACE2. Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between RBD and ACE2 in the Arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that Arbidol could generate favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we propose that the binding of Arbidol induced structural rigidity in the virus glycoprotein resulting in restriction of the conformational rearrangements associated with membrane attachment and virus entry.Further, key residues of RBD and ACE2 that interacted with Arbidol were identified, opening the doors for the development of therapeutic strategies and higher efficacy Arbidol derivatives or lead drug candidates.</p>", "date": "2020-06-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Solid electrolyte can act as a barrier for unwanted physical and chemical decomposition that lead to unstable electrodeposition (e.g. dendrite and filament growth). The formation and growth of filaments is tied to unique chemo-mechanical properties that exists at buried solid|solid interfaces. Herein,<i> in situ</i> tomography of Li|LLZO|Li cells is carried out to track morphological transformations in Li metal electrodes and buried solid|solid interfaces during stripping and plating processes. Optimized experimental parameters provide high resolution, high contrast reconstructions that enable lithium metal visualization. Machine learning and image processing tools are combined to quantify changes in lithium metal during stripping and plating. The analysis enables quantifying local current densities and pore size distribution in lithium metal during cycling experiments. Hotspots in lithium metal are correlated with microstructural anisotropy in the solid electrolyte. Modeling studies show large heterogeneity in transport and mechanical properties of electrolyte at the electrode|electrolyte interfaces. Regions with lower effective properties (transport and mechanical) are nuclei for failure. Failure is attributed to microstructural heterogeneities in the solid electrolyte that lead to high local stress and flux distributions.", "date": "2020-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The addition of solubilizing addends to the fullerene cage results in a large number of isomers, which are generally employed as isomeric mixtures.

The opportunities presented by single isomer, and particularly single enantiomer, fullerenes in organic electronic materials and devices are poorly understood. Here we separate 10 pairs of enantiomers from the 19 structural isomers of bis[60]PCBM, using them to elucidate important chiroptical structure-property relationships and demonstrating their application to a single enantiomer circularly polarized (CP) light detecting device. We find that larger chiroptical responses occur through inherent chirality of the fullerene cage and particularly through transitions with low CT character. When used in a single enantiomer organic field-effect transistor device, we demonstrate the potential to discriminate CP light with a fast light response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (<i>g<sub>ph</sub></i> = \u00b11.35).

Such de novo design of peptide sequences has the potential to create assembled structure in lipid membrane such as novel nanopores, which would also be applicable in molecular transporter between inside and outside of lipid membrane.", "date": "2020-06-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recently, laser post-ionization (MALDI-2) has been developed for increased ion yield and sensitivity for lipid IMS. However, the dependence of MALDI-2 performance on the various lipid classes is largely unknown. To understand the effect of the applied matrix on MALDI-2 analysis of lipids, samples including an equimolar lipid standard mixture, various tissue homogenates, and intact rat kidney tissue sections were analyzed using the following matrices: \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), 2\u2019,5\u2019-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHA), 2\u2019,5\u2019-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and norharmane (NOR). Lipid signal enhancement of protonated species using MALDI-2 technology varied based on the matrix used. Although signal improvements were observed for all matrices, the most dramatic effects using MALDI-2 were observed using NOR and DHB. For lipid standards analyzed by MALDI-2, NOR provided the broadest coverage, enabling the detection of all 13 protonated standards, including non-polar lipids, whereas DHB gave less coverage but gave the highest signal increase for those lipids recorded. With respect to tissue homogenates and rat kidney tissue, mass spectra were compared and showed that the number and intensity of neutral lipids tentatively identified with MALDI-2 using NOR increased significantly (e.g. 5-fold intensity increase for triacylglycerol).  In the cases of DHB with MALDI-2, the number of protonated lipids identified from tissue homogenates doubled with 152 on average compared to 76 with MALDI alone. High spatial resolution imaging (~20 \u00b5m) of rat kidney tissue showed similar results using DHB with 125 lipids tentatively identified from MALDI-2 spectra versus just 72 using standard MALDI. From the four matrices tested, NOR provided the greatest increase in sensitivity for neutral lipids (triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, cholesterol ester) and DHB provided the highest overall number of lipids detected using MALDI-2 technology. </p>", "date": "2020-06-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

LAMP leads to generation of products of increasing length over time. These products containing multiple loops are conventionally called cauliflower structures. Existing literature on LAMP provides extremely limited understanding of progression of cascades of reactions involved in the reaction and it is believed that cauliflower structures of increasing length constitute a majority of the product formed in LAMP. This study presents a first of its kind stoichiometric and pseudo kinetic model to comprehend LAMP reactions in deeper depth by (i) classifying LAMP reaction products into uniquely identifiable categories, (ii) generating a condensed reaction network to depict millions of interconnected reactions occurring during LAMP, and (iii) elucidating the pathways for amplicon generation. Despite the inherent limitations of conventional stoichiometric modelling for polymerization type reactions (the network rapidly becomes too large and intractable), our model provides new theoretical understanding of the LAMP reaction pathway. The model shows that while longer length products are formed, it is the smaller length recycle amplicons that contribute more towards the exponential increase in the amount of double stranded DNA. Prediction of concentration of different types of LAMP amplicons will also contribute substantially towards informing design of probe-based assays. </p>", "date": "2020-06-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Generally, trajectory methods are not applied to electronic structure calculations, since they predict that the electrons in a ground state, real, molecular wavefunction are motionless. However, a spin-dependent momentum can be recovered from the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation. Therefore, we developed new, spin-dependent equations of motion for the quantum hydrodynamics of electrons in molecular orbitals. The equations are based on a Lagrange multiplier, which constrains each electron to an isosurface of its molecular orbital, as required by the spin-dependent momentum. Both the momentum and the Lagrange multiplier provide a unique perspective on the properties of electrons in molecules.", "date": "2020-06-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have the potential to treat water from polluted sources to mitigate the scarcity of potable water. However, the performance demands on these materials in practical applications has not been studied in detail. This is but one of the challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of ENMs for water treatment. The emerging fit-for-purpose paradigm which encourages water treatment at the point-of-use (POU) or point-of-entry (POE) could lower the barrier for the use of ENMs in water technology by incorporating smaller, decentralized ENM-based treatment systems. This work develops a bottom-up and top-down modeling framework to facilitate the design of nanoporous membrane-based sorbents, a promising class of ENMs, for POU and POE water treatment applications. Langmuir isotherm and membrane structure-property calculations provide the multiscale link between molecular properties, including affinity, saturation capacity, and pore size, device design decisions, including membrane area and thickness, and system design decisions, including sorbent mass and number of parallel modules. The framework predicts that for lead contaminants, existing materials are near molecular and systems limitations; improvements in the properties of adsorptive materials to treat lead will yield few benefits for POU and POE treatment systems. Moreover, the framework provides dimensionless formulas that apply to all adsorptive systems that exhibit (near) equilibrium behavior as an easy-to-use tool for the broader membrane science and environmental engineering communities to assess the feasibility of emerging materials to meet process demands. A case study regarding materials for arsenic removal demonstrates how to apply the modeling framework to calculate material properties targets and predict system performance for an arbitrary single-solute adsorption process. Finally, these dimensionless models are used to identify three distinct regions of relative performance between batch and semi-continuous processes. These results give caution to applying scale-up heuristics outside their valid region, which can lead to under- or over-design during bottom-up studies. The presented modeling framework is a crucial step to fully optimize engineered nanomaterials across material, device, and system scales.", "date": "2020-06-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Environmental Science; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Water Purification", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we examine by means of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) computations the possibility of bond formation and molecular growth upon ionization of Van der Waals clusters of pure HCN clusters, and mixed clusters of HCN and HCCH, both of which are widespread in the interstellar medium. Ionization of van der Waals clusters can potentially lead to growth in low temperature and low-density environments. Our results show, that upon ionization of the pure HCN clusters, strongly bound stable structures are formed that contain N\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7H bonds, and growth beyond pairwise HCN molecules is seen only in a small percentage of cases.  In contrast, mixed clusters, where HCCH is preferentially ionized over HCN, can grow up to 3 or 4 units long with new carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen covalent bonds.  Moreover, cyclic molecules formed, such as the radical cation of pyridine, which is a prebiotic molecule. The results presented here are significant as they provide a feasible pathway for molecular growth of small organic molecules containing both carbon and nitrogen in cold and relatively denser environments such as in dense molecular clouds but closer to the photo-dissociation regions, and protoplanetary disks.

DEL-based hit discovery involves affinity selection of the library against a protein of interest, whereby compounds retained by the target are subsequently identified by next-generation sequencing of the corresponding DNA tags. When analyzing the resulting data, one typically assumes that sequencing output (i.e. read counts) is proportional to the binding affinity of a given compound, thus enabling hit prioritization and elucidation of any underlying structure-activity relationships (SAR). This assumption, though, tends to be severely confounded by a number of factors, including variable reaction yields, presence of incomplete products masquerading as their intended counterparts, and sequencing noise. In practice, these confounders are often ignored, potentially contributing to low hit validation rates, and universally leading to loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we have developed a method for comprehensively denoising DEL selection outputs. Our method, dubbed \"deldenoiser\", is based on sparse learning and leverages inputs that are commonly available within a DEL generation and screening workflow. Using simulated and publicly available DEL affinity selection data, we show that \"deldenoiser\" is not only able to recover and rank true binders much more robustly than read count-based approaches, but also that it yields scores which accurately capture the underlying SAR.

However, water exchange between bulk and buried hydration sites can be slow compared to simulation timescales, thus leading to the inefficient sampling of the locations of water.  This can pose problems for free energy calculations for computer-aided drug design. Here, we apply a hybrid method that combines nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) simulations and molecular dynamics (MD) to enhance sampling of water in specific areas of a system, such as the binding site of a protein. Our approach uses NCMC to gradually remove interactions between a selected water molecule and its environment, then translates the water to a new region, before turning the interactions back on. This approach of gradual removal of interactions, followed by a move and then reintroduction of interactions, allows the environment relax in response to the proposed water translation, improving acceptance of moves and thereby accelerating water exchange and sampling. We validate this approach on several test systems including the ligand-bound MUP-1 and HSP90 proteins with buried crystallographic waters removed.  We show that our NCMC/MD method enhances water sampling relative to normal MD when applied to these systems. Thus, this approach provides a strategy to improve water sampling in molecular simulations which may be useful in practical applications in drug discovery and biomolecular design.</div>", "date": "2020-06-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm combined with a multi-task neural network (MTNN) surrogate model for expensive docking simulations and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for rollouts, is used to sample the exhaustive SMILES space of candidate biomolecules. Using Vina scores as target objective to measure binding of therapeutic molecules to either the isolated spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 at its host receptor region or to the S-protein:Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interface, we generate several (~100's) new biomolecules that outperform FDA (~1000\u2019s) and non-FDA biomolecules (~million) from existing databases. A transfer learning strategy is deployed to retrain the MTNN surrogate as new candidate molecules are identified - this iterative search and retrain strategy is shown to accelerate the discovery of desired candidates. We perform detailed analysis using Lipinski's rules and also analyze the structural similarities between the various top performing candidates. We spilt the molecules using a molecular fragmenting algorithm and identify the common chemical fragments and patterns \u2013 such information is important to identify moieties that are responsible for improved performance. Although we focus on therapeutic biomolecules, our AI strategy is broadly applicable for accelerated design and discovery of any chemical molecules with user-desired functionality.", "date": "2020-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Ligand Design", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Research is still ongoing to develop effective antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, to address the current outbreak, development of natural inhibitors as a prophylactic measure is an attractive strategy due to their natural diversity and safety. Phytochemicals that target viral entry (Spike glycoprotein) and replication (3CLPro) are lucrative in terms of both economy and health for the treatment of the deadly virus. In this context, this work explored natural compounds from Indian medicinal plants as potential inhibitors for containing the spread SARS-CoV-2. The phytochemicals were rationally screened from 55 Indian medicinal plants in our previous work. All atom 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed using high performance computing for 8 top scoring rationally screened phytochemicals from <i>Withania somnifera</i> and <i>Azadirachta indica </i>and two repurposed drugs against the spike glycoprotein and the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. MM/PBSA, Principal component analysis and hydrogen bond occupancy were analysed to characterize protein\u2013ligand interactions and to find the binding free energy. Biological pathway enrichment analysis was also carried out to observe the therapeutic efficacy of these phytochemicals. The results revealed that Withanolide R (-141.96 KJ/Mol) and 2,3-Dihydrowithaferin A (-87.60 KJ/Mol) were with the lowest relative free energy of binding for main protease and the spike proteins respectively. It was also observed that the phytochemicals exhibit a remarkable multipotency with the ability to modulate various human biological pathways especially pathways in cancer. Conclusively we suggest that these compounds need further detailed <i>in vivo</i> experimental evaluation and clinical validation for implementation as potent therapeutic agent for combating SARS-CoV-2.</p>", "date": "2020-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Environmental biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The surface excess charge layer (SECL) in droplets has often been associated with distinct chemistry. Using molecular simulations for droplets with Na+ and Cl- ions we have found that this layer is \u2248 1.5\u22121.7 nm thick and depending on the droplet size it includes 33%-55% of the total number of ions. Here, we examine the e\ufb00ect of droplet size and nature of ions in the structure of SECL by using molecular dynamics. We \ufb01nd that in the presence of simple ions the thickness of the surface excess charge layer is invariant not only with respect to droplet size but also with respect to the nature of the simple ions and it is not sensitive to \ufb01ne details of different force \ufb01elds used in our simulations.</div><div> In the presence of  macroions the SECL may extend to 2.0. nm. For the same droplet size, iodide and model H3O+ ions show considerably higher concentration than the sodium and chloride ions. In nano-drops, the SECL does not have the highest concentration of ions. We identify the maximum ion concentration region that may overlap with SECL in nano-drops.  We also \ufb01nd that the differences in the average water dipole orientation in the presence of cations and anions in this layer are re\ufb02ected in the charge distributions. Within the surface charge layer, the number of hydrogen bonds reduces gradually relative to the droplet interior where the number of hydrogen bonds is on the average 2.9 for droplets of diameter < 4 nm and 3.5 for larger droplets. The decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds from the interior to the surface is less pronounced in larger droplets. In droplets with diameter < 4 nm and high concentration of ions the charge of the ions is not compensated only by the solvent polarization charge but by the total charge that also includes the other free charge. This \ufb01nding shows exceptions to the commonly made assumption that the solvent compensates the charge of the ions in solvents with very high dielectric constant. The study provides molecular insight into the bi-layer droplet structure assumed in the equilibrium partitioning model (EPM) of C. Enke and assesses critical   assumptions of the Iribarne-Thomson model for the ion-evaporation mechanism.  We suggest the extension of the bi-layer droplet structure in EPM to include the maximum ion concentration region that may not coincide with SECL in nanodrops.

While molecular forms of carbyne have been extensively characterized, the structural nature is hard to determine for many linear carbon wires that are made in-situ during pulling experiments. Here, we show that cumulenes and polyynes have distinctively different low-bias conductance profiles under axial torsion. We analyze the change of the electronic structure, Landauer transmission, and ballistic current density of the three types of closed-shell molecular carbynes as a function of the torsion angle. Both polyynic, odd-carbon cumulenic,<i> </i>and even-carbon cumulenic carbon wires exhibit helical frontier molecular orbitals when the end-groups are not in a co-planar configuration. This helical conjugation effect gives rise to strong ring current patterns around the linear wires. Only the transmission of even-carbon polyynic wires follows the well-known cosine-squared law with axial torsion that is also seen in biphenyl-type systems. Notably, the transmission of even-carbon cumulenic carbon wires rises with axial torsion from co-planar towards perpendicular orientation of the end-groups. The three distinct transmission profiles of polyynes, odd-carbon cumulenes,<i> </i>and even-carbon cumulenes may allow for experimental identification of the structural nature of linear carbon wires. Their different electron transport properties under axial torsion furthermore underline that, in the molecular limit of carbyne, three different subclasses of linear carbon wires exist.</p>", "date": "2020-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanodevices; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study investigates the relationship between structural density and mechanical and thermal performance of boehmite nanofiber-polymethylsilsesquioxane composite aerogels. Tri-functional organosilicon alkoxide, methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), was added to a boehmite nanofibers aqueous dispersion, the colloidal nanofibers were coated and bonded with polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ), to produce transparent to translucent wet gel monoliths. Low bulk density composite aerogel panels were prepared by CO2 supercritical drying of the wet gel monoliths before their mechanical properties and thermal conductivity were investigated. As the amount of the MTMS in the starting composition increased, the fibrillar monolith skeleton coated with PMSQ thickened. Correspondingly, the Young's modulus of the monoliths increased, and the thermal conductivity decreased. When the amount of MTMS added was small, it was possible to deform the translucent panels by uniaxial compression. After 30 % uniaxial compression of the panel, the thermal conductivity was suppressed by 19 %. The thermal conductivity response to compressive deformation of fibrous aerogels, after fabrication, may inform future insulation material development.", "date": "2020-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Materials Processing; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Thermal Conductors and Insulators", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Like many other small molecules, it suffers from intrinsic poor aqueous solubility, posing significant hurdles at various levels for its preclinical development and clinical translation. Herein, we report a poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) based BT44 micellar nanoformulation with ultra-high drug loading capacity of 47 wt.%. The BT44 nanoformulation was comprehensively characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryo-transmission/scanning electron microscopy (cryo-TEM/SEM). The DSC, XRD and redispersion studies collectively confirmed that the BT44 formulation can be stored as a lyophilized powder and can be redispersed upon need. The DLS suggested that the redispersed formulation is suitable for parenteral administration (Dh \u2248 70 nm). The cryo-TEM measurements showed the presence of worm-like structures both in plain polymer and BT44 formulation. The BT44 formulation retained biological activity in immortalized cells and in cultured dopamine neurons. The micellar nanoformulation of BT44 exhibited improved absorption (after subcutaneous injection) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and no acute toxic effects in mice were observed. In conclusion, herein, we have developed an ultra-high BT44 loaded aqueous injectable nanoformulation, which can be used to pave way for its preclinical and clinical development for the management of neurodegenerative disorders.

Until recently, applications of biocatalytic deuteration systems have been restricted by their requirement for a supply of super-stoichiometric quantities of a specifically labelled 2H-pre-cursor, which can be both costly to purchase and complex to prepare. Overcoming this hurdle, we have demonstrated a novel and easy to use H2-driven biocatalytic platform for the incorporation of 2H-atoms across a number of molecular functional groups. By combining the biocatalytic deuteration catalyst with enzymes capable of reductive amination, we synthesised a suite of multiply isotopically labelled amino acids from low-cost isotopic precursors, such as 2H2O and 15NH4+. Notably, this strategy enables the introduction of a 15N-label, 2H-label, and chiral centre all in a single-step, and gives rise to amino acid isotopologues on a half gram scale for use directly in the preparation of isotopically labelled proteins. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach in the workflow of protein NMR chemists, we prepared L-[\u03b1-2H,15N, \u03b2-13C]-alanine and integrated it into a large (> 400 kDa) heat-shock protein, which was subsequently analysable by Methyl-TROSY techniques, revealing new structural information.

Reports show that high amounts of LH2 lead to the accumulation of HLCCs, causing fibrosis and specific types of cancer metastasis. Some members of the Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent family have also been reported to have intramolecular O2 tunnels, which aid in transporting one of the required co-substrates into the active site. While LH2 can be a promising target to combat these diseases, efficacious inhibitors are still lacking. We have used computational simulations to investigate a series of forty-four small molecules as lead compounds for LH2 inhibition. Tunneling analyses indicate the existence of several intra-molecular tunnels. The lengths of the calculated O2-transporting tunnels in holoenzymes are relatively longer than the apoenzyme suggesting that the ligands may affect the enzyme's structure and possibly block (at least partially) the tunnels. The sequence alignment analysis between LH enzymes from different organisms shows that all the amino acid residues with the highest occurrence rate in the oxygen tunnels are conserved. Our results suggest that the enolate form of diketone compounds establishes stronger interactions with the Fe(II) in the active site. Branching the enolate compounds with functional groups such as phenyl and pyridinyl enhances the interaction with various residues around the active site.

In Scandinavia, wood is a preferred building material where wooden laminates and parquet flooring are extremely popular in housing.\nSince wood contain terpene compounds and the flooring materials use a lot of adhesives to obtain different structures depending on if it is a parquet or a laminate flooring, it is of interest to investigate how such materials influence the indoor air quality (IAQ) and if the emitted compounds may contribute to health problems. \nIn this study, primary emissions from several commercially available wooden flooring materials such as parquet and laminated flooring are presented. Since indoor air climate is very much dependent on the emission of volatile organic compounds from the building materials, we investigated such materials from the point of view of emission of volatile organic compounds and aldehydes. Since aldehydes are more toxic, it is of interest to review some of such data for aldehydes in this paper, which are necessary to obtain good indoor air quality. Health risks may mainly arise from the emission of terpene compounds and aldehydes from such flooring materials. According to international Occupational Exposure Limit levels (OEL), aldehydes are very hazardous for health at relatively low concentrations. They are also classified as human carcinogens according to EPA. Aldehydes are mainly formed from the oxidation of terpenes and from urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesives that are mainly present as adhesives in the flooring materials. In this paper I shall also review the standards that are used to approve such flooring products and the mechanisms behind the emission of aldehydes from UF adhesives. \nOur studies show that the levels of primary emissions are relatively high in such flooring materials and varies depending on if it is a parquet or laminate. These emissions may influence the indoor air quality and thereby may cause serious health problems. We have found that even an eco-labeled flooring material showed relatively high emission levels. This study reveals further that the standard used for the certification of building materials is not relevant to IAQ because they do not measure the total amount of free volatiles present in the flooring materials. The study reveals that to assure IAQ it is extremely important that the building materials are analyzed and specially when it concerns wooden materials.   \n", "date": "2022-09-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Taking advantages of the excellent selectivity of dual-aptamer recognition-mediated DNA computation and the sensitivity of tandem microchips, this method achieves, for the first time, sequential isolation of tumour PD-L1 EVs and non-tumour PD-L1 EVs.

The mechanical properties of the composites depend on various variables and parameters of the manufacturing process, which are challenging, if not impossible, to determine and optimize experimentally. Traditional first-principle modeling approaches are not accessible due to the complex physics involved. A hybrid model that combines incomplete physics knowledge with available measurement data within a differentiable programming framework opens up new avenues to tackle the challenges. In this work, a physics-integrated neural differentiable (PiNDiff) model is developed, where the partially known physics is integrated into the recurrent network architecture to enable effective learning and generalization. The merit and potential of the proposed method have been demonstrated in modeling the curing process of thick thermoset composite laminates, whose governing physics is partially given. The proposed PiNDiff model shows the capability to learn unknown physics from the limited, indirect data and, meanwhile, can be used to infer unobserved variables and parameters. The performance of the PiNDiff model has been compared with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) black-box deep learning models, and its advantages over the purely data-driven models and first-principles physics-based models have been discussed in detail.

A key problem is that the question of how living organisms can exhibit self-organizing ability that leads to highly ordered structures such as enzymes and DNA and high functions such as adaptive and evolutionary ability remains unanswered. This work reveals, by computer simulation and experiments, that a non-equilibrium steady state of an open reaction network (ORN), which is a good model of primitive life, demonstrates such self-organizing ability. Reaction and diffusion processes in an ORN are irreversible and always forced toward equilibrium and, hence, necessarily reach a steady state in which they have approached equilibrium to the largest extent possible and attained a full balance, if no oscillatory or dispersive behavior emerges. Thus, the steady state is firmly stabilized by the irreversible processes and is kept stable against fluctuation. As an ORN in general incessantly changes with time, this result can be interpreted as indicating that the steady state is produced by dynamic self-organization. The steady state can also exhibit adaptive ability because all the involved processes including inflows and outflows of chemical substances have attained a full balance and are in a harmonious state with the environment. Moreover, the steady state, which is in non-equilibrium, has a property of approaching equilibrium and thus can evolve toward highly ordered structures through interaction with the environment. In fact, we can argue that increases in the rate constants of reactions through the construction of highly ordered structures act as an important factor in an approach of a steady state to equilibrium. Thus, a steady state of an ORN can demonstrate multi-functional self-organizing ability essentially the same as that of living things and therefore dynamic self-organization in it can be regarded as providing a principle for the emergence of life.", "date": "2022-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biophysical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Conventional polymer theory predicts that polymer conformations become more compact as solvent quality decreases, but recent experiments have shown the high-performance organic-semiconducting polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) to form extended rod-like aggregates much larger than a single chain in poor solvents, with the formation of these extended aggregates correlated with  enhanced electron mobility in films deposited from these solutions. We explain the unexpected formation of extended aggregates using a novel coarse-grained simulation model of P(NDI2OD-T2) that we have developed to study the effect of solvent quality on its solution-phase behaviour. In poor solvents, we find that aggregation through only a few monomers gives effectively inseparable chains, leading to the formation of extended structures of partially overlapping chains via non-equilibrium assembly. This behaviour requires that multi-chain aggregation occurs faster than chain folding, which we show is the case for the chain lengths and concentrations shown experimentally to form rod-like aggregates. This kinetically controlled process introduces a dependence of aggregate structure on concentration, chain length, and chain flexibility, which we show is able to reconcile experimental findings and is generalisable to the solution-phase assembly of other semiflexible polymers.", "date": "2022-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Conducting polymers; Polymer morphology; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

With molecular dynamics simulations guided by this experimental information, we simulated the representative hydroxylases TauD and VioC and the halogenases BesD and WelO5 with both acute and obtuse harmonic restraints. We identified key native interactions that maintain the angle of approach in the respective enzymes, such as Asp94 in TauD and His127 in BesD.

Here, we theoretically elucidate the microscopic mechanism of the substituent effect on the optical properties and exciton dynamics of materials by combining the electronic structure calculations and the quantum dynamics simulations. The results show that the alkyl substituent has a minor effect on the single molecular properties, but dramatically changes these of DPND aggregates via varying the intermolecular interactions. The aggregates of DPND with and without alkyl side chains exhibit the more-likely of characters of H-type aggregations. In the former (DPND6), the weak degree of mixing of intramolecular localized excited (LE) states and intermolecular charge transfer (CT) states makes the low-energy absorption band possess the predominant optical absorption, while in the latter (DPND), the CT and LE states are close in energy, together with their strong interaction,  resulting in the substantial state-mixing, so that its two low-energy absorption bands have nearly equal oscillator strengths and a wide energy spacing of more than 0.5 eV.\nThe simulation of exciton dynamics elucidates that the\nphoto-initiated states in both aggregates cannot generate the free charge carrier because of the lack of enough driving forces.

Treatment with chemicals such as lime (calcium (hydr)oxide) is a promising technology for tailings dewatering and consolidation, particularly at higher pH. Given that kaolinite and silica minerals are the main constituents of many oil sands, we have investigated the influence of lime and NaOH addition on the silica/water/kaolinite interface over the pH range 7-12.4 using vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG). With lime addition, we observe a complete disappearance of the vibrational features of the interfacial water molecules for planar silica in contact with an aqueous dispersion of kaolinite particles at pH 12 and above with a concurrent increase in the amount of adsorbed kaolinite based on the observed peak at 3694 cm-1. This suggests that the absence of water features in the SFG spectra is associated with conditions that facilitate dewatering. With NaOH addition, however, the interfacial water SF intensity is still significant even under highly alkaline conditions despite the increase in adsorbed kaolinite at high pH. To better understand the SFG observations, we perform \uf07a-potential measurements on the planar silica aqueous interface and kaolinite aqueous suspensions under the same pH conditions with NaOH and lime addition.", "date": "2022-09-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Franzke; Ansgar Pausch", "abstract": "Relativistic two-component and four-component density functional calculations are carried out in a non-collinear formalism to describe spin-orbit interaction. The exchange-correlation functional itself is constructed as a straightforward generalization of the non-relativistic density functional approximation. However, spin-orbit coupling is a form of magnetic induction and generally leads to a non-vanishing paramagnetic current density. This means that functionals depending on the kinetic energy density such as meta-generalized gradient approximations and local hybrid functionals should be constructed in the framework of current density functional theory (CDFT), which is (almost) exclusively used in the regime of strong magnetic fields. Herein, we present a CDFT approach for spin-orbit coupling, which leads to current-dependent terms in the potential and its derivatives. The ansatz is implemented for the exchange-correlation potential and the exchange-correlation kernel, making it applicable to a wide range of molecular properties. We assess the importance of the current density terms for ground-state energies, excitation energies, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding and spin-spin coupling constants, as well as hyperfine coupling constants\nand \u2206g-shifts in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The most notable changes are found for EPR properties. The impact of the current-dependent terms rises with the number of unpaired electrons and consequently EPR properties are more sensitive towards CDFT. Considerable changes in the results are observed for the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functionals, as well as the B97M family and TASK. The current density terms are less important when exact exchange is incorporated. Consequently, the results with (local) hybrid functionals are not substantially affected. At the same time, the current density does not notably increase the computational costs for hybrid functionals, but the current-dependent kernel ensures the stability of response calculations in all cases. We therefore strongly recommend to use the framework of CDFT for self-consistent spin-orbit calculations.", "date": "2022-09-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These proton sources have been implicated in directly assisting catalysis by acting as shuttles for proton transfer or through the stabilization of transition states through hydrogen bonding. Herein, we report a new ligand system for CO2RR electrocatalysts, which features an aryl amine appended to a quinoline-bipyridine core.

For PDAs, the chromogenic transitions that are key to their stimuli-responsiveness depend on the conformation and electronic structure of the \u03c0-conjugated backbone, which can be influenced by the nature of flanking, solubilizing groups that guide the topochemical polymerization of PDAs. Here, we investigate the dependence of amphiphilic polydiacetylene properties based on the characteristic contributions of amino acids that comprise the peptide segments serving as a biomimetic template for diacetylene polymerization in water. While sequence engineering has long been used as an effective approach to tune the function of peptide- or protein-based materials, it remains elusive how the interplay between steric effects and hydrophobicity at the residue level can impact the assembly behavior and the bulk properties of the resulting materials from hierarchically ordered 1-D nanostructures. We leverage the strict geometric requirements needed to topochemically polymerize diacetylenes bearing hexameric peptide moieties to systematically probe the impact of molecular volume and polarity changes brought by dipeptide substitution domains to the assembly behavior, photophysics, electrical properties, and biocompatibility of peptide-PDA assemblies. From a series of peptide-diacetylene monomers with systematically varied sequence, we show that steric contributions predominate the resulting photophysical properties, but the trends in the formation of higher order assemblies comprising the film bioscaffolds are distinct from the trends in PDA electronic structure changes driven by the peptide templates due to the combined impact of sterics and hydrophobicity.

Crucially, we find that single excitations atop core-ionized references are sufficient to elucidate liquid-phase XAS spectra with semi-quantitative accuracy, opening the door for methods like electron-affinity CIS/TDDFT to be used as efficient alternatives to higher-order wave function approaches.", "date": "2022-09-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This is a new class of ceria-based materials with Ru properties drastically different from the known M/ceria materials. They show excellent activity in industrially important catalytic NO oxidation reaction, a critical step that requires use of large loadings of expensive noble metals in diesel aftertreatment systems. Ru1/CeO2 catalysts are stable during continuous cycling, ramping and cooling as well as presence of moisture. Furthermore, Ru1/CeO2 shows unprecedentedly high NOx storage properties during cold start due to formation of stable Ru-NO complexes as well as high spill-over rate of NOx to the support. Only ~0.05 wt% of Ru is required to have excellent NOx storage. Single Ru ions forming Ru1O5 sites exhibit remarkably higher stability during calcination in air/steam up to 750 \u00baC in contrast to RuO2 nanoparticles that become volatile at temperature slightly above ambient. We clarify the location of Ru(II) ions on the ceria surface and  experimentally identify mechanism of NO oxidation (as well as reactive storage) using DFT calculations and in-situ DRIFTS/Mass-spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, we show the high reactivity of Ru1/CeO2 for NO reduction by CO: only 0.1-0.5 wt% of atomically dispersed Ru is sufficient to achieve high activity at low temperatures. With the aid of excitation-modulation in-situ infra-red measurements and XPS measurement, we uncover the individual elementary steps of NO reduction by CO on an atomically dispersed ceria-supported catalyst, highlighting the unique properties of Ru1/CeO2 catalyst and its propensity to form oxygen vacancies/Ce+3 sites that are critical for NO reduction even at low Ru loadings.

While a variety of misleading fucosylated fragments has been observed for glycan standards, the exact molecular structure of fucosylated products after rearrangement remains elusive and their formation unpredictable. This constitutes a major obstacle to the sequencing of fucosylated glycans. Using Infrared ion spectrosopy, we resolve the molecular structure of fucosylated fragments of four Lewis and Blood Group H antigen trisaccharides. Our findings suggest that fucose migration, which was reported decades ago, results in fragment ions, which can be fully characterized. Additionally we report a new type of fucose migration, which does not feature any internal residue loss and therefore had not been previously detected by mass spectrometry: it consists of a local type of migration, where the fucose remains on the initial residue with a change of regiochemistry. Therefore, such glycan fragments previously regarded as diagnostic carry previously undetected molecular rearrangements.

Zarzar", "abstract": "The gravitational settling of oil droplets solubilizing in an aqueous micellar solution contained in a capillary channel is investigated. The motion of these active droplets reflects a competition between gravitational and Marangoni forces, the latter due to interfacial tension gradients generated by differences in filled- micelle concentrations along the oil-water interface. This competition is studied by varying the surfactant concentration, the density difference between the droplet and the continuous phase, and the viscosity of the continuous phase. The Marangoni force enhances the settling speed of an active droplet when compared to the Hadamard-Rybczynski prediction for a (surfactant free) droplet settling in Stokes flow. The Marangoni force can also induce lateral droplet motion, suggesting that the Marangoni and gravitational forces are not always aligned. The decorrelation rate (\ud835\udefc) of the droplet motion, measured as the initial slope of the velocity autocorrelation and indicative of the extent to which the Marangoni and gravitational forces are aligned during settling, is examined as a function of the droplet size: correlated motion (small values of \ud835\udefc) is observed at both small and large droplet radii, whereas significant decorrelation can occur between these limits. This behavior of active droplets settling in a capillary channel is in marked contrast to that observed in a dish, where the decorrelation rate increases with the droplet radius before saturating at large values of droplet radius. A simple relation for the crossover radius at which the maximal value of \ud835\udefc occurs for an active settling droplet is proposed.", "date": "2022-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although CIU is now routinely used in native mass spectrometry studies, the interlaboratory reproducibility of CIU has not been established. Here we evaluate the reproducibility of the CIU data produced across three laboratories (University of Michigan, Texas A&M University, and Vanderbilt University). CIU data were collected for a variety of protein ions ranging from 8.6-66 kDa. Within the same laboratory, the CIU fingerprints were found to be repeatable with root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of less than 5%. Collision cross section (CCS) values of the CIU intermediates were consistent across the laboratories, with most features exhibiting an interlaboratory reproducibility of better than 1%. In contrast, the activation potentials required to induce protein CIU transitions varied between the three laboratories. To address these differences, three source assemblies were constructed with an updated ion activation hardware design utilizing higher mechanical tolerance specifications. The production-grade assemblies were found to produce highly consistent CIU data for intact antibodies, exhibiting high precision ion CCS and CIU transition values, thus opening the door to establishing databases of CIU fingerprints to support future biomolecular classification efforts.", "date": "2022-09-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We demonstrate that the two monodentate ligands X employed modulate aggregate formation compared to the parent complexes where X = Cl. While the identity of the monodentate ligand affects the energy of Pt\u2013Pt excimers in solution in only a subtle way, it strongly influences aggregation in film. Detailed calculations on aggregates of different sizes support the experimental conclusions from steady-state and time-resolved luminescence studies at variable temperatures. The use of X = I appears to limit aggregation to the formation of dimers, while X = SCN promotes the formation of larger aggregates, such as tetramers and pentamers, leading in turn to NIR photo- and electroluminescence > 850 nm. A possible explanation for the contrasting influence of the monodentate ligands is the lesser steric hindrance associated with the SCN group compared to the bulkier I ligand.

To expand the range of applications of FbFPs for multicolor imaging and FRET-based biosensing, it is desirable to understand how to modify their absorption and emission wavelengths (i.e., through spectral tuning). There is particular interest in developing FbFPs that absorb and emit light at longer wavelengths, which has proven challenging thus far. Existing spectral tuning strategies that do not involve chemical modification of the flavin cofactor have focused on placing positively charged amino acids near flavin\u2019s C4a and N5 atoms. Guided by previously reported electrostatic spectral tunning maps (ESTMs) of the flavin cofactor and by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations reported in this work, we suggest an alternative strategy: placing a negatively charged amino acid near flavin\u2019s N1 atom. We predict that a single-point mutant, iLOV-Q430E, has a slightly red-shifted absorption and fluorescence maximum wavelength relative to iLOV. To validate our theoretical prediction, we experimentally expressed and purified iLOV-Q430E and measured its spectral properties. We found that the Q430E mutation in iLOV results in a slight change in absorption and a 4-8 nm redshift in the fluorescence relative to iLOV, in good agreement with the computational prediction. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the carboxylate side chain of the glutamate in iLOV-Q430E points away from the flavin cofactor, which leads to a future expectation that further red-shifting may be achieved by bringing the side chain closer to the cofactor.", "date": "2022-09-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The high specificity of enzymes can enable one-pot reactions where the substrates, intermediates, and products react only with the intended enzyme. However, this same specificity can hinder the substrate scope of biocatalytic cascades because each constituent enzyme requires complementary activity. Here, we implement a substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) approach to improve the substrate scope overlap of a two-enzyme cascade via directed evolution. This cascade leverages an L-threonine transaldolase, ObiH, to produce a range of \u03b2-OH amino acids that are subsequently decarboxylated to produce chiral 1,2-amino alcohols. Crucially, for the success of this cascade, we engineered a tryptophan decarboxylase to act efficiently on \u03b2-OH amino acids while avoiding activity on L-threonine, which is needed for ObiH activity. We leverage this exquisite selectivity with matched substrate scopes to produce a variety of chiral 1,2-amino alcohols in a one-pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides. This route constitutes a new disconnection for the synthesis of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonists and shows how SUMS can be used to guide the development of promiscuous, C-C bond forming cascades.

Our FCI\nsolutions correspond to treating the VDOF as an isospin in addition to the regular spin. A major\nadvantage of our treatment is its capability to assign to each energy curve in the qubit's spectrum a complete set of good quantum numbers for both the spin and the valley isospin. This allows for the interpretation of the Si double-dot spectra according to an underlying SU(4) \u2283 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) group-chain organization. Considering parameters in the range of actual experimental situations, we demonstrate for the first time in a double-dot qubit that, in the (2,0) charge configuration and compared to the expected large, and dot-size determined, single-particle (orbital) energy gap, the strong e \u2212 e interactions drastically quench the spin-singlet\u2212spin-triplet energy gap, E^\u2295_ST, within\nthe same valley, making it competitive to the small energy gap, E_V , between the two valleys. We\npresent results for both the E^\u2295_ST < E_V and E^\u2295_ST > E_V cases, which have been reported to occur in different experimental qubit devices. In particular, we investigate the spectra as a function of detuning and demonstrate the strengthening of the all-important avoided crossings due to a lowering of the interdot barrier and/or the influence of valley-orbit coupling. We further demonstrate, as a function of an applied magnetic field, the emergence of avoided crossings in the (1,1) charge configuration due to the more general spin-valley coupling, in agreement with experiments. The valleytronic FCI method formulated and implemented in this paper, and demonstrated for the case of two electrons confined in a tunable double quantum dot, offers also a most effective tool for analyzing the spectra of Si qubits with more than two wells and/or more than two electrons, in field-free conditions, as well as under the influence of an applied magnetic field.

Addressing these two major challenges, this work explores the performance of Tamm-Dancoff-approximated (TDA)-DFT for the calculation of a large set of \u2206EST values included in the recent STGABS27 benchmark set. To this end, we employ a wide range of approaches to include orbital relaxation, environmental effects, and structural relaxation.

Although the system has been adjusted to accommodate new elements, the connection with the chemical space has been largely forgotten and the question that arises is about the effect of the exponentially growing chemical space upon the periodic system.  To what extent advances in chemistry have confirmed or distorted the periodic system?  Is the system --icon of chemistry-- a traversal feature of the chemical space?  Here we solve these questions by computationally analysing the effect of the chemical space upon the periodic system from the dawn of the 19th century until the present.  We found that although the system has undergone several and significant changes across history, it converges towards a stable structure. This dynamics results from advances in chemistry such as the discovery of elements, of forms of chemical combination and the incorporation of new theoretical frameworks.  Interestingly, the periodic system is also influenced by socio-political events such as wars.  Given the nature of the chemical space, which holds the inertia of more than 200 years of chemical practice, and the limited chemical possibilities for the remaining elements to be synthesised, we hypothesise that the periodic system is going to remain largely untouched in the years to come.

Droplet contact on solid surfaces is typically achieved without control over the applied force and without optimizing the wetting properties in different environments (e.g., in air or liquid), resulting in poorly defined contact areas. In this work, we demonstrate the direct manipulation of EGaIn microdroplets using an atomic force microscope (AFM) to generate repeated, on-demand making and breaking of contact on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols. The nanoscale positional control and feedback loop in an AFM allow us to control the contact force at the nanonewton levels and, consequently, tune the droplet contact areas at the micrometer length scale in both air and ethanol. When submerged in ethanol, the droplets are highly non-wetting,\nresulting in hysteresis-free contact forces and minimal adhesion; as a result, we are able to create reproducible geometric contact areas of between 0.8\u20134.5 \u03bcm2 with the\nalkanethiolate SAMs in ethanol.

The effect has been linked to possible intercalation of species such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). However, whether intercalation helps or even occurs remains speculative. Hence, this work investigates, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the intercalation of NO2 between bilayers of molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), its energy, and the impact on charge transfer. The effects are confronted with the intercalation of nitrogen molecules (N2) and the equivalent adsorption of both species. The results show that the intercalation of NO2 can be energetically favorable for <0.4, 1.5\u20133.0, and >4.0  molecules/nm2 and that at low coverage, the molecule-sheet interactions are too weak to facilitate sufficient interlayer expansion, and thus the molecules dissociate. The dissociation and non-dissociative intercalation of NO2 enhance the per molecule charge transfer by 1110% and 256%, respectively, relative to adsorption. Hence, in all favorable cases, the intercalation should significantly enhance the response of the system. Furthermore, the results suggest that the evacuation of NO2 should be feasible, allowing MoTe2 recovery.

Electron transfer in the catalytic protein (MoFeP) proceeds through a unique [8Fe-7S] cluster (P-cluster) to the active site (FeMoco). In the reduced, all-ferrous (PN) state, the P-cluster is coordinated by six cysteine residues. Upon two-electron oxi-dation to the P2+ state, the P-cluster undergoes conformational changes in which a highly conserved oxygen-based residue (a Ser or a Tyr) and a backbone amide additionally ligate the cluster. Previous studies of Azotobacter vinelandii (Av) MoFeP revealed that when the oxygen-based residue, \u03b2Ser188, was mutated to a non-ligating residue, Ala, the P-cluster became redox-labile and reversibly lost two of its eight Fe centers. Surprisingly, the Av strain with a MoFeP variant that lacked the serine ligand (Av \u03b2Ser188Ala MoFeP) could still grow and fix nitrogen as quickly as wild-type Av MoFeP, calling into question the necessity of this conserved ligand for nitrogenase function. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that \u03b2Ser188 plays a role in protecting the P-cluster under non-ideal conditions. Here, we investigated the protective role of \u03b2Ser188 both in vivo and in vitro by characterizing the ability of Av \u03b2Ser188Ala cells to grow under subop-timal conditions (high oxidative stress or Fe limitation) and by characterizing the ability of Av \u03b2Ser188Ala MoFeP to be mismetallated in vitro. Our results demonstrate that \u03b2Ser188 (1) increases Av cell survival upon exposure to oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide, (2) is necessary for efficient Av diazotrophic growth under Fe-limiting conditions, and (3) protects the P-cluster from metal exchange in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest a structural adaptation of nitrogenase to protect the P-cluster via Ser ligation, which is a previously unidentified functional role of the Ser residue in redox proteins and adds to the ex-panding functional roles of non-Cys ligands to FeS clusters.", "date": "2022-09-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In molecular docking, whenever experimental structures were not available, in silico structural homology modeling has been the method of choice. However, using computationally predicted structures adds a further degree of uncertainty to the docking process. Recently, AlphaFold (AF), an artificial intelligence-based modeling tool, has shown impressive results in terms of model accuracy within the field of ab initio protein structure prediction. This outstanding success prompted us to evaluate how accurate AF models are from the perspective of docking-based drug discovery. We compared the performance of AF models in high-throughput docking (HTD) to their corresponding experimental PDB structures using a benchmark set of 16 targets spanning different protein families and binding site properties. Four docking programs and two consensus techniques were used to evaluate the HTD performance. The AF models showed consistently worse performance than their corresponding PDB structures, with zero enrichment factor values in several cases. While AlphaFold shows a remarkable ability to predict protein architecture and binding site anatomy, we conclude that this is not enough to guarantee that AF models can be reliably used for HTD purposes. Moreover, we show that very small variations at the side chain level of essential ligand-binding residues have a large impact on the outcome of HTD, what suggests that post-modeling refinement strategies might be key to increase the chance of success of AF models in prospective HTD campaigns.", "date": "2022-09-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The elastic properties and fracture behaviours of monolayer qHPF are found to be strongly anisotropic due to the \ndifferent properties between the inter-fullerene C-C single bonds and [2 + 2] cycloaddition bonds. Moreover, the tensile strength and fracture strain of monolayer qHPF are much smaller than those of any other existing two-dimensional (2D) carbon crystals. The very small tensile strength or fracture strain is ascribed to the inhomogeneous deformation of the stretched monolayer qHPF, which originates from the stiffness difference between the soft inter-fullerene bonds and the rigid intra-fullerene bonds. Compared with DFT calculations at the ground state, the NEP-based extensive MD simulations predict a much smaller tensile strength and fracture strain for monolayer qHPF due to their consideration of the effects of temperature and membrane size.

As such, bsAbs have been developed as effective treatment agents for diseases that remain challenging for conventional monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics to access. Despite this, bsAbs are intricate molecules, requiring both the appropriate engineering and pairing of linked heavy and light chains derived from separate parent mAbs. Current analytical tools for tracking the bsAb construction process have demonstrated a limited ability to robustly probe the higher order structure (HOS) of bsAbs. Native ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and collision induced unfolding (CIU) have proven to be useful tools in probing the HOS of mAb therapeutics. In this report, we de-scribe a series of comprehensive IM-MS and CIU datasets that reveal HOS details associated with knob-into-hole (KiH) bsAb model system. We find that quantitative analysis of CIU data indicates that global bsAb stability occupies and in-termediate space between the stabilities recorded for its parent mAbs.  Furthermore, our CIU data identifies the hole-containing half of the bsAb construct to be least stable, thus driving much of the overall stability of the bsAb. An analysis of both intact bsAb and enzymatic fragments allows us to link the first and second CIU transitions observed for intact bsAbs to the Fab and Fc domains, respectively. This result is likely general for CIU data collected from low charge state mAb ions and is supported by data acquired for deglycosylated bsAb and mAb constructs, each of which of which indi-cate greater destabilization of the second CIU transition observed in our data. When integrated, our CIU analysis allows us to link changes in the first CIU transition primarily to the Fab region of the hole-containing halfmer, while the second CIU transition is likely strongly connected to the Fc region of the knob-containing half of the bsAb construct.

This mean-field view, mathematically described by the Langevin saturation function, predicts enhanced dielectric saturation at lower temperatures. In contrast, recent experiments for glycerol have shown a sharp increase of the NDE with increasing temperature. The NDE is a sum of a term representing binary correlations of dipolar orientations and terms referring to three- and four-particle orientational correlations. Analysis of experimental data shows that the contribution of three- and four-particle correlations strongly increases at elevated temperatures. The mean-field picture of dielectric saturation as the origin of the NDE is inconsistent with observations. A positive NDE (increment of the field-dependent dielectric constant) is predicted for low-concentration solutions of polar molecules in nonpolar solvents.

Surface area and functional groups of electrode materials strongly affect these properties, but a mechanistic explanation for the interplay between such process and how to balance them is largely missing. For the anode material Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), we suggest a polaron based mechanism that influences Li ion uptake and mobility. Electrolytes containing a lithium salt induce an observable change in the bulk NMR relaxation properties of LTO nano particles. The longitudinal 7Li NMR relaxation time of bulk LTO can change by almost an order of magnitude and, therefore, reacts very sensitively to the cation and its concentration in the surrounding electrolyte. The reversible effect is largely independent of the used anions and of potential anion decomposition products. It is concluded that lithium salt containing electrolytes increase the mobility of surface polarons. These polarons and additional lithium cations from the electrolyte can now diffuse through the bulk, induce the observed enhanced relaxation rate and enable the non-faradaic process.

Here, we demonstrate end-of-life deconstruction and upcycling of high-performance poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) thermosets with a concurrent reduction in the energy demand for curing via frontal copolymerization. Triggered material deconstruction is achieved through cleavage of cyclic silyl ethers and acetals incorporated into pDCPD thermosets. Both solution-state and bulk experiments reveal that seven- and eight-membered cyclic silyl ethers and eight-membered cyclic acetals incorporate efficiently with norbornene-derived monomers, permitting deconstruction at low comonomer loadings. Frontal copolymerization of DCPD with these tailored cleavable comonomers enables energy-efficient manufacturing of sustainable, high-performance thermosets with glass transition temperatures greater than 100 \u00b0C and elastic moduli greater than 1 GPa. The polymers are fully deconstructed, yielding hydroxyl-terminated oligomers that are upcycled to polyurethane-containing thermosets with higher glass transition temperatures (ca. 158 \u00b0C) than the original polymer upon reaction with diisocyanates.

Although the most abundant taxa remained unaffected, silver caused an increase in diversity and richness of low-abundant bacteria and a decrease in chemical diversity. Both effects were mainly observed for women. The hallmark of the induced changes was an increase in the abundance of various monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), especially in the upper back. Several microbes-to-metabolites associations were uncovered including   Cutibacterium, detected in the upper back area, that was correlated with the distribution of MUFAs; and Anaerococcus spp. found in the underarms, which were associated with a series of different bile acids. Overall these findings point to a notable impact of the silver threaded material on the skin microbiome and chemistry. We observed that relatively subtle changes in the microbiome result in pronounced shifts in molecular composition.", "date": "2022-09-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Biochemistry; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Upon light illumination, the linear tetrapyrrole chromophore undergoes a double bond isomerization which starts a photocycle. In this work, we studied the photoisomerization of chromophore models designed based on the C- and D-rings of the phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore. In total, five different models with varying substitutions were investigated. Firstly, the vertical excitation energies were benchmarked using different computational methods to establish the relative order of the excited states. Based on these calculations, we computed the photoisomerization profiles using the extended multi-state (XMS) version of the CASPT2 method. The profiles were obtained for both the clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of the C15=C16 bond in the Z and E isomers using a linear interpolation of internal coordinates between the Franck-Condon and MECI geometries. In the minimal chromophore model that lacks the substitutions at the pyrrole rings, the isomerization involves both C14-C15  and C15=C16 bonds of the methine bridge between the C- and D-rings, resembling the hula-twist motion. The MECIs are characterized by a partial charge transfer between the two pyrrole rings pointing towards a twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Systematic introduction of substituents leads to an increase in the steric repulsion between the two pyrrole rings causing a pretwist of the dihedral around the C15=C16 bond, which creates a preference for the counterclockwise isomerization. Upon introduction of the carbonyl group at the D-ring the charge transfer has increased.  This changes the isomerization mechanism from hula-twist to one-bond flip.

Herein, trinitrohexaazatrinaphthalene (TNHATN) including an electron-withdrawing group (nitro, -NO2) was synthesized by the condensation reaction between hexaketocyclohexane and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, and it was first investigated as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. The TNHATN electrode displays a high discharge specific capacity of 361.7 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and a superior cycling stability, remaining the capacity retention of 97.9 % after 200 cycles. The excellent behaviors may be ascribed to its \u03c0-conjugated structure including electron-withdrawing groups and multiple redox active sites. The experimental resultes reveal the redox active sites are pyrazine nitrogen atoms and oxygen atoms from nitrio groups.

The 4f-in-core pseudopotentials are built through attributing 4f-subconfiguration 4fn (n = 1 \u2013 14) for Ln (Ln = Ce \u2013 Lu) into the atomic core region, making it possible to circumvent the difficulty of description of open 4fn valence shell.

Among redox-active moieties, benzils or aromatic 1,2-diones are particularly attractive due to their high theoretical gravimetric capacities and fast charge/discharge rates. Herein, we demonstrate that the cyanide-catalyzed polymerization of simple dialdehyde mon-omers unexpectedly leads to insoluble redox-active benzil-linked polymers instead of the expected benzoin polymers, as confirmed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrochemical characterization. Mechanistic stud-ies suggest that cyanide-mediated benzoin oxidation occurs by hydride transfer to the solvent, and that the insolubility of the benzil-linked polymers protects them from subsequent cyanolysis. The thiophene-based polymer poly(BTDA) is an in-triguing organic electrode material that demonstrates two reversible one-electron reductions with monovalent cations such as Li+ and Na+ but one two-electron reduction with divalent Mg2+. Furthermore, in lithium metal half cells, poly(BTDA) pos-seses an experimental capacity of 106 mAh/g and promising rate capabilities (64% capacity retention when the discharge rate is increased from 0.1 to 10 A/g).

O, F, and Si K-edge spectra, acquired as a function of potential, reveal when key reactions occur on high-capacity amorphous Si anodes cycled with and without fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The sequential formation of inorganic (LiF) and organic (-(C=O)O-) components is thereby revealed, and results in layering of the SEI. The addition of FEC leads to SEI formation at higher potentials which is implicated in the rapid healing of SEI defects and the improved cycling performance observed. Operando TEY-XAS offers new insights into the formation mechanisms of electrode-electrolyte interphases and their stability for a wide variety of electrode materials and electrolyte formulations.\n", "date": "2022-09-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we focus on a popular soft biomaterial, ELastin-like polypeptide (ELP) which has been prepared under different pH conditions.

The noteworthy point is that we measure theses properties at a spatial resolution of 0.9 nm.

Our experiments demonstrate that atomic uncertainty can detect unseen chemical structures and identify chemical species whose data are potentially associated with significant noise.

Essential to microorganisms, D-Alanine (D-Ala) is found in many animals and acts as a potent co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). These receptors are widely expressed and have a variety of functions in the nervous and endocrine systems. The gut microbiome, diet and putative endogenous synthesis are the potential sources of D-Ala in animals. Understanding the sources of D-Ala and distribution of gut-absorbed D-Ala in mammals is critical for the evaluation of interaction between an animal and its microbiota. In this work, we used germ-free mice fed with stable isotope-labeled L-/D-Ala to study the biodistribution of gut-absorbed D-Ala without interference from microbiota. This also allows the determination of endogenous D-Ala synthesis through enantiomeric conversion. D-Ala is absorbed by both the small intestines and colon; the distribution of gut-absorbed D-Ala is related to the tissue type and treatment time (1-hour and 2-week). The highest levels of D-Ala accumulate in the pancreatic islets and acinar tissues followed by the brain and pituitary gland. Changes in tissue peptide profiles measured after 2-weeks of D-Ala treatment suggest that D-Ala impacts the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. No endogenous synthesis of D-Ala via racemization was reliably observed in germ-free mice.

X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy (XPEEM) provided surface sensitive and localized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements that indicate that disproportionation is enabled by surface reconstruction that occurs upon charging that leads to surface Mn3+ sites on the LNMO particle surface that can disproportionate into Mn2+(dissolved) and Mn4+(s). During discharge of the battery, we observe high quantities of metal fluorides (particularly rich in MnF2) deposit in the CEI layer on the LNMO particles as well as the conductive carbon additives on the composite surface. Electronic conductivity measurements indicate that the MnF2 decreases film conductivity by 3-fold compared to LiF, suggesting that this CEI may impede both the ionic and electronic properties of the cathode. Our data indicate that in order to prevent transition metal dissolution and the associated side reactions in spinel-type cathodes (particularly those that operate at high voltage like LNMO), the use of electrolytes that offer improved anodic stability and prevent acid byproducts will be necessary.

Semiclassical structure-activity relationships have been invoked to rationalize these linear free energy relationships despite the widely acknowledged importance of quantum effects such as nonadiabaticity and tunneling in CPET reactions. Here we report variable temperature kinetic isotope effect data for the asynchronous reactivity of a terminal Co-oxo complex with C\u2013H bonds and find evidence of substantial quantum tunneling which is inconsistent with semiclassical models even when including tunneling corrections. This indicates substantial nonadiabatic tunneling in the CPET reactivity of this Co-oxo complex and further motivates the need for a quantum mechanical justification for the influence of \u0394G\u00b0PT and \u0394G\u00b0ET on reactivity. We include \u0394G\u00b0PT and \u0394G\u00b0ET in nonadiabatic models of CPET by modeling how they influence the anharmonicity and depth of proton potential energy surfaces, which we approximate with a four-state model.

The stability mechanism for bulk nanobubbles is then given: The formation of compressed amphiphilic monolayer because of microbubble shrinking leads to a vanishing surface tension, and consequently the curvature energy of the monolayer dominates the thermodynamic stability of bulk nanobubbles. With the monolayer model, we further interpret several strange behaviors of bulk nanobubbles: the gas supersaturation is not a prerequisite for nanobubble stability because of the vanishing surface tension, and the typical nanobubble size of 100nm is due to the small bending constant of the monolayer.

Both Au and Cu are interesting for rWGSR catalysis, but it turns out that the reactivities of Au and Cu are very different. In this study, we consider alloys made from Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, and Pd to identify surfaces with reactivities for CO2 dissociation in between Cu(111) and Au(111). Additionally, interesting alloy surfaces should have activation energies for CO2 dissociation that are only a little higher than the endothermic reaction energy. We find that certain Cu based alloys with Ag and Au meet these criteria, whereas alloys containing Pt or Pd do not. The low additional cost in activation energy occurs when the transition state and final state configurations are made to look very similar due to the placement of the different metal elements in the surface. Finally, we construct a kinetic model that compares the rate of the rWGSR to the estimated rate of unwanted side reactions (i.e. methane formation or coking) on Ag-Cu alloy surfaces with varying composition and random placement of the Ag and Cu atoms.

To assess the feasibility of recovering P from water by combining batch adsorption enrichment with struvite crystallization, we prepared four ternary layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with P-preferring elements (i.e., zirconium (Zr) or lanthanum (La)) via a facile coprecipitation method, and then evaluated their performance in capturing P from water, particularly in enriching P from a low-level P solution.  We find that P adsorption on all ternary LDHs is pH-dependent and ionic strength-independent, showing a maximum adsorption efficiency at pH ~5 regardless of the ionic strength.  Besides, all ternary LDHs demonstrate remarkably high P adsorption capacities, i.e., 842.2, 958.8, 499.6 and 1029.3 mg P g\u22121 under a certain condition for ZnFeZr, ZnFeLa, ZnAlZr and ZnAlLa, respectively, outperforming other LDHs reported so far.  Microstructural analyses show that all ternary LDHs have high stability against the acidic or basic solution, and that the P uptake mechanisms are attributable to anion exchange between P and intercalated nitrate ions, complexation at both the edge of LDHs and the surface of metal (hydr)oxides co-occurred, and electrostatic attraction.  Results of recycling tests indicate that all ternary LDHs present good enrichment for P, with enrichment factors above 2.6 after only five adsorption-desorption cycles.  In addition, more than 96% of the phosphorus in the P-enriched eluates can be efficiently reclaimed via struvite crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor at an Mg:N:P ratio of 2:5:1 in the feed solution.

Likewise, synthetic methods for selective nitrogen derivatization of unbiased C\u2013H bonds remain elusive. In this work, new-to-nature heme-containing nitrene transferases were used as starting points for the directed evolution of enzymes to selectively aminate and amidate unactivated C(sp3)\u2013H sites.

The\nevolved enzymes in these lineages are highly promiscuous and show activity towards a wide array of substrates, providing a foundation for further evolution of nitrene transferase function. Computational studies and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are consistent with a stepwise radical pathway involving an irreversible, enantiodetermining hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), followed by a lower-barrier\ndiastereoselectivity determining radical rebound step.

Conversely, polymerizations in dispersed media, which allow for the formation of scalable suspensions of (nano)particles during the polymerization process, have been advantageously used for the in situ encapsulation of active ingredients. In this review, the in situ encapsulation of active ingredients, such as peptides, proteins, enzymes or drugs, in polymer particles obtained by polymerization in dispersed media for potential biomedical applications, is covered.

A process simulation and technoeconomic assessment of three fast pyrolysis plant scenarios were conducted. The nature of the waste feedstock has an effect on the value chain configuration, fast pyrolysis, and upgrading process design. Considering the difficulties with the transport and storage of biogenic waste due to low bulk density or hazardous and pathogenic content in case of transporting untreated sunflower husks, it is recommended to use a hub-and-spoke type of decentralized value chain configuration. The fast pyrolysis plants are located close to the feedstock, and the fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) is transported to a single upgrading facility, colocated at an existing refinery. The upgraded FPBO is then cofed into an FCC (fluidized catalyst cracker), where partially green biofuels such as gasoline and diesel are produced. For the fast pyrolysis process design, Scenario 2, treating 10 t/h of dry biomass with electricity and steam as coproducts, has the most favorable economic results with a total capital investment (TCI) of 78 million Euro and operating expenses (OPEX) of 6 million Euro.", "date": "2022-09-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To describe the initial steps of Mg anode degradation by O2 impurities, we have developed a Mg/O ReaxFF reactive force field description capable of accurately modeling the bulk, surface, adsorption, and diffusion properties of both metallic Mg and the salt MgO. We show that O2 immediately dissociates upon first contact with the Mg anode (modeled as Mg(0001), Mg(10m10)A, and Mg(10m11)), heating the surface to several 1000 K. The high temperature assists the further oxidation and forms a rocksalt interphase intersected by several grain boundaries. Among the Mg surface terminations, Mg(10m10)A is the most reactive, forming an MgO layer with a thickness of up to 25 \u00c5. We also demonstrate the recrystallization of an amorphous MgO particle, which is obtained performing grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations, into the rocksalt structure by thermal annealing at elevated temperatures.

This device allows the characterization of the foam and its aging from nanometer up to centimeter scale on a single experiment. A specific SANS model was developed to quantitatively adjust the scattering intensity from the dry foam.

Here, we present a new approach that enables quantitative imaging of charge density dynamics at the metal-electrolyte interface of plasmonic nanoparticles. To achieve this, we employed a modelling approach that combines Mie scattering and double-layer capacitor models of the metal-electrolyte interface to convert the intensity of voltage-modulated light scattering by single nanoparticles to charge density modulation. Voltage-modulated single-wavelength micro-spectroscopy was performed to map the charge density modulation of gold nanoparticles attached to a substrate.

CNFs are usable in a wide variety of applications such as coatings, personal and healthcare products, packaging, and advanced structural materials. They can also help overcome some performance issues with objects 3D printed by stereolithography (SLA) including dimensional instability and poor mechanical properties. However, CNFs are hydrophilic, making their dispersion in hydrophobic resins common to SLA difficult. Therefore, improvement of performance properties will not be fully realized. In this work, we treated TEMPO-oxidized CNFs (TOCNFs) with the hydrochloride salt of lauroyl arginate ethyl ester (LAE\u22c5HCl), a cationic surfactant, to investigate how this coating would affect the performance properties of multicomponent uncured SLA resins and subsequently printed objects. We hypothesized this coating would enhance the dispersion of the cellulose nanomaterials when compared to their uncoated counterparts, which would lead to quantifiable differences among the sample groups. We found that the viscosity of a commercial 3D printing resin (0.34 Pa\u00b7s at 30 Hz) increased by nearly an order of magnitude upon addition of even 1 wt.%. uncoated TOCNFs (2.96 Pa\u00b7s at 30 Hz). Moreover, the tensile strength (19.9(5) MPa) and modulus (0.65(5) GPa) of objects printed from the commercial resin decreased when adding 4 wt.% uncoated TOCNF (12.5(2) MPa and 0.58(8) GPa, respectively). In contrast, resins having 4 wt.% TOCNFs coated with LAE were less viscous (1.25 Pa\u00b7s at 30 Hz), and objects printed from them had enhanced tensile strength (24.7(7) MPa) and modulus (0.78(8) GPa) when compared to both the unadulterated resin and that having uncoated TOCNFs.

Careful consideration is given to both the diversity of the data set and accurate model predictions for substrates bearing features beyond those present in the training set. The structural diversity in the data set is enabled by leveraging the Merck & Co., Inc Building Block Collection with an initial focus on C\u2013N coupling using secondary amines. The large dataset enables the systematic evaluation of model performance using five different data-splitting strategies. These five splits are carefully designed to evaluate the model\u2019s ability to extrapolate beyond the substrates in the training set. The accuracy of classification models built with a lens toward application to medicinal chemistry campaigns exceeded the baseline precision-recall by 25-67% depending on the splitting strategy. These results would manifest as significant enrichment of successful C\u2013N couplings using the hits recommended by the models.

The results show that Pro can be oxidized by HO\u25cf radical via formal hydrogen transfer (FHT) reactions at multiple sites, with the highest branching ratio found at hydrogen atoms H10 (30.04%) and H12 (25.60%). The overall rate constant at 298.15K is determined as 6.04 \u00d7 108 M-1 s-1, and its expression from 250 to 400K is k=1.634\u00d7T2.990\u00d7exp[1.591(kcal mol-1)/RT] M-1 s-1.

The most stable Cu(II)-Pro complexes have high potential oxidant risks by enhancing the HO\u25cf radical formation when reducing agents such as superoxide anion, or ascorbate anion are available. Besides, the oxidant reaction of the high oxidation state complexes, including Fe(III)-Pro and Cu(II)-Pro, by HO\u25cf radical as FHT reactions have a lower rate constant than that of free-ligand, while the ones for SET reactions is extremely low even though they are higher than that of free-ligand.

This procedure is scalable. The covalent labeling of the antibody with gold nanoclusters was confirmed by various analytical methods, including cryo-EM analysis of the Au25 nanocluster conjugates. In comparison with a non-homogenous variant prepared by lysine-selective bio-conjugation, Trp-selective conjugates exhibited both satisfactory gold cluster modification and minimal loss of antigen-binding ability.", "date": "2022-09-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Imaging; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Among the monomers that hardly copolymerize with CKAs are (1,3)-dienes such as isoprene (I). This is unfortunate since synthetic polyisoprene (PI) and its derivatives are the materials of choice for many applications, in particular as elastomers in the automotive, industrial, footwear, medical industry, but also nanomedicine. Thionolactones have been recently proposed as a new class of rROP-compatible monomers for insertion of thioester units in the main chain. Herein, we reported the synthesis of degradable PI by rROP via the copolymerization of I and DOT. Free-radical polymerization as well as two reversible deactivation radical polymerization techniques were successfully used for the synthesis of (well-defined) P(I-co-DOT) copolymers with adjustable molecular weight and DOT content (2.7-9.7 mol %). Reactivity ratios of rDOT = 6.600 and rI = 0.367 were determined, suggesting preferential incorporation of DOT in comparison to I. The resulting P(I-co-DOT) copolymers were successfully degraded (from -47% to -84% decrease in Mn) under basic conditions. As a proof of concept, the P(I-co-DOT) copolymers were formulated into stable and narrowly dispersed nanoparticles, showing similar cytocompatibility on J774.A1 and HUVEC cells than their PI counterparts. Furthermore, Gem-P(I-co-DOT) polymer prodrug were synthesized by the \u201cdrug-initiated\u201d method and exhibited significant cytotoxicity on A549 cancer cells. The synthesis of P(I-co-DOT) copolymers may therefore open new perspectives in the field of degradable vinyl polymers, not only in nanomedicine but also for other applications involving PI.

Here, we take on this challenge by first introducing an all-around performance descriptor that combines three key criteria (related to energy density, storage time and light-absorption characteristics), and by then using density functional theory (DFT) methods to calculate its values for 52 newly designed DHA/VHF switches. Through this approach, we are able to identify several switches with excellent overall properties that contain a structural motif absent in all DHA/VHF compounds considered for solar-energy storage in the existing literature. For some of these switches, we also provide retrosynthetic analyses for their preparation and perform DFT calculations to demonstrate that they form the energy-storing VHF isomer through a facile DHA \uf0ae VHF photoisomerization reaction.

We derivatized three natural estrogens with BODIPY fluorophores by azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction and developed an analytical workflow based on simple liquid-liquid extraction and HPLC-PDA analysis.

The present report looks at detection of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in single AAs after their identification through their cognate tRNAs. The volumes of AAs with PTMs are computed from crystallographic data for all 20 proteinogenic AAs and three types of PTMs (methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation). The ratio of the spatial volume of a modified AA to that of an unmodified one is then used to assign a PTM to the former. An experimental procedure to obtain these ratios for different PTMs with a nanopore of matching diameter is proposed. AA is freed following its identification via its cognate tRNA as in the procedure mentioned above, separated by a nanofilter, and translocated through a nanopore under electrophoresis. The ratio of the blockade level due to a modified AA to that due to the unmodified AA is compared with the theoretical ratio and a PTM assigned. Because the AA has been unambiguously determined by its cognate tRNA, PTM assignment is horizontal across the set of PTMs, thus the other 19 AA types are not involved in PTM assignment. Computational results are presented for 49 PTMs covering the three types mentioned above.

But the data they generate are difficult to analyze: non-linear time-trends, non-detects, extreme values, and autocorrelation are common attributes that make popular methods, such as the t- or rank-sum tests, poor descriptive models. Here, we propose a model for pipe loop data that accommodates many of these difficult-to-model attributes: a robust Bayesian generalized additive model with continuous-time autoregressive errors. Our approach facilitates corrosion control treatment comparisons without the need for imputing non-detects or special handling of outliers. It is well-suited to describing nonlinear trends without overfitting, and it accounts for the reduced information content in autocorrelated time series. We demonstrate it using a four-year pipe loop study, with multiple pipe configurations and orthophosphate dosing protocols, finding that an initially high dose of orthophosphate (2 mg P L-1) that is subsequently lowered (0.75 mg P L-1) can yield lower lead release than an intermediate dose (1 mg P L-1) in the long term.

Muscle metabolites resulting from animal growth and postmortem storage have a significant impact on meat quality, including flavor and color. Metabolomics studies of postmortem muscle aging have identified metabolisms that contain signatures inherent to muscle properties and the altered metabolites by physiological adaptation, with glycolysis as the pivotal metabolism in postmortem aging. In addition to major postmortem metabolisms, such as amino acid generation, metabolomics has played a role in mining relevant postmortem metabolisms and pathways that have recently been revealed, such as the citrate cycle and mitochondrial metabolism. This leads to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the generation of key compounds that are associated with meat quality.

The resulting composite catalyst, tested in the reductive amination of levulinic acid, is found to have a markedly improved lifetime when compared to just the MOF or polymer support containing Pd. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that the lifetime enhancement stems directly from the polymer, which plays a dual role: i) the oligomer stabilizes the MOF support through the elimination of certain vibrational modes associated with the framework ligand and likely pore-filling effects in the largest MOF pore, and ii) the Lewis base functionality on the oligomer backbone binds to the surface of the Pd NPs, thus, increasing their activity and inhibiting their aggregation. Several complementary spectroscopic (IR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy) and computational tools (pore space and topology analysis, molecular mechanics, and density functional theory simulations) were used to describe the nature of the MOF-oligomer interaction and identify the most likely location of the polymer within the MOF pore.", "date": "2022-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

As more and more studies indicate the importance of studying native receptors in their natural environment, it is essential to develop approaches allowing the specific labeling of native receptors. Here we report an innovative ligand directed approach to specifically label residues of native GPCRs upon ligand binding. To this end, we developed a ligand-directed toolbox based on a novel approach that uses molecular modules to build fluorescent ligand-directed probes that can label an archetypical aminergic GPCR (D1R). Our probes can be readily prepared before the labeling reaction from two molecular modules: an activated electrophilic linker which includes a fluorescent dye and a GPCR ligand that may include nucleophilic groups. Thanks to a fast and specific click reaction, the nucleophilic ligand can barely react with the activated linker before it is bound to the native target GPCR and the labeling reaction occurs. Subsequently, the ligand unbinds the GPCR pocket, leaving the receptor fluorescently labeled and fully functional. This novel labeling approach allowed us to label both D1 receptor in transfected cells and native receptors in neuronal cell lines. This approach will pave the way to develop new reagents and assays to monitor endogenous GPCRs distribution, trafficking, activity or binding properties in their native environment.", "date": "2022-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite this connection, most artificial metalloproteins (ArMs) are prepared in structur-ally rigid protein hosts. To better model the natural mechanisms of metalloprotein reactivity, we have developed conforma-tionally switchable ArMs (swArMs) that undergo a large-scale structural rearrangement upon allosteric effector binding. The swArMs reported here contain a Co(dmgH)2(X) cofactor (dmgH = dimethylglyoxime, X = N3\u2013, H3C\u2013, iPr\u2013). We used UV-vis absorbance and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopies, along with protein assays, and mass spectrometry to show that these metallocofactors are installed site-specifically and stoichiometrically via direct Co\u2012S cysteine ligation within the E. coli glutamine binding protein (GlnBP). Structural characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (2.99 \u00c5 resolu-tion) unveils the precise positioning and microenvironment of the metallocofactor within the protein fold. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies, along with isothermal titration calorimetry reveal that allosteric Gln binding drives a large-scale protein conformational change. In swArMs containing a Co(dmgH)2(CH3) cofactor, we show that the protein stabilizes the otherwise labile Co\u2012S bond relative to the free complex.

Key to the described reactivity is the use of silyl triflate reagents, which serve as reaction mediators in C-H deprotonation and stabilizers of (otherwise unstable) azole carboxylic acid intermediates. A diverse azole substrate scope designed via ma-chine learning-guided analysis demonstrates the broad utility of the sequence.

Among the inorganic substituents, again there are specific preferences\u2014tetravalent Pb prefers F and Cl more than Br and I. It is as though the relativistic contraction of s orbital of Pb is more significant with Br and I substituents, than with Cl, F and alkyl substituents.

We explain why typical hypervalent systems, like 12-X-6, 10-X-5 (X is a heavy atom, the number preceding X is the number of valence electrons surrounding X, and the number after X is the coordination number) with less electronegative substituents carrying lone pair (such as Iodine), and Lewis octet molecules like PbI4 are unstable, but their dianions (14-X-6, 12-X-5, PbI42-) are not. For heavy atoms, the relativistic contraction of s orbital renders the antibonding combination of s with ligand orbitals (\u03c31*) very low-lying, making it a good acceptor of electrons. Thus compounds where \u03c31* is empty are kinetically unstable, when an electron donor with appropriate energy (such as lone pair on Iodine or bromine) is present in the vicinity. Donor-acceptor interaction between \u03c31* and the lone pair on I or Br (F and Cl lone pairs are energetically far away from \u03c31*) is responsible for the instability of such compounds. The kinetic stability of tetraalkyl lead compounds is due to the absence of lone pairs on the alkyl substituents.

We show that this approach also applies to other transition metal-based coordination networks, and it will thus enable diversification of hybrid glass chemistry, including non- stoichiometric glass compositions, continuous tuning of physical and chemical properties, and a significant rise in the number of glass-forming hybrid systems by allowing them to melt before they thermally decompose.", "date": "2022-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Herein, we present two new redox non-innocent Cp compounds, imidazolium- and pyrrolinium-substituted zwitterionic Cps (IZCp 1a and PZCp 1b). The Cps were obtained in high yields and could be handled easily owing to their high stability in air and moisture, unlike other known Cps. The redox non-innocent behavior of the Cp ligands was demonstrated via experimental and computational analyses of their half-sandwich and sandwich complexes. During cyclic voltammetry, the molybdenum half-sandwich (3a, 3b) and ruthenium sandwich ([4a]PF6, [4b]PF6) complexes of IZCp and PZCp showed reversible one-electron reduction at a low potential (E1/2 ranging from \u22121.7 to \u22122.7 V vs. Fc/Fc+). This phenomenon has not been studied previously because of the high instability of the reduced complexes. DFT calculations for the reduced complexes ([3a]\u203e, [3b]\u203e, 4a, and 4b) confirmed that their spin density was mainly delocalized over the ligand center (70%\u201390%). EPR analysis of the isolated K[3b] and 4b indicated their ligand-centered radical structures. Furthermore, the CO stretching frequencies of K[3b] (\u03bdCO 1871.35, 1748.10, and 1698.80 cm\u22121) revealed that the redox non-innocent [PZCp]\u203e ligand is the strongest electron-donating Cp ligand among previously reported CpMo(CO)3 derivatives (\u03bdCO > 1746 cm\u22121).", "date": "2022-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Ligand Design", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work we present a suite of materials with covalently bound ssDNA to an alginate-based hydrogel for targeted forensic applications. These crosslinked materials not only promote a more stable 3D polymeric network, but also achieve localization of functional ssDNA, a more desirable feature compared to previous DNA encapsulated versions. Specifically, dual amine terminated ssDNA (N-DNA-N) of three different concentrations was bound to alginate using carbodiimide chemistry. Rheological characterization showed that each DNA-crosslinked material forms similar structures, but the higher DNA concentration behaved like a dynamic viscoelastic material. FTIR analysis confirmed the formation of amide bonds, indicative of successful crosslinking between the N-DNA-N and alginate. SEM visualization also showed that each material had distinct topographies, where the covalent crosslinked alginate-DNA materials had more ordered particles and networked structures. We also investigated ssDNA with three different amine functionalities to understand the amine reactivity, which revealed that the N-DNA-N attaches primarily from the terminal primary amines on the DNA strands. From this, microparticles (MPs) using the DNA-crosslinked materials were developed, and the particle morphology and sizes were measured. It was determined that MPs made using DNA-crosslinked materials had larger particle diameters compared to the non-DNA controls, which is ideal for the generation of white blood cell (WBC) mimetics in forensic materials. In addition, these MPs could be successfully processed in a relevant forensic scenario through extraction, amplification, and genotyping, demonstrating the functionality of these materials to forensic blood simulants.

The results demonstrated that Raman spectra precisely reflect the conformation of PEDOT units and their interactions with PSS. Two different responses were observed. In the case of oxidizing electrolytes, the effect of charge transfer is accurately transduced in Raman spectrum changes. On the other hand, reduction induces a progressive separation between the PEDOT and PSS chains, which decreases their mutual interaction. This stimulus determines characteristic variations in intensity, shape and position of the Raman spectra. However, we demonstrated that the same effects can be obtained either by increasing the concentration of non-oxidizing electrolytes or by deprotonating PSS chains. This poses severe limitations to the use of PEDOT:PSS for this type of Raman sensing.

While these monitoring systems operate continuously, their efficiency in detecting emissions will depend on meteorological conditions, sensor detection limits, the number of sensors deployed, and sensor placement strategies. This work demonstrates an approach to assess the effectiveness of continuous sensor networks in detecting infinite duration and fixed duration emission events from a point source, using a case study in west Texas. The case study examines a 10 kg/hr source at a height of 5.5m, representative of the emission pattern from a liquid storage tank.  Using site specific meteorological data and dispersion modeling, emission detection performance was characterized.  For this case study, infinite duration emission events were detected within 1 hour to multiple days, depending on the numbers of sensors deployed.  The percentage of fixed duration emission events that were detected ranged from less than 30% to more than 90%, depending on the emission event duration and the number of sensors deployed.  Because the dispersion modeling for the case study region predicted relatively narrow plumes, with steep concentration gradients, the benefit of using sensors with low detection thresholds was less important to system performance than the number of sensors deployed and the positioning of the sensors.  While these results are specific to this case study, the analysis framework described in this work can be broadly applied in the evaluation of continuous emission monitoring network designs.  Overall, while there can be time delays in continuous monitoring systems detecting continuous infinite duration emission events, and while some fixed duration emission events may not be detected, the detection efficiencies for continuous monitoring networks are greater than efficiencies for periodic short duration measurements, such as monthly or quarterly inspections.

It is the only known cofactor that enables enzymatic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions. It is produced by enzymes from the UbiX family, from flavin mononucleotide and either dimethylallyl mono- or diphosphate. prFMN biosynthesis is currently reported to be initiated by protonation of the substrate by Glu140.\nMethods\nComputational chemistry methods are applied herein - Constant pH MD, classical MD simulations, and QM cluster optimizations.\nResults\nGlu140 competes for a single proton with Lys129 prior to prFMN biosynthesis, but it is the latter that adopted a protonated state. Once the prenyl-FMN adduct is formed, Glu140 occurs in a protonated state far more often, while the occupancy of protonated Lys129 does not change. Lys129, Glu140, and Arg122 seem to play a key role in either stabilizing or protonating DMAP\u2019s phosphate group within the PaUbiX active site throughout initial steps of prFMN biosynthesis.\nConclusions\nThe role of Lys129 in the functioning of PaUbiX is reported for the first time. Glu140 is unlikely to act as a proton donor in prFMN biosynthesis. Instead, Lys129 and Arg122 that fulfil this role. Glu140 still plays a role in contributing to hydrogen-bond network. This behavior is most likely conserved throughout the UbiX family due to the structural similarity of the active sites of those proteins.\nSignificance\nMechanistic insights into a crucial biochemical process, the biosynthesis of prFMN, are provided. This study, although purely computational, extends and perfectly complements the knowledge obtained in classical laboratory experiments.\n  \n", "date": "2022-09-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we present simple, fast and cost-efficient labeling strategies for 17O-enrichment of amino acids and peptides. First, using mechanochemical saponification, a variety of unprotected amino acids were enriched within 30 min of milling under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with high enrichment levels (up to ~ 40 %), and in medium to high yields (~ 60 - 85 %) without the loss of their optical purity (ee > 99%). The labeling efficiency of the mechanochemical protocol was then compared to a re-optimised enrichment strategy based on acid-catalysed oxygen exchange. Subsequently, 17O-enriched Fmoc/tBu-protected amino acids were produced on a 1 g/day scale with high enrichment levels (~ 40 %), and in high synthetic yields (~ 75 - 85 %), by scaling up the mechanochemical enrichment followed by a Fmoc-protection step. Lastly, a direct site-selective 17O-labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side-chains was developed and applied to the RGD and GRGDS peptides, reaching up to 29% enrichment level. Producing highly enriched molecules enabled to record 17O solid-state NMR spectra at 14.1 T in reasonable analytical times.

These time-dependent oxidative processes have previously been probed using UV-VIS spectroscopy following the resuspension of bloodstains. Our study investigated the solid-state VIS spectra of degrading bloodstains without sample pre-treatment, effectively bypassing the need for resuspension. A total of 128 bloodstains from eight biological replicates were created and stored on glass slides in four temperature conditions: -20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, 22\u00b0C, and 45\u00b0C.

The peak area of the methemoglobin (metHb) band displayed the largest time and temperature differences, an interesting contrast to previous literature using the Soret band for TSD. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that storage temperature delineated the data, with the metHb band showing the greatest contributions to PC1. Linear mixed models from the PCA data with time showed clear TSD relationships with temperature, and with minimal inter-donor variability. Overall, this work complements the UV-VIS analysis of bloodstains for TSD estimation, with the importance of nothing clear differences between phases and sample preparation methods.

Different to the existing water models based on many-body expansion, we adopt a separation scheme purely based on distances, and systematically investigate how the long-range asymptotic terms increase the transferability and the data efficiency of the ML potential. We also show how the ML model can be an ideal tool to fit the short-range interactions which used to post great challenges to the conventional physically-motivated force fields. The water force field we obtain is highly accurate and transferrable in different environments, and the distance-based separation scheme is easy to be extended to general molecular systems. Through this study, we show how the information we learn from small clusters can be extrapolated into larger systems, thus providing a general recipe for the intermolecular force field development at CCSD(T) level of theory in future. \n", "date": "2022-09-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Separating lignocellulosic biomass components for use in tailored sustainable energy and materials applications is challenging, as the biopolymers are in close proximity within the plant secondary cell wall. Organic solvents are used to pretreat recalcitrant biomass and separate the interacting polymers, solubilizing the lignin fraction for lignin-first valorization approaches. However, no single organosolv pretreatment approach has proven superior for heterogeneous biomass samples. Simulation offers a complementary atomic view into interactions between biomass components, resolving mechanistic hypotheses for how biomass composition influences separations processes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we quantify lignin-cellulose interactions through binding free energies determined from 300 lignin polymer models in nine solvent environments, across four crystalline cellulose faces, with an aggregate simulation time of nearly 154 microseconds. The binding free energy determined from simulation categorizes the solvents. For poor lignin solvents, all lignin polymers bind strongly to cellulose.  By contrast, polar protic solvents such as methanol and ethanol favor the unbinding between lignin and cellulose in all conditions, regardless of charge for the lignin monomer tested. Aprotic organic solvents separate lignin from cellulose only for uncharged lignin monomers, with charged lignin monomers associating to cellulose. While polar protic solvents are most effective at breaking apart lignin-cellulose interactions for charged lignin species, solvent dynamics highlight that there is no single optimal solvent to facilitate lignin-cellulose separation, particularly as some solvents demonstrate greater effectiveness for skewed S:G ratios. Instead, the optimal solvent for a given lignin sample will depend on the lignin compound and the net charge for the lignin polymers.", "date": "2022-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Biological Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Bisphenol A (BPA) - a monomer used globally in producing polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, is a prototypic EDC that has received widespread attention due to its estrogenic activity. BPA has been detected in human serum, urine, amniotic fluid, placenta tissues, and umbilical cord blood. Its presence in the human population has been ascribed to consuming BPA-contaminated food due to its migration from polycarbonate plastics. However, little is known about the inimical health hazard of BPA migrating from polycarbonate bottles into food or drinks in Nigeria and how temperature and storage duration can influence its migration into any contact media. To address this problem, we scrutinized the effect of storage time and temperature on BPA migration from 3 selected polycarbonate water bottles and a brand of polycarbonate baby feeding bottles into a mixture of methanol and water in Makurdi, Nigeria, using the UV-Visible spectrophotometric method. We measured detectable levels of BPA right from day 1 at room temperature, suggesting a positive correlation between BPA release and residual BPA in the PC bottles. The amount of BPA migrated was in the range of (0.030 \u00b1 0.012) ng/mL (day 1 at room temperature) to (5.620 \u00b1 0.650) ng/mL (day 10 at 60 \u00b0C) for the 3 brands of polycarbonate feeding bottles and (0.080 \u00b1 0.010) ng/mL (day 1 at room temperature) to (4.300 \u00b1 0.100) ng/mL (day 10 at 60 \u00b0C) for a brand of polycarbonate water bottles studied. Both temperature and duration of storage generously influenced the migration of BPA exponentially. However, our study identified temperature as the dominant significant factor that enhanced the migration of BPA from PC bottles into the water. Therefore, it is safer for consumers to store foods in BPA-free bottles to avert health risks related to ingestion of BPA.", "date": "2022-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Inorganic Polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, we address this limitation by using a new method based on deconvolution and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm fitting of UV-Vis spectrum to calculate the precise concentration and number of cytochrome C (Cyt C) and Zinc Porphyrin (Zn Porph) bound to each multi-functional AuNP. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Zeta potential measurements, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to confirm the functionalization of AuNPs with Cyt C and Zn Porph. Despite the overlapping absorption bands of Cyt C and Zn Porph this method was able to reveal the accurate concentration and number of Cyt C and Zn Porph molecules attached per AuNP. Furthermore, using this method we were able to identify unconjugated molecules, suggesting the need for further purification of the sample. This guide provides a simple and effective method to quickly quantify molecules bound to AuNPs, giving users accurate and valuable information, especially for applications in drug delivery and biosensors.

The viability of a TES system depends upon the performance of its underlying storage material; improving the energy density of TES materials is an important step in accelerating the adoption of TES systems.  Salt hydrates are a promising class of TES materials due to their relatively high energy densities and their reversibility. Despite their promise, relatively few salt hydrates have been characterized, presenting the possibility that new hydrate compositions with superior properties may exist. Here, the energy densities, turning temperatures, and thermodynamic stabilities of 5292 hypothetical salt hydrates are predicted using high-throughput density functional theory calculations. The hydrates of several metal-fluorides, including CaF2, VF2, and CoF3, are identified as new, stable TES materials with class-leading energy densities and operating temperatures suitable for use in domestic heating and intermediate-temperature applications.  The promising performance of these materials is demonstrated at the system level by parameterizing an operating model of a solar thermal TES system with data from the new hydrates. Finally, machine learning models for salt hydrate thermodynamics are developed and used to identify design guidelines for maximizing energy density. In total, the new materials and design rules reported here are expected to foster the adoption of TES systems.", "date": "2022-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recent legislation in the United States requires updating of current methane reporting programs for oil and gas facilities with empirical data. While technological advances had led to improvements in methane emissions measurements and monitoring, the overall effectiveness of mitigation strategies rests on quantifying spatially and temporally varying methane emissions more accurately than current approaches. In this work, we demonstrate a quantification, monitoring, reporting, and verification framework that pairs snapshot measurements with continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) to reconcile measurements with inventory estimates and account for intermittent emissions events. We find site-level emissions exhibit significant intra-day and daily emissions variation. Snapshot measurements of methane can span over three orders of magnitude and may have limited application in developing annualized inventory estimates at site-level. Consequently, while official inventories underestimate methane emissions on average, emissions at individual facilities can be higher or lower than inventory estimates. Using CEMS, we characterize distributions of frequency and duration of intermittent emission events. Technologies that allow high sampling frequency such as CEMS, paired with a mechanistic understanding of facility-level events, are key to accurate accounting of short-duration, episodic, and high-volume events that are often missed in snapshot surveys, and to scale snapshot measurements to annualized emissions estimates.

The breakdown of the conventional pH definition is due to the rare and intermittent presence of ion pairs (H^+ and OH^-) in these pools, leading to pH = -log_10 (0). To characterize water ion pair lifetimes and populations in such systems, we have performed a set of stochastic kinetics simulations of the water dissociation reaction in pools ranging from 10^3  to 10^10 waters. We extract a kinetically derived availability coefficient, \u03b1_(i>0), as a suitable parameter to quantify the intermittent presence of a number i of ion pairs during an observation period. In this way, pH in confinement is intrinsically connected with the transient ion pair lifetimes and the stochastics associated with their formation.  We propose that \u03b1_(i>0) is equivalent to an activity coefficient, and use \u03b1_(i>0) along with the thermodynamic definition of pH to estimate an effective pH for a nanoscopic H_2 O pool. As the availability coefficient quickly converges to 1 for pool containing well over 5\u00d710^9 waters, the effective pH converges to the pure water bulk pH of 7.

AROPS relies on a customized Bayesian optimizer to solve multi-reactor/analyzer reaction optimization problems with three different scheduling modes to arrange tasks for various experimental modules. In addition, a mechanism based on probability of improvement (PI) for discarding unpromising on-going experiments was developed to facilitate freeing-up valuable experimental resources in parallelized optimization.

Additionally, the majority of localized d state transition metals identified from the computational screening study exhibit partial anionic character due to charge transfer from neighboring metal species. Using CO as a representative probe molecule, we show that localized d states for Rh, Ir, Pd, and Pt tend to reduce the binding strength of CO compared to their pure elemental analogues, whereas this does not occur as consistently for the Cu binding sites. These trends are rationalized through the d-band model, which suggests that the significantly reduced d-band width results in an increased orthogonalization energy penalty upon CO chemisorption.

Here we present an overview of currently available tests and benchmarks for computational chemistry, focusing on organic compounds, including halogens and common ions, as FFs for these are the most common ones. We argue that many of the benchmark datasets from quantum chemistry can in fact be re-used for evaluating FFs, but new gas phase data is still needed for compounds containing phosphor and sulfur. In addition, more non- equilibrium energies and forces are needed for compounds with halogens, P and S. For the condensed phases there is a large body of experimental data available and tools to utilise these data in an automated fashion are under development.

Important to the description of electronic excited states, especially those of charge-transfer character, is the treatment of the coupling between the QM and MM subsystems. The state-of-the-art is to use a polarizable force field for the MM region and mutually couple the QM wavefunction and MM induced dipoles, in addition to the usual electrostatic embedding, yielding a polarizable embedding (QM/MM-Pol) approach. However, we showed previously that current popular QM/MM-Pol approaches exhibit issues of root flipping and/or incorrect descriptions of electronic crossings in multistate calculations.[J. Chem. Theory Comput. 14, 2137 (2018)] Here we demonstrate a solution to these problems with an integral-exact reformulation of the Direct Reaction Field approach of Thole and Van Duijnen (QM/MM-IEDRF). The resulting embedding potential includes one- and two-electron operators, and many-body dipole-induced dipole interactions, and thus includes a natural description of the screening of electron-electron interactions by the MM induced dipoles. Pauli repulsion from the environment is mimicked by effective core potentials on the MM atoms. Inherent to the DRF approach is the assumption that MM dipoles respond instantaneously to the positions of the QM electrons, therefore dispersion interactions are captured approximately. All electronic states are eigenfunctions of the same Hamiltonian while the polarization induced in the environment and the associated energetic stabilization are unique to each state. This allows for a consistent definition of transition properties and state crossings. We demonstrate QM/MM-IEDRF by exploring the influence of a (polarizable) inert xenon matrix environment on the conical intersection underlying the photoisomerization of ethylene.", "date": "2022-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These low ST gaps can ideally be leveraged towards energy applications but is hindered by the decreasing stability of the system. While non-linear or kinked polyacenes are characterised by higher stability, multireference calculations on these systems are limited. In our work, we show that while the singlet states of kinked polyacenes are markedly less multireference, the triplet states are highly multireference in these systems and therefore, the correct trend of ST gap in the kinked polyacenes requires high-level multireference calculations. We show that unlike linear polyacenes, in the non-linear systems the ST gaps increase marginally with system size. The ST gaps also show absolutely no correlation with HOMO-LUMO gaps.

This synthesis was first optimized on vanillin by varying key parameters including both chemical (e.g., stoichiometry, reaction time) and mechanical (e.g., rotational speed, material, size and number of beads, liquid additive) conditions, leading to the isolation of allylated vanillin at the gram scale in excellent yield (95%). The optimized procedure was also successfully implemented to another bio-based phenol of interest, ethyl ferulate (92% isolated yield). The environmental impact of these procedures was compared with more classical in-solution protocols by calculating E factors. When work-up solvents were not taken into account, E factor (sEF) clearly indicated superiority of the ball-milling approach over the solution-based procedure, underscoring the capacity of ball-mills to drastically reduce the need for \u201creaction\u201d solvents. On the opposite, when work-up solvents were taken into consideration, E factors (cEF) were in favor of the solvent-based approach, which could be explained by the solvent quantities required to recover the reaction mixture from the ball-mill reactor. Overall, these results highlight i) the great potential of mechanochemistry to enable the development of both efficient and waste-less allylation of lignin-derived phenolic synthons and ii) the need to study higher-scale and continuous mechanochemical processes, such as by using extruders, to further improve efficiency and sustainability of such mechanochemical processes.", "date": "2022-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

One strategy is introducing an interlayer, which often consists of the mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC), to stabilize the Li0. However, how Li ions (Li+) transport within MIEC remains unknown. Herein, we investigate the Li, including Li0 and Li+, dynamics in a graphite interlayer, a typical MIEC, using operando neutron imaging and Raman spectroscopy. Our study reveals the Li evolution during mechano-chemistry and mechano-electrochemistry reactions. During cell assembly, intercalation\u2013extrusion-dominated mechano-chemical reactions transform the graphite into a Li-graphite interlayer consisting of SE, Li0, and diluted graphite-intercalation compounds. During battery operation, dictated by the lowest nucleation energy, Li0 plating preferentially occurred at the Li-graphite|SE interface and then transferred into the Li-graphite interlayer without intercalation. Upon further plating, Li0-dendrites formed, inducing short circuits and reverse immigration of Li0 from the anode to the cathode during charging. Continuum modeling was conducted to explain the Li dynamics. We concluded that with the MIEC interlayer, a lowest nucleation barrier at the Li0 side is necessary to drive the Li+ to transport across MIEC and preferentially deposit onto the Li0.", "date": "2022-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An important feature arising from the derivation is the necessity to include two-body correlations between monomer's particles, reminiscent to those recently found crucial for binding reactions. However in (homo-) dimerizations, particles of the same type associate, and therefore, self-correlations are excluded. As a result, the mathematical form of the equilibrium constant differs from the well-known expression given in textbooks. For systems with large number of particles the discrepancy is negligible, whereas, for finite systems it is significant. Rationalized by collision probability between monomers, the bimolecular rate for dimer formation is proportional to concentration the same way correlations are accounted for. That is average of squared, and not square of averaged, monomer concentration should be considered in such a way that inconceivable collisions between a tagged particle with itself are excluded. Another consequence emerging from these two-body correlations, is an inhomogeneous function behavior of system's properties when scaling-down the system to a regime smaller than the thermodynamic limit. Thus, averages of properties observed at small systems are different than those observed at macroscopic systems. When applied to the size-dependent composition of the system, we further demonstrate the equilibrium concentration of the dimer (or monomer) can be obtained from only the magnitudes of fluctuations in the system.

Here, we provide experimental demonstrations of our recently proposed tandem catalysis strategy which uses ethylene to convert PE to propylene, the commodity monomer used to make PP. The approach combines rapid olefin metathesis with rate-limiting isomerization. Mono-unsaturated PE is progressively disassembled at modest temperatures via many consecutive ethenolysis events, resulting selectively in propylene. Fully saturated PE can be converted to unsaturated PE starting with a single transfer dehydrogenation to ethylene, which produces a small amount of ethane (one equiv. per dehydrogenation event). These principles are demonstrated using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. While selectivity under batch conditions is limited at high conversion by the formation of an equilibrium mixture of olefins, high selectivity to propylene (\u2265 94 %) is achieved in a semi-continuous process due to continuous removal of propylene from the reaction mixture.

When selecting molecules to be used in such applications, an important quantity to consider is the thermodynamic hydricity, which is the free energy required for a species to donate a hydride anion. Theoretical calculations of thermodynamic hydricity depend on several parameters, mainly the density functional, basis set, and solvent model. In order to assess the effects of the above three parameters, we carry out hydricity calculations with different combinations of density functionals, basis sets, and solvent models for a set of organic molecules with known experimental hydricity values. The data are analyzed by comparing the R^2 and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of linear fits with a fixed slope of 1 and using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine statistical significance of the RMSE rank ordering. Based on these results, we quantified the accuracy of theoretical predictions of hydricity and found that the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost was obtained by using the B3LYP-D3 density functional for the geometry optimization and free energy corrections, either wB97X-D3 or M06-2X-D3 for single point energy corrections, combined with a basis set no larger than def-TZVP and the C-PCM ISWIG solvation model.

While state-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques can produce structural organization in small areas, we still lack a cost-effective, and scalable techniques to generate tunable color at sub-micron length scales. In this work, we produced structurally colored hydroxypropyl cellulose filaments with a suppressed angular color response by 3-d printing. Our systematic study of the morphology of the filaments reveals the key stages in the induction of a two-degree hierarchical order through 3-d printing. The first degree of order originates from the changing of the cholesteric pitch at a few hundred nm scale via chemical modification and tuning of the solid content of the lyotropic phase. Upon 3-d printing, the secondary hierarchical order of periodic wrinkling was introduced through the Helfrich-Hurault deformation of the shear-aligned cholesteric phases. Our work reveals the mechanism of the wrinkling behavior evidenced by detailed morphological characterization using SEM. In single layered filaments, we identified four morphological zones with varying order of wrinkles. Through this work, we demonstrate the possibility of modifying the wrinkling behavior and thus the angle dependence of the color response by changing the printing conditions.", "date": "2022-09-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Liquid Crystals; Optical Materials; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we demonstrated a novel way to detect early tumour metastasis by utilizing background-negligible phosphorescence imaging at room-temperature, putting the detection limits ahead to the stage of tumour metastatic niches.

In 1960, Wasserman synthesized a molecule in which two rings are held together like in a chain, which is a topological isomer of the separated components, leading to the realization that molecules could be topologically non-trivial.

Here, we present a novel approach for the optimization of porous electrode microstructures from the bottom-up that couples a genetic algorithm with a previously validated electrochemical pore network model.

For the studied VO2+/VO2+ electrolyte, we find an increase in the fitness of 75% compared to the initial configuration by minimizing the pumping power and maximizing the electrochemical power of the system. The algorithm generates structures with improved fluid distribution through the formation of a bimodal pore size distribution containing preferential longitudinal flow pathways, resulting in a decrease of 73% for the required pumping power. Furthermore, the optimization yielded an 47% increase in surface area resulting in an electrochemical performance improvement of 42%.

The effect of nanoparticle size, shape, composition, nature of support or metal loading on a support can be studied in more systematic ways. The fundamental knowledge gained paves the way for catalyst optimization by tuning the catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. However, a major drawback is that most colloidal syntheses require the use of additives or surfactants, which are detrimental to most catalytic reactions since they typically block catalyst active sites.

We perform competitive ligand exchange reactions with carboxylate and phosphonate ligands at the surface of HfO2, CdSe, and ZnS nanocrystals. We monitor the ligand shell composition by solution 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Using a monoalkyl phosphinic acid with an ether functionality, we gain an additional NMR signature, apart from the typical alkene resonance in oleic acid and oleylphosphonic acid. We find that carboxylate ligands are easily exchanged upon exposure to monoalkyl phosphinic acids, whereas an equilibrium is reached between monoalkyl phosphinates and phosphonates, slightly in the favour of phosphonate (K = 2). Phosphinic acids have thus an intermediate binding affinity between carboxylic acids and phosphonic acids for all nanocrystals studied. These results enable the sophisticated use of monoalkyl phosphinic acids for nanocrystal synthesis and for post-synthetic surface engineering.", "date": "2022-09-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Ligands (Inorg.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Unique properties derive from the assembly of Mn-O octahedra into polymorphic structures that can host protons and non-protonic cations in interstitial sites. Despite many reports on individual ion-polymorph couples, much less is known about the selectivity of electrochemical ion insertion in MnO2. In this work, we use density functional theory to holistically compare the electrochemistry of AxMnO2 (where A = H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+ & Al3+) in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. We develop an efficient computational scheme demonstrating that Hubbard-U correction has a greater impact on calculating accurate redox energetics than choice of exchange-correlation functional. Using PBE+U, we find that for non-protonic cations, ion selectivity depends on the oxygen coordination environments inside a polymorph. When H+ is present, however, the driving force to form hydroxyl bonds is usually stronger. In aqueous electrolytes, only three ion-polymorph pairs are thermodynamically stable within water\u2019s voltage stability window (Na+ and K+ in \ud835\udefc-MnO2, and Li+ in \u03bb-MnO2), with all other ion insertion being metastable. We find Al3+ may insert into the \ud835\udeff, R, and \u03bb polymorphs across the full 2-electron redox of MnO2 at high voltage, however, electrolytes for multi-valent ions must be designed to impede formation of insoluble precipitates and facilitate cation desolvation. We also show that small ions co-insert with water in \ud835\udefc-MnO2 to achieve greater coordination by oxygen, while solvation energies and kinetic effects dictate water co-insertion in \ud835\udeff-MnO2. Taken together, these findings explain reports of mixed ion insertion mechanisms in aqueous electrolytes and highlight promising design strategies for safe, high energy density electrochemical energy storage, desalination batteries, and electrocatalysts.", "date": "2022-09-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Using single particle analysis (SPA) we were able to further interpret the information gained from SAXS and cryo-ET experiments, showing that increasing PBd22-PEO14 mole fraction increases the membrane thickness from 52 \u00c5 for a pure lipid system to 97 \u00c5 for pure PBd22-PEO14 vesicles. We find two vesicle populations with different membrane thicknesses in hybrid vesicle samples. As these lipids and polymers are known to homogeneously mix, bistability is inferred between weak and strong interdigitation regimes of PBd22-PEO14 within the hybrid membranes. It is hypothesized that membranes of intermediate structure are not energetically favourable. Therefore, upon formation, each vesicle selects one of these two membrane structures, which are assumed to have comparable free energies. We conclude that, by combining biophysical methods, an accurate determination of the influence of composition on the structural properties of hybrid membranes is achieved, revealing that two distinct membranes structures can coexist in homogeneously mixed lipid-polymer hybrid vesicles.", "date": "2022-09-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Polymer blends; Interfaces; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

DEL selections are typically performed with a purified protein target immobilized on a matrix or in solution phase. Recently, DELs have also been used to interrogate the targets in complex biological environment, such as membrane proteins on live cells. However, due to the complex landscape of the cell surface, the selection inevitably involves significant non-specific interactions, and the selection data is much noisier than the ones with purified proteins, making reliable hit identification highly challenging. Researchers have developed several approaches to denoise DEL datasets, but it remains unclear whether they are suitable for cell-based DEL selections. Here, we propose a new machine-learning (ML)-based approach to process cell-based DEL selection datasets by using a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation loss function, a probabilistic framework that can account for and quantify uncertainties of noisy data. We applied the approach to a DEL selection dataset, where a library of 7,721,415 compounds was selected against a purified carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA-2) and a cell line expressing the membrane protein carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA-12). The Extended-Connectivity Fingerprint (ECFP)-based regression model using the MAP loss function was able to identify the true binders and also reliable structure-activity relationship (SAR) from the noisy cell-based selection datasets.

Fingerstick collection of blood is easily performed at home, in the workplace, or at the point-of-care, obviating the need for a trained phlebotomist. While the initial collection of blood is facile, the diagnostic or clinical utility of the sample is dependent on how the sample is processed and stored prior to transport to an analytical laboratory. The past decade has seen incredible innovation for the development of new materials and technologies to collect low-volume samples of blood with excellent precision that operate independently of the hematocrit effect. The final application of that blood (i.e., the test to be performed) ultimately dictates the collection and storage approach as certain materials or chemical reagents can render a sample diagnostically useless. Consequently, there is not a single microsampling tool that is capable of addressing every clinical need at this time.

H2S, a physiologically potent agent and thiol congener, also reduces nitrate at copper(II) to NO generation, providing a lens into NO3-/H2S cross-talk in the biological milieu.", "date": "2022-09-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To achieve this goal, several screening strategies have been proposed, most of which require validation of thermodynamic stability and synthesizability of candidate materials via computationally intensive quantum chemistry or solid-state physics calculations. This problem can be overcome by reducing the number of calculations through machine learning methods, which predict target properties using unrelaxed crystal structures as inputs. However, numerical input representations of most of the previous models are based on either too specific (e.g., atomic coordinates) or too ambiguous (e.g., stoichiometry) information, practically inapplicable to energy prediction of unrelaxed initial structures. In this work, we develop direction-based crystal graph convolutional neural network (D-CGCNN) with the highest accuracy toward formation energy predictions of the relaxed structures using the initial structures as inputs. By comparing with other approaches, we revealed correlations between crystal graph similarities and model performances, elucidating the origin of the improved accuracy of our model. We applied this model to the on-going high-throughput virtual screening project, where the model discovered 1,725 stable materials from 15,318 unrelaxed structures by performing 3,966 structure optimizations (~25 %).", "date": "2022-09-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Alloys; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

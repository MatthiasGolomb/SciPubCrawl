Recently, the coupled-trajectory surface hopping (CTSH) method has been proposed to combine the key advantages of the coupled-trajectory mixed quantum-classical method based on XF and the fewest switches surface hopping. We here present a novel variant of CTSH, namely sign-consistent CTSH (SC-CTSH), which considers proper trajectory clustering to reconstruct the nuclear density distribution and the consistency between wave function and active states to introduce decoherence. Using the exact quantum solutions as references, the high performance of SC-CTSH is benchmarked in the widely studied scattering models and compared with other related XF-based methods. Due to the incorporation of new trajectory clustering and sign consistency algorithms, SC-CTSH obtains more accurate quantum momentum and decoherence during the nonadiabatic dynamics, which makes the combination of XF and surface hopping more consistent and reliable. This study further highlights the significance of internal consistency between wave function and active states, which is important in the further development of mixed quantum-classical dynamics methods.", "date": "2025-02-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this field, an increasing number of generative models focus on directly generating materials with desired properties more accurately, moving away from the traditional approach of enumerating vast numbers of candidates and relying on computationally intensive screening algorithms. However, we assert that without accurate prediction capabilities, effective material design is unattainable, as generating necessary structures becomes futile if their quality cannot be reliably evaluated.  Matbench provides an excellent foundation for predictive tasks, yet prior efforts with LLMs have primarily focused on composition-related tasks using models such as GPT or LLaMA. In this study, we revisit BERT, a relatively small LLM with 110 million parameters, which is significantly smaller than GPT or LLaMA models containing billions of parameters.  Remarkably, we demonstrate that BERT-base achieves comparable performance to these larger models in material property prediction tasks. Extending beyond composition tasks, we introduce BERT\u2019s application in structure prediction using CIF (Crystallographic Information File) data and natural language descriptions of structures.  Our results rival state-of-the-art composition models such as CrabNet and, in several tasks across datasets ranging from a few hundred to over a hundred thousand samples, even surpass traditional structure-based and knowledge-driven models.  Additionally, on the latest Matbench test task, Matbench-Discovery, our model outperformed the Voronoi RF model and achieved MAE results comparable to other models that rely solely on energy predictions. Our findings provide a new reference point for future LLM applications in material design, offering valuable insights for leveraging language model in this domain and emphasizing natural language descriptions over conventional model-centric design.

The specific compositions investigated here are B1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO2, B1Ce1Ag0.06TiO2, and B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2. From DLS analysis, the particle size of the synthesized catalysts was found to be in the range of 125 \u2013 500 nm. The XRD spectra confirmed the presence of cerium. The DRS analysis showed the bandgap energy of the synthesized catalysts to be in the range of 2.7 \u2013 2.8 eV. ICP-OES analysis was done to check the leaching of the dopants from the catalysts into the solution and the results showed that silver did not leach out while boron (~0.2 ppm) and cerium (~ 0.1 ppm) were present in trace amounts. The catalysts were also evaluated for the degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic under UV-A light. At optimized conditions, the best performing photocatalyst namely, B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2, showed ~54% degradation of the antibiotic in 120 min. This is attributed to the increased amounts of cerium and silver. Although the performance under UV-A irradiation is not encouraging, these results suggest that these catalysts may be more effective under visible or solar light and further work is needed to check the effectiveness under visible light irradiation as well as on larger scales of treatment.

Doping heteroatoms into a host crystal enables modulation of the physical properties without altering the intrinsic electronic structure. Doping copper ions in colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has been shown to suppress hot electron relaxation. However, the relationship between the local environment of the heteroatoms in the host crystal and the physical properties has been insufficiently explored. In this study, CdSe and InP QDs were synthesized in the presence of copper ions (Cu:CdSe and Cu:InP QDs, respectively). Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was performed to investigate the hot electron relaxation dynamics, and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were performed to elucidate the local environment of the copper ions. Hot electron relaxation was slower in the Cu:CdSe QDs than in the CdSe QDs, whereas no such trend was observed for the Cu:InP QDs. XAFS analyses indicated that the copper ions substituted for cadmium ions in the CdSe QDs, whereas the copper ions segregated on the surface of the InP QDs. This behavior can be explained by the solid solubility of the respective materials: CdSe and Cu2Se are miscible, facilitating substitution, whereas InP and Cu3P are immiscible, resulting in the formation of a heterostructure. The combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and XAFS measurements is an effective method for elucidating structure\u2013property relationships, and it will aid in comprehensively understanding the effect of heteroatoms in the host crystal on the physical properties.", "date": "2025-02-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Common hydrogen production methods include coal gasification, steam reforming, methane pyrolysis, and water electrolysis. All the hydrogen production methods produce a mixture of H2 and other products such as CO2, N2 and CH4 depending on the method. To separate hydrogen from the other molecules, common methods like cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption have been used widely. In addition to these methods, membranes can be used which offer energy efficiency compared to the previously mentioned methods. The widely used membranes for H2 separation are metallic membranes such as palladium-based membranes. Despite their high separation performance, they are not cost-effective. Another type of membrane that can address cost-efficiency, energy consumption, and performance limitations, is the polymeric membrane. Moreover, polymeric membranes are also solution-processable and thus bringing another advantage from a fabrication point of view. However, polymeric membranes usually suffer from a permeability-selectivity trade-off. Therefore, there is a need to improve the hydrogen separation performance of polymeric membranes, and one effective strategy is forming mixed matrix membranes (MMM). MMM is a composite membrane comprised of at least two components: polymers and fillers. The presence of the fillers in this type of membrane is important to improve the separation performance of the polymeric membranes. This review then aims to provide an overview of MMM used for hydrogen separation starting from their fabrication strategies until thorough discussions and assessments of different fillers. Moreover, this article also comprehensively evaluates the performance of the MMM by assessing their improvement on the separation performance and scrutinizing the impact of the filler's physical properties on the MMM performance.

The effectiveness and adaptability of the control strategy were demonstrated using cooling crystallization of mannitol in water as a case study. Key process parameters, including target particle size, seed loading, and seed population, were systematically varied to assess robustness and reproducibility of the control strategy.

Their structures and configurational assignments were determined using NMR, mass spectrometry, TD-DFT calculations, and retrobiosynthetic insights. Lusichelins feature a unique structural arrangement with thiazoline/thiazole rings connected by a vinyl group, an aliphatic carbon chain, or directly, enabling potential for hexadentate metal coordination.

The solvent accessible volume of the cage structures is approximated by a tetrahedral tessellation and is thereby able to adapt in shape and size during the simulation for flexible systems. With a symmetric and smooth function, we can determine a continuous loading by switching the solvent molecules from outside to inside. By applying a harmonic bias, the number of solvent molecules within the cavity can be systematically controlled, and e.g. by umbrella sampling the free energy profile for increased solvent loading can be computed. The approach is applied and validated for a purely organic porous solvent system and a palladium-based metal-organic cage compound. The influence of the smoothing parameter is tested and the results are com- pared to available experimental data as well as prior simulation results.

Here, we implement and critically assess machine-learning-enabled targeted free energy calculations derived from flow-based generative models to compute the free energy difference between two ice crystal polymorphs (Ice XI and Ic), modeled with a fully flexible empirical classical force field. We demonstrate that even when remapping from an analytical reference distribution, such methods enable a cost-effective and accurate calculation of free energy differences between disconnected metastable ensembles when trained on locally ergodic data sampled exclusively from the ensembles of interest. Unlike classical free energy perturbation methods, such as the Einstein crystal method, the targeted approach analyzed in this work requires no additional sampling of intermediate perturbed Hamiltonians, offering significant computational savings. To systematically assess the accuracy of the method, we monitored the convergence of free energy estimates during training by implementing an overfitting-aware weighted averaging strategy. By comparing our results with ground-truth free energy differences computed with the Einstein crystal method, we assess the accuracy and efficiency of two different model architectures, employing two different representations of the supercell degrees of freedom (Cartesian vs. quaternion-based). We conduct our assessment by comparing free energy differences between crystal supercells of different sizes and temperatures and assessing the accuracy in extrapolating lattice free energies to the thermodynamic limit. While at low temperatures and in small system sizes, the models perform with similar accuracy. We note that for larger systems and high temperatures, the choice of representation is key to obtaining generalizable results of quality comparable to that obtained from the Einstein crystal method.

We show that the uncatalyzed sulfite oxidation driven by O2 in aqueous microdroplets is size-dependent across varying O2 concentrations and temperatures. Sulfite oxidation rates scale with the surface-area to volume ratio (i.e. 1/radius) of the microdroplet and oxidation occurs in the absence of any added catalysts.

Herein, we report the synthesis and photocatalytic behavior of Ru@MOF-808, a Zr-based MOF that was post-synthetically modified with a Ru-polypyridyl complex. The post-synthetic modification was achieved using solvent-assisted incorporation of bipyridine-carboxylate ligands onto the nodes of the MOF-808, followed by the coordination of the Ru(II)-terpiridine moiety. A thorough characterization including 1H-NMR, diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and gas adsorption studies, combined with DFT calculations, provide strong support for efficient incorporation of the molecular Ru-complex at the loading of one Ru center per node. In the presence of a strong sacrificial reductant BIH(1,3-Dimethyl-2-phenylbenzimidazoline), Ru@MOF-808 was found to catalyze photochemical reduction of CO2 into a mixture of CO and formate ion. When compared to the homogeneous model catalyst Ru(tpy)(bpy)\u2082\u207a, Ru@MOF-808 was found to exhibit higher formate yields. To explain these formate enhancements, we propose a mechanism that involves the CO2 capture at the MOF nodes to form Zr-bicarbonate species, which further react in a hydride transfer reaction with photo-generated Ru-H donor, thereby outperforms molecular catalyst in HCOO- production.

In this work we apply a combination of X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations to describe the electronic structure and bonding properties in a series of dicobalt complexes supported by expanded pincer PNNP ligands. The compounds with silane ligands and a pseudo-octahedral coordination geometry exhibit Co-Co \u03c3 and multicentered bonding character, which we characterize from both the occupied and vacant perspectives via their strong contributions to the Co K-edge X-ray emission and absorption spectra, respectively. In contrast, the dicobalt complexes with a pseudo-tetrahedral coordination environment do not exhibit Co-Co bonding, due to symmetry constraints on orbital overlap and the 3d orbital occupancies of Co2+ ions in a tetrahedral ligand field. We extend the spectroscopically driven insights to theoretical evaluation of related dicobalt complexes with silane and hydride ligands to explain the presence or absence of a Co-Co bond in these species based on ligand coordination and symmetry arguments.

Sugarcane bagasse (SCPB) powder, treated with copper and/or nickel nitrates, was pyrolyzed in a TGA under nitrogen at heating rates from RT to 500 \u00b0C for 1 hour. TGA/DTG permitted monitoring the thermal events of SCPB which was found to be exacerbated by the introduction of metals.

The pyrolysis activation energies (Ea) of SCPB and SCPB/CuNi were determined using FWO and DAEM models.

Echavarr\u00eda; Daniel  Kocsi; Mohamed Abdellah; Starla Glover; Sara H Mejias", "abstract": "The lack of control in the protein-chromophore interaction network in designed bio-hybrids is one of the key challenges in the field. This issue makes the photoresponse of the generated bio-hybrids unpredictable, limiting their potential. In this study, we address this challenge by developing a biohybrid system using a small, de novo \u03b13 protein composed of three short \u03b1-helices connected by flexible loops. This design creates a simplified protein pocket in which folding is defined by a few amino acids, while the rest can be modified, enabling precise predictions through rational design. Based on this control, we showed a strategy to label the chromophore specifically achieving a well-folded Biohybridand to change the dielectric environment of the chromophore in a selective manner by locating aromatic amino acids at key positions in the pocket based on the structure of the \u03b13. In particular, we incorporated a pyrene chromophore at position 34, centrally located within the pocket in helix 2, and introduced aromatic amino acids\u2014phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan\u2014at position 18 in helix 1, at 0.3 nm distance from the chromophore. Our findings revealed that these amino acids not only affect the relaxation dynamics of the chromophore but also protein conformation in a correlated manner. Specifically, tryptophan-induced an open protein conformation, while phenylalanine and tyrosine promoted a closed conformation, as evidenced by changes in pyrene emission, which acted as a conformation reporter. Using an iterative approach that combines circular dichroism and protein engineering, we demonstrated that the conformational changes arise from the low folding energy of the \u03b13 protein (~4.3 kcal/mol). This low energy allows the protein's structure to be modulated by a single interaction serving as the sole energy input. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy showed that open conformations exhibited faster triplet-state decay than closed conformations. This study highlights the critical yet often overlooked role of protein-chromophore interactions in modulating Biohybrid photoresponses. It also establishes the \u03b13 protein as an ideal protein model system for studying these interactions with high potential for rational biohybrid design.", "date": "2025-02-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Biophysical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These catalysts were then applied to the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). The investigation focused on the effects of Co2+ or Co3+ substitution by Mn2+ or Mn3+ within the Co3O4 matrix on various properties, including physiochemical characteristics, morphology, microstructure, reducibility, thermal stability, as well as their impact on catalytic performance. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including XRD, SEM, BET, XPS, H2-TPR, and DRIFT, were employed to elucidate the underlying factors responsible for effective CO oxidation.

This finding is crucial for designing SF dimers for solar cells and photoredox catalysis, as it emphasizes the importance of considering acceptor/donor redox potentials relative to the T1 energy.", "date": "2025-02-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, these structures are shown to lose their integrity in body fluids due to dilution and protein interactions. The natural polymeric micelles (such as chitosan, alginate, collagen etc.) have attracted significant interest in recent years as drug delivery agents in the pharmaceutical field as they provide controlled release, drug targeting, hydrophobic active material solubilization, and high cell uptake efficiency due to their small size, with the added advantage of intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability, which is always a question with synthetic polymers. However, biopolymers in their natural form are not suitable for self-assembly, and they require assistance through the chemical modification of biopolymer molecules to obtain hydrophobic functional groups for self-assembly. However, recent studies have shown that the stability problem of synthetic polymeric micelles that encapsulate drugs physically still remains for natural polymeric micelles in the presence of proteins, even though they maintain their integrity with dilution in blood plasma, unlike synthetic polymeric micelles. This requires additional surface modifications to make the natural polymeric micelles protein resistant in the blood. Sometimes, the chemical modification of biopolymeric molecules is provided by the chemical bonding of hydrophobic drug molecules for self-assembly and to maintain the integrity of these types of micelles.

Force-separation (FS) curves clearly show that the solvent forms about 3 ordered layers near the iodine adlayer independent of potential. These ordered layers of solvent can be readily pushed away by the AFM tip. Regardless of solvent, transitions of the lateral adsorbate structure have been observed depending on potential and normal load, respectively. These structural transitions indicate that the structure of adsorbed iodine is very sensitive to the Ag coverage, and the tip penetrates the adsorbed iodine as normal load increases. Friction forces as function of normal load convincingly show the influence of the tip penetration on friction; plowing of the tip in the adsorbate layer leads to an additional friction force depending on potential and solvent. With increasing normal load in Ag+ containing tetraglyme (G4), friction increases steeply as the sliding tip penetrates the iodine adsorbed on Ag adlayers, in agreement with the results in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, friction increases more drastically as the concentration of water increases. Considering the high friction on Ag monolayer after the penetration into the iodine, there are two possible causes: 1) the reduced mobility of the iodine on Ag adlayer and 2) the interaction between water adsorbed on the tip and Ag adlayers. However, in Ag+ containing PC, in spite of the penetration of the tip into the iodine adlayer, friction force dependence on load does not show a clear distinction between gold and silver substrates.

First, we compute the energy\nrequirements of a long-haul truck for a 600-mile (966 km) real-world driving range and perform battery sizing. The battery sizes are used along with a fleet-replacement\nmodel and the U.S. payload distribution to compute payload losses for two different chemistries, Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) and Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP). Given present battery energy densities, BET fleets will require 1.06 and 1.27 times the trucks of a diesel fleet to provide the same cargo capacity. Next, we perform electricity pricing analysis for high-power applications. Our baseline scenario estimates a price of 0.32 USD/kWh, and it only decreases to 0.15 USD/kWh for the optimistic scenario. Currently, we compute the total cost of ownership for BETs to be more than twice (>2x) that of diesel trucks, however, the price premium is projected to decrease significantly to 1.2x in the long term. BETs could become economically competitive with diesel if the delivered cost of electricity for high-power applications drops below 0.1 USD/kWh, and if we realize projected improvements in battery energy density and cost. Our emissions analysis shows negligible present-day greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits from switching to BETs, primarily due to the carbon intensity of electricity generation. In the long term, we project BETs to have 40% less GHG emissions than diesel. Today, BETs are not well-suited for the long-haul trucking sector.

In this study, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics simulation as research tool to investigate the interaction formed between Lin28 and precursor element of let-7d, one of the 12 members of the let-7 family. By constructing systems of intact sequence length of preE-let-7d, our simulations suggest that both the loop region of hairpin structure and GGAG sequence can form stable interactions with the CSD and ZKD region of the protein, respectively.

In this study, we compare two different process concepts, with and without recycle, under realistic operating conditions using thermodynamic modelling and simulation. The H2/CO2 feed ratio is crucial to achieve sufficiently high methane selectivity and thereby reduce the effort in product gas cleaning and the overall process complexity.

Our initial efforts focused on identifying the factors that govern yield and selectivity in the cotelomerization of isoprene, butadiene, and CO2. The most effective cotelomerization/hydrogenation reaction sequence was scaled-up, leading to mixtures of two isoprene-butadiene coupled lactones (3-ethyl-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (EtPeP), and 3-ethyl-6-methyl-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2- one (EtVMeP) and the butadiene homocoupled lactone, 3-ethyl-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (EtVP). The ratios of these three lactones varied depending on telomerization conditions and purification methods employed. Stepwise syntheses of pure EtVMeP and EtPeP via alternate routes were also carried out. The pure lactones as well as lactone mixtures were subjected to organocatalyzed ring-opening (co)polymerization (ROP) using triazabicyclodecene (TBD), yielding CO2-based copolymers with molar masses (Mn) ranging from 5.5 to 12.7 kDa and narrow dispersities (\u0110 = 1.3). Increasing the proportion of EtPeP relative to EtVP led to a notable increase in the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the copolymers, reaching -20.5 \u00b0C. While EtPeP underwent successful ring-opening polymerization, reactions with EtVMeP resulted in termination of the polymerization owing to the formation of a non-nucleophilic tertiary alkoxide chain end. Thus, small amounts of EtVMeP can have a deleterious effect on copolymerizations of lactone mixtures derived from cotelomerization.

Efficient image fusion approaches are essential to exploit the complementary chemical information across different zoom scales. Most current image fusion algorithms tend to work by equalizing the spatial characteristics of the platforms to be combined, i.e., downsampling pixel size and cropping non-common scanned sample areas if required. In this work, a new image unmixing algorithm based on a flexible mathematical framework is proposed to enable working with all available image information while preserving the original spatial properties of every imaging measurement.\nThe algorithm is tested on a challenging image fusion scenario of fluorescence and Raman images collected on labelled HeLa cells. The system is relevant from an analytical point of view, since smart fluorescence labelling allows profiting from the excellent morphological information without causing interferences in the rich chemical information furnished by Raman. From a data handling perspective, it offers a challenging multiscale problem, where the fast fluorescence imaging acquisition allows recording full cell images, and the slower Raman image acquisition is focused on scanning only relevant small regions of the cells analyzed. By applying the image fusion algorithm proposed, an improved morphological and chemical characterization of cell constituents in the full cell area is obtained despite the different spatial scales used in the original imaging measurements.", "date": "2025-02-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Microscopy; Spectroscopy (Anal.

In particular, the Cantor alloy, CrCoFeMnNi, has attracted significant interest as a low-cost, earth-abundant alternative to Pt-group catalysts. However, the Cantor alloy is susceptible to degradation in acidic environments. To address this, Pt has been proposed as an addition to the Cantor alloy to leverage the high catalytic activity and surface stability of Pt. In this study, we identify and elucidate the catalytic activity trend for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) across the CrCoFeMnNiPt composition space. Assuming the formation of a Pt skin through surface reconfiguration, a machine learning-accelerated simulation protocol infers the strain-corrected adsorption strengths of key reaction intermediates and uses them as descriptors for kinetic modelling. Our results show that Pt-modification of the Cantor alloy is a potentially viable strategy towards active and durable ORR catalysts. However, we also observe binary Pt-rich alloys with approximately 80% Pt exhibit the highest ORR activity due to synergistic ligand and strain effects. As this analysis identifies known alloys with high ORR performance, we suggest that this framework contributes to a clear understanding of how bulk composition affects the reaction kinetics of complex surface alloys.

This study presents a theoretical analysis and experimental validation of AFM-IR for imaging subsurface features within organic multilayer structures, revealing previously unobserved differences in imaging broadening.  An analytical model based on the sample geometry demonstrates that the lateral size of the absorber significantly impacts both the signal intensity and spatial resolution in AFM-IR chemical imaging. These findings are experimentally validated, and a more true to (sample) reality finite element method (FEM) model was subsequently created, resulting in strong agreement with the experimental data. The model reveals how irregular structures directly impact photothermal expansion, providing an explanation for the distinct image broadening observed with infrared excitation of different layers.

For example, it has been reported that NBs exist in water over long periods (i.e. weeks to months) and can act as free gas reservoirs. However, NBs are a source of scientific debate, particularly regarding characterization methods. Conventional methods, such as dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and nanoflow cytometry, cannot distinguish between nanoparticles and NBs since they are insensitive to the differences of the physical properties of the materials. However, acoustic (speed of sound) measurements can be used to quantify NBs because they rely on the compressibility dependence of gases (\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60) which is considerably larger than liquids (\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f) and solids. In the present work, a speed of sound measurement for nanobubble characterization (SONIC) was designed and developed to probe the compressibility variations diagnostic to NBs in water. NBs in water act as acoustic scatters that reduce the speed of sound relative to the bubble-free water. This decrease in the speed of sound can only be attributed to the existence of gas bubbles due to the strong compressibility dependence that solid nanoparticles lack. The results obtained from the acoustic measurements are compared with the observations from nanoparticle tracking analysis to confirm the existence of NBs in water. SONIC was validated in water with different molalities of NaCl (aq), and in the presence of solid nanoparticles of similar size and concentration to the NBs. SONIC is the first technique that addresses an important bottleneck of NB characterization by providing an accurate and selective characterization on NBs in complex water mixtures that will help understand the behaviour of NBs and accelerate their application in many fields.", "date": "2025-02-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Analytical Chemistry - General; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we propose approaches to help mitigate nutrient pollution via the development of cyanobacteria-based processes that capture phosphorus from dairy manure. Using engineered strains of cyanobacteria, we were able to increase biomass phosphorus density 8.5-fold with no impact on growth rate, producing biomass that contained 14% phosphorus by mass. Techno-economic modeling revealed that the dramatic increase in phosphorus density leads to a significantly more cost- and resource-efficient process, with over a 2-fold reduction in total annualized cost (TAC), 8-fold reduction in required land use, 3-fold reduction in energy usage, and fully eliminating the use of freshwater. Further analysis showed that combining the mutant strain with a simplified nutrient recovery process resulted in a phosphorus recovery charge (PRC) of 9.2 USD per kg P, which is 88% lower than an estimated socioeconomic cost of P runoff (75 USD per kg P) and equivalent to a service charge of 0.015 USD/gal of manure processed. By using cyanobacteria biomass as a P-dense biofertilizer, the proposed approach can help facilitate nutrient transportation and the transition to a more circular agricultural economy.

Its non-invasiveness makes it a perfect tool for monitoring chemical reactions and determining their products and kinetics. Typically, the reactions are monitored by a series of 1H NMR spectra acquired at regular time intervals. Even such a straightforward approach, however, often suffers from several problems. In particular, the reaction may cause the sample inhomogeneity, resulting in a non-homogenous magnetic field and distorted spectral lineshapes. When the studied process is fast, the hardware correction (shimming and locking) cannot be applied on the fly, and the spectral quality degrades over the course of the reaction. Moreover, when non-deuterated solvents have to be used in the reaction mixture, a magnetic field-stabilizing system (deuterium lock) cannot work. Consequently, the spectra have distorted lineshapes, reduced resolution, and randomly varying peak positions, making them challenging to analyze quantitatively with standard software. In this paper, we propose a conceptually new approach to quantitative analysis of a series of distorted spectra.

Therefore, to achieve maximal efficacy, ASOs require efficient nuclear delivery. Current ASO therapeutics shuttle in and out of the nucleus inefficiently. In this work, we have synthesised ASO conjugates for active nuclear import, by covalent conjugation with a potent small-molecule nuclear importer, (+)-JQ1.

This workshop provided an opportunity for researchers to see user-developed infrastructure in action, learn about how they could integrate these projects into their work, and contribute to discussion about what is needed to advance the state of democratized SDLs. In this perspective, ten contributed examples of user-developed hardware and software from the workshop are highlighted. Despite a diverse array of projects, common motivations for pursuing user-developed infrastructure were cost savings and specification requirements that were unmet by commercially available products. Continuing to advance the state of user-developed automation infrastructure will require commitments to completing high-quality documentation for open-source hardware projects, pathways for materials researchers to learn hardware development skills, and more opportunities for researchers to share their infrastructure advancements, in addition to the scientific advancements that they enable.

Alternative mediators have been proposed to address this challenge, but only calcium has shown some success, with NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ~50%, while voltage requirements far exceed 3 V.

This review focuses on mesostructuring of SiCN ceramics through microphase separation of direct inorganic precursor-block-organic copolymers and other significant approaches. This approach is particularly advantageous, as the resulting mesostructured SiCN ceramics can be precisely tuned by adjusting polymer ratios, controlling thermal cross-linking, and implementing programmed pyrolysis.

By incorporating metal precursors into amphiphilic copolymers prior to microphase separation and pyrolysis, a convenient and efficient route to catalytic materials is established.

To fully exploit the potential of these biocatalytic systems, an atomistically detailed mechanistic understanding of their activity is pivotal.\nTo this end, this study sheds light on two fundamental stages of the catalytic cycle of PET and PEF hydrolysis by PETase\u2014acylation and deacylation\u2014using hybrid QM/MM enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to capture all relevant dynamic effects. Well-tempered metadynamics simulations at the DFTB3 level are performed along collective variables optimized via linear discriminant analysis, a supervised learning-assisted approach that accounts for the contributions of each potentially relevant degree of freedom. The free energy (FE) profiles indicate that the acylation stage is the rate-limiting step for both PET and PEF degradation, with barriers \u2248 8 kcal/mol and \u2248 4 kcal/mol higher than those obtained for the deacylation step, respectively. Remarkably, substantial mechanistic differences are found. While PET acylation occurs in a concerted manner, with a single energy barrier of \u2248 21 kcal/mol, PEF acylation follows a two-step mechanism where after the first barrier, \u2248 10 kcal/mol high, a metastable intermediate state is formed, which then evolves towards the product once a second barrier of \u2248 2 kcal/mol is overcome. This mechanistic description is consistent with the FE profiles obtained at higher levels of theory (PBE, B3LYP, RI-MP2) via FE perturbation, thus validating the key insights elucidated by metadynamics simulations. Finally, both global and local reactivity descriptors derived from conceptual density functional theory (DFT) suggest that PEF is more electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack than PET.\nThe results obtained by means of the robust computational protocol adopted here offer for the first time thermodynamic and mechanistic insights into PET and PEF hydrolysis by PETase at the molecular level.

Recent elucidation of the 3D structure of HpaA offers novel opportunities for targeted therapeutic strategies to inhibit bacterial adhesion. This study aims to computationally characterize the interactions between HpaA and antibodies to identify potential candidates for therapeutic intervention against H. pylori infection. I hypothesize that high-affinity binding of specific antibodies to the specific binding site of the HpaA protein can effectively block bacterial adherence to gastric epithelial cells, thereby mitigating H. pylori-induced pathogenesis. AlphaFold 3 obtained the HpaA three-dimensional structure, providing a foundation for in-silico docking studies. Molecular docking simulations using HDOCK predicted antibody binding interactions and were validated using ScanNet, a deep learning-based method. Binding energy was calculated using the PRODIGY software, and hydrogen bond analysis was performed. Antibody 1IL1 demonstrated the strongest binding affinity to the HpaA protein. Additionally, to understand the binding interactions between the HpaA and annexin proteins, I performed AlphaFold 3 simulations, which showed that the apical region of the HpaA was involved in the annexin interaction. The results were consistent with lab experimental findings, and to the best of my knowledge, this is the first computational study on HpaA-mediated prevention of H. pylori interaction with the gut lining.

As the C-C units in the molecules are continuously replaced by B-N units, almost all geometric parameters change monotonically, while almost all electronic properties undergo a turning point at (BN)4C10, suggesting that (BN)4C10 may have special optoelectronic properties. The isotropic polarizabilities of (BN)nC(18-2n) (n = 1\u20139) decrease sequentially with an increase in the number of B-N units in the molecule, while the total first hyperpolarizabilities as well as the values corresponding to second harmonic generation (SHG) and hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) experiments first increase and then decrease, reaching their respective maximum at (BN)4C10.

However, the broad utility of such motifs is limited, for example, by the broken conjugation though the central, sp3-hybridized, carbon or silicon atom(s). To enrich their functionality, we reason the central atom could be exchanged for a transition metal to improve electronic coupling between the \ud835\udf0b-conjugated substituents and impart reversible redox properties. In evaluating this hypothesis, here we probe single-molecule junctions comprising oligoaryl wires with tetrahedral osmium(IV), silane, or methane centers. Surprisingly, we find that transport through junctions formed from the intact molecules in a non-polar, inert solvent appears largely independent of the central atom identity. In contrast, the conductance of junctions comprising an osmium(IV) wire can be modulated in an electrochemical environment by a factor of 47, to values 80\u00d7 higher than for a silane analogue, by opening the bias window asymmetrically about the electrode Fermi level (EF). These measurements also indicate that such compounds can undergo in situ reactions that result in junctions comprising their dissociated oligoaryl arms, linked by chemisorbed Au-C(sp2) contacts. Our experimental results are supported by first principles calculations, which predict the osmium(IV) wires are substantially more conductive than the organic analogues due to their delocalized and well-coupled frontier orbitals with energies close to EF.

BiOCl is a characteristic layered ferroelectric material that contains [Bi2O2]2+ layers arranged anisotropically along the c-direction. However, the depolarization and polarisation of BiOCl are significantly influenced by the thickness of its nanosheets. In this study, europium (Eu3+)-doped BiOCl nanosheets resembling a 2D-dimensional structure have been synthesized using the solid-state grinding method at ambient temperature. As a result of the depolarization effect, the intensity of the electric dipole (ED) transitions 5D0 \u2192 7F2 and 5D0 \u2192 7F4 increases in Eu3+-doped BiOCl nanosheets. Further, electric force microscopy (EFM) confirms that the electric field is present in close proximity to the surface of Eu3+-doped BiOCl.

A hybrid Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP)/Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel approach is used to distribute the computational load among processor cores and compute nodes. The intermediates at both the MP2 and the CCSD(T) levels are expressed in a density fitting formalism, using only three-index quantities to decrease the amount of data to be stored and communicated. To further reduce compute time, the frozen natural orbital, the natural auxiliary function, and the natural auxiliary basis schemes are implemented in a hybrid parallel manner. The combination of these three approximations and our recent size-consistent explicitly correlated triples correction with the new hybrid parallelization offers a unique accuracy-over-cost performance among explicitly correlated CC methods. Our comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate excellent parallel scaling of the cost-determining operations up to hundreds of processor cores. As demonstrated on the non-covalent interaction energy of the corannulene dimer, highly- accurate explicitly correlated CCSD(T) calculations can be carried out for systems of 60-atoms and 2500 orbitals, which were beyond computational limits without local correlation approximations. This enables various applications, such as benchmarking of or, for certain size ranges, replacing local CCSD(T) or density functional methods as well as the further advancement of robust thermochemistry protocols designed for larger molecules of ca. 20\u201350-atoms.", "date": "2025-02-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These mixtures form polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes in solution that can adsorb on solid surfaces and significantly reduce friction. Experiments have shown that the charge density of polyelectrolytes affects their adsorption and conformation on the surface, which are expected to strongly influence their lubrication performance. Here, we use coarse-grained, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study how different charge densities and surface coverages of a polyelectrolyte, cationic guar gum, in the presence of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate, influence hair friction. We observe improved lubrication for polyelectrolytes with higher charge densities on biomimetic surfaces representative of both virgin and bleached hair. This is attributed to an increase in surface separation, which is facilitated by higher retention of interfacial surfactants and water. Higher polyelectrolyte surface coverages also result in lower friction through this mechanism. At sufficiently high polyelectrolyte surface coverages, friction becomes insensitive to the level of chemical damage on the hair surface. Most polyelectrolytes have flat, train-like conformations, particularly at high charge density and low surface coverage. The number of tail and loop conformations increases at lower charge density and higher surface coverage, but this has a minor effect on friction compared to the amount of water and surfactant trapped inside the contact. These simulations show considerable promise for virtual screening of polyelectrolytes with optimal lubricity performance in liquid formulations.", "date": "2025-02-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Polyelectrolytes - Polymers; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In particular, enantioselective preparation of atropisomers is of great interest due to their privileged status as chiral ligands and pharmacophores. Although chromatographic- or crystallization-based methods are commonly used to separate atropisomers, we urgently need more efficient and economical approaches to access enantioenriched atropisomers. The use of stereoconvergent methods to access molecules with point chirality is well established, but we have not yet tapped the potential of stereoconvergent catalytic methods to arrive at enantioenriched atropisomers. We recently discovered deracemization activity in a wild-type P450 enzyme and explored its ability to deliver a stereoconvergent route toward enantioenriched atropisomers. Using a curated set of P450 variants, we found that a wide variety of symmetric and non-symmetrically substituted 2,2\u02b9-binaphthol (BINOL) building blocks can be deracemized to high enantiomeric purity. Further, we demonstrated that this deracemization activity is mechanistically distinct from activity of previously reported P450 enzymes, which operate through enantioselective bond formation to afford enantioenriched atropisomers, whereas, the deracemization process reported here is proposed to proceed through bond rotation.  As engineered variants have complementary selectivity profiles and substrate scope, this biocatalytic platform should be readily tunable for any desired substitution pattern.

The Diamond:H-Transitional Metal Oxide AO sensor (DiMO) was characterized using RF plasma-based and laser detonation AO facilities. Tungsten oxide, WO3, with thickness ranging from 6 nm to 30 nm was used as the TMO coating of choice.

Unfortunately, natural AMPs are prone to proteolytic cleavage in vivo and have relatively low selectivity for microbial versus human cells, motivating the development of synthetic peptidomimetics of AMPs with improved peptide stability, activity, and selectivity. However, a lack of understanding of structure-activity relationships for peptidomimetics constrains development to rational design or experimental predictors, both of which are cost and time prohibitive, especially when the design space of possible sequences scales exponentially with the number of amino acids. To address these challenges, we developed an iterative Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach to explore a large design space of 336,000 synthetic \u03b1/\u03b2-peptide analogues of a natural AMP, aurein 1.2, based on an initial training set of 147 sequences and their biological activities against microbial pathogens and selectivity for microbes vs. mammalian cells. We show that the quantification of prediction uncertainty provided by GPR can guide the exploration of this design space via iterative experimental measurements to efficiently discover novel sequences with up to a 52-fold increase in antifungal selectivity compared to aurein 1.2. The highest selectivity peptide discovered using this approach features an unconventional substitution of cationic amino acids in the hydrophobic face and would be unlikely to be explored by conventional rational design. Overall, this work demonstrates a generalizable approach that integrates computation and experiment to accurately predict the selectivity of AMPs containing synthetic amino acids, which we employed to discover new \u03b1/\u03b2-peptides that hold promise as selective antifungal agents to combat the antimicrobial resistance crisis.

We explore the transition to dynamic, data-driven methodologies, emphasizing the integration of hybrid mechanistic-machine learning models that bridge first-principles knowledge with data. Further, we highlight the importance of transdisciplinary concepts from ecological sciences such as non-linear dynamics and resilience to the design of industrial networks and supply chains. The perspective uncovers how these dynamic phenomena influence system stability, adaptability, and long-term sustainability by incorporating concepts such as time delays, hysteresis, and time-variant characteristics. We further examine stability landscapes and adaptive cycles to demonstrate how resilience thinking redefines process design and control strategies in the face of global uncertainties. The emergence of advanced computational tools, such as spatial-temporal deep learning architectures and adaptive process control strategies, is reshaping the sustainability of manufacturing supply chains.

Here, we present a combined purification and desalting procedure for fucoidan, which is based on a solid-phase extraction (SPE) principle using a silica-containing column like those found in common DNA purification kits. We find that a mini spin column from a commercial DNA kit can recover >1 milligram of fucoidan and remove molar scale salts in a single step.

Furthermore, the Cu-hairpins can also perform light-driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes, an activity that is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far.

This also explains why identification/classification of species can be so readily and universally done by GP. It requires the perspective on the nature of spiddos.

One of the most widely used types of 3D printers is the stereolithography SLA or the masked stereolithography (m)SLA, which uses light to photo crosslink a liquid resin to solid objects layer by layer. 3D printable resins consist of numerous components, with the biggest part consisting of usually methacrylates or acrylates. However, contrary to the trend of reducing plastic consumption, the methacrylates used for SLA resins are mainly petroleum derivatives. Bio-based options made with soybean oil have become commercially available in the last few years. These oils are not very sustainable as soybeans have a high demand for land and water use, and there is competition for using soy as food/feed or for materials. In contrast to soybeans, microalgae have simple nutrient requirements and do not need arable land or freshwater, excluding them from competition with crops. They also have a high CO\u2082 fixation and can produce and store a high oil content of up to 75% by biomass weight, which can be used for the production of the resin. Here, we show how to produce 3D printable resins based on microalgal oil.

Characterization of such intermediates can be delicate as some processes can proceed very fast, inducing a short temporal window for their characterization. The problem is particularly true for the so-called prenucleation species, for which this difficulty is made worse due to their solubility, nanometric size and highly dynamic nature. In this communication, we introduce an innovative approach based on the \"trapping\" of reactive intermediates in a vitreous matrix, inspired by cryo-TEM sample preparation but adapted specifically to solid-state NMR characterization. This approach enables time-resolved analysis since the aging time of the mineralizing reaction is controlled on the milliseconds time-scale using a dedicated stopped-flow device. The cryo-fixation is achieved by spraying the reacting solution in cold liquid isopentane at -145\u00b0C, and the NMR rotors are filled with specifically designed packing tools, ensuring the control of the low temperature during the whole process. Finally, the cryo-fixed solution can be studied by low-temperature solid-state NMR by acquiring time-resolved NMR spectra as snapshots of the ongoing reaction. First, we show that phosphate solutions can be efficiently vitrified using this protocol and studied by low-temperature 31P solid-state NMR at -120 0C. We demonstrate that the 31P chemical shift interaction of cryo-quenched solutions varies with the pH, allowing us to distinguish the different phosphate species coexisting in solution (PO43-, HPO42-, H2PO4-and H3PO4) based on their chemical shift anisotropy patterns, which is characteristic of their protonation degree. The determination of the proportion of each species at varying pH levels enables us to construct the speciation diagram under our experimental conditions. We observe that the \"apparent pKa,\" i.e., the pH values for each chemical equilibrium, are slightly influenced by the low temperature, and possibly by the preparation conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be applied to study fast calcium phosphate crystallization, revealing the early stages of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nucleation within just 20 ms of reaction time, as shown by 31P ssNMR. Importantly, the described methodology is the first step towards studying fast out-of-equilibrium solutions through trapping and then studying by solid-state NMR of transient intermediate species. Indeed, proper freeze quenching prevents the transient species from transforming and preserves their native environment, such as hydration, pH, or ionic strength.

In these cathodes, cation-\u03c0 interactions significantly influence Li+ diffusion and storage properties in \u03c0-conjugated cathodes, but classical OPLS-AA force fields fail to capture these effects. This study employs a bottom-up approach based on density functional theory (DFT) to optimize the nonbonded interaction parameters (OPLS-AA/corr.), particularly for the Li+-\u03c0 interactions with the PTBT polymer. Following prior work, we used an ion-induced dipole potential to model the cation-\u03c0 interactions. The impact of the solvent on the PTBT monomers was examined by computing the potential of mean force (PMF) between PTBT monomers and Li+ ions in both explicit and implicit solvents using the Boltzmann inversion of probability distributions close to room temperature. In the implicit solvent case, the magnitude of the binding free energy decreased with increasing dielectric constant, as the dominant electrostatics scaled with the dielectric constant. In contrast, in the explicit solvent case, considering the mixtures of organic solvent DME and DOL, the binding free energy shows minimal dependence on solvent composition due to the competing interaction of TBT and Li+ with the solvent molecules. However, increasing salt concentration decreases the binding free energy due to Debye-H\u00fcckel screening effects.

In the complex molecular environment of biomolecular building blocks, however, it is unclear which chemical and structural dynamic features support electronic conductivity. Here, we investigate the role of finite temperature fluctuations on the electronic structure and its implications for conductivity in a peptide-based fiber material composed of an antiparallel coiled coil hexamer, ACC-Hex, building block. All-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) are combined with interpretable machine learning (ML) to understand the relationship between physical and electronic structure of the peptide dimer subunit of ACC-Hex. For 1,101 unique MD ``snapshots\" of the ACC peptide dimer, hybrid DFT calculations predict a significant variation of near-gap orbital energies among snapshots, with an increase in the predicted number of nearly degenerate states near the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which suggests improved conductivity. Interpretable ML is then used to investigate which nuclear conformations increase number of nearly-degenerate states. We find that molecular conformation descriptors of inter-phenylalanine distance and orientation are, as expected, highly correlated with increased state density near the HOMO. Unexpectedly, we also find that descriptors of tightly coiled peptide backbones, as well as those describing the change in the electrostatic environment around the peptide dimer, are important for predicting the number of hole-accessible states near the HOMO.

In this work, we used DFT calculations to better understand the effects of different substituents on the radical reac-tivity of thionolactones (dibenzo[c,e]oxepane-5-thione DOT derivatives) already described as more or less effective for copol-ymerization with vinyl monomers in order to adjust the reactivity of these thionolactones. To carry out these calculations, we focused on the value of the transfer constant ktr and its relationship to the propagation constant kp of the vinyl monomer. The calculations performed subsequently on 7-phenyloxepane-2-thione (POT) derivatives highlighted that electron-donating groups inserted in para-position on the phenyl ring should improve the copolymerization efficiency with acrylate derivatives and in contrary electron-withdrawing groups should lead to more important compositional drift during styrene and acrylate copolymerization. Although POT derivatives bearing electro-donating groups could not be prepared, the preparation of those with CF3 and NO2 groups was successfully achieved. Experimental copolymerization of these two thionolactones with sty-rene and isobornyl acrylate are in good agreement with the calculations. This result confirmed the versatility and relevance of our calculation approach to account for the reactivity of thionolactones.", "date": "2025-02-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Several methods employ an empirical correlation between the residence time and the measured simulation time for a ligand to escape the binding pocket during biased molecular dynamics (MD), while others rely on more formal approaches that require a substantially larger computational effort and/or setup times often impractical in a fast-paced drug-discovery setting. Here we propose a new scheme to calculate absolute residence times by using two enhanced sampling approaches, consisting of an exploration phase followed by an exploitation phase that estimates the residence time: Random Acceleration Molecular Dynamics (RAMD) to harvest plausible egress pathways, and then Infrequent Metadynamics (iMetaD) to estimate residence time. This protocol caters to drug discovery programs, where a key aspect is the compromise between accuracy, throughput, and ease of use. We benchmark this approach by computing residence times for a congeneric series of ligands binding to several diverse drug targets and show that we can achieve good accuracy (RMSE of 1.22 and R2 of 0.80 in log10(\u03c4)) without manually tuning the enhanced sampling parameters.", "date": "2025-02-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

For example, redox active ligands mediate f-block reactivity with small molecules and have applications in molecular magnetics in homometallic Ln systems, yet have not been incorporated into heteromultimetallic complexes.

However,  operational stability, the Achille\u2019s heel of all emerging photovoltaics, has been largely  overlooked in PIMs research so far, making it difficult to forecast their practical use in real- world applications. In this work, we analyse the operational stability of a promising new PIM  composition, CsMAFA-Sb:Bi, generated through the antimony:bismuth co-alloying of a triple  cation vacancy-ordered antimony-based PIM. Through an in-depth theoretical and  experimental investigation, we demonstrate that the co-alloying induces local structural  changes that lead to enhanced microstructure, reduced trap-assisted recombination, and  increased solar cell power conversion efficiency (PCE), with the highest value being 3.05%.  Accelerated aging tests according to ISOS L-1 and L-2 protocols highlight the crucial role of  co-alloying in enhancing stability. Specifically, maximum power point tracking at 85 \u00b0C shows  a projected T80 lifetime of 275 hours for CsMAFA-Sb:Bi devices, which has never been  achieved not only for any other PIM-based device but also for high-efficiency technologies,  such as lead halide perovskite solar cells with similar device constituents.

The need of high concentration of organochloride limits the application in cancer therapy as most small molecule organochlorides show liver toxicity at elevated concentrations. To study if the oxidation is feasible at low concentration of organochloride, we proposed a reaction network where the effect of molecular oxygen is included. We hypothesized that oxygen competes with the organochloride to react with aqueous electrons, thereby causing a low yield of ROS at low organochloride concentrations. However, oxygen is necessary in the ROS formation pathway, which complicates straightforward prediction of reaction outcome. We developed a mathematic model to simulate the yield of ROS depending on organochloride and oxygen concentrations. The simulated results indicate that at low organochloride concentration, decreasing oxygen concentration leads to higher yield of ROS, with a peak at approximately 2% partial pressure of oxygen, and oxygen lower than 2% results in a sharp yield drop of ROS. Experiments using a thioether as reductant to quantify the ROS formation show good agreement with simulated data, verifying the proposed network. After irradiation in phosphate buffer saline/organochloride, a thioether caged drug showed efficient uncaging yield, demonstrating the viability of using thioether as a radiation-sensitive group.", "date": "2025-02-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Radiation", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, their limited structural variety makes it challenging to tailor their lubrication properties for specific applications. This study demonstrated the potential of two-dimensional silver thiolate (AgSR) coordination polymers, which feature distinctive organic\u2013inorganic lamellar crystal structures, as tunable solid lubricants based on the precise structural design. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that various AgSR compounds with linear alkylthiolato and para-substituted benzenethiolato ligands formed layered structures with high crystallinity. Ball-on-disk friction tests were performed on powder-supported specimens to assess the solid lubricating properties of AgSR. The AgSRupported specimens with alkylthiolato ligands demonstrated a coefficient of friction (COF) of approximately 0.1, considerably lower than that of the well-known layered materials, MoS2 and alkylammonium-intercalated mica. This exceptional lubricity of AgSR is likely attributed to their unique interlayer structures, which exhibit minimal interdigitation of alkyl chains. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses of the worn surfaces of the AgSRupported specimens revealed that AgSR compounds create lubricating films on the sliding substrates. Furthermore, for a series of AgSR compounds featuring para-substituted benzenethiolato ligands, the COF values were highly affected by the functional groups at the para position, which affected their interlayer interactions. Strong interlayer interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, resulted in considerable increases in the COF to approximately 0.7, suggesting that the lubrication properties of AgSR are derived from the ease of cleavage in their layered crystal structures. These findings imply that AgSR offers considerable advantages over traditional inorganic layered materials for the tailored development of custom solid lubricants.", "date": "2025-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, understanding how these parameters are influenced by profile shape and instrumentation remains a key challenge, as these factors fundamentally determine the precision and efficiency of analytical measurements. To address this, we derive analytical solutions for the precision of Lorentzian profile peak parameters under Poisson noise constraints using the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao inequality and Fisher information. By comparing these precision limits with those of Gaussian profiles, we identify the peak characteristics that strongly influence parameter precision. Our results demonstrate that the profile slope and tail intensity are critical factors for estimating peak position and position differences, with Gaussian profiles exhibiting higher precision under identical conditions. Conversely, the weaker intensity\u2013bandwidth correlation in Gaussian profiles contributes to their superior precision in intensity and bandwidth estimation. Additionally, Lorentzian profiles show a \u221a3-fold improvement in area ratio precision over intensity ratio precision, surpassing the corresponding improvement in Gaussian profiles. This distinction arises from the larger area and stronger intensity\u2013bandwidth correlation inherent in Lorentzian profiles. These findings highlight the significant impact of profile shape on peak parameter precision, providing essential guidance for decision-making in instrument design and analytical conditions. By integrating these analytical solutions with insights from analytical chemistry, we establish a theoretical framework linking peak parameter precision with instrument performance. This framework enables quantitative evaluation of the effects of equipment and experimental design improvements on measurement precision.

It presents a significant challenge in various fields, especially in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, wound healing, and medical devices. To develop effective antifouling solutions, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying biological attachment. For example, surface properties, such as hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and texture, play a key role in avoiding the formation of biofilms that facilitate the incorporation of other microorganisms. While current antifouling strategies are generally effective on hydrophilic surfaces, they often exhibit reduced efficacy on hydrophobic ones due to limited surface interactions. Here, we propose the use of amphiphilic random copolymers, which combine both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, as a promising solution for adapting to different surface types. In particular, this study explores the use of amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-(2-acetoacetoxy ethyl methacrylate) (P(OEGMA-co-AEMA)) copolymers as adaptive coatings to prevent biofouling. Chemical characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) confirmed the successful synthesis of the copolymers. Additionally, their ability to form antifouling layers on both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was evaluated using advanced techniques such as atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry. Bacterial adhesion experiments demonstrated an 80% reduction in biofouling, highlighting their potential for various biomedical applications such as medical device coatings.\n\n", "date": "2025-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Coating Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The results, together with ex-situ XRD measurements, reveal that BiF3 undergoes multiple-step phase transformations upon defluorination (from original o-BiF3 to c-BiF3 and then o\u2019-BiF3) before the formation of Bi metal, showing an intercalation-type mechanism. In addition, the formation of Bismuth oxidefluoride (BiOF) at later discharged state (beyond a capacity of 200 mAh g-1) is observed, which is attributed to oxygen impurities from the solid electrolyte introduced by the applied solid state synthesis method. Operando XAS measurements confirm the continuous reduction of the Bi oxidation state from +3 to 0 and the formation of multi-intermediate phases during the defluorination process. Through Rietveld analysis on operando XRD patterns we obtain the quantification of phase fractions and crystal structure information of intermediate phases during the defluorination process, from which we are able to derive a model for the first defluorination process of BiF3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the comparison between the results from operando XAS and operando XRD indicates that BaSnF4 plays a crucial role on the transport process of not only F- but also oxygen impurities within the BiF3 cathode composite, contributing to the formation of the oxidefluoride phase.

In this study, we demonstrate that PZSs are able to catalyze the conversion of various N-hydroxylated diamines, which are different from the natural substrate. The N-hydroxylated diamines were obtained in situ using N-hydroxylating monooxygenases (NMOs), allowing subsequent cyclization by PZS, ultimately forming the N-N bond to yield various N-N bond-containing heterocycles. Using bioinformatic tools, we identified novel NMO and PZS homologs that exhibit distinct activity and stereoselectivity profiles. The screened panel yielded 17 hydroxylated diamines and new promiscuous NMOs, thereby expanding the substrate range of NMOs resulting in the formation of previously poorly accessible N-hydroxylated products as substrates for PZS. The subsequently investigated PZSs led to a series of 5- and 6-membered N-N bond-containing heterocycles, and the most promiscuous catalysts were used to scale up and optimize the synthesis, yielding the desired N-N bond-containing heterocycles with up to 45% isolated yield.

This has inspired their use in water purification and desalination, a critical emerging need. However, stability, scalability, and cost have prevented their widespread adoption in water purification membrane technologies. As such, attention has turned to the use of artificial water channels, with pore functionalized polymers and macrocycles providing a powerful alternative. Whilst impressive rates of transport have been achieved, the combination of a scalable, high-yielding synthesis and efficient transport has not yet been reported. Herein, we report such a system, with densely functionalized channel interiors, synthesized by high-yielding living polymerization with low polydispersities, showing high salt exclusion, and excellent water transport rates.

This technique, known as optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), has been applied on diamond-NV centres and transition metal complexes. Metal-free counterparts of these optically addressable spin qubits promise to be cheaper, more sustainable colour centres with prolonged polarisation lifetimes. However, progress has been hindered by the low ODMR signals of carbon-based \u03c0-diradicals, partly due to the lack of a ground singlet-to-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC). In this work, we propose to explore organic systems that are even more electron-deficient: electron sextets. Using triplet carbenes as an example, we illustrate how the ground singlet-triplet gap can be widened beyond thermal energy with the associated singlet-to-triplet ISC made available by vibronic effects. Through careful molecular engineering, this ISC can occur at a rate similar to and with an opposite spin selectivity from the excited-state ISC well-established in \u03c0-diradicals, unlocking a new ODMR pathway with potential signal gains. Persistent triplet carbenes is a renascent field with multiple stable molecules being isolated in the past five years. To motivate further development of its emissive properties, we illustrate our design in two realistic carbene candidates that incorporate existing strategies for carbene stabilisation.

The same is predicted to be valid for the properties of multiexcitons. To realize applications exploiting the generation of multiexcitons in colloidal nanocrystals, it requires a comprehensive understanding of size and surface influence e.g., on the lifetimes of multiexciton species. In this study, we employ intensity-dependent transient absorption spectroscopy to probe multiexcitons in long-chained organic (phosphonic acids and trioctylphosphine oxide), and short inorganic ligand (sulfide, S2\u2212) capped colloidal CdSe quantum dots of four different sizes. To analyse the intensity-dependent transient absorption data a global fit method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling was employed. Applying a simple Auger recombination model lifetimes and spectra of multiexciton species were analysed. The spectra obtained for different multiexciton species exhibit both size and surface functionalization dependent features, which allow us to distinguish between different species. Independent of the surface modification, we find that the multiexciton lifetimes follow the volume scaling laws established earlier. Owing to the strong surface hole trapping induced by the S2\u2212 ligands, S2\u2212-capped QDs show prolonged multiexciton lifetimes compared to the QDs capped with the native organic ligands with long alkyl chains. Deconvoluting contributions of bleach, stimulated emission and photoinduced absorption in the species spectra enables us to determine multiexciton binding energies. We observe a decrease of binding energies with increasing size and a clear reduction in multiexciton binding energies for the S2\u2212 -capped QDs. The observed trends can be explained by changes in the overlap of electron and hole wave functions depending on the QDs diameter and the charge carrier localization which can be induced by trapping in surface defect sites.

This study  systematically evaluates the impact of tokenization, molecular representation, pre-training data, and adversarial  training on a BERT-based model for yield prediction of Buchwald-Hartwig and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions  using publicly available HTE datasets. We demonstrate that molecular representation choice (SMILES,  DeepSMILES, SELFIES, Morgan fingerprint-based notation, IUPAC names) has minimal impact on model  performance, while typically BPE and SentencePiece tokenization outperform other methods. WordPiece is  strongly discouraged for SELFIES and fingerprint-based notation.

A use of artificially generated domain-specific pre-training data is proposed. The artificially generated sets prove  to be a good surrogate to the reaction schemes extracted from reaction data sets such as Pistachio or Reaxys. The best performance was observed for hybrid pre-training sets combining the real and the domain-specific, artificial data. Finally, we show that a novel adversarial training approach, perturbing input embeddings  dynamically, improves model robustness and generalisability for yield and reaction success prediction.

O2-GEN excels in generating fused-ring systems and conjugated fragment assemblies, achieving nearly 100% validity and novelty. It signifi\u0002cantly outperforms existing models in speed and chemical structural validity, particularly for larger molecules. The framework supports both global and local generation modes, allowing for the creation of new molecules or modifications of existing structures. Additionally, O2-GEN integrates a property selector finetuned with density functional theory data, enabling precise multi-property screening. This framework offers a powerful tool for rational design and high-throughput screening of OOMs, with potential applications to drug discovery and energy materials.", "date": "2025-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we quantify SEI conductivities and SEI transference numbers using a separator-free Cu|SEI|Li architecture that treats the SEI as a functional solid-state electrolyte (SSE). We discover that while any SEI property alone (e.g., electronic conductivity) is weakly correlated (R2<0.71) with battery performance (e.g., Coulombic efficiency), a strong correlation (R2>0.99) can be achieved by defining the \u201cSEI cT number\u201d as a product between the SEI transference number (T) and the ratio of SEI conductivities (c). Analogous to the thermoelectric figure of merit (i.e., zT), SEI cT quantitatively benchmarks the holistic impact of SEI properties on battery performance and underscores the pitfalls of citing such properties in isolation. Perhaps most strikingly, we demonstrate that Li metal deposition and stripping at room temperature is possible in our separator-free Cu|SEI|Li cell, confirming that the SEI can function precisely as an SSE.

However, significant challenges including surface defects (delamination, burr, surface roughness), rapid tool wear and material transition issues in drilling CFRP/metal stack, underscore the need for effective, automated process prediction / optimization for improved machining performance. Conventional physics-based models often fall short due to their reliance on extensive computational resources and inability to capture CFRP\u2019s complex machining dynamics arising from thermo-mechanical load coupling and process uncertainties. To address these limitations, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising, data-driven solutions that reduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge while delivering fast, accurate predictions by uncovering patterns within dataset.

They can clearly reveal various interactions between specific fragments, and become widely popular in recent years. This chapter first briefly reviews the definition and characteristics of the two methods, and then introduces a new variant of IGM, called modified IGM (mIGM), which, like IGM, only requires atomic coordinate information to perform the analysis and thus the computational cost is fairly low, while its graphical quality in exhibiting weak interactions is almost as good as the markedly more expensive IGMH. This chapter then introduces the averaged mIGM (amIGM) method, which extends mIGM to visual analysis of the weak interactions involved in molecular dynamics trajectories. A series of examples fully demonstrate that amIGM can well display all kinds of weak interactions in dynamic environments, and its image quality and flexibility are all superior to the previously proposed averaged noncovalent interaction (aNCI) method with similar uses.", "date": "2025-02-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, PTAA-based PSCs often exhibit lower efficiencies than their Spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, presumably due to the absence of perovskite passivation techniques suitably employed to PTAA HTMs. In this study, phenylalkylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PRA-TFSI) was developed as a spontaneous perovskite passivator specifically tailored for PTAA HTMs. The influence of alkyl chain lengths in PRA cations was systematically explored using newly synthesized PRA-TFSI with carbon chain lengths ranging from 1 to 4: benzylammonium-TFSI (Bn-TFSI: C1), phenylethylammonium-TFSI (PEA-TFSI: C2), phenylpropylammonium-TFSI (PPA-TFSI: C3), and phenylbutylammonium-TFSI (PBA-TFSI: C4). During the deposition of PTAA solutions containing PRA-TFSIs on perovskite photoabsorbers, spontaneous perovskite passivation formed monolayer-like overlayers, offering thermal stability at 85 \u2103. This approach contrasts with conventional iodide salt-based passivation techniques, which mostly generate two-dimensional perovskites (e.g., (PEA)2PbI4) under thermal stress, potentially degrading photovoltaic performance. Notably, longer alkyl chains in PRA cations more effectively suppressed defects on perovskite surfaces owing to their accessibility to the physically deeper defects, which is a unique trend exhibited by PRA-TFSIs. Additionally, the resulting passivation layer enhanced the interfacial affinity between PTAA and the perovskite layer, likely owing to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions facilitated by the phenyl moiety in PRA cations, except for PBA-TFSI, because its long alkyl chain weakened the affinity. Among the PRA-TFSIs, PPA-TFSI (C3) emerged as the optimal passivator, achieving a power-conversion efficiency of up to 23.2%, which is high among PTAA-based PSCs with n-i-p structures\u2014particularly among those that are Li-free, not subjected to post-passivation, and possesses substantial PTAA attachment on perovskite layers \u2014with retention of the prominent thermal stability at 85 \u2103.

Heptazine (Hz) being an exceptionally strong electron acceptor and the phenoxazines being strong electron donors, these novel compounds are expected to exhibit low-lying singlet and triplet states of pronounced charge-transfer (CT) character. The excited-state electronic structures of these chromophores were investigated with electronic absorption and emission spectroscopies, electrochemical methods, and ab initio electronic-structure calculations. The UV-Vis absorption spectra in the solution were assigned by comparison with computed vertical electronic excitation energies. The absorption spectra exhibit strong transitions to the bright locally-excited 1\u03c0\u03c0* state of the Hz core as well as to bright low-lying singlet CT states. The calculations predict that the vertical excitation spectra of all three compounds exhibit singlet-triplet inversion, that is, the lowest singlet state of the Hz core is lower in energy than the lowest triplet states of CT character, albeit the S1 and T1 states are nearly degenerate in H3. When the 0-0 transition energies are considered, on the other hand, the CT states are lowest in energy in all three compounds, and singlet and triplet CT states are nearly degenerate, which is confirmed by stationary and time-resolved spectroscopy in thin solid films.

However, experiments are often difficult to interpret, and the development of computationally affordable approaches to simulate experimental signals is desirable. For linear spectroscopy, optical spectra of small to medium-sized molecules can be efficiently calculated in the Franck-Condon approach. Approximating the nuclear degrees of freedom as harmonic around the ground- and excited-state minima, closed-form expressions for the exact finite-temperature linear response function can be derived using path-integral approaches, fully accounting for Duschinsky mode-mixing effects. In the present work, we demonstrate that a path-integral approach can be utilized to yield analogous closed-form expression for the finite-temperature nonlinear (third-order) response function of harmonic nuclear Hamiltonians. The resulting approach, named FC2DES, is implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs), allowing efficient computations of 2DES signals for medium-sized molecules containing hundreds of normal modes. Benchmark comparisons against the widely used cumulant method for computing 2DES signals are performed on small model systems, as well as the nile red molecule.

We found that some defects are very reactive with hydrogen thereby definitely trapping hydrogen in defective h-BN. However, depending on hydrogen partial pressure, less reactive defect sites can be populated. Because of the lower binding capability of these sites, they would allow for hydrogen to be recycled and recovered. For small defect sizes, we found that hydrogen preferentially bind to nitrogen sites by forming N\u2014H bonds, and if no N sites are available then boron sites would be the next to bind hydrogen. Hydrogen dissociation via Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) is found to be more favorable than forming only N\u2014H bonds but only if the defect size is large enough to accommodate steric effects. For specific conditions such as T= 400 K, p_(\"H\" _\"2\"  )=1 bar, and only considering one molecular H2 per defect, three defects, namely the N monovacancy, 3V(1B2N), and hexagonal 6V(3B3N) could play a role in both the activation and recycling of H2, as they would be reacting enough to allow a favorable splitting of H2 while not binding too strongly to allow its recovery. More broadly, a range of p_(\"H\" _\"2\"  ) and hydrogen loading conditions were investigated for different types of defects and the finding suggests that p_(\"H\" _\"2\"  ) could be used to fine tune the Gibbs free energy of hydrogenation, thereby allowing several types of defects at different hydrogen loading content to play a role in the activation/recovery process of H2 in defective h-BN.", "date": "2025-02-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previous work suggests hydrogen diffuses through the top passivating oxide layer to initiate hydriding reactions within the underlying grain boundaries (GB). However, the atomistic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the structural factors that control its initiation are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, here we use a high-throughput density function theory (DFT) workflow to investigate the adsorption of H and H2 in the defective bulk UO2. Specifically, we exhaustively investigated the adsorption of H (107 sites) and H2 (26 sites) in three different coincidence site lattice (CSL) GBs: \u03a33, \u03a35, and \u03a39. Compared to the binding energies in pristine UO2, we observe significantly stronger hydrogen adsorption at these GB sites. Interestingly, we find that the trends in H and H2 adsorption vary considerably across the three GB models. In particular, while a small number of sites in \u03a35 and \u03a39 show exothermic adsorption of H and H2, respectively, no such sites are found in \u03a33. Further statistical analysis of these trends suggests that H adsorption, which is adsorbed as a hydride anion (i.e., H-), is positively correlated with the value of its negative charge and depends on the number of neighboring oxygen and uranium atoms.

These buffers will have different pH values, and it has become clear that pH differences can translate to dramatic effects on MOF-catalyzed rates. Predicting the relative magnitude and even the direction of rate variations, however, is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the rate laws involved in CWA (or agent simulant) hydrolysis and their relationship to the nature of the catalyst active-site.

We explore the role of oligomerization, multivalency and co-operativity in PPI inhibition. Hot-spot residues from an MCL-1 binding peptide (NOXA B) are grafted onto the outer surfaces of homo- and hetero-dimeric coiled-coil peptides to obtain inhibitors with mid-nM potency and selectivity over BCL-xL. Binding of ho-modimeric coiled coils to MCL-1 is positively co-operative resulting in stabilization of both part-ners. Homodimeric coiled coils support binding of two copies of the target protein. Modification of the coiled-coil sequence to favor assembly of higher-order scaffolds (trimer and tetramer), negatively impacts inhibitory potency, with AlphaFold2 modelling and biophysical data indicat-ing a complex interplay between coiled-coil oligomerization and target binding. Together, these data establish dimeric coiled coils as the most-promising of such scaffolds to develop inhibitors of \u03b1 helix-mediated PPIs.

Using solution NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that both ligands selectively bind the hybrid QDH conformation while exhibiting negligible affinity for the antiparallel topology. High-resolution NMR structures reveal that both ligands localize at the G-quadruplex-duplex (Q-D) junction but with distinct binding dynamics. Our results indicate that ligand binding specificity depends on factors such as ligand structure and the Q-D interface's integrity rather than the base pair's nature or the length of the lateral duplex domain. Stable capping structures, such as the G-C-G-C quartet in antiparallel PIM1 QDH, hinder specific binding with high affinity.

Despite similar color changes during breakdown, oxidative hair dyes and natural melanin have not been directly compared, until now. \n\nThis paper proposes that oxidative hair dyes and melanin degrade through the same fundamental process: chromophores progressively break down under oxidative stress, shifting the visible hue from cool to red and then from red gradationally to yellow.\n\n When exposed to UV light, heat, air, and water, oxidative color undergoes structural changes that mirror the oxidation of natural melanin, resulting in warmth and lightening. This suggests that fading is not limited to pigment loss and leaching but follows a predictable chemical degradation pattern that alters both color characteristics and visual presentation. The warmth that emerges is not solely due to exposed residual melanin exposure, but also to changes in light absorption and reflection caused by the progressive loss of conjugated bonds in the dye molecule itself.\n\nIn contrast, non-oxidative (commonly basic) dyes used in hair coloring are preformed chromophores so they \ndo not follow this oxidative degradation model. \nThese dyes bind to the hair fiber without undergoing oxidative coupling, making them structurally more stable against environmental breakdown. Instead of shifting warm as they fade, preformed dyes lose their most UV sensitive components first, often leaving behind residual blue and green hues.\n\nThis fundamental difference in fading behavior has long been a source of confusion in the practical application of hair coloring processes. \nThe disparate behavior of these preformed dyes supports the idea that only oxidative dyes share a common stepwise breakdown pattern with melanin due to their reliance on oxidation for color formation.\n\nThis hypothesis bridges hair color chemistry and natural pigment degradation, providing a new framework for understanding color longevity. If validated, it could lead to advancements in oxidative dye formulations. \n\nWhile much research has focused on the science behind hair dye chemistry, these studies rarely connect to practical execution. Understanding the nuanced degradation of oxidative dyes provides a critical link between scientific research and real world color services. \nIt allows for more clarity in the education provided to stylists. This will  facilitate more precise formulation adjustments, improving color longevity and minimizing unwanted warmth.\nFurther study of oxidative dye breakdown at the molecular level could enable cosmetic laboratories to develop more stable oxidative systems or identify mechanisms to slow degradation, enhancing the durability of cool tones. Bridging this gap between laboratory research and practical application has the potential to drive advancements in formulation science, professional hair color performance, and artistry behind the chair. \n", "date": "2025-02-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this work, we present the first excited-state nonadiabatic simulations of heptazine-based molecules and aggregates, aiming to elucidate the role of nonradiative pathways in their photorelaxation processes. Our results reveal that isolated heptazine and melem (C6 N10 H6) molecules return to the ground state via conical intersections within sub-picosecond timescales following photoexcitation.\nIn contrast, melem aggregation, driven by strong hydrogen bonding, markedly suppresses nonradiative photorelaxation through two mechanisms: (i) inter-molecular charge transfer, which reduces the likelihood of electron-hole recombination via internal conversion, and (ii) molecular packing, which prevents ring deformation, thus reducing the occurrence of conical intersections.

Quantification was carried out after the PEGs had been separated, each characterized by a number that typically indicates the average molecular weight of the molecules. Although PEGs are relatively high in molecular mass, the chromatographic conditions were adjusted to enable their clear resolution, which is crucial for ensuring reliable and precise quantification of these standards. Separation was achieved using an Ultra-hydrogel DP column (Waters), which specializes in size exclusion and is designed to allow effective separation of polymers of varying sizes. The mobile phase consisted of a water-acetonitrile mixture in a 65:35 ratio. This composition ensured the optimal separation and enhanced resolution of the samples. The separated PEGs were detected using a refractive index detector, which enabled highly accurate quantitative analysis of the various standards. The six PEG standards employed in this work were PEG300, PEG400, PEG1500, PEG4000, PEG6000, and PEG8000. Remarkably, all these standards were successfully separated in less than 10 minutes, demonstrating the efficiency and rapidity of the developed method. To ensure the robustness and reliability of the method, a set of validation parameters was rigorously assessed. Specificity was confirmed by verifying the absence of interferences from other components in the sample matrix. Linearity was evaluated by analyzing the detector response to different PEG standards across a concentration range, and a considerable degree of correlation was obtained. Precision and intermediate precision were confirmed through repeated analyses, with minimal variation observed between repetitions, thus ensuring the reproducibility of the method. Furthermore, accuracy of the method was validated by comparing the experimental results with theoretical molecular weight values, which showed an excellent agreement between the two, reinforcing the method\u2019s validity. This present study makes a significant contribution to the field of analytical methods for characterizing biopolymers. The optimization of the HPLC-SEC method, coupled with a full validation, enables the precise and rapid determination of the molecular weight of the studied biopolymer, which is essential for its potential use in various industrial applications. Moreover, this methodology could be useful for the analysis of other biopolymers, paving the way for further advancements in the analysis of polymers in different contexts, including biomaterials, biotechnological products, and environmental studies.", "date": "2025-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Initially, we studied FROMP of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-norbornene (HMNB) monomer using the second-generation Grubbs catalyst (G2) as initiator. In contrast with the model FROMP system of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), HMNB is a liquid that contains hydroxyl groups capable of inhibiting G2.

Site requirements are often inferred from the number of metal atoms an adsorbate coordinates to, which can underpredict the number of contiguous sites that are inaccessible to co-adsorbates by lateral repulsion. Here, we instead determine adsorbate site requirements from the surface areas they exclude from co-adsorbates. These areas are determined from adsorbate structures, optimized previously using density functional theory (DFT), by projecting their molecular volumes onto the surface plane (AS) or by tracing their areas with a circular probe that represents co-adsorbates (Aenc).

They predict a number of sites needed for ethane hydrogenolysis on Ir nanoparticles (two to three exposed Ir atoms) that is consistent with previous kinetic measurements and DFT calculations. The areas further estimate site requirements for benzene hydrogenation on Pt nanoparticles (six exposed Pt atoms) that accurately describe rate dependences on benzene pressure, under physically realistic benzene and H-adatom coverages and with adsorption enthalpies consistent with experimental benchmarks.

In this report we describe a promising inhibitor- design campaign which unexpectedly failed in the experimental test phase, and the likely source for that failure. The target protein for this research was the papain-like protease (PLPro) from SARS-CoV2, which cleaves the host's interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein and leads to the weakening of type 1 interferon response. In this work, we have performed a QSAR-based search of the PubChem database to find molecules with higher affinity to PLPro and, consequently, better inhibitory effect than previously-confirmed inhibitor GRL-0167. The 50 detected candidates were docked to the structure of PLPro, and the complexes of the three molecules bound to the experimentally-confirmed S3-S4 pocket were subjected to triplicate molecular dynamics simulations to ascertain the stability of the binding mode. The simulations showed that one of the candidates remained stably bound to the inhibitory pocket. Analysis of binding energies showed that this molecule was at least as good a binder as previously-confirmed inhibitors. Despite such promising results, these candidates failed experimental validation, and a simple, newly-developed, computational protocol identified self-aggregation as the likely reason for this lack of success. Widespread adoption of this simple protocol will highlight ligands prone to this unhelpful behavior, and hopefully increase the success rate of future molecular design campaigns.", "date": "2025-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Additionally, models with chemical specificity, such as Martini, may extrapolate to cases where experimental data is scarce, making CG methods highly promising for high-throughput (HT) screenings and chemical space exploration. Yet no rigorous data formats exist for the crucial aspect of describing how the atoms are grouped (i.e., the mapping). As CG models advance toward true HT capabilities, the lack of mappings and indexing capabilities for the growing number of CG molecules poses a significant barrier. To address this, we introduce CGsmiles, a versatile line notation inspired by the popular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) and BigSMILEs. CGsmiles encodes the molecular graph and particle (atom) properties independent of their resolution and incorporates a framework that allows seamless conversion between coarse- and fine-grained resolutions. By specifying fragments that describe how each particle is represented at the next finer resolution (e.g. CG particles to atoms), CGsmiles can represent multiple resolutions and their hierarchical relationships in a single string. In this paper, we present the CGSmiles syntax and analyze a benchmark set of 407 molecules from the Martini force field. We highlight key features missing in existing notations that are essential for accurately describing CG models. To demonstrate the utility of CGsmiles beyond simulations, we construct two simple machine-learning models for predicting partition coefficients, both trained on CGsmiles-indexed data and leveraging information from both CG and atomistic resolutions.

In this work, the ferryl heme form of IsdG was characterized because it is an analogue for the immediate product of enzyme-catalyzed heme hydroxylation. The ferryl heme form of IsdG generated following the addition of meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to the ferric heme form of IsdG has a half-life of 4.0 \u00b1 0.2 min, which is more than 100 times longer than the half-life for the ferryl heme form of human heme oxygenase (hHO). Magnetic circular dichroism characterization of the IsdG species yielded spectral data and zero-field splitting parameters consistent with either a compound II- or compound ES-like ferryl heme. Further characterization of isotopically-enriched samples with elec-tron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the presence of a protein-based organic radical, as would be ex-pected for compound ES. Finally, multi-scale quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics and time-dependent density functional theory strongly suggest that the ferryl heme form of IsdG has a ruffled porphyrin ligand and an oxo ligand.

Whereas industrial ammonia synthesis relies on the energy-intensive Haber\u2013Bosch process, nitrogenase enzymes achieve this transformation under ambient conditions\u2014yet at the expense of a remarkably high ATP demand. Understanding their mode of operation could inspire the development of more efficient synthetic catalysts. In this study, we scrutinize the role of electrostatics in nitrogenase\u2019s active site, surrounding the so-called M-cluster. Strikingly, all M-clusters reveal similar trends, exhibiting distinct electrostatic environments at the metal sites that have been proposed as potential N2-coordination sites. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site favors the cleavage of the Fe6\u2013S\u2013Fe2 sulfido bridge, exposing the Fe6 center for N\u2082 binding. Moreover, an oriented long-range electric field along the Fe2\u2013Fe6 axis is identified, which may assist in N\u2082 activation towards hydrogenation, once the nitrogen takes on a bridging configuration between both metal sites. Our findings suggest that nitrogenases likely exploit electrostatic effects in an unconventional manner; rather than directly favoring the coordination of N2 to the M-cluster, they primarily modulate the kinetics (and thermodynamics) of key mechanistic steps preceding, and following, the absorption step.

In particular, diamine-functionalized M2(dobpdc) (dobpdc4- = 4,4\u2019-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3\u2019-dicarboxylate), an extended analogue of M2(dobdc), has demonstrated exceptional CO2 selectivity under humid conditions owing to its unique cooperative CO2 capture mechanism. Despite these advantages, its CO2 diffusion behavior\u2014a critical parameter for practical applications\u2014remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of pore size and diamine functionalization on CO2 diffusion in Mg2(dobpdc). By employing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLPs), we achieve quantum-level accuracy within classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enabling the examination of large-scale systems comprising over 4,000 atoms on nanosecond timescales. To elucidate the CO2 diffusion behavior, we compare Mg2(dobpdc) with its smaller-pore counterpart Mg2(dobdc) and larger-pore analogue Mg2(dotpdc) (2,5-dioxido-1,4-terephthalate). Four distinct diamines\u2013m-2 (N-N'-methylethylenediamine), m-2-m (N,N\u2019-dimethylethylenediamine), e-2 (N-ehylethylenediamine), and e-2-e (N,N\u2019-diethylethylenediamine)\u2013are appended to Mg2(dobpdc) and Mg2(dotpdc) to evaluate their influence on CO2 diffusion. The developed MLPs exhibit root mean square errors (RMSEs) of less than 5 meV/atom for energies and 0.3 eV/\u00c5 for forces, compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with MLP-optimized lattice parameters deviating from DFT values by no more than \u00b12%. For bare MOFs, our MLPs accurately predict CO2 binding enthalpies and the localized CO2 feature near open Mg sites, consistent with experimental observations. This results in low diffusion coefficients (2.0 x 10-11 m2/s \u2013 3.1 x 10-10 m2/s) at low CO2 uptake. For Mg2(dobpdc) and Mg2(dotpdc), which possess larger pore sizes than Mg2(dobdc), the diffusion coefficients increase with increasing CO2 uptake. This trend is attributed to the saturation of Mg sites, which reduces interactions between free CO2 molecules and Mg ions. At one CO2 per Mg, the diffusion coefficients are calculated as 2.1 x 10-9 m2/s and 3.7 x 10-9 m2/s for Mg2(dobpdc) and Mg2(dotpdc), respectively. Diamine functionalization further enhances CO2 diffusion (0.8 x 10-9 m2/s ~ 13.2 x 10-9 m2/s) by reducing access to open Mg sites and introducing complex interactions between diamine units and CO2 and between ammonium carbamate units and CO2. However, at high CO2 loadings, steric hindrance caused by functionalized diamines decreases the diffusion coefficients (1.6 x 10-9 m2/s ~ 6.1 x 10-9 m2/s), particularly in Mg2(dobpdc) due to its smaller pore size relative to Mg2(dotpdc). These findings provide valuable insights into the interplay between pore architecture, functionalization, and CO2 diffusion in bare and diamine-functionalized MOFs.

Thus, developing a highly active, durable, and binder-free anode is beneficial for advancing alkaline water electrolysis for broader applications. This study presents a new yet effective surface sulfidation method for converting commercial FeNiCo alloy, Kovar, into highly active, stable, and binder-free OER electrodes. This surface sulfidation step leads to surface enrichment of Ni, higher oxidation states of Ni and Fe, and sulfur incorporation into lattice oxygen, which enhances the formation of (oxy)hydroxide and modulates the binding energy of *OH intermediate species. Hence, the surface sulfidized Kovar electrode demonstrated a significant enhancement in OER performance, with an overpotential as low as 261 mV at 10 mA/cm2 (compared to 345 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for as-received Kovar), a Tafel slope of ~ 40 mV/dec, and robust stability over 120 hours in 1 M KOH.

However, the industrial use of laccase is often limited by its inactivation under harsh conditions, including the presence of non-aqueous solvents, extreme pH and high temperatures. To overcome these challenges, various solvent engineering strategies have been explored, including the use of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) as environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional organic solvents. In this study, the effects of NADESs composed of betaine, choline chloride, L-proline, and sorbitol were evaluated. Sorbitol was consistently used as the hydrogen bond donor to assess the impact of different hydrogen bond acceptors. Laccase activity, structural stability and interactions with the NADES components were investigated using enzyme activity assays, intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and molecular docking studies. The results revealed a significant enhancement in laccase activity when Betaine:Sorbitol NADES was used, suggesting its potential as a sustainable solvent system for industrial applications.

As expected, the forces were in the range of a few 10\u00b4s of piconewtons. They could be easily resolved with the optical lever technique, provided that data were accumulated and averaged for a few minutes. The time resolution of the experiment was 200 microseconds. The kinetics were rather complicated. There was a fast movement of the negatively charged cantilever towards the positively charged electrode, which in most cases was not kinetically resolved and in other cases lasted a few milliseconds. This first step was followed by a reverse motion, which in most cases could be interpreted as a relaxation. The time scale of this motion roughly matched the time scale, over which the electric current through the electrodes decayed. The electric current was mostly due to double layer recharging, possibly accompanied by some charge transfer at the electrodes. The current caused a decay of the electric field at the cantilever, hence the decay of the cantilever deflection. Interestingly, the second stage occasionally drove the cantilever deflection to the opposite side. The second process in these cases overcompensated the first process, which is in conflict with the notion of this second process being entirely caused by a relaxation. The cantilever never came to rest over a few milliseconds. The origin of the slow movement in the final stage of the modulation cycle may be rooted in convection.

Singh; Justin P.  Lomont; Boyong Wan; Chi Zhang", "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy is a powerful method for analyzing chemical compositions across diverse samples. Spontaneous Raman scattering (spRS) provides complete Raman spectra but typically yields low signal levels, requiring long signal integration times. In contrast, stimulat-ed Raman scattering (SRS) produces much stronger signals, allowing for rapid spectral acquisition, and has been widely used to accelerate chemical imaging. Despite advances in both techniques, it remains unclear which method offers superior limits of detection (LODs) for molecules in biological samples. While theoretical comparisons under ideal conditions suggest that performance depends on photon flux and integration time, no experimental studies have directly compared the LOD of spRS and SRS spectroscopy. In this study, we systemati-cally compare the LOD of frequency-domain spRS and SRS for water-soluble analytes in aqueous solutions, a common environment for biological specimens. We first introduce a simplified LOD estimation methodology by taking only three measurements to derive the dilu-tion maximum (DM). This methodology achieved LOD estimates closely aligned with those obtained through serial dilution. Using this approach, we assessed the impact of various parameters, including Stokes laser power, the presence of beam scanning, number of pixels, and pixel dwell time, on the LOD of SRS spectroscopy and determined optimal conditions for SRS. Our results demonstrate that at short inte-gration times, SRS exhibits shot-noise-limited performance, with LOD inversely proportional to the square root of the acquisition time. At longer integration times, photothermal effects can cause deviations from ideal LOD scenarios. Under optimized experimental conditions, spectral-domain SRS confidently detects ~700 \u03bcM dimethyl sulfoxide in water and 1 g/L glucose and bovine serum albumin in aqueous solutions without spectral averaging. This performance can surpass that of spRS spectroscopy, even with equal or longer integration times.", "date": "2025-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Spectroscopy (Anal.

The preference for specific shapes varies at different stages of oligomer formation, depending on the oligomer size. A theoretical model is proposed to fit collisional cross-section (CCS) data and is verified through both nIM-MS experiments and MD simulations, ultimately establishing an anisotropic growth mechanism for liraglutide.

The result leads to an infinite spectrum of possible GRD diffusivity coefficients, and thus growth rate, values. Therefore, a family of possible equilibrium size distributions exist. It is demonstrated how this result can be used to describe the equilibrium size distributions reported for lactose and sucrose crystal growth where the distribution was suggested to be composed of two crystal ensembles each with a distinct kinetic behavior. The model predicts that different types of crystals, each with distinct kinetic behavior growing from a pure solute, are most likely to be observed when the growth rate diffusivity coefficient is on the order of the bulk solute diffusivity coefficient.

The addition reaction of DEtTIIP-NCO and betaAla-OEt yielded DEtTIIP:CO-betaAla-OEt, and the 1,3-diethyl ester is highly resistant to alkaline hydrolysis due to the steric shielding by the adjacent 2,4,6-iodines, while the -ethyl ester of the Ala substructure was easily removed.

The Mn2+ content of manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MnxFe3-xO4) deeply impacts their structure, magnetism, and, thus, their capacity as nanoheaters. To properly unveil how Mn2+ content influences these parameters, it is essential to synthesize monodisperse MNPs with similar sizes and shapes. Herein we report the synthesis of a wide range of MnxFe3-xO4 with x = 0.14 to 1.40, with similar polyhedral morphologies and sizes (13 to 15 nm) to exclude the crucial role that size and shape play. We demonstrate that high Mn2+ levels (x \u2265 0.70) lead to structural changes and the appearance of strain defects reflected in their poor saturation magnetization (Ms) values but, without modification of the final crystallite size. For the rest of the samples (in the range of x = 0.0 up to 0.70), average Ms values remain nearly constant despite Mn2+ levels, but the coercive field (Hc) varies significantly, indicating the critical role of composition in driving the transition of the particles towards soft magnets behaviors. As MNPs were synthesized in organic solvents, they were transferred into water using a polymer coating. Even when this step is often overlooked, water transference results in cations leaching, promoting vacancies and changes in the local ferrite structure. These changes had a minor impact on Ms values, suggesting that leaching probably affects the cations located closer to the surface. The magnetic heating capabilities were evaluated by calorimetry and AC magnetometry, finding that the heating capacity increased as the Mn2+ content increased (x \u2264 0.60). Lastly, selected MNPs (x = 0.07 and 0.60) were incubated with MIA PaCa-2 cell line for 24 h, showing an absence of cell cytotoxicity together with a high internalization rate independent of the compositions used.

In this work, we present a machine learning framework, named MlCOFSyn, designed to assist in the synthesis of 2D COFs. This framework explores the application of 2D COF crystallization models by implementing three pivotal functionalities: predicting crystal sizes based on the input monomer addition sequence, reverse-engineering monomer addition sequences to achieve desired crystal sizes, and optimizing monomer addition sequences to produce larger crystals. These functionalities are critical for the controlled synthesis of 2D COFs but have been largely underexplored due to the lack of accessible theoretical tools. The MlCOFSyn framework leverages efficient machine-learning algorithms and features an intuitive graphical interface, enabling its use on consumer-grade computers by non-experts. By addressing these gaps, the MlCOFSyn framework represents a substantial advancement in facilitating 2D COF research and synthesis.", "date": "2025-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite recent advances in harnessing thermal gradients to achieve controlled deposition of nanoparticles at a laser spot, the deposition of anisotropic gold nanoparticles via opto-thermophoresis could not be achieved in aqueous solution. Herein, the use of ethanol as a co-solvent was shown to enable rapid (<10 s) and effective deposition of gold nanorods in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone on unmodified glass substrates. The influence of key parameters, including polymer concentration and molecular weight, co-solvent content, nanoparticle concentration, and laser power, were studied. While ethanol content and polymer size had the largest impact on the assembly structure, all had an impact on the assembly growth rate. Polymer size was found to significantly impact the degree of nanorod assembly found in the pattern, which led to a surface-enhanced Raman scattering enhancement factor up to 10^8. In summary, this approach utilizes thermal gradients to direct the formation of highly localized plasmonic assemblies without the need of functionalization of the substrate.

However, it is still significant challenge to precisely control the secondary coordination sites or functionalities within the framework. This complexity arises due to the multitude of parameters influencing the synthesis process. Precise control of secondary sites within MOFs can be achieved through accurate linker design, overcoming limitations imposed by diverse reaction conditions. By employing modular approach in the linker design, we prepared four new di and tetra carboxylate-based linkers where acetylene and triazole functionalities were incorporated in the side arms of linkers through sequential Sonogashira, Suzuki and \u201cclick\u201d reactions. Under similar reaction conditions, acetylenic tagged non-symmetrical linear ditopic linker, H2-1, gave 4-fold interpenetrated Cu(II) 3D framework while acetylenic tagged symmetrical linear ditopic linker, H2-2, produced 2D framework. This indicates the importance of subtle change in linker core towards the targeted assemblies. An isostructural to UiO-68, an acetylene functionalised Zirconium MOF was also prepared using H2-1 where the acetylene group was found disordered due to linker different orientational arrangements and rotation within framework. With linear triazole functionalized ditopic linker, H2-3, two isostructural 3D Cu(II) and Cd(II) 3D frameworks were prepared where triazoles of one ligand were found axially coordinated with paddlewheel units and the triazoles of the second ligand were partially hydrogen bonded. On the other hand, two isostructural 3D Zn(II) and Cd(II) MOFs were built from reaction with a tetratopic linker, H2-4, where all triazoles sites were found axially coordinated with the paddlewheel SBU. A triazole functionalized 12- connecting zirconium MOF was prepared by linker H2-3, which ester hydrolyse to linker H2-4 during MOF synthesis.

Lanthanide-lanthanide ion separations are challenging due to similarity in their hydrated size, with commonly used methods limited to single stage selectivities of ~ 2-3. Here we present supramolecular membrane channel nanopores based on a pillar[5]arene scaffold with appended diphenylphosphine oxide (DPP) ligands that show high transport selectivity (~18:1) of the medium lanthanide, Europium (Eu3+), over all measured monovalent and divalent ions, including protons. These membrane channels also have high lanthanide-lanthanide transport selectivity with Eu3+/La3+ selectivity of >40 and Eu3+/Yb3+ selectivity of ~30. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the high selectivity observed is due to specific water-mediated interactions between the hydrated ions and the channel.

More importantly, a judicious combination of characterization techniques can provide an integrated framework for efficiently planning pre-treatment and recycling processes. In this study, industrial BM samples from end-of-life NMC622, NMC111, and NMC901 LIBs are characterized. The comparative characterization of BM using FBRM (focused beam reflectance measurement) and laser diffraction techniques showed that applying square weighting to the chord length distribution measured by FBRM yields values close to the actual particle size, while also providing a method that can be used for real-time analysis of recycling processes. XRD (x-ray diffraction), complemented by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and metal composition data confirmed that crystalline NMC phases remain intact in untreated BM and graphite exists as a mixture of 2H and 3R phases. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy with SEM elemental analysis provided insights into the carbonaceous deposits and metal particles on graphite surfaces. Qualitative TGA/MS (thermogravimetry with mass spectrometry) of BM under pyrolytic conditions allowed the identification of residual electrolytes and PVDF through the evolution of carbonaceous and fluorinated gases.

Machine-learned descriptors can be of low dimensionality and constant size but lack physical significance and human interpretability. Sigma profiles, which are unnormalized histograms of the surface charge distributions of solvated molecules, combine physical significance with low dimensionality and size-independence, making them a suitable candidate for a universal molecular descriptor.

The successful crystal structure segregation is attributed to the novel set of descriptors comprising both compositional and structural features.

The unsupervised learning method based on principal component analysis (PCA) followed by clustering using the K-means method was applied to cluster compounds belonging to different structure types. Using the recommendation engine, we predicted the expansion of the clusters and then identified cluster/structure-type overlap.  PuNi3-type was among the clearly segregated structure types according to the unsupervised model, and a novel representative, TbIr3, was selected for experimental validation, adopting this structure. The final supervised machine learning predictions were done with PLS-DA, SVM, and XGBoost confidently predicting the novel TbIr3 to belong to the PuNi3-type with an accuracy of 96.6%, 99.8%, and 99.9% respectively.

Additionally, recent developments in chemiluminescent protective groups and their incorporation into advanced functional materials underscore the versatility of these compounds. Despite significant progress, key challenges remain, particularly in optimizing quantum yield, emission properties, and solvent compatibility for practical applications. Future research should prioritize the development of highly tunable 2-coumaranone derivatives with enhanced spectral and kinetic properties, further expanding their potential in diagnostics, bioimaging, and mechanoluminescent sensing. By addressing these challenges, 2-coumaranones could pave the way for next-generation chemiluminescent technologies with unprecedented sensitivity and adaptability.", "date": "2025-02-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study, we first show that such analyses cannot be extended to arbitrary concentration of intercalated ions. Furthermore, we compare the DFT derived energies and electrostatic energies based on nearest neighbors and show that while it improves upon the direct point charge predictions, the correlation is still limited to certain concentrations. Finally, we develop a machine learning-based ranking model employing the electrostatic energies as predictive features.

One of the E3 ligases for which efficient PROTACs have been described is the Von-Hippel-Lindau factor (VHL). However, the development of PROTACs has so far often relied on a minimum of computational tools, so that it is mostly based on a trial-and-error process. Therefore, there is a great need for resource- and time-efficient structure-based or computational approaches to streamline PROTAC design. In this study, we present a combined computational approach that integrates static ternary complex formation, induced fit docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our methodology was tested using four experimentally derived ternary complex structures of VHL PROTACs, reported for BRD4, SMARCA2, FAK and WEE1. In addition, we applied the validated approach to model a recently in-house developed FLT3-targeted PROTAC (MA49). The results show that static ternary models generated with a protein-protein docking method implemented in the software MOE have a high predictive power for reproducing the experimental 3D structures. The induced fit-docking of different active PROTACs to their respective models showed the reliability of this model for the development of new VHL-mediated degraders. In particular, the induced-fit docking was sensitive to structural changes in the PROTACs, as evidenced by the failed binding modes of the PROTAC negative controls. Furthermore, MD simulations confirmed the stability of the generated complexes and emphasized the importance of dynamic studies for understanding the relationship between PROTAC structure and function.

These pollutants emanate from a multitude of sources, including petrochemical industries, pharmaceutical production, and the manufacture of pesticides, thereby posing considerable threats to both aquatic ecosystems and human health. Conventional water treatment methodologies, encompassing biological degradation, adsorption, and chemical oxidation, frequently fall short in achieving complete elimination of these contaminants or may inadvertently generate secondary pollutants, thereby underscoring the need for the formulation of alternative treatments that are more effective and sustainable. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been recognized as an innovative material for the remediation of phenol and its derivatives, because of their high surface area, remarkable catalytic efficacy, and pronounced adsorption properties. The distinctive characteristics of AgNPs facilitate the efficient degradation and transformation of phenolic compounds through mechanisms such as adsorption, photocatalysis, and catalytic degradation redox reactions. Furthermore, the functionalization of AgNPs with stabilizing agents enhances their stability, selectivity, and reusability, thereby rendering them as a viable option for water purification. This article critically reviews recent progress in AgNP-based purification of waterbodies by removing phenols. Notable findings indicate that AgNPs substantially augment the rates of phenol degradation, with variables such as nanoparticle size, surface modifications, and prevailing environmental conditions playing pivotal roles in their operational efficiency. Nevertheless, challenges pertaining to nanoparticle aggregation, potential environmental toxicity, and the feasibility of large-scale application require further exploration. Future research should prioritize eco-friendly synthesis or green synthesis methodologies, enhanced recovery techniques, and the mitigation of potential risks linked to nanoparticle discharge.

The stability of SEI/CEI mainly depends on their chemistry and structure. Current studies on SEI/CEI design mainly focus on regulating their chemistry by tuning electrolyte formulations. In this work, we showcase that both the chemistry and structure of SEI/CEI could be readily regulated via a temperature modulated formation strategy. Specifically, pre-charging under heated condition was used to regulate the types and kinetics of electrolyte decomposition reactions, followed by frozen at low-temperature storage to control the deposition behavior of decomposition products on the electrode interface. Studies show that high temperatures pre-charging can affect the coordination structure of Li+ and accelerate the decomposition reaction kinetics, leading to large amount of anion decomposition. The subsequent low-temperature storage rapidly reduces the solubility of decomposition products generated at high temperatures, promoting the deposition of insoluble products on both electrodes, resulting in a dense and stable SEI/CEI. The robust SEI/CEI enables stable cycling of a 4.5 V Li||NCM811 cell in a medium-concentration ether-based electrolyte, achieving a capacity retention of 88.7% after 200 cycles at 0.5C (areal capacity 1.5 mAh cm-2).

While most foldamers fold into (chiral) helices, many abiotic foldamers are built from achiral repeat units. They therefore do not have a preferred twist sense. The handedness can, however, be controlled by attaching groups with chirality centers to the foldamer backbone. This process allows the chiral information from readily available feedstocks to be amplified into larger-scale structural asymmetry and translated into functional behavior. This review describes mechanisms whereby the point chirality of chiral \u201ccontroller\u201d groups directs the helicity of the foldamer to which they are attached. We highlight examples of aromatic oligoamides, oligohydrazides, oligoindoles, oligo(ortho-phenylenes), and oligo(aminoisobutyric acids), examining cases where the controller groups are attached at either the helices\u2019 termini or sides. Our emphasis is on applying intuitive concepts from conformational analysis and, where appropriate, computational modeling of small substructures. In each case, we consider first short-range interactions that orient the controller group in space relative to its direct point of attachment to the foldamer. We then consider long-range interactions between the controller group and more-distant parts of the oligomer, typically one turn farther along the helix. Together, these interactions allow the twist sense to be predicted (or rationalized).

The influence of external pressure on the structure and magnetic response is thoroughly studied, where the pressure-induced modification in the intermolecular interactions leads to enhanced cooperativity and a hysteretic stepwise spin state switching. The versatility of the systems is further explored where 1 displays a reversible ON/OFF photo-switching between a photo-induced paramagnetic metastable HS and diamagnetic LS states under light irradiations at low temperatures along with light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST).", "date": "2025-02-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Magnetism; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A major drawback of C-N-SPPS is its dependence on atom-intensive protecting groups, such as fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc), along with the excessive use of protected amino acids and coupling reagents. In contrast, synthesizing peptides in the N- to C-direction, from amine to carboxylate, presents an opportunity to reduce reliance on protective strategies and could offer a more efficient approach to peptide manufacturing.

Unconventional phases or even complex heterostructures play a crucial role in the performance of catalysts for efficient water electrolysis. By utilizing a controlled, iterative reduction synthesis route, a tailored binder-free cobalt boride-phosphite electrode (CoxB-[0.2]P-O) with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases is developed. The tailored cobalt chemistry, hierarchical morphology and mixed phases synergistically enhance the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Those electrodes exhibit platinum-like HER performance with an overpotential of 33 mV at the standard current density of 10 mA cm-2, with excellent intrinsic kinetics and enhanced electron transfer in an alkaline 1M KOH electrolyte. Comprehensive microstructure and spectroscopic analyses proved the success of the one-pot strategy to modulate the chemistry of cobalt by incorporating boron and phosphite. Moreover, the tailored formation of nanostructures with locally varying morphology by the co-existence of amorphous and crystalline phases on the nanometer scale is confirmed.

This diversity can be traced back not only to variations in the protein scaffolds in which the chromophore is embedded, but also to the different isomeric forms of the chromophore itself, whose role is crucial in several processes. Although most computational approaches for these systems often require classical molecular dynamics, efforts in providing a set of parameters able to accurately and consistently model through molecular mechanics several isomeric chromophores are lacking in literature. The most recent efforts entail either refinements of general purpose force fields, which lack in accuracy, or parameterisation strategies that include environmental effects, making the resulting parameters not transferable to a different embedding. In this work, we provide accurate intramolecular force fields based on data purposely computed using M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset second order perturbation theory, specifically tailored for varied natural retinal Protonated Schiff Bases and synthetic analogues often employed in retinal-based photoswitches.

From liquid miscibility to the formation of organic crystals and biological structures, subtle interplays of charge distribution determine the outcome. Aromatic rings are a key motif in organic chemistry that provide rigid and highly directional interactions in proteins and nucleic acids. The distribution of the aromatic delocalised \u03c0 electrons is strongly modulated by the substituents, giving rise to complex charge patterns across the molecule that affect reactivity and intermolecular interactions. These patterns range from axial dipoles to localised \"holes\" in the delocalized \u03c0 network. While increasingly well-understood in the solid state, their influence on solvation and miscibility in the liquid remains unknown. We exploited neutron total scattering and experimentally constrained Monte Carlo simulations to picture the solvation of three aromatics in water: phenol, aniline, and p-nitrophenol. We observe the expected strong classical hydrogen bonds between the water and the OH, NH2, and NO2 substituents. Out of the ring plane, the solvation of phenol and aniline is centred around perpendicular, non-classical OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions. By contrast, for p-nitrophenol, the presence of the electron-withdrawing nitro group enhances the overall molecular dipole, and introduces a pronounced \u03c0 hole on the nitro group that significantly disrupts the out-of-plane solvation. The latter is dominated by a close O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N contact (3.44 \u00c5) accompanied by longer O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7centroid interactions (~4.00 \u00c5) resulting from localized charge depletion in the ring.

Desiccators are essential laboratory tools for drying solids and maintaining low humidity to prevent unwanted reactions. The choice of desiccant is critical, as they reach different residual humidity and perform the drying process with different speed. Additionally, the desiccant can react and therefore remove not only water from the gas phase inside the desiccator. This study details the structure of classical and modern desiccators, the choice of vacuum conditions, and the hazards associated with using certain desiccants. Several desiccants, including calcium chloride, copper(II) sulfate, magnesium perchlorate, and molecular sieves, and others are evaluated, discussing their properties, capacities, and safety considerations. Besides, an experimental setup for measuring humidity absorption rates and residual moisture is outlined. The findings indicate that desiccants like magnesium perchlorate and molecular sieves demonstrate low residual moisture and high absorption speeds, but have disadvantages considering regeneration or safety issues. The article concludes with recommendations for selecting appropriate desiccants based on their characteristics, and ease of use, while acknowledging the need for careful handling of hazardous materials.

In particular, the role of commonly added, supposedly sacrificial, proton donors on SEI chemistry and morphology remains a mystery. In this work, the impact of ethanol concentration in a 1 M LiNTf2 in THF electrolyte on SEI properties and nitrogen reduction is analysed via a multi-pronged characterisation approach. Post-mortem surface analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows a dependence in the relative proportion of LiF and Li2O on ethanol concentration, while depth profiling measurements via cluster source time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry reveals increasing SEI electrolyte permeability at higher ethanol concentrations. Cryogenic electron microscopy measurements show a reduction in SEI thickness with increased ethanol concentration, as well as increased SEI homogeneity. Lithium metal is also observed only in ethanol free condition. Analysis of bulk SEI components via titration corroborates the observation of lithium metal in cryo-microscopy measurements, as well as showing an increase in bulk Li2O/LiOH content with ethanol concentration.

Herein, we examine the role of pre-association in I-PCET to a molecularly well-defined graphite-conjugated carboxylic acid (GC-COOH) surface site. We quantify electrolyte proton activity and I PCET kinetics in acidic, acetate-buffered, and alkaline electrolytes as a function of NaClO4 concentration ranging from 1 mole kg<sup>\u22121</sup> to 17 mole kg<sup>\u22121</sup>. Measured I-PCET rates at GC COOH are attenuated by a factor of 4.3 in acidic and 4.6 in acetate-buffered media relative to the rates expected based on the solution pH across this ionic strength range. In contrast, in alkaline electrolytes the apparent rate of I-PCET is far less diminished upon increasing NaClO<sub>4</sub> concentration. To account for these findings, we propose a multiple-step model for I-PCET in acidic and acetate-buffered media that invokes quasi-equilibrated exchange of interfacial Na<sup>+</sup> for H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> to form a hydrogen-bonded pre association complex prior to rate-limiting concerted proton-electron transfer.

By systematically comparing this nanocluster-based method to other direct synthesis routes and using X-ray pair distribution function, thermogravimetric and statistical analyses, we establish key design principles governing aMOF formation.

Structural analysis reveals that while aMOFs share motifs with crystalline polymorphs, they cannot be directly mapped onto known structures, highlighting the importance for more nuanced characterisation approaches. Just as crystal engineering was instrumental in the expansion of crystalline MOFs, new synthetic strategies are essential for advancing the aMOF field.

The pyrolysis temperature was set to \n800 \u2103 based on the boiling point of ZnCl2 and increasing more macro-, meso- and microporosity of \npalm waste biochar (PWB). The physicochemical and textural properties of all PWBs were \ncharacterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray \nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), point of zero charge (pHPZC), and methylene blue index (MBi) and \niodine index (Ii). ZnCl2- and H3PO4-activated PWBs showed more pore and channel structures than \nC2H5OH-activated and ultrasonicated PWBs, as noted from SEM images. Raman results proved that \nthe I(D)/I(G) ratio values of all PWBs ranged from 2.19 to 3.19, confirming they are typical amorphous \ncrystalline carbons as confirmed by XRD.

Recent advances in surrogate models for reactive chemistry offer promising speedups, but ensuring that these models remain physically consistent remains challenging.

Here, we introduce a positivity preserving projection that simultaneously enforces both constraints. We demonstrate this approach using an example from atmospheric chemistry and an example from heterogeneous catalysis. In both cases, the positivity preserving projection yields exclusively positive model predictions conforming to the atom balance, without reducing the overall accuracy of the model.\t", "date": "2025-02-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We demonstrate how the delocalized light-matter interactions, together with the local electronic donor-acceptor couplings can be used to enhance the rate constant of the charge transfer reactions.

This pump operates through a kinetic ratchet mechanism under single-wavelength photonic control: (1) photocyclization of a diarylethene-based Knoevenagel derivative generates a high-energy photoisomer (\u0394G = 22.5 kcal/mol), (2) irreversible covalent metathesis (K > 10^16) releases stored chemical potential, and (3) a photon-energy-gated ring-opening reaction enforces pathway unidirectionality.

In particular, the photolysis rate of the thionocarbamate derivatives was found to be more than 100-fold faster than the corresponding carbamates, a result that is explained through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations as arising from the thermodynamic instability of thiocarbonyls, offering a new strategy in photocage design. These results also highlight the potential of using thionocarbamate-based BODIPY derivatives as versatile tools for H\u2082S delivery, paving the way for their application in H\u2082S-related therapies and studies.", "date": "2025-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Despite recent advances, our mechanistic understanding of the CO2 electrolysis reaction network has remained incomplete, with C4 products, in particular long-sought after aromatic C6 product molecules, still being elusive. Here, we use a novel real-time capillary DEMS technique to determine accurate kinetic onset potentials of a wide set of C1-3 CO2 reduction products. Included in our study are rarely and never-before reported reaction products, such as propionaldehyde, propylene, and firstly acetylene. We focus on the formation of acetylene, C2H2, and also investigate its alkyne electro-reduction, the C2H2 reduction reaction (C2H2RR). Acetylene is shown to electro-reduce on Cu catalysts to the C4 compound 1,3-butadiene in a 2e- reduction reaction. In parallel, it revealed a potential-dependent electroless Cu-catalyzed ambient-condition [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction to C6 benzene. We discuss the mechanistic implications of our experimental kinetic onset potentials and rationalize the potential-dependent valorizations of acetylene on Cu. Finally, we propose a future two-step process concept to valorize captured CO2 into industrially important aromatic C6+ molecules. This process cascade will open up reaction pathways towards sustainable e-aromatics", "date": "2025-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

There are significant advances in the application of machine learning approaches to developing protein-ligand scoring functions in recent years. However, traditional docking softwares and existing deep-learning methods remain unsolved limitations in terms of pose quality and binding affinity prediction accuracy. Furthermore, machine learning-based scoring functions are hard to generalize to unseen cases due to the scarcity of structure-affinity data, and mostly lack physical interpretability. In this study, we propose RefineScore, which learns the underlying physical laws by the neural network parameterized physical energy terms. In addition, mixed density network (MDN) is introduced to predict the distance likelihoods of van der Waals (vdW) and hydrogen bonding (Hbond) pairs and further correct the classical energy equations for the absolute binding free energy calculation. RefineScore provides a versatile atomic interaction evaluation framework within protein-ligand complexes and is highly interpretable for the key interaction analysis and energy contribution decomposition. By integrating these carefully tailored techniques, RefineScore maintains the advantages of machine learning models while providing physical interpretability and capturing complex interaction patterns. Our evaluation results show that RefineScore has superior scoring and ranking power.

M.  van der Zon; Andrea F.G. Gargano", "abstract": "Native size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with native mass spectrometry (nMS) enables the characterization of proteins and protein complexes by combining liquid-phase separation (SEC) and mass measurement of the complexes (nMS). This approach allows for an increase in the throughput of native MS experiments, reduces the bias that may be present due to the co-ionization of oligomers, and facilitates online sample buffer exchange. SEC-nMS uses volatile buffers and relatively wide-diameter columns (e.g., \u2265 1 mm), with flow rates in the tens of \u00b5L/minute. To ionize sample components under this flow regime, relatively harsh electrospray ionization (ESI) desolvation conditions are needed, potentially resulting in protein dissociation/denaturation. Also, relatively large amounts of samples are required (several micrograms).  Herein, we describe the development of a nanoflow SEC-nMS method using 200 \u00b5m I.D. columns, operated at 500 nL min-1. This approach allows buffer exchange, oligomer separation, and mild ionization conditions (e.g., without the assistance of heated gas flow or temperature). Compared to microflow (1 mm I.D. column), the nanoflow method achieved a 4-fold increase in MS peak intensity, despite using a sample 20 times less concentrated (0.05 mg mL-1 for nanoflow vs. 1 mg mL-1 for microflow). Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of three injection approaches on sensitivity and separation efficiency: large-volume (1 \u03bcL), nano-volume (50 nL), and online mix-bed ion-exchange capillary trap injection. To demonstrate its performance and applicability for sample-limited analysis, the final method using nano-volume injection was applied to several model proteins, protein complexes, and a urine sample from a pregnant donor.\n", "date": "2025-02-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Particular attention is given to intersystem crossing (ISC) and non-adiabatic dynamics in triplet states, as the lowest triplet state plays a critical role in driving the excited-state proton transfer process in the ortho isomer. The efficiency of singlet-triplet crossings was analyzed by evaluating electronic features and energy gaps derived from dynamic simulations. The investigations suggest a systematic reduction in the rate of ISC from ortho to meta to para isomer.

The mixtures were composed of cholinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([Chol][TFSI]) and LiTFSI, with LiTFSI mole fraction, LiTFSI, spanning from 0 to 0.5 (saturated solution), and [Chol][TFSI] and La(TFSI)3 with 0< x{La(TFSI)3}} < 0.12. The translational self-diffusion coefficients of Chol+, TFSI- and Li+ have been measured, along with NMR their relaxation times at various magnetic fields, in order to decipher the intertwined dynamics between the ions, and to reveal how the local dynamics impact the long range translational diffusion. When the concentrations of lithium and lanthanum are increased in the liquid, the long range dynamics of all the ions drop. In the case of LiTFSI, the self-diffusion coefficient of lithium becomes higher than the one of TFSI at high concentration, revealing a change in lithium transport mechanisms. The NMR relaxation data confirm this change, showing a clearer transition at x{LiTFSI}=0.15. It is interpreted as a change from a vehicular transport mechanism of the lithium below x{LiTFSI}=0.15 to a hopping mechanism above. A similar crossover seems to occur in the lanthanum solutions. It is suspected that the hydroxyl group of the organic cation is involved in this phenomenon.", "date": "2024-02-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The high sensitivity of MS results in numerous but sometimes incorrect candidate compounds, whereas the greater universality of NMR leads to fewer but more accurate annotations. These two analytical techniques are rarely used in combination despite their complementarity. This study focuses on the chemical profiling of Larix decidua (Pinaceae) bark by joint LC-HRMS2 and 13C NMR data analysis and by querying custom in silico-generated chemical databases. MS-based dereplication allowed the annotation of 135 MS2 spectra with at least two different annotation tools. Twenty-five compounds were annotated in parallel by NMR spectra analysis, including two previously undescribed myrtenic acid derivatives. Sixteen of these compounds were already reported in the Pinaceae family. Twelve compounds were jointly annotated with a high confidence level by comparing LC-HRMS2 and 13C NMR dereplication results, including compounds not reported to date in Larix decidua. Our results show the benefits brought by combining LC-HRMS2 and 13C NMR data and by querying custom in silico chemical databases to enhance the confidence level of data annotation during the chemical profiling of complex natural extracts.", "date": "2024-02-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Natural Products; Chemoinformatics; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We describe the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the effect of aromaticity on the rate of release of the amine from hydroxybenzylammonium compounds.

Herein, we demonstrate that carbon-modified silicon oxide (SiOxCy) overlayers with nanoscopic thickness can greatly enhance the activity of Pt electrodes towards the oxidation of CO and five different oxygenate molecules. Trends in activity are reported with respect to the composition and structure of the SiOxCy overlayers, revealing that low-density, carbon-rich overlayers enhance peak current densities towards the oxidation of formic acid, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol by 370%, 290%, 190%, 130%, and 30%, respectively, compared to bare Pt controls. Unlike conventional alloy electrocatalysts, the alcohol oxidation activity of SiOxCy|Pt electrodes did not strongly correlate with their ability to oxidize CO intermediates, suggesting that that C-H bond scission and/or oxidation of aldehyde or carboxylic acid intermediates, rather than CO intermediates, are the rate limiting steps during the oxidation of C1 and C2 alcohols. For larger alcohols like propanol and butanol, oxidation activity on encapsulated electrodes diminishes relative to bare Pt, which is attributed to mass transport limitations introduced by the overlayer.

Ensuring proper charge neutrality within the simulation cell requires performing titration moves in sync with the insertion or deletion of ions  -- a crucial aspect often overlooked in the literature. \t\tContrary to prevailing views, cpH simulations are inherently grand-canonical, meaning that the controlled pH is that of the reservoir. The presence of the Donnan potential between the implicit reservoir and the simulation cell introduces significant differences between titration curves calculated for open and closed systems  -- the pH of an isolated (closed) system is different from the pH of the reservoir, for the same protonation state of the polyelectrolyte. \t\tTo underscore this point, in this paper  we will compare the titration curves calculated using the usual cpH algorithm with those from the exact canonical simulation algorithm. In the latter case, titration moves adhere to the correct detailed balance condition, and pH is calculated using the recently introduced surface Widom insertion algorithm.

Here we explore plant-derived cyclic cystine-knot peptides as ligands of the CB2R. Cyclotides are known for their exceptional biochemical stability. Recently they gained attention as modulators of GPCR signaling and as templates for designing peptide ligands with improved pharmacokinetic properties over linear peptides. Cyclotide-based ligands for CB2R were profiled based on a peptide-enriched extract library comprising nine plant species. Employing pharmacology-guided fractionation and peptidomics we identified cyclotide vodo-C1 from sweet violet plant (Viola odorata) as a full agonist of CB2R with an affinity (Ki) of 1 \u00b5M and a potency (EC50) of 8 \u00b5M. Leveraging deep learning networks we verified the structural topology of vodo-C1 and modelled its molecular volume in comparison to the CB2R ligand binding pocket. In a fragment-based approach we designed and characterized vodo-C1-based bicyclic peptides (vBCL1-4), aiming to reduce size and improve potency. Opposite to vodo-C1, the vBCL peptides lacked the ability to activate the receptor, but acted as negative allosteric modulators or neutral antagonists of CB2R. This study introduces a new macrocyclic peptide phytocannabinoid, which served as template for the development of synthetic CB2R peptide modulators.

In the first part, the incorporation of the solid material was characterized structurally (SEM, Hg porosimetry) and compositionally (XRD, elemental analysis), and the modification of the carbonaceous support was characterized by the yield and the amount of solid incorporated in the synthesis product (TGA). The results show that the synthesis by wet impregnation produces a composite material formed by a porous matrix of carbon-containing solid in an amount, with a distribution and precursor-dependent crystallinity. The synthesis also results in the loss of a significant amount of carbonaceous support, which varies from precursor to precursor. The results also show that only the material with zinc oxide outperforms the material with no added solid in removing nitrate from water.

In this study we consider how information flows through the auxilary density operators (ADOs) in the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We consider three cases for a range of baths,underdamped, intermediate and overdamped. By understanding how information flows, we are able to determine the relative importance of different ADOs within the hierarchy. We show that ADOs sharing a common Matsubara axis behave similarly while ADOs on different Matsubara axes behave differently. Using this knowledge we are able to truncate hierarchies significantly, thus reducing computation time, while obtaining qualitatively similar results. This is illustrated by comparing 2D electronic spectra for a molecule with an underdamped vibration subsumed into the bath spectral density.

Foundational GEL platforms like phage-, yeast-, ribosome- and mRNA-display enabled display of libraries composed of 20 natural amino acids (20AA). Today, numerous strategies expand GEL beyond 20AA space by incorporating unnatural amino acids (UAA) and chemical post-translational modification (cPTM) to build linear, cyclic, and bicyclic peptides. The standard operating procedure for UAA and cPTM libraries starts from a \"na\u00efve\" chemically-upgraded library with 108-1012 compounds, uses target of interest and rounds of selection to narrow down to a set of receptor binding hits. However, such approach uses zero knowledge of natural peptide-receptor interactions which already exists in libraries with 20AA space. There is currently no consensus whether \u2018zero knowledge\u2019 na\u00efve libraries or libraries with pre-existing knowledge can offer a more effective path to discovery of molecular interactions. In this manuscript, we evaluated the feasibility of discovery of macrocyclic and bicyclic peptide from \"non-zero knowledge\" libraries. We approach this problem by late-stage chemical reshaping of phage-displayed landscape of 20AA binders to NS3aH1 protease. The re-shaping is performed under a novel multifunctional C2-symmetric linchpin, 3,5-bis(bromomethyl)benzaldehyde (termed KYL), that combines two electrophiles that react with thiols and aldehyde group that reacts with N-terminal amine. KYL diversified phage-displayed peptides into bicyclic architectures and delineates 2 distinct sequence populations: (i) peptides that retained binding upon bicyclization (ii) peptides that lost binding once chemically modified. Our report provides a case study for discovering advanced, chemically-upgraded macrocycles and bicycles from libraries with pre-existing knowledge. The results imply that thousands of selection campaigns completed in 20AA space, in principle, can serve for late-stage reshaping and as a starting point for discovery of advanced peptide-derived ligands.", "date": "2024-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, the emission peaks of the reported chiral OIHMHs mainly locate in the visible region, and chiral OIHMH with ultraviolet (UV) circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been rarely reported. To fill this gap, cerium, a unique rare-earth (RE) element with tunable luminescence from UV to the visible region owing to the 4f-related electronic transition, was introduced to construct the first RE-based chiral OIHMHs, R/S-MCC. The chirality is successfully transferred from the chiral organic cations to the inorganic cerium chloride framework in R/S-MCC, as confirmed by the single crystal structures, circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence. The emission spectra of R/S-MCC are in the UV region, originating from the characteristic d-f transition of Ce3+, which making the Ce-based metal halides are ideal candidates towards CPL light sources in the UV region. Notably, R/S-MCC are the first RE-based OIHMHs, also the first chiral metal-halides with UV CPL. Our work opens a new avenue for the development of the chiral OIHMH family towards RE-based chiral OIHMH.

IM measurement provides collision cross section (CCS) values that facilitate analyte identification. While CCS values can be directly calculated from mobility measurements obtained using drift tube ion mobility spectrometry (DT-IMS), this method has limited mobility resolution due to the practical constraints on the length of the ion drift path. Consequently, DT-IMS cannot differentiate analytes with similar mobilities or resolve fine mobility features of individual ions. Cyclic IMS (cIMS) instruments leverage a cyclic path enabled by traveling wave ion mobility (TWIM) technology and offer increased mobility solution to address this challenge. While TWIM devices must first be calibrated to enable CCS measurements, current calibration strategies are primarily tailored for single-pass analyses. This preference is partly attributed to the challenges associated with multi-pass calibration methods, which require both calibrants and analytes to experience the same number of passes. Achieving this consistency can be complicated due to factors like peak splitting and diffusion, and may not be feasible for on-line IM-MS analyses. A recent report employed average ion velocities obtained from multiple measurements under different separation pathlengths as a pathlength-independent metric for CCS calibration. However, the ability to exploit this averaging approach is limited by observed variation in ion drift time/velocity in these measurements. In this study, we introduce a novel calibration strategy designed for multi-pass cIMS analyses, directly targeting the root cause for the pathlength- and mobility-dependent variations in ion drift time. With this method, we demonstrate that CCS values derived from multi-pass measurements closely align with those obtained from single-pass analyses, with an average deviation of 0.1%. We apply this method to characterize four isomeric trisaccharides. Our approach not only results in excellent agreement between our measured cIMSCCS values and the reported DTCCS values, with an average difference of only 0.5%, but also allows us to effectively identify subtle mobility characteristics of each compound and determine their respective CCS values. This level of detail and accuracy was previously unattainable using DT-IMS or single-pass cIMS measurements. We developed an algorithm for reconstructing arrival time distribution in cases where wrap-around has resulted in peak splitting. Collectively, the new calibration strategy and the reconstruction procedure maintain reproducibility and precision in CCS measurements while largely eliminating the need for meticulous selection of separation times. We expect that our method will empower researchers to harness the high mobility resolution offered by multi-pass cIMS analyses without compromising the accuracy of CCS measurement, making it appropriate for straightforward use across a wide range of applications.", "date": "2024-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The selection and concentration of the reducing agents affected both the extent of nonspecific adduction and the charge-state distribution of the analyte. For a protein without disulfide bonds, increasing concentrations of DTT or \u03b2ME resulted in shifts to higher charge states, whereas increasing concentrations of TCEP resulted in shifts to lower charge states. Based on these trends and additional properties of the reducing agents, we propose that DTT and \u03b2ME are mild supercharging agents and that TCEP is a potent charge-reducing agent. The selection and concentration of the reducing agents, as well as the sample pH, also affected the extent of disulfide bond reduction, and for \u03b2ME, the extent of covalent adduction by that molecule to cysteine. These results offer insights into the compatibility of reducing agents with the goal of obtaining high-quality native mass spectra. Based on our results, we present recommendations for the use of reducing agents in native MS experiments.", "date": "2024-02-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the exciton dissociation mechanism is still under debate. It is unclear why a small energy offset can lead to efficient exciton dissociation in nonfullerene systems, but causes significant charge recombination in fullerene ones. Most of the previous theoretical studies have focused on the static properties of donor\u2013acceptor heterojunctions, while neglecting excited electron dynamics and nonadiabatic effects. Here, we applied nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to study the charge transfer dynamics in both donor:Y6 and donor:C60 crystalline systems. We found that thermal effects do not significantly influence the exciton dissociation in the NT-4T-FF:Y6 system, which aligns with experimental observations. Based on our simulations, we identified a five-step charge transfer process in nonfullerene systems. While previous studies suggested electrostatic interfacial fields from non-fullerene small molecule acceptors, our research reveals that strong donor-acceptor interactions primarily affect the local exciton states rather than the ground state. Consequently, the polarized local excitons play a key role in reducing the Coulomb attraction between electrons and holes, thus facilitating exciton dissociation with a small energy offset. In contrast, this mechanism is not observed in fullerene OSC systems. Our findings provide a fundamental basis for the further development of novel OSC materials with the potential for achieving even higher PCE.", "date": "2024-02-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

On surfaces, modelers commonly resort to much more complex and expensive Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. Here we extend the Smoluchowski model to allow the diffusing species to undergo chemical reactions, and derive analytical formulae for the diffusion limited rate coefficients for 3D, 2D and 2D/3D interface cases.

We demonstrate the feasibility to obtain phase transitions in levitating droplets and on hydrophobic substrate, whereas self-assembly was limited on hydrophilic supports. Moreover, the aspect ratio of the nanotubes proves to be a pivotal factor, influencing both transitions and the resulting materials shape and surface. Besides material shaping, acoustic levitation emerges as a promising method for studying phase transitions, toward the rapid establishment of phase diagrams from diluted to highly concentrated states using a limited volume of sample.", "date": "2024-02-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Liquid Crystals; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we establish a synthetic approach based on split-pool chemistry to produce 100-million membered macrocyclic libraries containing natural and non-natural amino acids. Near-quantitative intramolecular disulfide formation is facilitated by rapid (<10 minute) oxidation by iodine to prepare macrocyclic synthetic libraries in solution. Treatment with dithiothreitol post-affinity selection enables near-quantitative reduction of the library members, rendering the linear analogs amenable to standard tandem mass spectrometry sequencing. We demonstrate the utility of these libraries to discover novel macrocyclic binders to cadherin-2 and the anti-hemagglutinin antibody clone 12ca5. The lead cadherin-binding peptide (CBP) is endowed with nanomolar binding affinity measured by biolayer interferometry (BLI, apparent dissociation constant KD = 53 nM). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies including alanine and D-amino acid scans reveal the amino acids responsible for driving affinity (hot-spots) and the positions tolerating mutagenesis (cold-spots). Informed by SAR data, two new macrocyclic libraries are designed to derivatize these positions with a variety of abiotic amino acids based on the hot- and cold-spots. Following affinity selection and experimental validation by BLI, 10 high-affinity ligands out of 10 discovered were identified from the library that derivatized the CBP cold-spots, while zero of the two peptide ligands discovered from the hot-spot library were high-affinity binders.

Accurately interpreting such measurements requires understanding the response of SOA to heat. Using optical microscopy, we monitored catechol + O\u2083 SOA during heating at mild temperatures (36-52 \u00b0C). Catechol + O\u2083 SOA is a type of SOA formed in wildfire plumes. Surprisingly, the SOA particles appeared to boil when heated to these temperatures. We identified acetone and CO\u2082 as dominant species emitted from the SOA during heating, implying decomposition of the SOA components. Using mass spectrometry techniques, we observed catechol dimers to be the major product in unheated SOA and observed the degradation of these dimers after heating. Viscosity calculations suggested the mixing time of acetone and CO\u2082 within the particles was 11 h and 1 h at temperatures of 36 and 52 \u00b0C, respectively. The observed boiling can be explained by the production and slow mixing of acetone and CO\u2082 within the SOA particles when subjected to mild temperatures. Our results underscore the importance of considering decomposition, high viscosities, and slow mixing times when interpreting thermal desorption measurements of SOA, even when heating to mild temperatures.

These materials have a number of benefits, including stability, catalyst reusability, tunability, and the capacity for post-reaction separation. Here, the potential applications of UiO-66-NDC (1,4-Naphthalenedicarboxylic acid) as a photocatalyst for the degradation of reactive orange 16 (RO16), methyl orange (MO), and rhodamine B (RhB) were investigated. Due to its large surface area, adjustable characteristics, stability, effective light absorption, capacity for charge separation, and adaptability in design, UiO-66-NDC was chosen for photocatalytic dye degradation. A solvothermal process was used to synthesize the UiO-66-NDC, and methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize its structure. The zeta potential was used to determine the surface charge. In order to conduct the photocatalytic tests, dye solutions with defined concentrations were exposed to UVA light irradiation in the presence of UiO-66-NDC. UV-visible spectroscopy was used to monitor the degradation process, which made it possible to calculate the degradation rate constants and the percentage of dye removal. The removal efficiency of adsorption, which was also examined, was at a minimum (17% for RO16, 48% for MO, and 25% for RhB). The degradation of the dyes by UiO-66-NDC showed excellent photocatalytic activity, with degradation rates for RO16, MO, and RhB of 93%, 94%, and 91%, respectively, and good reusability. The research determined that 300 mg/L of catalyst was the ideal level. Three successive cycles of using UiO-66-NDC as a catalyst have demonstrated its reusability.

Therefore, isolating solid-state degradation mechanisms, and explicitly linking them to the associated deformation fields requires a multimodal characterization strategy.

Two copolymer variations with different segmental compositions (70 wt% and 60 wt% of hard segments) were synthesized. After modifying the copolymers with PEG, the presence of a lipase catalyst accelerated degradation after 20 days, evidenced by reduced residual content. Gel permeation chromatography analysis showed up to 40% decrease in molecular weight, while gravimetric analysis indicated a mass loss of up to 10% during enzymatic degradation. Morphological examination revealed that the enzymatic breakdown, facilitated by hydrolase activity (boosted by the presence of PEG), resulted in surface erosion, holes, cracks and changes in spherulitic morphology. It highlights the tunable degradation pathways of these copolymers. Bioactivity studies demonstrated the formation of biomimetic calcium/phosphate (Ca/P) crystals, with varying stoichiometry based on segmental composition. Copolymers with higher crystallinity (70 wt% hard segments) favored tricalcium phosphate-like crystal formation, while those with lower crystallinity (60 wt% hard segments) were more susceptible to hydroxyapatite precipitation. In vitro cytotoxicity tests using mice fibroblasts exhibited excellent cell viability and attachment for all copolymers.

Even in the electrochemical reaction system of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, a considerable amount of heat is generated by overpotential. However, the physical mechanism of thermogenesis is not yet clear. We propose a thermogenesis model based on the electrochemical overpotential of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. As a result of quantitatively estimating the value of the overpotential applied in each reaction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, we found that 39-63% of the initial free energy in the respiratory chain was converted into heat, and the rate of thermogenesis changed depending on respiratory activity.

The study combines both static and dynamic measurements by small angle neutron scattering, neutron spin echo and PFG-NMR. Ion-specific effects are a phenomenon at high polyelectrolyte concentration and the nature of the counterion is seen to influence drastically the ionene chain-chain interactions. The origin lies in the closer approach of large, highly polarisable counterions to the chain backbone, leading to more constricted counterion clouds.

AlGaN-based deep UV emitters are gaining visibility for their disinfection capabilities. Likewise, high electron mobility transistors are attracting increasing attention owing to their superior electron transport which yields high-speed and high-power applications. Those devices are conventionally made of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on foreign substrate. However, structural defects, including stress induced by a mismatch in unit cell parameters and the presence of dislocations, can not only decrease the efficiency of the light emitters (by facilitating the non-radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs), but also impede electron mobility within the two-dimensional electron gas at the AlGaN/GaN interface.

Cobalt hydrides (Co\u2013H) have garnered significant attention in this field, where the weak Co\u2013H bonds are most commonly generated in a catalytic fashion through a mixture of stoichiometric amounts of peroxide oxidant and silane reductant. Here we show that the reverse process of HAT to an alkene, i.e. hydrogen atom abstraction of a C\u2013H adjacent to a radical, can be leveraged to generate catalytically active Co\u2013H species in a new application of shuttle catalysis coined shuttle HAT. This method obviates the need for stoichiometric reductant/oxidant mixtures thereby greatly simplifying the generation of Co\u2013H under exceedingly mild reaction conditions.

However, current methods for identifying isoAsp sites in proteins often suffer from ambiguity and have not gained widespread adoption. We have developed a novel method that exclusively labels isoAsp with deuterium. This method capitalizes on the unique structural characteristics of isoAsp residues, which possess a free \u03b1-carboxyl group and can form an oxazolone ring. Once the oxazolone ring forms, it facilitates racemization at the C\u03b1-position, incorporating a deuteron from a D2O solvent. The sites of deuterium-incorporated isoAsp in proteins can be unequivocally determined by comparing the precursor and product ion masses of the peptides from proteins reacted in H2O and D2O. The effectiveness of this method has been demonstrated through its application to model proteins, lysozyme and rituximab.

For inorganic compounds, the coordination geometry has been estimated as idealized polyhedra of high symmetry, which through ligand field theory provides predictive capabilities. However, real samples rarely have ideal symmetry, and even though continuous symmetry measures can be used to evaluate deviation form ideal symmetry, this often fails for lanthanide(III) complexes with high coordination numbers and no obvious principal axis. In lanthanide complexes, the unique electronic structures and the associated properties are intricately tied to the symmetry around the lanthanide center. Robust methodologies to evaluate and estimate point group symmetry is therefore instrumental for building structure property relationships. Here, we have demonstrated an algorithmic approach that determines the principal axis, and computes a deviation from ideal symmetry. This approach is based on the continuous symmetry measures and evaluates deviations from ideal symmetry for each symmetry operation in all relevant point groups. To demonstrate the methodology we have investigated the structure and symmetry of 8 and 9 coordinated lanthanide(III) aqua complexes, and correlated the luminescence from 3 europium(III) crystals to their actual symmetry.

The methods that can explore changes in structure as a function of sub-ambient temperature are scant, and yet many drugs are stored at such temperatures. Here we show how variable temperature ion mobility-mass spectrometry (VT-IM-MS) can provide the role of temperature on conformational landscapes in the form of collision cross sections at discrete temperatures. To delineate collision effects from structural change we report measurements made on four molecules that possess different degrees of rigidity namely: poly (L-lysine) (PLL) dendrimer, ubiquitin, \u03b2-casein and \u03b1-synuclein from 190-350K. We show that the PLL dendrimer varies with temperature consistent with collision theory, and conclude, as expected, its structure does not alter significantly over this range. By contrast, the structure of each protein is altered by the temperature of the drift gas, with notable unfolding to all charge states at 350 K and also at 250 K, following predicted in vitro stability curves, and with conformational variation that gives qualitative insights to the effect of temperature on the free energy landscape of these proteins. We also show that we can kinetically trap unfolding intermediates at drift temperatures of 210 K and 190 K on a millisecond experimental time scale. For alpha-synuclein, the 13+ ions present two distinct conformers and VT-IM-MS measurements allow us to calculate the transition rate and activation energies for conversion between these.

Here, we present the first paper in a series that investigate the role iodine species in atmospheric cluster formation. In this work, we have studied the iodic and iodous acid monomers, the iodine tetroxide and iodine pentoxide monomers, and their dimer formation with common atmospheric precursors. We have tested the accuracy of commonly applied methods for calculating the geome- try of the monomers, thermal corrections of monomers and dimers, the contribution of spin-orbit coupling to monomers and dimers, and finally the accuracy of the electronic energy correction calculated at different levels of theory. We find that optimizing the structures either at the \u03c9B97X-D3BJ/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP or the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP level achieves the best thermal contribution to the binding free energy. The electronic energy correction can then be calculated at the ZORA-DLPNO-CCSD(T0) level with the SARC-ZORA-TZVPP basis for iodine and ma-ZORA-def2-TZVPP for non-iodine atoms. This combination of methods yields results in excellent agreement with fully relativistic calculations at a comparatively low computational cost. We applied this methodology to calculate binding free energies of the iodine-containing dimer clusters, where we confirm the qualitative trends observed in previous studies.

Besides, this masked compound could also efficiently promote the inhibition of methyltransferase activity in living cells, subsequently suppress H3K9me2, a mark that regulates various chromatin functions.

With this approach, we study the effects of alkali metal ions on water organization near graphene oxide films at the air/water interface using vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy.

Theoretical modeling of the concentration-dependent sum frequency signal from graphene oxide and arachidic acid surfaces reveals that the adsorption of monovalent ions is mainly controlled by the carboxylic acid groups on graphene oxide. An in-depth analysis of sum frequency spectra reveals at least three distinct water populations with different hydrogen bonding strengths. The origin of each population can be identified from the concentration dependent variations of their SFG signal.

The challenges associated with developing a catalytic enantioselective variant are amplified as concerted [1,2]-rearrangements are forbidden, with these processes proposed to proceed through homolytic C-N bond fission of the ylide, followed by stereoselective radical-radical recombination. Herein a Lewis basic chiral isothiourea facilitates catalytic [1,2]-rearrangement of prochiral aryl ester ammonium salts to generate unnatural \u03b1-amino acid derivatives with unprecedented levels of enantiocontrol (up to 97:3 er) and up to total selectivity over the thermally allowed [2,3]-rearrangement. Key factors in favouring the [1,2]-rearrangement include exploitation of (i) disubstituted terminal allylic substituents, (ii) cyclic N-substituted ammonium salts and (iii) elevated reaction temperatures. Mechanistic studies involving 13C-labelling and crossover reactions, combined with radical trapping experiments and observed changes in product enantioselectivity are consistent with a radical solvent cage effect, with maximum product enantioselectivity observed with promotion of \u201cin-cage\u201d radical-radical recombination. Computational analysis indicates that the distribution between [1,2]- and [2,3]-rearrangement products arises predominantly from C-N bond homolysis of an intermediate ammonium ylide, followed by recombination of the a-amino radical at either the primary or tertiary site of an intermediate allylic radical. Electrostatic interactions involving the bromide counterion and the rearrangement transition states control the facial selectivity of the [1,2]- and [2,3]-rearrangements, while the difficulty of forming a bond in the more sterically hindered tertiary position of the allylic substituent disfavors the formation of the [2,3]-product.

The present work aims to conduct a comparative and extensive profiling of the natural product-likeness of a recently updated version of LANaPDB and the individual ten compound databases that form part of LANaPDB. The natural product-likeness profile of the Latin American compound databases is contrasted with the profile of other major natural product databases in the public domain and a set of small-molecule drugs approved for clinical use. As part of the extensive characterization, we employed several chemoinformatics metrics of natural product likeness. The results of this study will capture the attention of the global community engaged in natural product databases, not only in Latin America but across the world.", "date": "2024-02-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, there is only limited experimental data on the PFAS BDEs, and there are uncertainties associated with the BDEs computed using density functional theory. Although quantum chemical methods like the G4 composite method can provide highly accurate BDEs (< 1 kcal mol-1), they are limited to small system sizes. To address DFT's accuracy limitations and G4's system size constraints, we examined the connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH) scheme and found that it can provide BDEs that are reasonably close to the G4 accuracy while retaining the computational efficiency of DFT. To further improve the accuracy, we modified the CBH scheme and demonstrated that BDEs calculated using it have a mean-absolute deviation of 0.7 kcal mol-1 from G4 BDEs. To validate the reliability of this new scheme, we computed the ground state free energies of seven PFAS compounds and BDEs for 44 C\u2013C and C\u2013F bonds at the G4 level of theory. Our results suggest that the modified CBH scheme can accurately compute the BDEs of both small and large PFAS at near G4 level accuracy, offering promise for more effective PFAS degradation strategies.

The escalating global demand for food production and a surge in agricultural activities have resulted in a significant increase in agro-waste generation. In India, an agro-waste annual output ranging between 85-100 million tonnes is observed, with wheat straws contributing substantially to approximately one-third of the total agro residue [6]. Addressing the challenge of agro-waste utilisation, we present an innovative methodology for converting wheat straw into a Biodegradable polymer (acetyl ferulic acid polymer). The process involves the extraction of lignin through an acid-base neutralisation reaction, with the qualitative confirmation of lignin presence achieved through Safranin dye testing. The extracted lignin undergoes oxidation via the Nitrobenzene Oxidation (NBO) method, facilitating the conversion into Vanillin through sidechain oxidation of the complex lignin structure. The subsequent acetylation of Vanillin is carried out to obtain acetyl ferulic acid, which is then polymerised utilising zinc acetate as a catalyst. Glycerol is employed as a plasticiser, and the biodegradability of the resulting polymer is assessed within a controlled ambient decomposition environment in the laboratory. Decomposition data is subjected to modelling using Wolfram Mathematica, yielding the decomposition time. Our findings assert that the developed biodegradable polymer requires approximately 105 days to decompose, achieving a degradation rate of approximately 99.98%. This newly synthesised biopolymer is posited to exhibit compatibility with existing biodegradable polymers, thus contributing to the advancement of sustainable polymer materials.", "date": "2024-02-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Biopolymers; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

With infinite structural possibilities, the MOF community is reliant on simulations to identify the most promising candidates for given applications. Among thousands of reported structures, many exhibit limited reproducibility - in either synthesis, performance, or both - owing to the sensitivity of synthetic conditions. Geometric distortions that may arise in the functional groups of pyrene-based ligands during synthesis and/or activation cannot easily be predicted. This sometimes leads to discrepancies between in-silico and experimental results. Here, we investigate a series of topologically similar pyrene MOFs for carbon capture, as in their orthorhombic crystal structure, the ligand stacks in a parallel fashion, creating a promising binding site for CO2. These structures share the same ligand 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy), but have different metals (M-TBAPy, with M = Al, Ga, In, Sc). As predicted, the metal is shown to affect the pyrene stacking distance, and therefore the CO2 uptake. Interestingly however, our study reveals that the choice of metal also affects the rotational freedom of the ligand's benzoate groups, impacting the overall predicted ranking of the MOFs based on their CO2 uptake. Crystallographic analysis reveals the presence of additional phases where the metal node allows for geometric rearrangement. Considering these additional phases improves the prediction of adsorption isotherms, enhancing our understanding of pyrene-based MOFs for efficient carbon capture.", "date": "2024-02-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

There are countless potential diamines and tetramines, paving the way for a vast number of potential sorbents to be probed for CO$_2$ adsorption properties. The number of amines and their configuration in the MOF pore are key drivers of CO$_2$ adsorption capacity and kinetics, and so a validation of computational prediction of these quantities is required to suitably use computational methods in the discovery and screening of amine-functionalized sorbents. In this work, we study the predictive accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) and related calculations on amine loading and configuration for one diamine and two tetramines. In particular, we explore the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and its formulation for solids (PBEsol) with and without the Grimme-D2 and Grimme-D3 pairwise corrections (PBE+D2/3 and PBEsol+D2/3), two revised PBE functionals with the Grimme-D2 and Grimme-D3 pairwise corrections (RPBE+D2/3 and revPBE+D2/3), and the non-local van der Waals correlation (vdW-DF2) functional. We also investigate a universal graph deep learning inter-atomic potential's (M3GNet) predictive accuracy for loading and configuration. These results allow us to identify a useful screening procedure for configuration prediction that has a coarse component for quick evaluation and a higher accuracy component for detailed analysis. Our general observation is that the NNP can be used as a high-level and rapid screening tool, whereas PBEsol+GD3 gives a completely qualitatively predictive picture across all systems studied, and can thus be used for high accuracy motif predictions. We close by briefly exploring the predictions of relative thermal stability for the different functionals and dispersion corrections.", "date": "2024-02-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

These preclude the evaluation of finite-temperature free energy corrections, limiting thermochemical calculations to enthalpies only. Full-dimensional vibrational frequency calculations are possible by replacing the fixed-atom constraints with harmonic confining potentials, and here we compare that approach to an alternative strategy in which fixed-atom contributions to the Hessian are simply omitted.  While that approach does eliminate imaginary frequencies, it tends to underestimate both the zero-point energy and the vibrational entropy, in addition to the artificial rigidity already introduced by fixed-atom constraints. Harmonic confining potentials eliminate imaginary frequencies and provide a flexible means to construct models that can be used in unconstrained geometry relaxations.

Despite recent progress in sensitivity of PES, there exists a necessity for a comprehensive understanding of mutual interactions between exciton modes and plasmonic responses of nanocavities in terms of relative positions, orientations, and excitation wavelengths. In this study, we observed that the hot-spot transfer effect, occurring upon the coupling of a single molecule with a plasmonic nanocavity, is induced by the exciton modes of the molecule. Bright spots within the exciton mode contribute positively to the near fields, while dark spots contribute negative impact on the fields in the plasmonic nanocavity. At the sub-nanometer scale, the coupling between the molecule and plasmonic nanocavity results in substantial deviations from a simple power law. We approach the understanding the local field enhancement from both aspects of plasmon excitation and molecule induction.

These impurities pose significant risks in various applications, including electronics, biological tissues, and medical implants. At the same time, spatial-/time-/light-controlled 3D photo printing has been hindered by low-efficiency polymerization concerning both initiation and monomer conversion. To address these criti-cal issues, a pioneering concept, \u201cdegradation-inhibited quench,\u201d is introduced and implemented within photopolymeriza-tion to solve the problems mentioned above. This innovative approach aims to produce pure polymers via higher-efficiency Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) with a unique class of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives as organo-photocatalysts at an extremely low concentration (as low as 50ppm). Through this approach, pure polymers with ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) have been successfully synthesized. For instance, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) achieved a monomer conversion of > 50%, a molecular weight of 2.1 million, and a dispersity of 1.38 after 12 h additional dark reaction. Notably, this novel photopolymerization method demonstrates applicability across a broad spectrum of monomers, with or without solvents, including acrylate, acrylic, styrene, and acrylonitrile. Mechanism insights revealed that the production of UHMW PMMA stemmed from the degradation of intermediate complex DPP\u2022+/Br-, which originated from the photo initiation. This degradation inhibited the oxidative quenching of active propagating chain radicals, thereby significantly extending their lifespan. This groundbreaking concept embraces the potential for further development of highly effective organo-photocatalysts and reactive systems specifically tailored for 3D photopolymerization.

However, the need to include on-resin macrocycle formation in the synthetic workflow results in considerable burden and limits universal applicability to CLiPs. Here we show that this drawback can be removed by first converting the native CLiP of interest into its linearized analogue via controlled hydrolysis of the depsi bond through saponification. By avoiding the macrocycle formation altogether, the required synthesis effort is strongly reduced as it now only requires production of linear peptide analogues. The NMR fingerprints of the linear peptide analogues display a sufficiently distinctive chemical shift fingerprint to act as effective discriminators. The approach is developed using viscosin group CLiPs and subsequently demonstrated on putisolvin, leading to a structural revision, and tanniamide, a newly isolated compound defining a new group in the Pseudomonas CLiP portfolio.

The results indicate that a structural transformation from spinel to rock salt phase occurs above a critical limit for the lithium concentra- tion (xc), which is determined to be between 0.5< xc\u22641 for Fe3\u2013\u03b4O4. Magnetization measurements clearly shows the formation of the LiFeO2 phase with its distinct anti- ferromagnetic behaviour below its Need temperature. Upon lithiation, magnetization measurements reveal exchange bias in the hysteresis loops with an asymmetry, which can be attributed to the formation of mosaic-like LiFeO2 subdomains. The combined characterization techniques enabled us to unambiguously identify the phases and their distribution involved in the lithiation process. Correlating magnetic and structural properties opens the path to increase the understanding of the processes involved in a variety of non-magnetic applications of magnetic materials.", "date": "2024-02-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Biggin; John Spencer; Frank von Delft", "abstract": "Fragment approaches are long-established in target-based ligand discovery. Nevertheless, their full transformative potential lies dormant, because progressing hits to potency remains difficult and underserved by methodology developments, which mostly focus on screening.  The only credible progression paradigm is conventional design-make-test analyse (DMTA) medicinal chemistry, which is costly and thus necessitates picking winners early, thereby effectively discarding all the other hits.  We here demonstrate the workability of an alternative strategy, namely immediate large-scale exploration of diverse hit-inspired compounds. The key insight is that it is effective to cheaply parallelize large numbers of non-uniform multi-step reactions, because even without compound purification, a high-quality readout of binding is available, namely crystallography of fragment screening. This has the sensitivity to detect even low-level binding of slightly active compounds, which the targeted binding site extracts directly from crude reaction mixtures (CRMs). In this proof-of-concept study, we expand a fragment hit from a crystal-based screen of the second bromodomain of human PHIP, using array synthesis on low-cost robotics to implement 6 independent multi-step reaction routes of up to 5 steps, attempting the synthesis of 1876 diverse expansions; designs were entirely driven by synthetic tractability.  Expected product was present in 1108 CRMs, as detected by automated mass spectrometry; and 22 individual products were resolved in crystal structures of CRMs added to crystals. These provided an initial SAR map, revealed pose stability in 19 and instability in 3 products, and resolved stereochemical preference.

If these two steps were separated, the reaction selectivity and generality issues could then be addressed independently. Herein we report a catalytic asymmetric radical coupling with great generality by merging the copper-catalyzed enantioselective S(IV) center formation and copper-mediated enantiospecific SH2 radical coupling. This decoupling strategy has enabled the successful coupling of over 30 different carbon-, nitrogen-, and oxygen-based radicals having a broad range of reactivity with N-acyl sulfenamides, leading to diverse S-chiral compounds with exceptional enantioselectivity. Thus, it offers a holistic approach to accessing a rich portfolio of S(IV) and S(VI) chiral centers, which is anticipated to have a transformative impact on the synthesis of S-chiral compounds and benefit medicinal chemistry and other related fields.

The toxicity of tire and road wear particles has been linked to their organic additives and associated transformation products. Tire and road wear particles, and associated tire-derived compounds are introduced to the agricultural environment via atmospheric deposition, irrigation with reclaimed wastewater, and the use of biosolids (treated sewage sludge) as fertilizer. In the agricultural environment, these tire-derived compounds could be taken up by edible plants, leading to human exposure. \nMethods: Sixteen tire-derived compounds were measured in twenty-eight commercial leafy vegetable samples from four countries. Based on the results, the estimated daily intake of these tire-derived compounds was calculated due to leafy vegetable consumption based on local diets under a mean and maximum concentration scenario.\nResults: In commercial leafy vegetables, six tire-derived compounds were detected: benzothiazole (maximum concentration \u2013 238 ng/g dry weight), 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (maximum concentration \u2013 665 ng/g dry weight), DPG (maximum concentration \u2013 2.1 ng/g dry weight), 6PPD (maximum concentration \u2013 0.4 ng/g dry weight), IPPD (maximum concentration \u2013 0.1 ng/g dry weight), and CPPD (maximum concentration \u2013 0.3 ng/g dry weight). At least one compound was present in 71% of samples analyzed. The estimated daily intake for DPG ranged from 0.05 ng/person/day in the mean scenario to 4.0 ng/person/day in the maximum scenario; benzothiazole ranged from 12 to 1296 ng/person/day; 6PPD ranged from 0.06 to 2.6 ng/person/day; IPPD ranged from 0.04 to 1.1 ng/person/day; CPPD ranged from 0.05 to 2.6 ng/person/day.\nDiscussion: Statistical analyses did not reveal correlation between known growth conditions and tire-derived compound concentrations in the leafy vegetable samples. The estimated daily intake via leafy vegetable consumption was generally lower than or comparable to the estimated daily intake via other known sources. However, we show that tire-derived compounds are taken up by foodstuff, and exposure might be higher for other produce. Future studies are needed to uncover pathways of tire-derived compounds from road to food, assess the exposure to transformation products, and investigate the biological effects associated with this exposure.\n", "date": "2024-02-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Environmental Science; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Catalytic mutations in Mac1 render viruses nonpathogenic, making this enzyme a promising target for antiviral development. For this reason, the third CACHE challenge focused on identifying binders of the Mac1 domain of NSP3 for the development of novel antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, we used available structural data of the NSP3 Mac1 domain in complex with known fragment binders as starting points for ligand discovery; our efforts were primarily focused on sub-sites of the ADP binding site in the NSP3 macrodomain. Then, using Artificial intelligence (AI)-guided and knowledge-based fragment merging and expansion approaches, we generated novel molecules that would serve as templates to identify highly similar compounds in the Enamine REAL database that would be commercially available.

We ranked the predicted binding poses based on docking score, followed by visual pose analysis of the best 200 compounds. We finally selected and proposed 150 compounds for testing, followed by further shortlisting to yield a final list of 107 molecules. 91 compounds were purchased from Enamine and are being tested at the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC).

Sodium-based batteries constitute a promising alternative to address these issues; however, due to the similarities between the two alkali metals, they present similar failure modes as their lithium counterparts. In this work, we focus on one of such failure mechanisms: the thermodynamically-driven accumulation of vacancies on the surface of the metallic anode, which leads to the formation of voids and pits, detrimental to battery performance and cycle life. We investigate the differences in behavior between anode/coating interfaces of both lithium and sodium. Adhesion energy, a descriptor previously argued to be a reliable design principle for lithium metal anodes, is found to not exhibit the same predictive power for sodium metal architectures: in cases where vacancy congregation is not thermodynamically favorable for isolated sodium slabs, we find strong interfacial interactions to have adverse effects on void formation. By studying select coating materials, we also reveal that these material interactions at alkali/coating interfaces are highly nuanced, and that the field of surface science and engineering is ripe with opportunities for further discovery and tuning of surface properties via coating selection.

From a mechanistic viewpoint, we show that cation disorder greatly lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy by decreasing the coordination number of transition metals to certain oxygen ions. In addition, we observe a large chemical expansion coefficient with respect to oxygen nonstoichiometry, which is about three times greater than those of classical oxygen-deficient materials such as fluorite and perovskite oxides.

This is particularly the case in Fe-based Fenton like reaction, in which both Fe2+ and Fe3+ are active but react with significantly different catalytic rates. While the elemental metal loading is easily assessed by elemental analysis, the determination of the oxidation degree is more challenging. To do so, we designed single Fe-based meso-macroporous silica materials as catalysts for the degradation of methylene blue, an organic dye serving as well-known model for the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater. The silica materials were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel process through a combined templating mechanism with micelles and solid lipid nanoparticles of Fe-based surfactants. Magnetic measurements have revealed that half of the iron centers are in the Fe2+ state. The following of the Fenton like reaction through magnetic measurements agrees with a contribution of Fe2+ in the catalytic process. The magnetic response emerges as a valuable tool for quantifying and characterizing individual catalytic centers.

While impressive improvements of their sensitivity have been realized, the bandwidths of these devices have been mostly limited to few MHz. We argue that this shortcoming originates in the relatively large RC constants of TMDC-based photodetectors, which suffer from high surface defect densities, inefficient charge carrier injection at the electrode/TMDC interface and long charging times. However, we show in a series of papers that rather simple adjustments in the device architecture afford TMDC-based photodetectors with bandwidths of several 100s MHz. We rationalize the success of these adjustments in terms of the specific physical-chemical properties of TMDCs, namely their anisotropic in-plane/out-of-plane carrier behavior, large optical absorption, and chalcogenide-dependent surface chemistry. Just one surprisingly simple yet effective pathway to fast TMDC photodetection is the reduction of the photoresistance by using light-focusing optics, which enables bandwidths of 0.23 GHz with an energy consumption of only 27 fJ/bit.  By reflecting on the ultrafast intrinsic photoresponse times of few picoseconds in TMDC heterostructures, we motivate the application of more demanding chemical strategies to exploit such ultrafast intrinsic properties for true GHz-operation in real devices. A key aspect in this regard is the management of surface defects, which we discuss in terms of its dependence on the layer thickness, its tunability by molecular adlayers and the prospects of replacing thermally evaporated metal contacts by laser-printed electrodes fabricated with inks of metalloid clusters. We highlight the benefits of combining TMDCs with graphene to heterostructures that exhibit the ultrafast photoresponse and large spectral range of Dirac materials with the low dark current and high responsivities of semiconductors. We introduce the bulk photovoltaic effect in TMDC-based materials with broken inversion symmetry as well as a combination of TMDCs with plasmonic nanostructures as means for increasing the bandwidth and responsivity simultaneously. Finally, we describe the prospects of embedding TMDC photodetectors into optical cavities with the objective of tuning the lifetime of the photoexcited state and increasing the carrier mobility in the photoactive layer. The findings and concepts detailed in this account demonstrate that GHz photodetection with TMDCs is feasible, and we hope that these bright prospects for their application as next-generation optoelectronic material motivates more chemists and material scientists to actively pursue the development of the more complicated material combinations outlined here.

In this work, we micropatterned highly conductive poly(phenylene alkylene) ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) with different surface geometries for MCDI. The micropatterned membranes increase the interfacial area with the liquid stream leading to a 700 mV reduction in cell voltage when operating at constant current (2 mA cm-2; 2000 ppm NaCl feed) and improved the energy normalized adsorbed salt (ENAS) value, increasing it by 1.4 times. Combining the micropatterned poly(phenylene alkylene) IEMs with poly(phenylene alkylene) ionomer filled electrodes reduced the cell voltage by 1000 mV improved the ENAS values by 2.3 times relative to the base case. This reduction in cell voltage allowed for higher current density operation (i.e., 3 to 4 mA cm-2) without the occurrence of significant parasitic reactions. Finally, we implemented porous ionic conductors into the spacer channel with flat and micropatterned IEM configurations and ionomer infiltrated electrodes. For the configuration with flat IEMs, the porous ionic conductor improved ENAS values across the current density regime (2 to 4 mA cm-2). The porous ionic conductors combined with micropatterned IEMs and porous ionic conductors only improved ENAS when operating the cell at 4 mA cm-2. The latter observation motivates future work to design integrated patterned IEMs with porous ionic conductor materials for improving MCDI energy efficiency over a wide current density range and with varying NaCl feed concentrations.

In this study, cationic cellulose was synthesized using an epoxy derivative, 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (EPTMAC), in an aqueous pyrrolidinium hydroxide solution. Since an aqueous pyrrolidinium hydroxide solution is a strong alkaline solution, the solution not only exhibits a high cellulose solubility at room temperature but also facilitates the reaction between cellulose and the epoxy derivative. We investigated the influence of reaction time, temperature, cellulose concentration, cationic reagent concentration, and the selection of a precipitation solvent for purification on the degree of substitution (DS) value of cationic cellulose. The structure of the obtained cationic cellulose was examined using 1H NMR, 1H-1H TOCSY, 1H-13C HSQC measurements, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). As a result of increasing cellulose and EPTMAC concentrations, the DS value increased, reaching a maximum value of 1.9. Solubility tests indicated that the cationic cellulose with chloride counter-anions exhibited notable solubility even in ethanol when the DS values were over 1.2. Cationic cellulose with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (TFSA) anion synthesized with a view to battery applications was insoluble in water and exhibited a film-forming property. Thus, the solubility of cationic cellulose could be controlled by varying the anionic species.", "date": "2024-02-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Cellulosic materials; Polyelectrolytes - Polymers; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In hydroxyl radical protein footprinting with X-rays (XFP), hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) generated by water radiolysis covalently label multiple amino acid (AA) side chains simultaneously. However, HRPF technologies faces challenges in achieving their full potential due to the broad (>103) dynamic range of AA\u2019s reactivity to \u2022OH and the difficulty to detect slightly modified residues, particularly in peptides with highly reactive residues like methionine-containing peptides and in peptides containing all low reactive residues. To overcome this limitation, we developed a synchrotron-based multiplex labeling chemistry that utilizes CF3 radicals (\u2022CF3) produced from a trifluoromethylation (TFM) reagent under controlled and optimized \u2022OH doses generated by X-rays. We optimized the dual \u2022CF3/\u2022OH chemistry in this TFM labeling approach using six model peptides and lysozyme, there-by extending the existing \u2022OH labeling platform with simultaneous \u2022CF3 labeling. This optimization led to a two-fold increase in labeled AAs in multiplex TFM labeling, primarily by labeling to a greater degree AAs with low \u2022OH reactivity via the \u2022CF3 channel, while moderate and highly \u2022OH reactive AAs were labeled in both \u2022CF3 and \u2022OH channels. Importantly, the low reactivity of methionine to \u2022CF3 enabled the detection and quantification of additional AAs labeled by \u2022CF3 across methionine-containing pep-tides. Consistent with observations in model peptides and protein, we observed a balanced dual \u2022CF3/\u2022OH chemistry and more uniform labeling of residues in both \u2022CF3/\u2022OH channels optimizing protein footprinting. Furthermore, the solvent accessibility of lysozyme residues directly correlated with \u2022CF3 labeling demonstrating that multiplex labeling enables a high-resolution assessment of molecular interactions for enhanced HRPF.

This paper reports a simple, reliable, and quick method of preparing ultra-thin GO films, irrespective of their origin, and demonstrates the new opportunities possible with the utilization of this method. The total amount of GO used to form the thin film is significantly less compared to previous examples in the literature, minimizing the dissolved GO in the subphase.

In this work, we describe the first example of a heterometallic d-f cyanide-bridged Ru(II)-Er(III) assembly ob-tained by the direct reaction of trivalent erbium salt with the neutral [Ru(bipy)2(CN)2] metalloligand. This strategy allows for accommodating inorganic negatively charged anions, such as nitrate and oxalate, in the coordination sphere of the lanthanide ion. As a result, a dimeric tetranuclear discrete molecular architecture is obtained, where the two constituting monomeric Ru(II)-CN-Er(III) units are bridged by an oxalate anion coordinating two Er(III) ions in a bis-bidentate fashion. Strikingly, this heter-ometallic compound shows intense dual emission in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges under single-wavelength exci-tation both in solution and in the crystalline state. The effect of Er(III) coordination through a cyanide bridge is thoroughly dis-cussed, also with the support of DFT calculations, to highlight the factors that induce the observed spectral hypsochromism and, more importantly, the remarkable tenfold-increased emission quantum yield of the [Ru(bipy)2(CN)2] moiety in the visible range. We show that the described coordination mode induces an energy raise of the emissive 3MLCT state and even a more pronounced lifting of the non-emissive Ru(II) 3MC states, suppressing thermal deactivation channels. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of water molecules and quenching groups surrounding the lanthanide ion in the molecular architecture, rel-atively intense erbium emission at 1.5 \u03bcm telecom wavelength is detected through the sensitization from the Ru(II) metallolig-and. We suggest that this compound can find applications as efficient solid-state dual emitter and luminescent chemical sensor.

This research delves into the interaction mechanisms between lignin and organic molecules, using the adsorption of the cationic dye Methylene Blue (MB+) as a case study. Herein, we aim to quantitatively estimate the contribution of different interaction types in the overall adsorption process. While carbonyl groups were found to have no significant role in attraction, carboxylic groups (\u2013COOH) exhibited significantly lower adsorption compared to hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH). Through alternately blocking aliphatic and phenolic \u2013OH groups, we determined that 61% of the adsorption occurred through H-bonding and 38% via electrostatic interactions. Performance studies of modified lignin, along with spectroscopic methods (XPS, FTIR) confirmed the negligible role of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions in adsorption. This study offers fundamental insights into the mechanistic aspects of MB adsorption on lignin, laying the groundwork for potential modifications to enhance the performance of lignin-based adsorbents.

Luminescent WELs have potential applications as solar cell coatings and smart, planar optical components. However, as luminophore-photoinitiator interactions are expected to change photopolymerization kinetics, the design of robust luminescent photopolymer sols is non-trivial.

Initial rate analysis with different bulk polymers reveals differences in the first-order rate constants in the absence and presence of LV, with a notable increase (40%) in the photolysis rate for the 1:1 blend. Fluorescence quenching studies, coupled with density functional theory calculations, establish that these differences arise due to electron transfer from photoexcited LV to the ground state photoinitiator molecules. We also demonstrate an in-situ UV/Vis absorbance technique that enables real-time monitoring of both waveguide formation and photoinitiator consumption during the fabrication of WELs. The in-situ photolysis kinetics confirm that LV-photoinitiator interactions also influence the photopolymerization process during WEL formation.

Any mention of the word \u2018nicotine\u2019 was removed from e-cigarette packaging by early 2022 and nicotine warnings were replaced with generic underage sale warnings. Despite this labelling the vast majority (98.8%) of devices analysed contained nicotine, most (89%) at high concentration (>30 mg/mL) and 4.2% contained at least one chemical prohibited by the TGO110. Conclusions: Manufacturers have removed any mention of nicotine from the original e-cigarette packaging to circumvent regulations and continue their sale. The packaging of e-cigarette products in Australia is generally not indicative of their contents, particularly nicotine, and most did not display required warnings. Ingredients with associated health risks, prohibited in legal vapes by the TGO110, were found in samples. Consequently, the risks of e-cigarette use cannot be appropriately identified from the information supplied on the packaging or device.", "date": "2024-02-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Understanding the electronic structures of their active sites (oxidation state, local symmetry and ligand environment) is key to developing molecular-level structure-property relationships. In that context, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers a unique combination of element selectivity and sensitivity to local symmetry. Commonly, for early transition metals such as Ti, K-edge XAS is applied for in situ characterization and subsequent structural analysis with high sensitivity towards tetrahedral species. Ti L2,3-edge spectroscopy is in principle complementary and offers specific opportunities to interrogate the electronic structure of five-and six-coordinated species. It is, however, much more rarely implemented, because the use of soft X-rays implies ultra-high vacuum conditions. Furthermore, the interpretation of the data can be challenging. Here, we show how Ti L2,3-edge spectroscopy can help to obtain unique information about both homogenous and heterogeneous epoxidation catalysts and to develop a molecular-level relationship between spectroscopic signatures and electronic structures. Towards this goal, we first establish a spectral library of molecular Ti reference compounds, comprising various coordination environments with mono- and dimeric Ti species having O, N and Cl-ligands. We next implemented a computational methodology based on multiplet ligand field theory and maximally localized Wannier orbitals benchmarked on our library to understand Ti L2,3-edge spectroscopic signatures.

Many contributions of Blacks to modern technology are still not widely known. In 1913 alone, more than a thousand inventions were patented by African Americans who were fortunate enough to be accepted at the patent office. Many other black inventors discovered medicines as well as laborsaving devices, but were not allowed to patent them in their own names; others who controlled their labor stole credit, authorship, and profit for their discoveries. In this article, we hope to inspire young people of all colors by telling the stories of black scientists who developed products, medicines, and systems that changed lives. All scientists presented here were born before the 20th century, when Blacks were up against severe forms of oppression and inhumanity. Black people faced unparalleled obstacles in accessing both primary and higher education, and the few educational facilities that were available to Blacks were inadequate compared to those available to whites. Additionally, black people could not obtain housing or jobs, and they were not recognized or included as members of society. Despite these challenges, some of the greatest scientific discoveries were made by black people. The black scientists highlighted here did not have equal access to education during their lifetime, and it was only through perseverance that they were able to overcome obstacles and earn educational degrees.

A key reason for these high voltages is that the reactors contain a chemical chamber, inserted between the anode and cathode chambers, that leads to a high Ohmic resistance.

Here, narrowband green TADF emitters based on a fICZ framework are reported with a peripheral donor decoration strategy. By attaching electron-donating diphenylamino-type groups onto the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-dominating positions of bis-fused indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole, the HOMO is largely destabilized and the emission is markedly red-shifted (by > 70 nm) with retained narrow bandwidth. In toluene solution, the emitters show green emission with emission maximums at 500\u2212523 nm and small full-widths at half maximums at 26\u221228 nm. Importantly, the donor decoration narrows the singlet-triplet energy gap and introduces a higher-lying long-range charge-transfer triplet state having considerable spin-orbital coupling with the emissive singlet state, which behaves as an intermediate triplet state to facilitate RISC. In doped films, the emitters show efficient narrowband green TADF emission.

In case of PLA a single \u03b1 phase is formed. The print bed temperature has, in comparison to PA12, a major influence on the degree of crystallinity \u03c7c and\nthus the homogeneity of the 3D printed parts, especially close to the print bed. By comparing the obtained results from WAXD, DMA, DSC and FSC measurements with relevant printing times, guidelines for 3D printed parts with a homogeneous structure are derived.", "date": "2024-02-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymer morphology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The interdependencies between the two dimensions and the possibility of incorporating complex gradient profiles, such as multi-segmented gradients or shifting gradients, make trial-and-error method development time-consuming and highly dependent on user experience. Retention modeling and Bayesian optimization (BO) have been proposed as solutions to mitigate these issues. However, both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. On one hand, retention modeling depends on effective peak tracking and accurate retention time and width predictions, becoming increasingly challenging for complex samples and advanced gradient assemblies. On the other hand, Bayesian optimization may require many experiments when dealing with many adjustable parameters, as in LC\u00d7LC. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the use of multi-task Bayesian optimization (MTBO), a method that can combine information from both retention modeling and experimental measurements. The algorithm was first tested and compared with BO using a synthetic retention modeling test case, where it was shown that MTBO finds better optima with fewer method-development iterations than conventional BO. Next, the algorithm was tested on the optimization of a method for a pesticide sample and we found that the algorithm was able to improve upon the initial scanning experiments. Multi-task Bayesian optimization is a promising technique in situations where modeling retention is challenging, and the high number of adjustable parameters and/or limited optimization budget makes traditional Bayesian optimization impractical.", "date": "2024-02-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

For practical single molecule sensing applications, arrays of on-chip integrated fixed-gap tunnel junctions that can be built into compact systems are preferable. Fabricating nanogaps by electromigration is one of the most promising approaches to realize on-chip integrated tunnel junction sensors. However, the electrical behavior of fixed-gap tunnel junctions immersed in liquid media has not been systematically studied to date, and the formation of electromigrated nanogap tunnel junctions in liquid media has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we perform a comparative study of the formation and electrical behavior of arrays of gold nanogap tunnel junctions made by feedback-controlled electromigration immersed in various liquid and gaseous media (deionized water, mesitylene, ethanol, nitrogen, and air). We demonstrate that tunnel junctions can be obtained from microfabricated gold nano-constrictions inside liquid media. Electromigration of junctions in air produces the highest yield (61 %), electromigration in deionized water and mesitylene results in a lower yield than in air (44\u201348 %), whereas electromigration in ethanol fails to produce viable tunnel junctions due to interfering electrochemical processes. We map out the stability of the conductance characteristics of the resulting tunnel junctions and identify medium-specific operational conditions which have an impact on the yield of forming stable junctions. Furthermore, we highlight the unique challenges associated with working with arrays of large numbers of tunnel junctions in batches.

Molecular modelling was performed which revealed the TLR8 activity of the IMDQ scaffold to be associated with the presence of amino functionality in the benzyl group.  TLR7-biased activity was driven by the forming of multiple H-bonds with TLR7 which not formed when the IMDQ scaffold compounds were docked with TLR8.

The sensitivity of tunneling currents to entities in the tunneling gap has generated interest in developing electronic biosensors with single molecule resolution. Tunnel junctions can, for example, be used for sensing bound or unbound DNA, RNA, amino acids, and proteins in liquids. However, manufacturing technologies for on-chip integrated arrays of tunnel junction sensors are still in their infancy, and scalable measurement strategies that allow the measurement of large numbers of tunneling junctions are required to facilitate progress. Here, we describe an experimental setup to perform scalable, high bandwidth (> 10 kHz) measurements of low currents (pA\u2013nA) in arrays of on-chip integrated tunnel junctions immersed in various liquid media. Leveraging a commercially available compact 100 kHz bandwidth low-current measurement instrument, we developed a custom two-terminal probe on which the amplifier is directly mounted to decrease parasitic probe capacitances to sub-pF levels. We also integrated a motorized 3-axis stage, which could be powered down using software control, inside the Faraday cage of the setup. This enabled automated data acquisition on arrays of tunnel junctions without worsening the noise floor despite being inside the Faraday cage. A deliberately positioned air gap in the fluidic path ensured liquid perfusion to the chip from outside the Faraday cage without coupling in additional noise. We demonstrated the performance of our setup using rapid current switching observed in electromigrated gold tunnel junctions immersed in deionized water.

In this context, redox-active lyotropic liquid crystals based on 3D nanomaterials, known as lipid cubic phases (LCP), hold great potential due to the large specific surface area and the possibility to be functionalized. In this study, we functionalized a monoolein (MO) LCP matrix by incorporating an amphiphilic redox shuttle within its matrix with the aim to enhance the electrochemical performance of a glucose oxidase (GOx) based electrode and we investigated the stability of the overall system. The use of dodecyl(ferrocenylmethyl)dimethylammonium bromide (Fc12-Br) resulted in an electroactivity loss with time of the resulting Fc12-Br/MO electrode, probably due to the formation of a passivating layer between the bromide counterions and the electrode surface. Hence,  bromine (Br-) was replaced with hexafluorophosate (PF6-), leading to Fc12-PF6/MO. Both structures were used for GOx entrapment and the resulting electro-activity towards glucose was assessed. Though the sensitivity obtained with the Fc12-Br/MO/GOx and Fc12-PF6/MO/GOx systems was comparable, the latter showed superior stability over time, with more than 80% activity retained for > 20 days. Moreover, when the concentration of the Fc12 redox shuttle within the cubic phase was increased by 10,  a 4 times greater current density was generated. Consequently, the Fc12-PF6/MO electrode shows superior stability and performance than previously reported redox lyotropic LCP systems, thus paving the way for promising applications in enzyme-based biodevices.", "date": "2024-02-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Liquid Crystals; Biophysical Chemistry; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While its effect on surface-adsorbate interactions has been rationalized, an understanding of the electronic factors that drive these interactions and their consequences on catalytic activity is lacking. In this work, we use ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling (MKM) to develop electronic descriptors that govern the effect of biaxial strain in the modulation of interactions between adsorbate and transition states with catalyst surface and report its significance in enhancing the activity of fcc Pd(111) in the synthesis of ammonia (NH3), an important renewable-energy and hydrogen (H2) vector. We established the p-band center (pcenter) of the adsorbates and transition states (TS) and the hybridized d-band center (dcenter) of the surface metal as key electronic descriptors for adsorbate and TS energy variations with strain. Specifically, the pcenter of the adsorbates is lowest for the sites with the strongest adsorption, and the upshift of the dcenter of the surface metal atoms is greatest for the adsorption site with the highest strain susceptibility (i.e., the change in adsorption energy per unit applied strain). Importantly, we showed significant deviations in scaling relations with strain compared to periodic scaling relationships, both for adsorption and reaction. Over a net 4% tensile strain (\u00b12%), the dcenter of Pd(111) moved upward by 0.21 eV, enhancing N2 dissociation, the rate-determining step in NH3 synthesis by ~37\u00d7, and the pcenter in N  bound to the catalyst surface moved downward in the adsorbed state and upward in the TS (i.e., electron density shifted toward the bonding and anti-bonding states, respectively). Thus, tensile strain played a dual role in enhancing N2 dissociation, strengthening the adsorption of atomic N and weakening the N-N bond in the TS. We then evaluated N2 dissociation at 3/4 ML H-coverage under industrial conditions (150 atm H\u00ac2, 50 atm N2, and 723 K), revealing the effect of tensile strain on the rate enhancement to be nearly two orders of magnitude greater (~3273\u00d7 vs. ~37\u00d7) at high surface coverages.

Several strategies have been developed to both synthetically and post-synthetically tailor the depletion layer towards particular applications, however, this understanding has primarily been advanced in Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) nanocrystals, leaving open questions about generalizing to other doped metal oxides. Here, we quantitatively analyze the depletion layer in In-doped CdO (ICO) nanocrystals, which we show have an intrinsically wide depletion layer that leads to broad plasmonic modulation via post-synthetic chemical reduction and ligand exchange. Leveraging these insights, we apply depletion layer tuning to enhance the inherently weak plasmonic coupling in ICO nanocrystal superlattices. Our results demonstrate how electronic band structure dictates the radial distribution of electrons and governs the response to post-synthetic modulation, enabling the design of tunable and responsive plasmonic materials.

However, beginning with initial materials sintering and extending through electrochemical aging, Sr diffusion within the Gd-doped CeO2 (GDC) barrier layer has been observed to lead to the formation of unwanted secondary phases such as SrO and SrZrO3. To establish the impact of these phases on SOEC performance, we perform firstprinciples calculations to determine secondary phase bulk oxide conductivities and compared them to that of the YSZ electrolyte. We find that SrO has a low conductivity arising from poor mobility and a low concentration of oxygen vacancies (V_O^2+), and its presence in SOECs should therefore be avoided as much as possible. SrZrO3 also has a lower oxide conductivity than YSZ; however, this discrepancy is primarily due to lower V_O^2+ concentrations, not V_O^2+ mobility. We find Y-doping to be a viable strategy to increase V_O^2+ concentrations in SrZrO3, with 16% substitution of Y on the Zr site leading to an ionic conductivity on par with that of YSZ. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy obtained using scanning transmission electron microscropy on cross-sections of SOECs indicates that Y is the most common minority element present in SrZrO3 forming near the GDC\u2014YSZ interface. Thus, we expect SrZrO3 to be rich in V_O^2+ and not to hinder long-term device performance.

As proof of concept, we investigate the effects of twist angle on the electrocatalytic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). We predict the activity of tBLG with the twist angle of 13.174\u00b0 and 21.787\u00b0 for hydrogenation evolution reaction (HER) using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach. We calculate the hydrogen adsorption energy (\u0394GH*) at various sites on tBLG and examine their angle-dependency. By comparing the GH* for different active sites of untwisted bilayer graphene (BLG) and tBLG, we find that the GH* decreases with the increase of twist angle. As a result, the thermodynamic limiting potential for HER increases with the twist angle. Furthermore, the \u0394GH* shows a correlation with the layer distance and the site location on the 2D plane. Detailed analysis reveals that the twist of bilayer graphene could increase the z height (dz) of active sites as a function of their distance to the symmetry centers, alter the local geometry of active sites, and therefore modify the \u0394GH*.

Recently, a new class of sulfonolipids, sulfur amino lipids (SALs), was identified in these bacteria, with possible structures proposed by Smith et al. (ISME Journal, 2021, 15, 2440-2453). This study aims to confirm or revise the proposed structures for SAL-656 and SAL-672. Two candidates for SAL-656 and SAL-672 were synthesized, namely 3-acyloxyacylamides of homotaurine and cysteinolic acid, respectively. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of synthetic and natural SALs revealed significant discrepancies, leading to the exclusion of proposed structures. Further exploration of lipid extracts from R. pomeroyi and P. inhibens identified related lipoforms of SAL-656 and SAL-672, which form two distinct families based on LC-MS/MS and molecular network analysis. While the mass spectrometric data allow exclusion of previously proposed structures and provide insights into acyl groups and headgroups, the complete structures of SAL-656 and SAL-672 remain elusive. Nonetheless, the data are consistent with revised structures based on cysteinolic acid or 3-amino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid wherein both hydroxyl and amino groups are acylated.

However, current technologies have significant drawbacks that limit application to select feedstocks. For example, the endothermic steam-reforming process is limited to gasified low-sulfur feedstocks that have thus far precluded the economic utilization of municipal solid wastes (MSW) among other sources of biomass. The use of elemental S is one potential method to utilize these organic wastes for H2 production through the high-temperature and exothermic production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon disulfide (CS2) gasses as chemical intermediates. These reduced sulfur species are thermodynamically unstable with respect to their oxygen-analogs, which indicates that usable chemical energy may be derived from their oxidation. When biomass is dehydrogenated with S at lower temperatures, the formation of CS2 is suppressed and sulfurized biochar is produced.

This \u201csulfur-reforming\u201d process and additional steps may allow for the economical valorization of currently unutilized organic matter in MSW that may be contributing to environmental harm.

However, the underlying mechanism of Cas12a\u2019s trans-cleavage characteristic remains unclear. To explore this mechanism, we introduced Xeno nucleic acids (XNA) as potential trans-cleavage substrates of Cas12a. XNAs are chemically modified nucleic acid analogues, which originate from chemical modifications of nucleobases, sugar moieties, and the backbone. We observed a progressive decrease in trans-cleavage rates by Cas12a across different types of XNAs, in the following sequence: nucleobase-modified XNA > sugar moiety-modified XNA > backbone-modified XNA. In addition, more complex chemical modifications on either of the three above locations led to the lowering of the trans-cleavage rate of Cas12a.

In the present paper, we focus our investigation on the 21 m bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) WiS electrolyte, recently reported to have acidic pH values. We explore the speciation of an excess proton in this system and its dependence on the initial local environment using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

This acid is stabilised in the WiS solution for several picoseconds thanks to the formation of a complex with water molecules and a neighboring TFSI\u2013 anion. We further investigate how the excess proton affects the microstructure of WiS, in particular, the oligomerisation of lithium cations, and report possible notable perturbations of lithium nanochain organisation in some cases.

CO2/cyclic epoxide ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) allows for >30 wt% of the polycarbonate to derive from CO2; so far, the field has largely focused on oligocarbonates. In contrast, efficient catalysts for high molar mass polycarbonates are under-investigated and the resulting thermoplastic structure-property relationships, processing and recycling need to be elucidated. This work describes a new organometallic Mg(II)Co(II) catalyst that combines high productivity, low loading tolerance, the highest polymerization control and yields polycarbonates with Mn values from 4-130 kg mol-1, with narrow, monomodal distributions. It is used in the ROCOP of CO2 with bicyclic epoxides to produce a series of samples, each with Mn>100 kg mol-1, of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC), poly(vinyl-cyclohexene carbonate) (PvCHC), poly(ethyl-cyclohexene carbonate) (PeCHC, by hydrogenation of PvCHC) and poly(cyclopentene carbonate) (PCPC). All these materials are amorphous thermoplastics, with high glass transition temperatures (85 < Tg < 126 \u00b0C, by DSC) and high thermal stability (Td > 260 \u00b0C). The cyclic ring substituents mediate the materials\u2019 chain entanglements, viscosity, and glass transition temperatures.

We focus on gentle ensemble refinement, where the difference between the potential energy surfaces of the reference and refined models is small on a thermal scale. By relating the variance of this energy difference to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the respective Boltzmann distributions, one can encode prior knowledge about energy uncertainties, i.e., force-field errors, in the exchange rate. The energy uncertainty is defined in the space of observables and depends on their type and number, and on the thermodynamic state. We highlight the relation of gentle refinement to free energy perturbation theory. A balanced encoding of prior knowledge increases the quality and transparency of ensemble refinement.

Pyridoxal hydrochloride was synthetically converted to a series of diverse vitamin B6-based redox-active benzoyl pyridinium salts. These compounds were electrochemically characterized through cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in neutral and basic aqueous electrolytes (1 M KCl and 0.1 M NaOH). Based on the CV results, which demonstrated reversibility under basic conditions, two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory-scale redox flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10 mM with 0.1 M NaOH as the supporting electrolyte. These results showed that the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. Both CV analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two-electron process. To explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. This process involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons to reduce the ketone group to alcohol. Computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (ET), then proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and finally proton transfer (PT). 1H NMR deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last PT step is not reversible in 0.1 M NaOH, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. The apparent reversibility observed in CV at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the PT step at the timescale of the measurement.

However, conventional materials used for sensing layers often suffer from poor selectivity and require elevated operating temperatures, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel approach to address these challenges by utilizing the intrinsic physicochemical properties of Mo-bearing transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The findings reveal that variable charge availability on TMD surfaces leads to highly selective adsorption enhancements, resulting in significant differences in the TMD responses to various molecules, even at room temperature. This results in an exceptional relative sensitivity of the TMD monolayers, which in the case of combustion products exceeds what is feasible under the same conditions by conventional sensing materials such as ZnO and TiO2 by three orders of magnitude. Such an unprecedented variation in responses results in distinct sensing profiles. This enables effective cross-referencing of responses, offering significant benefits for sensor arrays.

To date, the production of LCCs in high yields is still an open challenge. Herein, we address this challenge with a novel approach for the targeted production of LCCs. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), we optimized our AquaSolv Omni (AqSO) biorefinery toward the synthesis of LCCs with high carbohydrate content (up to 60/100 Ar) and high yields (up to 15 wt%). Our AI approach was essential for biorefinery fine-tuning toward maximum performance, while keeping the number of experiments within reasonable limits. More specifically, we followed a Bayesian Optimization approach that allowed us to iteratively collect data and explore the effect on yield and carbohydrate content of selected processing conditions: temperature, process severity, and liquid-to-solid ratio. By means of a Pareto front analysis, we identified optimal trade-offs between the LCC yield and carbohydrate content. We discovered sizeable regions of processing conditions that yield LCCs in 8-15 wt% with carbohydrate content in the range of 10-40/100 Ar. To evaluate the utility of the produced LCCs for future high-value applications, we measured key properties: the glass transition temperature (Tg), the surface tension, and the antioxidant activity. Intriguingly, we found that LCCs with high carbohydrate content are generally related with low Tg and surface tension. The presented biorefinery concept, in conjunction with its AI-guided optimization, is a first step toward the scalable production of LCCs tailor-made for high-value applications.", "date": "2024-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This mechanism is not reproduced by static DFT but is supported by quasi-classical molecular dynamics calculations and unifies several unusual observations in this system, including partial chirality transfer, non-statistical isotopic scrambling at the ethylene bridge, the isolation of spirocyclic dearomatized species in a related heterocyclic series, and the observation that introduction of an 8-substituent dramatically improves enantiospecificity.", "date": "2024-02-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For instance, employing anion redox can yield higher capacities compared to transition metal redox alone. Anion redox in sulfides has been recognized since the early days of rechargeable battery research. however, now we aim to understand the charge compensation mechanisms and how to control them. Here, we study the effect of d-p overlap in controlling anion redox by shifting the metal d band position relative to the S p band. We aim to determine the effect of shifting the d band position on the electronic structure and ultimately on charge compensation. Two isostructural sulfides LiNaFeS2 and LiNaCoS2 are directly compared with the hypothesis that the Co material should yield more covalent metal-anion bonds. The newly reported material LiNaCoS2 exhibits multielectron capacity of >/=1.7 electrons per formula unit, but despite the lowered Co d band, the voltage of anion redox is close to that of LiNaFeS2. Interestingly, the material suffers from rapid capacity fade. Through a combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Co and S X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and partial density of states calculations, we demonstrate that S oxidation to [S2]2- occurs in early states of charge which leads to an irreversible phase transition into pyrite CoS2 and lithiated cobalt spinel phases such as LixCo3S4 and LixCo9S8. Thus, we conclude that anion oxidation occurs from S nonbonding p orbitals and the Co d bands are too low in energy to prevent a phase transition to more thermodynamically stable persulfide-containing phases. Further, the higher crystal field stabilization energy for octahedral coordination over tetrahedral coordination leads to phase transition in LiNaCoS2.", "date": "2024-02-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Electrochemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While appreciably studied in two-dimensional systems, the influence of surface organic substituents on many known and emergent one-dimensional (1D) and quasi-1D (q-1D) crystals has remained underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate the surface functionalization of bulk and nanoscale Chevrel-like q-1D ionic crystals using In2Mo6Te6, a predicted q-1D Dirac semimetal, as the model phase. Using a series of alkyl ammonium (\u2014NR4+; R = H, methyl, ethyl, butyl, and octyl) substituents with varying chain lengths, we demonstrate the systematic expansion of the intra-chain c-axis direction and the contraction of the inter-chain a/b-axis direction with longer chain substituents. Additionally, we demonstrate the systematic expansion of the intra-chain c-axis direction and the contraction of the inter-chain a/b-axis direction as the alkyl chain substituents become longer using a combination of powder X-ray diffraction and Raman experiments. Beyond the structural modulation that the substituted groups can impose on the lattice, we also found that the substitution of ammonium-based groups on the surface of the nanocrystals resulted in selective suspension in aqueous (NH4+-functionalized) or organic solvents (NOc4+-functionalized), imparted fluorescent character (Rhodamine B-functionalized), and modulated the electrical conductivity of the nanocrystal ensemble.

Intending to introduce spatiotemporal control in the processability of polyurethane materials, in this work we investigate dynamic transcarbamoylation by the addition of a latent acidic catalyst into an aromatic and an aliphatic polyurethane network. We introduce three photoswitches based on merocyanine/spiropyran compounds which, upon exposure to visible light, undergo a reversible cyclization reaction, resulting in formation of strong acids. The use of such photoswitches prevents the presence of a permanent acidic species in the network, which would eventually lead to its degradation over time. Importantly, due to the reversible nature of the cyclization reaction, the release of the acidic catalyst is not permanent, as evidenced by stress relaxation measurements. Overall, the evidence of the light-induced, acid-catalyzed transcarbamoylation is supported by stress-relaxation, optical microscopy, and self-healing measurements.

Focused on Madder dye, a natural and historical pigment renowned for its diverse color properties, we tackle challenges that traditional experimentation struggled to address.

This study proposed a highly scalable quasi-degenerate second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (QD-NEVPT2) using the local pair-natural orbital (PNO) method. Our recent study showed an efficient implementation of the PNO-based state-specific (SS) NEVPT2 method using orthonormal localized virtual molecular orbitals (LVMOs) as an intermediate local basis. This study derived the state-coupling (or off-diagonal) terms to implement QD-NEVPT2 in an alternative manner to enhance efficiency based on the internally contracted basis (ICB) and PNO overlap matrices between different references. To facilitate further acceleration, a local resolution-of-the-identity (RI) three-index integral generation algorithm was developed using LMOs and LVMOs. Although the NEVPT2 theory is considered to be less susceptible to the intruder-state problem (ISP), this study revealed that it can easily suffer from ISP when calculating high-lying excited states. We ameliorated this instability using the imaginary level shift (LS) technique. The PNO-QD-NEVPT2 calculations were performed on small organic molecules for the 30 lowest-lying states, as well as photoisomerization involving the conical intersection of 1,1-dimethyldibenzo[b,f] silepin with a cis-stilbene skeleton. These calculations revealed that the PNO-QD-NEVPT2 method yielded negligible errors compared to the canonical QD-NEVPT2 results.

Traditionally, catalyst improvements are made through empirical trials, where the catalyst is functionalised by adding, removing or modifying groups within its structure and, subsequently, reevaluating the new catalytic activity. This procedure is not efficient and leads to unsuccessful trials that waste resources. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to accelerate homogeneous asymmetric catalyst optimization. However, these often lack a general descriptor generation procedure to allow encoding of molecules from a broad region of chemical space. To overcome this, we propose a homogeneous catalyst graph neural network (HCat-GNet) for the prediction of selectivity of catalysts given the SMILES of participant molecules. We demonstrate its use in rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric 1,4-addition (RhCAA), a reaction of major importance in organic synthesis. We benchmark HCat-GNet against traditional ML methods for its ability to predict RhCAA stereoselectivity from two chiral diene ligand two datasets; one for learning and one for final testing. For the learning dataset, both traditional ML and HCat-GNet methods give comparable results. However, when presented with the new unseen test dataset, traditional ML models perform poorly, while HCat-GNet retains a general ability to accurately predict product absolute stereochemistry and reaction stereoselectivity. Furthermore, HCat-GNet allows model interpretability, permitting analysis of the effect of ligand substituents in determining reaction selectivity. HCat-GNet shows greater potential for catalyst optimization than traditional ML, as it allows the use of a non-fixed number of participant molecules to train the model, only requiring the SMILES of the molecules to create graph representations. HCat-GNet allows more general models that accurately extrapolate into unseen regions of chemical space.

This method is based on the simplified time-dependent density functional theory (sTD-DFT) where all semi-empirical two-electron integrals are replaced by exact one- and two-center atomic orbital (AO) two-electron integrals while all  other approximations from sTD-DFT are kept.  The performance of this new parameter-free XsTD-DFT method was benchmarked to evaluate excited state and (non)linear response properties, including ultra-violet/visible absorption, first hyperpolarizability, and two-photon absorption.  For a set of 77 molecules, results from the XsTDA approach (or XsTD-DFT considering the Tamm-Dancoff approximation) were compared to corresponding TDA data.  XsTDA/B3LYP excitation energies only deviate absolutely by 0.14 eV in average from those obtained from standard TDA while drastically cutting computational costs by a factor of 20 or more depending on the single energy threshold chosen. The absolute deviations of excitation energies with respect to the full scheme are decreasing when the system size is increasing, showing the suitability of XsTDA/XsTD-DFT to treat large systems.  Comparing XsTDA and its predecessor sTDA, the new scheme globally improves excitation energies and oscillator strengths.  Particularly, the XsTDA scheme can faithfully reproduce TDA results for charge transfer states. Among the various results, TD-DFT first hyperpolarizability frequency dispersions for a set of push-pull $\\pi$-conjugated molecules are faithfully reproduced by XsTD-DFT while the sTD-DFT method always provides red-shifted resonance energy positions.  Excellent performance with respect to experiment is observed for the 2PA spectrum of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP).

First-principles band structure calculations are performed on the electrified (001) surfaces of Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, and Sb2Te3 using an implicit electrolyte model. Our results demonstrate the adiabatic evolution of the surface states upon surface charging.

To date, several reports have hinted at the influence of the surface Bi:V ratio on the solar water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanodes, but only a handful of strategies have been reported to afford to fine-tune such surface stoichiometry while a comprehensive understanding of an atomic level of the role of the surface termination remains elusive. Herein, we report a new methodology that modulates the surface Bi:V ratio and, in turn, maximizes the PEC performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We found that annealing in the presence of ammonium metavanadate drastically reduces the surface recombination while improving the charge separation. Detailed characterization revealed that this treatment filled the native surface vanadium vacancies, which are found to act as recombination centers, while inducing a significant increase in the density of oxygen vacancies, which reinforced the built-in electric field that drives the charge separation. Interestingly, coating with NiFeOx improves, especially, the charge separation in surface V-rich BiVO4. Results suggest that the V-rich surface termination altered the surface energetics of BiVO4 leading to an improved band alignment across the interface. Overall, these results provide a new platform to modulate the surface stoichiometry of BiVO4 thin films while shedding new light on the mechanisms whereby the surface termination governs the PEC response.", "date": "2024-02-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The exclusivity of these interactions to natural, organic, or molecular systems has limited the demonstration and understanding of helical motifs in densely packed solid-state lattices. Herein, we report that the ordering of Ga atoms in GaSeI, a representative crystal from an exfoliable class of atomically precise III-VI-VII 1D van der Waals (vdW) crystals, manifests the elusive Boerdijk-Coxeter (B-C) helix motif. B-C helicity is a rare non-repeating geometric pattern arising from the distinct face-sharing order of well-defined tetrahedra with adjacent vertices defined by an irrational rotational or twist angle, previously thought to only exist in macro- to molecular-scale structures but not at the atomic scale. Using InSeI and GaSeI as models, we show that the structural degree of freedom in a 1D vdW lattice generally allows for the systematic twisting of a tetrahelical lattice defined by a periodic 41 screw axis in InSeI to its infinitely extending B-C helix counterpart in GaSeI. Helical coordinate analysis of GaSeI reveals that the Ga atoms forming the [GaSe3I]\u221e repeating motif display B-C helicity whereas Se and I atoms order as concentric tetrahelices that form B-C helix variants with systematically expanded helical radii. This discovery of ideal B-C helicity in optically active vdW lattices exfoliable down to single helix chains presents a distinctive materials platform towards understanding aperiodic helicity and chirality in low-dimensional solids, enabling new opportunities in designing well-defined solid state materials for quantum transport and long-range chirality-driven phenomena.", "date": "2024-02-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The clinical translation of functionalize drug carriers for OA has been hindered, in part, by our incomplete comprehension of how these materials interact with and respond to the pathological environment. This study aims to address this gap by examining how cationic NPs interact with ECM components in an ex vivo OA cartilage explant model. By comparing the behavior of smaller (<10nm) and larger (~270 nm) cationic NPs and subjecting them to explants preconditioned with OA-specific catabolic enzymes, we observed multifaceted effects on ECM integrity and biomolecule conformation. All NP-biomolecule complexes induced differential cytokine production from stimulated macrophages.

This step, forming H2/MeH, makes the overall cycle exergonic while also generating more of the key cationic metal electrophile. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations revealed metal-specific dehydrocoupling pathways, with the divergent reactivity shown to be due to the different metal valency (which impacts the accessibility of amine-free cationic complexes) and steric environment.

The electron doped SrTiO3/electrolyte is the system under review because of its high photocurrent efficiency with an ultrafast light trigger and because it allowed for detection of intermediate forms across the electromagnetic spectrum. The first part covers how the efficient catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the Schottky diode, the depletion layer, and Helmholtz layer under operating conditions to the extent possible. The second part covers the detection of the surface bound intermediates by transient spectroscopy. These target ultrafast (ps-ns) electron transfer from (or hole-trapping to) bound surface water species that are associated with the reactive oxygen intermediates of OER (e.g. OH*, O*). Their detection via a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and coherent acoustic waves is then described. These target, respectively, the electronic states, the vibrational levels, and the lattice strain associated with the intermediates. The review is primarily concerned with how the measurements are made and the intermediates\u2019 experimental spectra. The theoretical descriptions are brought in as a needed to provide context to spectra that are difficult to interpret on their own.

We determined the effects of phosphorylation and glycosylation on the strength of the MYC:Bin1 interaction, and reveal an influence of MYC sequence length on binding. Our platform for the rapid synthesis of MYC sequences up to 84 AA with distinct PTM patterns thereby enables the systematic study of PTM function at a molecular level, and offers a convenient way for an expedited screening of constructs.", "date": "2024-02-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we present an algorithm designed to optimize molecular fingerprints. This algorithm combines the relevant bits of information, aiming to enrich the final fingerprint for predicting specific behavioral properties. To achieve this, relevant variables (i.e. bits) for prediction were collected from six non-hashed fingerprints and fused into a master fingerprint. We used fish toxicity as a proof of concept. The RFR model was developed based on the master fingerprint. It demonstrated comparable results to conventional descriptor-based models with R$^2$ $\\approx 0.9$ for the training set and R$^2$ $\\approx 0.6$ for the test set. The molecular fingerprints have the advantage of being consistent and interpretable. Consequently, we were able to confirm the relevance of variables to the toxicity prediction. The final model outperformed each of the models based on individual fingerprints in the number of chemicals with prediction error, that fell in the range of +/- one standard deviation of residuals.

Membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) is an effective platform for deionizing aqueous streams; however, conventional MCDI is unable to selectively remove targeted ions from a liquid mixture. In this work, we fabricated manganese oxide composite anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for MCDI to enhance phosphate removal selectivity from sodium chloride-sodium dihydrogen phosphate (10:1 molar ratio) aqueous mixtures. We systematically investigated several critical factors, such as constant current or voltage operation, applied voltage amount, process stream pH, and manganese oxide content in the AEM, on phosphate removal efficiency and phosphate selectivity. A trade-off was observed between phosphate removal and selectivity when increasing the cell voltage. Under the best conditions, an MCDI unit with a 20 wt% Mn2O3 composite AEM and a bipolar membrane facilitated high phosphate removal efficiency of \u2265 31.8 % and a phosphate over chloride selectivity of 1.1 while showing stability for at least 30 cycles. To help understand how manganese oxide particles boost AEM selectivity, static electronic structure calculations were performed, and they revelated that hydrogen phosphate absorption on Mn2O3 composite AEM was 314 kcal/mol more exothermic than that on pristine AEM while chloride adsorption on Mn2O3 composite AEM was 2.2 kcal/mol less exothermic than that on a pristine AEM.

Its application has been limited to closed chemical systems without considering external potentials from the surrounding environments. To address this limitation and incorporate the influence of external potentials, polarization effects, and long-range interactions between a chemical system and its environment, the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of an electrostatic operator have been used as extra input to the existing ML model to represent the electrostatic environments. However, high-order electrostatic interaction is often essential to account for external potentials from the environment. The existing models based only on the invariant features cannot capture significant distribution patterns of the external potentials. Here, we propose a novel ML model that includes high-order terms of the Taylor expansion of an electrostatic operator and uses an equivariant model, which can generate high-order tensors covariant with rotations as a base model. Thus, we can use the multipole-expansion equation to derive a useful representation by accounting for the polarization and intermolecular interaction.

Therefore, establishing a stable and effective method to obtain these nuclides is critical. To address this issue, a silica-supported copolymer loaded with bis (2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP) was prepared, characterized, and investigated for the separation of 228Ra and 224Ra from natural 232Th in the nitric acid media.

The adsorption isotherm was well described by the Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption amount towards thorium could reach 72.0 mg/g. Thermodynamic investigations suggested that the thorium adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous. On basis of batch experiments, the separation behaviors were further investigated in column modes, and the separation of 228Ra and 224Ra from thorium was finally demonstrated using 226Ra as the tracer nuclide. The chemical recovery rate to 226Ra reached 96.7%, and the decontamination factor to thorium exceeded 105.

An accompanying graph neural network package can be used for property prediction and allows users to readily use computed features for learning tasks. To test the efficacy of electron density-based data for machine learning, we benchmark several datasets including QM8, QM9, LIBE, Tox21, and a Green 2022 Reaction dataset. This wide dataset diversity underscores the flexibility of QTAIM descriptors and our package. In addition, we made our code high-throughput methods compatible with new versions of BondNet and Chemprop architectures to allow for both reaction and molecular property prediction out-of-the-box. To motivate the use of QTAIM features for varied prediction tasks we also perform extensive benchmarking of our new mod- els to existing benchmark models as well as to our own models without QTAIM features. We show that almost universally, QTAIM features improve model performance on our algorithms, ChemProp, and BondNet. We also determine that QTAIM can aid in generalizing model performance to out-of- domain (OOD) datasets and improve learning at smaller data regimes.

Low-coordinate mononuclear transition metal complexes stand out for their substantial anisotropy and higher blocking temperatures. However, understanding the intricate interplay between these parameters poses a significant challenge, often beyond traditional magneto-structural correlations.

Thus, DFT's ability to simulate the solid/water interaction needs to be benchmarked and ideal simulation setups need to be identified, in order to prevent systematic errors. Here, we developed a rigorous sampling protocol for benchmarking the adsorption/desorption strength of water on metallic surfaces against experimental temperature programmed desorption, single crystal adsorption calorimetry and thermal energy atom scattering. We screened DFT's quality on a series of transition metal surfaces, applying three of the most common exchange correlation approximations; PBE-D3, RPBE-D3 and BEEF-vdW.  We find that all three XC-functional reflect the pseudo-zeroth order desorption of water rooted in the combination of attractive adsorbate-adsorbate interactions at low coverages and their saturation at intermediate coverage. However, both RPBE-D3 and BEEF-vdW lead to more appropriate water binding strengths, while PBE-D3 clearly overbinds near-surface water. We are able to relate the variations in binding strength to specific variations in water-metal and water-water interactions, highlighting the structural consequences inherent in an uninformed choice of simulation parameters.

This scheme is completely independent of the in vacuo potential and requires only the positions of the atoms of the machine learning subsystem and the positions and partial charges of the molecular mechanics environment.

The configurational dependence of the electronic density and the inclusion of the induction energy introduced by the EMLE model leads to a systematic reduction in the average error of the free energy surface when compared to MM embedding.

In this configuration, the eigenmodulation of the plasmonic properties of the metal film under applied potential results in a background signal, which hampers the unambiguous interpretation of the sensor response due to redox reactions. Here, we present a new strategy to overcome this disadvantage by using a van der Waals heterostructure (vdW-HS) as the working electrode on a plasmonic gold film. The vdW-HS comprises of a graphene sheet on top of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheet transferred onto a gold film of a standard SPR sensor. We show that the background signal is completely suppressed using such an architecture enabling the unambiguous analysis of SPR sensor response due to electrochemical reactions. Moreover, parasitic electrocatalytic responses due to intercalated or embedded impurities in the gold film can be efficiently avoided using hBN as the interlayer. We further observe that the potential dependent plasmonic signals are not just a reproduction of the electrochemical current when probing diffusive redox active species in solution. Subtle differences between the current and the plasmonic signal can be traced back to the diffusive nature of the redox active species.

First, we set forth four desiderata that should be satisfied by any definition of the position-dependent free energy density, f(R), in a system comprising only a fluid and a rigid solute: its volume integral, plus the fixed internal energy of the solute, should be the system free energy; it deviates from its bulk value, f_bulk, near a solute but should asymptotically approach f_bulk with increasing distance from the solute; it should go to zero where the solvent density goes to zero; and it should be well-defined in the most general case of a fluid made up of flexible molecules with an arbitrary interaction potential. Second, we use statistical thermodynamics to formulate a definition of the free energy density that satisfies these desiderata. Third, we show how any free energy density satisfying the desiderata may be used to analyze molecular processes in solution. In particular, because the spatial integral of f(R) equals the free energy of the system, it can be used to compute free energy changes that result from the rearrangement of solutes, as well as the forces exerted on the solutes by the solvent. In particular, we discuss the thermodynamic analysis of water in protein binding sites to inform ligand design. Finally, we discuss related literature and address published concerns regarding the thermodynamic plausibility of a position-dependent free energy density. The theory presented here has applications in theoretical and computational chemistry and may be further generalizable beyond fluids, such as to solids and macromolecules.

In general, G-quadruplex DNA shows a wide range of protection of hydrogens extending from ~12% to ~21% deuterium incorporation.  Additionally, the DNA sequences selected to represent parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid G-quadruplex topologies exhibit slight differences in deuterium uptake levels which appear to loosely relate to overall conformer stability. Notably, the exchange level for one of the hybrid sequence sub topologies of G-quadruplex DNA (24 TTG) is significantly different (compared with the others studied here) despite the DNA sequences being highly comparable. For the quadruplex-forming sequences, correlation analysis suggests protection of base hydrogens involved in tetrad hydrogen bonding. For duplex DNA ~19% deuterium incorporation is observed while only ~16% is observed for triplex DNA.  This increased protection of hydrogens may be due to the added backbone scaffolding and Hoogsteen base pairing of the latter species.

However, other SBPs and SBP-ligand based affinity systems remain underexplored. The sulfoquinovose-binding protein SmoF, is a substrate-binding protein component of the ABC transporter cassette in Agrobacterium tumefaciens involved in importing SQ and its derivatives for SQ catabolism.

Here we report on a new approach where we use photoswitchable surfactants to enable drastic changes in both the bulk and interfacial properties. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) mixtures with three alkyl-arylazopyrazole butyl sulfonates (CnAAP) with -H, -butyl and -octyl tails are applied and E/Z photoisomerization of the surfactants is used to cause substantially different hydrophobic interactions between the surfactants and PDADMAC. This affects significantly the P/S binding and allows for tuning both the bulk and interfacial properties of PDADMAC/CnAAP mixtures through light irradiation. For that, we have fixed the surfactant concentrations at values where they exhibit pronounced surface tension changes upon E/Z photoisomerization with 365 nm UV light (Z) and 520 nm green (E) light and have varied the PDADMAC concentration. The electrophoretic mobility can be largely tuned by photoisomerisation of CnAAP surfactants and P/S aggregates, which can even exhibit a charge reversal from negative to positive values or vice versa. In addition, low colloidal stability at equimolar concentrations of PDADMAC with CnAAP surfactants in the E configuration lead to the formation of large aggregates in the bulk which can be redissolved by irradiation with UV light when the surfactant\u2018s alkyl chain is short enough (C0AAP). Vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) reveals changes at the interface similar to the bulk, where the charging state at air-water interfaces can be modified with light irradiation. Using SFG spectroscopy, we interrogated the O-H stretching modes of interfacial H2O and provide qualitative information on surface charging that is complemented by neutron reflectometry, from which we resolved the surface excess of PDADMAC and CnAAP at the air-water interface, independently.

Functional studies on these enzymes are greatly hampered by the lack of information on the polyphenols present in a specific organism, so the physiological substrate is unknown for most polyphenol oxidases.  Therefore, seven commercially available fungal and two plant species were examined in detail for the presence of polyphenols using an LC-HRMS-based suspect screening workflow. A total of 401 features were annotated, composed of 221 flavonoids and 180 non-flavonoids. As 64% of the flavonoids were conjugated with a glycone, (semi-)quantification was applied when a reference standard of the aglycone was available. Isomers of hesperetin-O-glucoside were ubiquitous in all investigated samples. The samples were then additionally investigated by a quantitative, targeted LC-MS/MS assay that covers 90 polyphenols from 13 distinct polyphenol classes.

The method uses a stepwise forward selection strategy, facilitated by the rapid Gram-Schmidt process, to prioritize blocks based on their effectiveness in minimizing prediction error, as indicated by the lowest prediction residuals. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we showcase the outcomes of three empirical near-infrared (NIR) datasets. Comparative analyses were performed against partial-least-squares (PLS) regressions on single-block pre-processed datasets and a methodology relying solely on PROSAC. The PROSAC-SO-PLS approach consistently outperformed these methods, yielding significantly lower prediction errors. This has been evidenced by a reduction in the root-mean-squared error of prediction (RMSEP) ranging from 5 to 25% across seven out of the eight response variables analyzed. The PROSAC-SO-PLS methodology offers a versatile and efficient technique for ensemble pre-processing in NIR data modeling. It enables the use of SO-PLS minimizing concerns about pre-processing sequence or block order and effectively manages a large number of data blocks. This innovation significantly streamlines the data pre-processing and model-building processes, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of chemometric models.

However, the mechanisms governing their charge-discharge cycles remain poorly understood and are even a matter of debate and controversy. No consensus exists on the charge carrier in mild aqueous electrolytes, especially those containing a multivalent metal cation such as Zn2+. In this study, we comprehensively investigate the electrochemical reactivity of two model quinones, chloranil and duroquinone, both when diluted in solution or incorporated into carbon-based composite electrodes. We demonstrate that a common nine-member square scheme proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism can fully describe and rationalize their electrochemical behavior in relation to pH and chemical composition of the aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, we emphasize the crucial role played by the pKas associated with the reduced states of quinones in determining the charge carrier involved in compensating negative charges reversibly injected in the active material. Finally, contrary to widely reported findings for Zn/organic batteries, we unequivocally establish that the predominant solid-state charge carriers in Zn2+-based mild aqueous electrolytes are not multivalent Zn2+ cations but rather protons supplied by the weakly acidic hexaaqua metal ions (i.e., [Zn(H2O)6]2+]).", "date": "2024-02-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

DNP performance can vary significantly depending on the types of polarizing agents employed, and the criteria for optimum DNP efficiency are not fully understood. Thus, a better understanding of the structure, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) linewidths, and relaxation properties would aid in designing more efficient DNP polarizing agents. However, EPR characterizations of the polarizing agents are typically performed in different environments (e.g., strength of magnetic field and microwave power) than typical DNP experiments. Here, we demonstrate a low-cost and home-built setup that enables in-situ EPR detection in a dual resonance DNP-NMR/EPR probe using an optical chopper. The chopper modulates the microwave irradiation, thereby modulating the longitudinal magnetization (Mz) of the electron spins. Our results of DNP and EPR spectra on TEMPOL using a solid-state microwave source at 6.7 T / 188 GHz and 4.2 K showed a good agreement. In principle, an optical chopper should be compatible with a wide range of microwave sources, including gyrotrons that output high-power microwaves. To verify this, we placed an optical chopper in between the waveguides of a 527 GHz gyrotron and successfully reproduced a DNP field profile similar to the case without a chopper.

The new version of FFParam has multiple new capabilities for FF parameter optimization and validation, with emphasis on the ability to use condensed phase target data in the optimization. FFParam-v2 allows optimization of Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters using potential energy scans of interactions between selected atoms in a molecule and noble gases viz.

A new bonded parameter optimization algorithm has been introduced to account for simultaneously optimizing multiple molecules sharing parameters. FFParam-v2 also supports comparison of normal modes and the percent contribution of internal coordinates towards each normal mode obtained from QM and molecular mechanics calculations. Such comparison capability is vital to validate the balance amongst various bonded parameters that contribute to the complex normal modes of molecules.

Extensive studies have established that the introduction of methylammonium chloride (MACl) significantly improves the bulk quality of FAPbI3 so commonly used; while heating the photoabsorber\u2019s precursor film, the incorporated MACl facilitates the crystalline growth of FAPbI3, simultaneously volatilizing and dissipating from the perovskite layer. However, not only the photoabsorber's bulk quality but also heterointerfaces between the photoabsorber and carrier transport materials importantly contribute to the PV performances. Paradoxically, the MACl effects on FAPbI3 heterointerfaces have been sparingly explored and consequently remained elusive. Herein, the effects of MACl on these heterointerfaces are unveiled by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved microwave conductivity. The MACl additive accelerates carrier injections from FAPbI3 to the carrier transport materials presumably owing to the occurrence of spontaneous modulation of the heterointerfaces. In particular, at the heterointerface between FAPbI3 and the titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer, an emissive interlayer that is chloride-containing and wide-bandgap (FAPbI3-xClx) is formed spontaneously, which most likely serves multiple advantages leading to the observed PV performance enhancement: hole blocking and facilitation of electron injection from FAPbI3 to TiO2 without additional hole trapping. Consequently, the present results provide novel insights into the widely employed MACl additive in FAPbI3 photoabsorbers and thereby propels the further advancement of PSCs. Furthermore, this study demonstrates effective investigation of carrier dynamics with regard to the heterointerface, which is challenging, using potent time-resolved spectroscopies, so will promote development in the material sciences.", "date": "2024-02-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our simulations reveal the equilibrium between two stable proton-localized structures with distinct Eigen-like and Zundel-like hydrogen-bond motifs.

One promising approach is the in-situ formation of catalysts which are inherently stable under the oxidizing, alkaline conditions often used in OER studies.

Recent literature studies demonstrated a possible pathway for a continuous flow synthesis of paracetamol from \u03b2-pinene. While this process is currently not of commercial interest, the available literature synthesis demonstrates the technical feasibility of such chemical conversion as well as several new chemical transformations. However, the environmental efficiency of the proposed flow synthesis was not determined.

For this purpose, scaled-up process models of continuous paracetamol manufacture were developed in Aspen Plus and a complete life cycle inventory was estimated. A GWP of 58 kg CO2-eq./kg product was predicted, and key impact contributing aspects of the designed process were identified through a hotspot analysis. A comparative feedstock analysis showed that \u03b2-pinene derived from Kraft pulping waste can be a cleaner feedstock than the benchmark feedstock benzene.

Using a combination of (electro)analytical techniques, encapsulated RuOx anodes are shown to effectively suppress Cl- transport to buried catalyst active sites while allowing for the desired OER to occur, leading to increases in OER faradaic efficiency at moderate overpotentials. Evidence for the ability of SiOx overlayers to block Cl- ions from reaching the active buried interface was obtained by monitoring the OH stretching mode of OH adsorbates using in situ Raman spectroscopy.  This study also reports trade-offs between the activity, selectivity, and stability of bare and encapsulated Ru and RuOx electrocatalysts, finding that the magnitude of these trade-offs strongly depends on the nature of both the catalyst and overlayer material.

Kurusu ; Nathalie Tufenkji", "abstract": "\nDue to growing concerns of plastic pollution release into water bodies, it is imperative to understand and assess the removal of nanoplastics and microplastics during wastewater treatment processes. Although earlier studies have shown high removal of plastic contaminants during coagulation, flocculation and settling, a limited number of experiments have examined the removal of nanoplastics in relevant water chemistries including higher pH values and in the presence of organics. In this study, the removal of nanoplastics and microfibers is assessed using conventional (alum) and alternative coagulants including aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) and cationic polyamines (pDADMAC) in a synthetic wastewater matrix for pH conditions between 7 and 8.6. Our results show that plastic removal is considerably reduced at higher pH values when alum is used as a coagulant. At the shorter settling time of 30 s, removal of pristine and aged nanoplastics declined from 64 \u00b1 3% and 76 \u00b1 3% respectively (pH 7) to less than 20% at pH values higher than 7.8.  Similarly, polyester microfiber removal was observed to decline from 97 \u00b1 1% at pH 7 to 85 \u00b1 3% at pH 8.6 for samples collected after 3 min of settling. Replacing alum with polynuclear aluminum coagulants resulted in greater plastic contaminant removal at pH values above 8 with a maximum observed microfiber removal of 95 \u00b1 1% (ACH; pH 8.6; 3 min settling time) and a maximum observed nanoplastic removal of 71 \u00b1 5% (ACH+pDADMAC; pH 8.2; 30 s settling time). Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) measurements revealed that ACH coagulant species results in a thicker deposition layer on negatively charged surfaces compared to alum. The addition of pDADMAC to ACH led to a more favorable interaction with a model negatively charged surface, indicated by a faster and more rigid deposition of the alternative coagulant.

Descriptor selection, fraught with uncertainty, compounds the issue while amassing requisite data remains a daunting task. The introduction of descriptors derived from quasi-transition-states (qTS) offers a promising avenue to alleviate this burden. However, the challenge of descriptor selection persists. Herein, a novel small-data-driven model based on universal descriptors (UD-qTS) is proposed. Key differentiating properties between diastereomeric qTSs, encompassing energies, frontier orbital energies, Cartesian forces and charges of core atoms, are proposed as UD. The model's efficacy is validated through its application to the asymmetric aldol reaction, utilizing 3 experimental variables and merely 9 UDs, and fewer than 150 training samples. Moreover, a novel method is presented using Cartesian forces to rectify discrepancies between qTS and true TS. This UD-qTS strategy circumvents tedious large-scale descriptor exploration and screening, offering an efficient choice for small-data-driven enantioselectivity prediction.", "date": "2024-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Even though the role of the SEI in battery function is well understood (e.g., it must be electronically insulating and ionically conductive, it must enable uniform Li+ flux to the electrode to prevent dendrite growth, it must accommodate the large volume changes of Li electrodeposition), the challenges associated with probing this delicate composite layer have hindered the development of Li metal batteries for practical applications. In this review, we detail how nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can help bridge this gap in characterization due to its unique ability to describe local structure in conjunction with ion dynamics while connecting these properties to electrochemical behavior. By leveraging NMR, we can gain molecular-level insight to aid in the design of Li surfaces that enable reactive anodes for next generation, high energy density batteries.", "date": "2024-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We calculated the ASFE for most compounds from the FreeSolv database using the Open Force Field (OpenFF) and compared them to earlier results obtained with the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF).  By applying a nonequilibrium (NEQ) switching approach between the molecular mechanics (MM) description (either OpenFF or CGenFF) and the neural net potential (NNP)/MM level of theory (using ANI-2x as the NNP potential), we attempted to improve the accuracy of the calculated ASFEs. The predictive performance of the results did not change when applying this approach to all 589 small molecules in the FreeSolv database that ANI-2x can describe.  When selecting a subset of 156 molecules, focusing on compounds where the force fields performed poorly, we saw a slight improvement in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).  The majority of our calculations utilized unidirectional NEQ protocols based on Jarzynski's equation. Additionally, we conducted bidirectional NEQ switching for the subset of 156 solutes. Notably, only a small fraction (10 out of 156) exhibited statistically significant discrepancies between unidirectional and bidirectional NEQ switching free energy estimates.", "date": "2024-03-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

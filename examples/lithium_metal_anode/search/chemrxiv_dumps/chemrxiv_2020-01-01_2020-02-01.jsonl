H. Zhang", "abstract": "<p>Threofuranosyl nucleic\nacid (TNA) is an analogue of DNA. Its inter-nucleotide linkages are shifted\nfrom the wild-type 5'-to-3' one to the 3'-to-2' one. As a result, the number of\ncovalent bonds between consecutive phosphates is reduced from 6 to 5. This\nleads to higher chemical stability, less reactive groups, and lower\nconformational flexibility. Experimental observations indicate that the\ninteraction network is perturbed at the minimal level and the thermodynamic\nstability of the duplex is unaltered upon the TNA mutation. Whether\ncomputational modelling could reproduce this result will be studied in the base\nflipping of the middle T (DNA) residue or its T-to-TFT mutation (TNA). We\napplied the equilibrium free energy simulation and the nonequilibrium\nstratification method proposed previously in the base flipping case, proving\nthe applicability of alternative free energy simulation protocols. As the force\nfield is the main accuracy-limiting factor when converged phase space sampling\nis obtained, we benchmarked three popular AMBER force fields for nucleotides.\nThe last-generation force fields include bsc1 and OL15, both of which perform\nsimilarly in reproducing the structures near the crystal conformation in\nprevious benchmark studies. Our results indicate that all these three force\nfields provide similar descriptions of the base-paired state. However, with\nfree energy simulation constructing the free energy profiles along the\nconformational change pathway, high-energy regions are explored and these three\nforce fields behave differently. The bsc1 force field is found to perform best\nin reproducing the similarity of stabilities of DNA and TNA duplexes. The free\nenergy barrier of base flipping under the OL15 force field is lowered modestly\nin TNA, and thus this force field is also usable. However, the bsc0 force field\nprovides wrong results. The TNA duplex is significantly less stable than the DNA\nduplex. Therefore, the bsc0 force field is not recommended in any application\nin modern nucleotide simulations. The salt concentration in nucleotide\nsimulations is another factor influencing the thermodynamics of the system.\nPrevious reports conclude that the net-neutral and excess-salt simulations\nprovide similar results. However, the simulation method limits the phase space\nregion explored in previous computational modelling. Our free energy simulation\nexplores high-energy regions, where the excess salt does affect the\nthermodynamic stability. The free energy barrier along the base flipping pathway\nis generally elevated upon the addition of excess salts, but the relative\nheight of the free energy barriers in DNA and TNA duplexes is not significantly\nchanged. This phenomenon emphasizes the importance of adding sufficient salts\nto reproduce the experimental condition. </p>", "date": "2020-01-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Lectin glycan preferences are usually centered on specific monosaccharides. In contrast, human intelectin-1 (hItln-1, also known as Omentin-1) is a soluble lectin that binds a range of microbial sugars, including \u03b2-Dgalactofuranose (\u03b2-Galf), D-glycerol 1-phosphate, D-glycero-D-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KO), and 3- deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO).

Finally, our finding that hItln-1 avoids binding prevalent glycans with a terminal 1,2 diol (e.g., NeuAc, and L-glycero-\u03b1-D-manno-heptose) suggests the lectin has evolved to recognize distinct bacterial species.", "date": "2020-01-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we have considered the interactions of aspartate (Asp) derivatives, as models of complex biomolecules, with calcite. Using kinetic growth experiments, we have investigated the inhibition of calcite growth by Asp, Asp2 and Asp3.This entailed the determination of a step-pinning growth regime as well as the evaluation of the adsorption constants and binding free energies for the three species to calcite crystals. These latter values are compared to free energy profiles obtained from fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. When using a flat (104) calcite surface in the models, the measured trend of binding energies is poorly reproduced. However, a more realistic model comprised of a surface with an island containing edges and corners, yields binding energies that compare very well with experiments. Surprisingly, we find that most binding modes involve the positively charged, ammonium group. Moreover, while attachment of the negatively charged carboxylate groups is also frequently observed, it is always balanced by the aqueous solvation of an equal or greater number of carboxylates. These effects are observed on all calcite features including edges and corners, the latter being associated with dominant affinities to Asp derivatives. As these features are also precisely the active sites for crystal growth, the experimental and theoretical results point strongly to a growth inhibition mechanism whereby these sites become blocked, preventing further attachment of dissolved ions and halting further growth.", "date": "2020-01-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biocompatible Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, any real application of photo-switchable molecules requires that spin crossover be paired with additional functionality such as long-range magnetic order. Important advances combining these functions are notably reported for a number of bimetallic Prussian Blue analogues; however, to date PBA-based magnetic photo-switches can only operate be-low 150 K due to loss of magnetic order. In contrast, cobalt ferrite is a ferrimagnetic semiconductor with a Curie temperature of 790 K and extremely favorable magnetic properties by comparison to state-of-the-art PBAs. The mixed valence electronic structure of cobalt ferrite is reminiscent of cobalt-iron PBA, which is a well-known photo-switch. To investigate the potential for photo-switching in this material, we employ transient XUV spectroscopy to probe charge and spin dynamics with element-speci\ffic resolution on the femtosecond time scale. Results show that 400 nm light excites a metal-to-metal charge transfer transition, which drives the crossover of high-spin Co2+ to low-spin Co3+ with a time constant of 405 \u00b1 29 fs and an internal quantum efficiency of unity.

It can also fragment to butenes and formaldehyde through a competing retro-Prins condensation pathway. Using detailed kinetic measurements of 2-MTHF dehydra-decyclization on zeolites with disparate acidities (boro- and alumino-silicates) and micropore environments (MFI, MWW, and BEA), weakly acidic borosilicates were shown to exhibit ca. 10-30% higher selectivity to dienes at about five-to-sixty times lower proton-normalized rates than aluminosilicates (453-573 K). Dehydra-decyclization site time yields (STYs) were invariant for aluminosilicates within the investigated frameworks, indicating the absence of pore-confinement influence. However, individual site-normalized reaction rates varied by almost an order of magnitude on borosilicates in the order MWW > MFI > BEA at a given temperature (523 K), indicating the different nature of active sites in these weak solid acids. The diene distribution remained far from equilibrium and was tuned towards the desirable conjugated diene (1,3-pentadiene) by facile isomerization of 1,4-pentadiene. This tuning capability was facilitated by high bed residence times, as well as the smaller micropore sizes among the considered zeolite frameworks. The suppression of competing pathways and promotion of 1,4-pentadiene isomerization events lead to a hitherto unreported \u223c86% 1,3-pentadiene yield and an overall \u223c 89% combined linear C5 dienes\u2019 yield at near quantitative (~98%) 2-MTHF conversion on the borosilicate B-MWW, without a significant reduction in diene selectivities for at least 80 hours time-on-stream under low space velocity (0.85 g reactant/g cat./h) and high temperature (658 K) conditions. Finally, starting with iso-conversion levels (ca. 21-26%) and using total turnover numbers (TONs) accrued over the entire catalyst lifetime as the stability criterion, borosilicates were demonstrated to be significantly more stable than aluminosilicates under reaction conditions (~3-6x higher TONs).", "date": "2020-01-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The interactions of X\u2212NH2 and X\u2212OH with X = Li, BeH,\nBH2, Na, MgH, and AlH2 also produce either linear or fully planar geometries. All of\nthese factors imply that the lone pair on the N or O atoms are datively bonding with\nthe empty <i>p</i> orbitals in the other atoms. This leads to a reduction in hybridization. The\nnon-periodic strengths of these bonds have implications for the detection of molecules in\nspace as well as in models for the formation of refractory molecules and condensation of\nmineral species in early stages of planet formation.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>", "date": "2020-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Geochemistry; Bonding; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The CO2 consumption at gas-diffusion electrodes due to electrochemical reduction and reaction with OH- at the electrode-electrolyte interface leads to a substantial reduction in the volumetric flowrate of gas flow out of the electrolyzer, especially when highly alkaline electrolytes and elevated current densities are utilized, mainly owing to elevated pH at cathode/electrolyte interface. Without considering the CO2 consumption, the Faradaic efficiencies for major gas products could be significantly overestimated during high current density CO2 reduction conditions, particularly in the case of high pH electrolyte. In addition, a detailed carbon balance path is elucidated via a two-step procedure of CO2 reaction with OH- at cathode/electrolyte interface and subsequent CO2 generation at anode/electrolyte interface caused by a relatively low pH in the vicinity of the anode. Based on the proposed two-step carbon balance path, a systemic exploration of gases released in anolyte reveals the transformation of a HCO3- or OH- catholyte to a CO32- catholyte, which was further confirmed by pH measurement.", "date": "2020-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrocatalysis; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We show that this high-throughput, <i>in situ</i> approach has broad applicability by controlling the number of atomic layers on the fly, rapidly optimising green solvent design for maximum yield, and viewing live production rates. Combining insights on the hydrodynamics of exfoliation with this scalable monitoring technique, targeted process intensi\ffication, quality control, batch traceability and individually customisable materials on-demand are possible.</div>", "date": "2020-01-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Carbon-based Materials; Materials Processing; Multilayers; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Fluid Mechanics; Process Control; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

A prior theory of gravity by fractional, reversible fissing of matter and fusing of space to target is presented for explaining this mystery of gravitational killing of cancer cells. With this new theory a new math of divergent differentiations and divergent integrations are outlined to explain mysteries. By the mechanism given the variation in source gravity as computed by the new math can thereby explain effects on biology as the biology and chemistry have divergent differentiations and divergent integrations, which couple source of gravities and couple changing gravities to surrounding spaces and targets in surrounding spaces. Greater effects of</div><div>gravities in nano-scales than molecular scales are reasoned as nano-sizes have mass effects and greater collectivity relative to molecular scales. The mechanism also postulates superluminosity of rare with slowing to luminous with denseness (space reversal) for explaining inertia, denseness and back and forth time reversal. The loss of inertia due to space reversal is reasoned! Mass to energy and vice versa dynamics are involved relativistically. By such new mechanics there are differences in denseness as the superlumes fiss to rare so surrounding rare can couple and the superluminous rare concentrates to slow so as to couple to dense. There are limits of such superluminosity as by the vast distances and the vast, composite, dense spaces of matter and the slowness (inertia). These new mechanics of composite matter/space manifest group dispersion (by new divergent calculus) as provided by hidden mechanics as by self-interacting self-deforming conformations to explain observable phase dispersed (older calculus). The observables are manifested by phase dispersions of matter and space as by new divergent calculus via constructive self interactions.

Herein we report a new SMILES-based molecular generative architecture that generates molecules from scaffolds and can be trained from any arbitrary molecular set. This is possible thanks to a new molecular set pre-processing algorithm that exhaustively cuts all combinations of acyclic bonds of every molecule, obtaining a large number of scaffold-decorations combinations. Moreover, it serves as a data augmentation technique and can be readily coupled with randomized SMILES to obtain even better results with small sets. Two examples showcasing the potential of the architecture in medicinal and synthetic chemistry are described: First, models were trained with a training set obtained from a small set of Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) active modulators and were able to meaningfully decorate a wide range of scaffolds and obtain molecular series predicted active on DRD2. Second, a larger set of drug-like molecules from ChEMBL was selectively sliced using synthetic chemistry constraints (RECAP rules). Moreover, the resulting scaffold-decorations were filtered to only allow decorations that were fragment-like. This allowed models trained with this dataset to selectively decorate diverse scaffolds with fragments that were generally predicted to be synthesizable and attachable to the scaffold using known synthetic approaches. In both cases, the models were already able to decorate molecules using specific knowledge without the need to add it with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning.

Recent advances in machine learning, driven by deep learning models and data availability, have shown utility throughout synthetic organic chemistry as a data-driven method for reaction prediction. Here we present a machine-intelligence approach to predict the products of an organic reaction by integrating deep neural networks with a probabilistic and symbolic inference that flexibly enforces chemical constraints and accounts for prior chemical knowledge. We first train a graph convolutional neural network to estimate the likelihood of changes in covalent bonds, hydrogen counts, and formal charges. These estimated likelihoods govern a probability distribution over potential products. Integer Linear Programming is then used to infer the most probable products from the probability distribution subject to heuristic rules such as the octet rule and chemical constraints that reflect a user's prior knowledge. Our approach outperforms previous graph-based neural networks by predicting products with more than 90% accuracy, demonstrates intuitive chemical reasoning through a learned attention mechanism, and provides generalizability across various reaction types. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential for even higher model accuracy when complemented by expert chemists contributing to the system, boosting both machine and expert performance.

Using solution X-ray scattering and cryo-TEM, we showed that with progressive increase of spermine concentration, tubulin-dimers assembled into a tubulin helical-pitch (or a short TCS), TCSs, TCS that stacked into tubes through base-to-top packing, antiparallel bundles of TCS tubes in a quasi-hexagonal symmetry, and eventually twisted hexagonal bundles of inverted tubulin tubules. Time-resolved experiments revealed that tubulin assemblies formed at low spermine concentrations were precursors of the assemblies formed at higher spermine concentrations. The results provide insight into the variety of morphologies that tubulin can form, and contribute to our understanding of the fundamental interactions that control the composition and construction of protein-based biomaterials.</p>", "date": "2020-01-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Biophysical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics; Self-Assembly; Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

With the rapid progress of deep-learning techniques and the accumulation of three-dimensional protein structures, using deep neural networks to learn the relationship between protein sequences and structures and then automatically design a protein sequence for a given protein backbone structure is becoming increasingly feasible. In this study, we developed a deep neural network named DenseCPD that considers the three-dimensional density distribution of protein backbone atoms and predicts the probability of 20 natural amino acids for each residue in a protein. The accuracy of DenseCPD was 51.56\u00b10.20% in a 5-fold cross validation on the training set and 54.45% and 50.06% on two independent test sets, which is more than 10% higher than those of previous state-of-the-art methods. Two approaches for using DenseCPD predictions in computational protein design were analyzed. The approach using the cutoff of accumulative probability had a smaller sequence search space compared to that of the approach that simply uses the top-k predictions and therefore enables higher sequence identity in redesigning three proteins with Rosetta.

Here, an in-depth quantitative spectroelectrochemical analysis of MnO2 thin-films provides a set of important new mechanistic insights. A major finding is that charge storage occurs through the reversible two electron faradaic conversion of MnO2 into water-soluble Mn2+ in the presence of a wide range of weak Br\u00f8nsted acids, including the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ or [Mn(H2O)6]2+ complexes commonly present in aqueous Zn/MnO2 batteries.

A perspective, which goes beyond ECM emulation, is the design of a host-material with features, which are not accessible in the biological portfolio. Such a feature would, for instance be, the creation of a structural or chemical gradient, and to explore how this special property influences the biological processes. First, we wanted to test if macroporous organosilica materials with appropriate surface modification can act as a host for the implementation of human cells like HeLa or LUHMES. It was possible to use a commercially available polymeric foam as a scaffold and coat it with a layer of a thiophenol-containing organosilica layer, followed by biofunctionalization with biotin using click chemistry and the subsequent coupling of streptavidin - fibronectin to it. More importantly, deformation of the scaffold allowed the generation of a permanent structural gradient. In this work, we show that the structural gradient has a tremendous influence on the capability of the described material for the accommodation of living cells. The introduction of a bi-directional gradient enabled the establishment of a cellular community comprising different cell types in spatially distinct regions of the material. An interesting perspective is to study communication between cell types or to create cellular communities, which can never exist in a natural enviornment.</p></div></div></div></div>", "date": "2020-01-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biocompatible Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Many subcellular condensed bodies are hierarchically organized into multiple coexisting domains or layers.

Here, we show that the formation of hierarchically organized multiphase droplets with up to three coexisting layers is a generic phenomenon in mixtures of complex coacervates, which serve as models of charge-driven liquid-liquid phase separated systems. We present simple theoretical guidelines to explain both the hierarchical arrangement and the demixing transition in multiphase droplets using the interfacial tensions and critical salt concentration as inputs. Multiple coacervates can coexist if they differ sufficiently in macromolecular density, and we show that the associated differences in critical salt concentration can be used to predict multiphase droplet formation. We also show that the coexisting coacervates present distinct chemical environments that can concentrate guest molecules to different extents.

The model represents the electrolyte ions as a scalar field and the solvent as a polarisable dielectric continuum, both surrounding the quantum solute. The overall energy expression is a grand canonical functional incorporating the electron kinetic and exchange correlation energies, the total electrostatic energy, entropy and chemical potentials of surrounding electrolyte, osmotic pressure, and the effects of cavitation, dispersion and repulsion. The DFT calculation is performed fully self-consistently in the electrolyte model, allowing the quantum mechanical system and the surrounding continuum environment to interact and mutually polarize. A bespoke parallel Poisson-Boltzmann solver library, DL_MG, deals with the electrostatic problem, solving a generalized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Our model supports open boundary conditions, which allows the treatment of molecules, entire biomolecules or larger nanoparticle assemblies in electrolyte. We have also implemented the model for periodic boundary conditions, allowing the treatment of extended systems such as electrode surfaces in contact with electrolyte. A key feature of the model is the use of solute-size and solvation-shell-aware accessibility functions that prevent the unphysical accumulation of electrolyte charge near the quantum solute boundary.

Grad; Isabell Tunn; Dion Voerman; Alberto S. de L\u00e9on; Roel Hammink; Kerstin Blank", "abstract": "Biological materials combine stress relaxation and self-healing with non-linear stress-strain responses. These characteristic features are a direct result of hierarchical self-assembly, which often results in fiber-like architectures. Even though structural knowledge is rapidly increasing, it has remained a challenge to establish relationships between microscopic and macroscopic structure and function. Here, we focus on understanding how network topology determines the viscoelastic properties, i.e. stress relaxation, of biomimetic hydrogels. We have dynamically crosslinked two different synthetic polymers with one and the same crosslink. The first polymer, a polyisocyanopeptide (PIC), self-assembles into semi-flexible, fiber-like bundles and thus displays stress-stiffening, similar to many biopolymer networks. The second polymer, 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG), serves as a reference network with well-characterized structural and viscoelastic properties. Using one and the same coiled coil crosslink allows us to decouple the effects of crosslink kinetics and network topology on the stress relaxation behavior of the resulting hydrogel networks. We show that the fiber-containing PIC network displays a relaxation time approximately two orders of magnitude slower than the starPEG network. This reveals that crosslink kinetics is not the only determinant for stress relaxation. Instead, we propose that the different network topologies determine the ability of elastically active network chains to relax stress. In the starPEG network, each elastically active chain contains exactly one crosslink. In the absence of entanglements, crosslink dissociation thus relaxes the entire chain. In contrast, each polymer is crosslinked to the fiber bundle in multiple positions in the PIC hydrogel. The dissociation of a single crosslink is thus not sufficient for chain relaxation. This suggests that tuning the number of crosslinks per elastically active chain in combination with crosslink kinetics is a powerful design principle for tuning stress relaxation in polymeric materials. The presence of a higher number of crosslinks per elastically active chain thus yields materials with a slow macroscopic relaxation time but fast dynamics at the microscopic level. Using this principle for the design of synthetic cell culture matrices will yield materials with excellent long-term stability combined with the ability to locally reorganize, thus facilitating cell motility, spreading and growth.", "date": "2020-01-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hydrogels", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These sensors, rendered highly lipophilic to anchor the conjugated pi-wire molecular framework in the membrane, offer several favorable functional parameters including fast response kinetics and high sensitivity to membrane potential changes. The impact of VSDs has, however, been limited due to the lack of cell-specific targeting methods in brain tissue or living animals. We address this key challenge by introducing a non-genetic molecular platform for cell- and molecule-specific targeting of synthetic voltage sensitive dyes in the brain. We employ a dextran polymer particle to overcome the inherent lipophilicity of voltage sensitive dyes by dynamic encapsulation, and high-affinity ligands to target the construct to specific neuronal cells utilizing only native components of the neurotransmission machinery at physiological expression levels. Dichloropane, a monoamine transporter ligand, enables targeting of dense dopaminergic axons in the mouse striatum and sparse noradrenergic axons in the mouse cortex in acute brain slices. PFQX in conjunction with ligand-directed acyl imidazole chemistry enables covalent labeling of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the same brain regions. Probe variants bearing either a classical electrochromic ANEP dye or state-of-the-art VoltageFluor-type dye respond to membrane potential changes in a similar manner to the parent dyes, as shown by whole-cell patch recording. We demonstrate the feasibility of optical voltage recording with our probes in brain tissue with one-photon and two-photon fluorescence microscopy and define the signal limits of optical voltage imaging with synthetic sensors under a low photon budget determined by the native expression levels of the target proteins. We envision that modularity of our platform will enable its application to a variety of molecular targets and sensors, as well as lipophilic drugs and signaling modulators.

The purpose of this Perspective is to explore how our qualitative understanding of electronic excitation processes can be promoted beyond the molecular orbital picture by exploiting methods and insights from modern quantum chemistry. For this purpose, the physics of a correlated electron-hole pair is analysed in detail to show the origin of exchange repulsion and a dynamic Coulomb attraction, which determine its energy aside from the orbital energies.

Subjecting this scaffold to a palladium-catalyzed Heck reaction effects a regioselective and stereoselective arylation of the cyclohexadiene ring. The arylation proceeds with a highly selective 1,3-chirality transfer of stereogenic information installed in the microbial arene oxidation. Quantum chemical calculations have provided insight<br />into the mechanism of the palladium catalyzed arylation. The high selectivity can be explained both by a kinetic preference for the observed arylation position and, interestingly, by reversible carbopalladation in competing positions. Functional groups that were well tolerated on the diene substrate included a range of esters, amides and a Weinreb amide, affording a total of 23 different products<br />in good yields. These products, which can be considered as latent enolic nucleophiles, also possess a unique three dimensional structure which can be utilized in further stereoselective transformations. This was demonstrated by subjecting one of the products, which contained a protected aldehyde, to a tandem deprotection \u2013 cyclization sequence. The reaction proceeded with complete stereoselectivity<br />and afforded a tricyclic ketone product possessing four stereogenic centers.

The NCI method [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 132 , 6498 (2010)] enables to identify attractive and repulsive noncovalent interactions from promolecular densities in a fast manner. However, the approach remained up to now visual/qualitative, the relationship with energetics was conspicuously missing. We present a new version of NCIPLOT which allows quantifying the properties of the NonCovalent Interaction (NCI) regions in a fast manner. In order to do so, the definition of NCI volumes is introduced, which allows quantification of intra and intermolecular NCI properties in big systems where wavefunctions are not available. The connection between these integrals and energetics is reviewed for benchmark systems (S66\u00028), showing that our simple approach can lead to GGAquality energies while scaling with the number of atoms involved in the interaction (not the total number of atoms). The new implementation also includes an adaptive grid which allows the computation in a fast, parallelizable and efficient computational environment. The relationship with energetics derived from force fields is highlighted<br />and the faster algorithm exploited to analyze the evolution of interactions along MD trajectories. Through machine learning algorithms we characterize the relevance of NCI integrals in understanding the energetics of big systems, which is then applied in revealing the energetic changes along conformational changes, as well as identifying the atoms involved. This simple approach enables to identify the driving forces in biomolecular structural changes both at the spatial and energetic levels, while going beyond a mere parametrized-distances analysis.<br />", "date": "2020-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In as-synthesized Silicalite-1, the fluoride anions occupy well-defined positions in the 4<sup>1</sup><b>\u00b7</b>5<sup>2</sup><b>\u00b7</b>6<sup>2</sup> cages, where they are covalently bonded to framework Si atoms. Previous experimental studies showed that the fluoride anions are dynamically disordered at room temperature. The dynamic disorder can be suppressed by cooling to cryogenic temperatures and also through a variation of the OSDA, pointing to an interplay between framework and extra-framework dynamics. In the present work, ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) were employed to study the influence of the OSDA on the fluoride dynamics, comparing a total of eight alkylammonium OSDAs having either four alkyl chains of equal length (symmetric) or one short and three longer chains (asymmetric). In addition to time-averaged quantities, such as atomic root mean square displacements, the number of dynamic events in which fluoride ions \"jump\" from one Si atom to a neighboring one was analyzed. While the timescale accessible to the AIMD simulations was found to be too short to observe significant fluoride dynamic disorder at room temperature, it was clearly detectable when increasing the temperature to 373 K. For systems incorporating symmetric OSDAs, increasing OSDA size correlates with decreasing freedom of motion of the framework atoms. In line with previous experimental findings, a drastic reduction of the fluoride dynamic disorder was observed for systems containing tributylammonium-based OSDAs having one short (methyl or ethyl) chain. Besides reproducing the experimental observations, the computational approach also helped to explain this suppression of the dynamic disorder on the basis of the size and shape of the OSDA.", "date": "2020-01-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Solid State Chemistry; Theory - Inorganic; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It is shown how growth sequences involving C<sub>2</sub> dimers, that take place in carbon vapor, combustion systems, and the ISM, could give rise to a variety of bare carbon clusters. Among the bare carbon clusters thus formed, some could lead to fullerenes, while others, after hydrogenation, could lead to PAHs. We propose that the formation of hexagonal rings present in these bare carbon clusters are the result of [2+2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions that involve C<sub>2</sub> dimers. In the C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub> fullerenes, each of the twelve pentagons is surrounded by five hexagons and thereby \u201cisolated\u201d from each other. To explain why, we suggest that in bowl-shaped clusters the pentagons can form as the consequence of closures of \u201ccove regions\u201d that exist between hexagonal rings, and that they can also form during cage-closure, which results in the creation of six \u201cisolated\u201d pentagonal rings, and five hexagonal rings. The proposed growth mechanisms can account for the formation of fullerene isomers without the need to invoke the widely used Stone-Wales rearrangement. Considering processes that take place in combustion systems, it is proposed that soot particle inception can result from oligomerization of the bare carbon clusters that originated from cycloadditions involving C<sub>2</sub> dimers.

This complementarity o\ufb00ers unique opportunities, provided that the two methods are compared at a suitable level. Recently, several groups have used MD simulations to compute the spectral density of backbone and side-chain molecular motions, and to predict NMR relaxation rates from these. Unfortunately, in the case of methyl groups in protein side-chains, inaccurate energy barriers to methyl rotation were responsible for a systematic discrepancy in the computed relaxation rates, as demonstrated for the AMBER \ufb0099SB*-ILDN force \ufb01eld (and related parameter sets), impairing quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments. However, correspondence could be regained by emending the MD force \ufb01eld with accurate coupled cluster quantum chemical calculations. Spurred by this positive result, we tested whether this approach could be generally applicable, in spite of the fact that di\ufb00erent MD force \ufb01elds employ di\ufb00erent water models. Improved methyl group rotation barriers for the CHARMM36 and AMBER \ufb0015ipq protein force \ufb01elds were derived, such that the NMR relaxation data obtained from the MD simulations now also display very good agreement with experiment. Results herein showcase the performance of present-day MD force \ufb01elds, and manifest their re\ufb01ned ability to accurately describe internal protein dynamics.", "date": "2020-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

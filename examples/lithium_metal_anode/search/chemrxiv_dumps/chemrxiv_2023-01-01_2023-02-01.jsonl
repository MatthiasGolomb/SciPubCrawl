In general, the mechanism of formation of low-molecular-weight gels involves the gelation of solvents such as ethanol and water in the presence of low-molecular-weight gelators, which have larger molecular weights than the solvents. The gelator creates a supramolecular network via noncovalent bonds, and this network holds the solvent molecules, causing them to lose fluidity and thereby promoting gelation. That is, low-molecular-weight gels do not self-assemble and gelate solvent molecules themselves; the literature contains no reports of the self-assembly and gelation of extremely small solvent molecules such as ethanol and water. However, in this work, we found that ethanol molecules themselves form a large gel structure by self-assembling with few-nanometer-diameter oxide nanoparticles and water molecules. Our finding reveals an intriguing phenomenon where ethanol molecules support the main structure of a large gel structure through supramolecular assembly via hydrogen bonding. The key factor for the gelation of ethanol observed in this study is the presence of BaZrO3 nanoparticles, which are positively charged and homogeneously dispersed. When these nanoparticles and water were present, we observed the gelation of a substantial amount of ethanol, which would not normally occur. Our results overturn the common belief that extremely small molecules such as ethanol cannot function as a main bearer of gelatinization, and our discovery opens a path to the development of a novel self-assembly system that has not been previously reported. In addition, because the method proposed in the present work can potentially be used to prepare gels that incorporate other extremely small molecules having hydrogen bonds, we expect our findings to lead to the development of various novel materials with unique functions.", "date": "2023-01-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Overcoming the Coulomb barrier is the central goal of nuclear fusion, and an effective model of the barrier can only accelerate the achievement of this potential source of clean and abundant energy. A recently introduced magnetic \u201cCoulomb\u201d barrier model provides a visual and tactile representation of the fusion potential curve, including the counterintuitive combination of far-range repulsion and close-range attraction (https://youtu.be/FzEHs47nylA). The model contains a pair of opposing circular magnet arrays, each array comprising a series of double north-oriented magnets alternating in regular sequence with single south-oriented magnets.  This configuration generates complex magnetic fields between the arrays, with the result that the net force between them (attractive or repulsive) depends on the degree of separation.  The close-range dynamic simulates the behavior of the strong nuclear force within the Coulomb barrier, and the plot of magnetic force versus distance reproduces the familiar fusion potential curve. Given Maxwell\u2019s unification of electricity and magnetism within the electromagnetic fundamental force, the question arises as to whether alternating and unequal electric fields might also demonstrate a potential barrier. In this exercise, the circular alternating and unequal magnet sequences of each magnet array are replaced by theoretical alternating +1 and -2 coulomb electrostatic charges to produce a pair of opposing electrostatic arrays. The centimeter scale and essential geometry are preserved. Coulomb\u2019s law is then used to calculate component forces at incremental distances between the arrays. The theoretical electrostatic analog of the magnetic \"Coulomb\" barrier apparatus generates a force/distance curve that is nearly identical to the magnetic barrier curve but differing only in magnitude. Combinations of opposite and unequal charges also have the capacity to emulate or model quark \u201cconfinement.\u201d  Like the Coulomb barrier, confinement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. Nothing like it exists in the classical domain. And like the Coulomb barrier, confinement forces may be modeled with an appropriately configured sequence of alternating and unequal charges, as shown in Figure 3(a). \nHere, the six alternating +1 and -2 coulomb charges are assumed to occupy fixed positions 1 cm apart. A displacement force is applied to an internal -2 charge in a direction orthogonal to the linear sequence.  The orthogonal force component between the internal -2 charge and each of the other charges in the sequence is then determined using Coulomb's law.  The sum of these forces is plotted versus the distance between the displaced charge and its original in-line position (see Figure 3(b)). The plot is undeniably electrostatic and yet bears no resemblance to the inverse square plot normally associated with the force between a pair of charged particles.  In fact, this electrostatic force/distance curve more closely resembles published quark \u201cconfinement\" force behavior.

This has primarily been achieved via experiments in the enantiomeric resolution of asymmetric acids and bases followed by polarimetric analysis, NMR analysis using chiral shift reagents, and NMR, GC, and HPLC analysis of diastereomeric derivatives of the chiral molecules. Despite the increasing prevalence of the utility of GCs and LCs fitted with chiral columns in academia and the chemical industry, they have seen limited involvement in undergraduate training. To achieve the stereochemical laboratory requirements without sacrificing existing lab techniques, we have modified two standard laboratory experiments to include chiral GC analysis as follows: (1) The extraction of carvone from spearmint leaves and caraway seeds via steam distillation or other extraction methods is a lab widely used to demonstrate stereochemistry. However, the analysis of the products from the extraction is often limited to thin-layer chromatograms that confirm the presence of carvone and shows that the enantiomers have similar polarity. By including a GC method using a \u03b2-DEX\u2122 225 column in this lab, students were able to compare retention times of the spearmint and caraway extracts with those in a racemic mixture, then predict whether they are R or S by comparing with an injection of a pure R-carvone sample. (2) The reduction of aldehydes and ketones is another common experiment done in most institutions. Sodium borohydride reduction of acetophenone produced a racemic mixture which was observed as two retention times on the chromatogram. Reduction using the two enantiomers of commercially available CBS catalysts provided relatively enantiopure alcohols. Students could predict which enantiomers resulted from each enantiomer of the CBS catalyst by comparing it with a commercially obtained enantiopure alcohol. They also used chromatographic data to calculate the enantiomeric excess from their reactions.

However, a direct understanding of the atomic-scale mechanism associated with the charging and discharging processes for the Silicon anode is still lacking, partly due to the fact that the electrochemical reaction and structural evolution in the silicon anode involve complex phase transformation between crystalline (c-) and amorphous (a-) phases. In the past, such theoretical studies were limited by the capability of ab initio molecular dynamics. In this work, employing a newly developed deep potential model, we calculate and analyze voltage curves and microstructure evolution pathways starting from c-Si/a-Si/c-Li3.75Si/a-Li4.5Si with lithium insertion/extraction. Our simulations not only reproduce the key experimental phenomena, but also allow us to study the atomic scale mechanism associated with these phenomena. In particular, the voltage plateaus in both of the c-Si and a-Si lithiation processes are reproduced with a predicted plateau difference close to experimental measurements, which indicates the two-phase reaction mechanism at the initial lithiation stage. The latent heat of the phase transformation from c-Li15-\u03b4Si4 to a-Li15-\u03b4Si4 phases along the delithiation paths is evaluated, and agrees well with experimental value. Furthermore, the structural evolution from the crystal Si to the Li-Si solid solution and subsequently to the a-LixSi phase is captured, and the change of Si-Si bond distribution matches well with experiments.

Very few artificial methods are available for controlling the shape of dsDNA at any level, whereas several artificial methods have been developed to efficiently organize single-stranded DNA and RNA into a variety of well-defined nanostructures by programmed self-assembly. Here, we show how long double-stranded DNA sequences can be spatially organized by triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs),  which bridge two or more encoded polypurine domains. The linearized or plasmid dsDNA is compacted into antiparallel folds, which enables the formation of raster-filled 2D shapes and 3D structures with either square or hexagonal organizations. Contrary to ssDNA, dsDNA has inherent rigidity which alleviates the requirement to saturate a structure with TFO strands, yet the TFOs are still able to bend the dsDNA controllably and steeply up to 180\u00b0 over 6 bp. The majority of structures investigated here are formed by Hoogsteen interactions which require pH = 5-6, however, the methodology is also applied with reverse Hoogsteen interactions at physiological pH. In both cases, the DNA triplexes render pure polypurine scaffolded structures resistant to DNase I.

In previous work, experimental studies have shown that even minor structural changes can have a significant impact on the maximum loading capacity for several different drugs. In an effort to shed light on the molecular interactions underlying the structure-property-relationships we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on a selection of curcumin-loaded polymer micelles that have been experimentally characterized in detail. We investigated polymer-drug interactions in different micelle compositions, i.e. different drug loadings as well as variation of polymer structures of the inner hydrophobic core and the outer hydrophilic shell. Interestingly, the system with the highest experimental loading capacity also showed the highest amount of drug molecules encapsulated by the hydrophobic core in silico. Furthermore, in systems with a lower loading capacity the outer A blocks showed a greater extent of entanglement with the inner B blocks. Our results from hydrogen bond analyses corroborate the hypotheses of previous experimental studies: poly(2-butyl-2-oxazoline) B blocks, found experimentally to have a reduced loading capacity for curcumin in comparision to poly(2-propyl-2-oxazine), established fewer but longer-lasting hydrogen bonds. This possibly results from the additional methylene group in the backbone of poly(2-propyl-2-oxazine)  to allow for different sidechain conformations around the hydrophobic cargo, compared to poly(2-butyl-2-oxazoline). This was further investigated by an unsupervised clustering of monomers within smaller model systems mimicking the different micelle compartments. In addition, an exchange of the hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) A blocks with the slightly more hydrophobic poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) leads to a higher percentage of A blocks interacting with hydrophobic drugs and a reduced hydration of the corona; this suggests an impairment of micelle solubility or colloidal stability. This study demonstrates how all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can help in dissecting the effects of small structural changes in poly(2-oxazoline)-based micelles; we argue that it will pave the way for a more rational a priori design based approach to the development of drug delivery systems in the future.", "date": "2023-01-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Polymer Science; Drug delivery systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A generalization that uses two different fractional-occupancy SCF calculations is also considered.

Calculations of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of water as a function of relative humidity allow for following the adsorption process from the initial hydration stage to complete filling of the MOF pores. Initial hydration begins at the water molecules that saturate the open Cr3+ sites of the framework, which is then followed by the formation of water chains that extend along the channels connecting the hexagonal pores of the framework. Water present in these channels gradually coalesces and fills the hexagonal pores sequentially after the channels are completely hydrated. The development of hydrogen-bond networks inside the MOF pores as a function of relative humidity is characterized at the molecular level using experimental and computational infrared spectroscopy. A detailed analysis of the OH-stretch vibrational band indicates that the low- frequency tail, which is common in the experimental infrared spectra of water in MOFs, stems from strongly polarized hydrogen-bonded water molecules, suggesting the presence of some structural dis- order in the experimental samples.

The process involves the application of an overpotential that splits water to form H+ and OH\u2013 ions, producing acidity and alkalinity, i.e., in addition to gaseous co-products, at the anode and cathode, respectively. The alkalinity that results, i.e., via the \u201ccontinuous electrolytic pH pump\u201d results in the instantaneous precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), magnesium carbonates (Mg\u2013CO3), and/or magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) depending on the CO32\u2013 activity in solution. This results in the trapping, and hence durable and permanent (at least ~10,000\u2013100,000 years) immobilization of CO2 that was originally dissolved in water, and that is additionally drawn down from the atmosphere within: a) mineral carbonates, and/or b) as solvated bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) and carbonate (CO32\u2013) ions (i.e., due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2 into seawater having enhanced alkalinity). Taken together, these actions result in the net removal of up to \u22484.6 kg of CO2 per m3 of seawater processed. Geochemical simulations quantify the extents of net CO2 removal including the dependencies on the process configuration.

Herein, we report the synthesis of black gold via a facile, one-step green method using commonly known precursors (chloroauric acid and sodium citrate) performed at room temperature. The formation of the black gold particles is driven by self-assembly of in-situ formed small nanoparticles (~ 5 nm) followed by a fusion step forming extensive networks of nanowires.

Herein, we show the production of such end-products from crude raw materials via the photosensitized dimerization of terpenes. Terpenes are hydrocarbons originating from renewable sources, such as forestry, industrial bio-waste and photosynthetically active microorganisms. Under irradiation at 365 nm, we observed high conversions of terpenes into dimers (e.g. 96.1 wt.%, 12 h for \u03b1-phellandrene), and remarkable results were obtained using simulated and natural sunlight (90.8 wt.% and 46.6 wt.%, respectively, for \u03b1-phellandrene). We show that the lower reactivities of some isomeric monoterpenes could be overcome by a cross-photodimerization with \u03b1-phellandrene. We also utilized the cross-photodimerization approach to obtain C15 and C30 products, combining mixtures of isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Hydrogenation of the terpene dimers gave materials with physical properties suitable as high energy density fuels and lubricant oils.

Once prepared, the N4-substituted urazole peptide is selectively oxidized using mild, peptide-compatible conditions to generate an electrophilic N4-substituted TAD peptide intermediate that reacts selectively under aqueous conditions with internal and terminal Tyr residues to furnish Tyr-linked cyclic peptides. The approach demonstrates good tolerance of native residue side chains and enables access to cyclic peptides ranging from 3- to 11-residues in size (16- to 38-atom-containing cycles).

Many competing factors including the polymer architecture, molecular weight, backbone chemistry, and presence of solvent affect the local and global dynamics, and in many cases are interrelated. One approach to imparting distinct dynamic processes is through the incorporation of dynamic bonds with widely varying kinetics of bond exchange. Here, statistically crosslinked polymer networks are synthesized with mixed fast and slow dynamic bonds with four orders of magnitude different exchange kinetics. Oscillatory shear rheology shows that the single component networks (either fast or slow) exhibit a single relaxation peak, while mixing fast and slow crosslinkers in one network produces two peaks in the relaxation spectrum. This is in stark contrast to telechelic networks with the same mixture of dynamic bonds where only one mixed mode is observed, and here we develop the molecular design rules necessary to have each dynamic bond contribute a distinct relaxation mode. By controlling the polymer architecture and difference in the number of dynamic bonds per chain, we have elucidated the role of network architecture on imparting multimodal behavior in dynamic networks. A highly tunable and recyclable material has been developed with control of rubbery plateau modulus (through crosslink density), relaxation peak locations and ratio (through crosslinker selection and molar fractions), and tan \u03b4 (through the relationships of the rubbery plateau and relaxation peak locations).

Among the non-precious and abundant metals tested so far, copper is one of the best CO2 catalysts capable of converting this molecule into more than thirty different hydrocarbons and alcohols. However, the selectivity for desired products is often too low. Here, we present a computational investigation of nanostructuring and Cu/Sn alloying effects on the activity and selectivity of CO2 conversion. We have employed density functional theory calculations to explore the possibility of using small Cu\u2212Sn clusters, Cu4\u2212nSnn (n = 0\u20134), to activate CO2 and convert it to carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid (HCOOH). First, we have considered a detailed analysis of the structure, stability, and electronic properties of Cu4\u2212nSnn clusters and their ability to absorb and activate CO2. Then, we report the kinetics of the gas phase CO2 direct dissociation on Cu4\u2212nSnn to generate CO. Finally, we discuss the mechanism of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO and HCOOH on Cu4\u2212nSnn clusters and the competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction. Based on our results, we conclude the Cu2Sn2 system has the highest potential as a stable and selective catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 conversion to CO. We found the Cu2Sn2 to suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution and be highly selective toward CO. This study demonstrates that Cu2Sn2 clusters are a potential candidate for the electrocatalytic conversion of the CO2 molecule.

Most CLgens show ultraviolet emission, and it remains an enormous challenge to change the electronic structures of CLgens to improve their photophysical properties by precisely regulating the intramolecular through-space interactions (TSI). Herein we propose a general strategy to construct a higher-level intramolecular TSI in multiaryl-substituted alkanes, namely the secondary through-space interaction (2nd TSI), which is constructed by the primary through-space interaction (1st TSI) and TSI linker. By introducing methyl and phenyl into 1,1,3,3-tetraphenylpropane (TPP) respectively, butane-1,1,3,3-tetrayltetrabenzene (Me-TPP) and propane-1,1,1,3,3-pentaylpentabenzene (Ph-TPP) both show bright visible clusteroluminescence (CL),  whose fluorescence quantum yield is up to ~40% and the emission wavelength extends to 530 nm. Advanced theoretical studies relating to their emission mechanism are quantitatively performed to analyze the photophysical properties of these CLgens in different states. It is found that molecular rigidity and proper conformation both play pivotal roles in improving the 1st TSI, enhancing the TSI linker and constructing 2nd TSI. Experimental and calculation results prove that the hierarchical TSIs and CL have been successfully regulated in these multiaryl-substituted alkanes (MAAs).

It can thus be used off-the-shelf to rapidly screen 10,000s of crystal structures (which can contain millions of unique defects) from existing databases of DFT-relaxed crystal structures. This modeling approach therefore provides a significant screening and discovery capability for a plethora of applications in which vacancy defects are the primary driver of a material's utility.

This methodology represents a great improvement compared to other procedures described in literature, for which high temperatures, stronger reaction conditions or metal catalysts are usually required. In some cases, this protocol affords to the first examples of trapping allylic carbocations with indole derivatives. All these features make this procedure an appealing and green alternative in comparison with other examples reported in literature on alkylation of amines by allylic alcohols.

Amino acid sequence variations of IAPP between species can greatly decrease their propensity for aggregation. For example, human IAPP is toxic to beta-cells, but rat and pig IAPP are not. However, it is not clear how these differences affect membrane association. Using native mass spectrometry with lipid nanodiscs, we explored the differences in the association of human, rat, and pig IAPP with lipid bilayers. We discovered that human and rat IAPP bound nanodiscs with anionic dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) lipids, but pig IAPP did not. Furthermore, human and rat IAPP interacted differently with the membrane. Human IAPP shows potential tetramer complexes, but rat IAPP associated with the membrane sequentially.

While destructive interference in the \u03c0-system arises from interference terms between paired occupied and virtual orbitals, this is not the case in saturated systems.

Initially, silica NPs were transparent to 532 nm excitation, but after brief exposure to a CO2 laser (10.6 \u03bcm) their 532 nm absorptivity increased, and when heated they emitted blackbody-like emissivity in the visible/near IR, signaling that their compositions had become more Si-rich.  The transformation was also probed by sublimation rate measurements from 1600 K to 2350 K, and the chemistry of the transformed surface was probed by measuring the O2 etching kinetics of pre-heated silica NPs at 1200 and 1300 K.  Sublimation was significant for NP temperatures at TNP \u2265 1900 K, and the NP optical properties showed further slow changes as the NPs sublimed.  The O2 etching kinetics for pre-heated silica NPs were similar to those previously reported for single Si NPs under the same conditions, with etching efficiency (EEO2) initially increasing with etching time, then dropping by three orders of magnitude as the NP surface passivated by growth of a thermally stable SiO2 layer.  NPs lost up to 50% of their initial masses before passivating.  The etching and passivation kinetics at different temperatures and O2 pressures are compared, and comparisons are also made to the temperature and time dependence of EEO2 for pre-heated silica, Si, SiC, and carbon NPs.

In this study, O-H and \u03b1-C-H bond cleavages in ethanol on a Cu3X(111) surface (X= Zr, In, Ag, Au) were carried out using DFT to explore the effect of alloying on the selective and effective dehydrogenation of ethanol.

Thus this work indicates that alloying Zr can selectively break the O-H bond of ethanol, which cannot be accomplished using Pt, Pd, or Cu catalysts. Meanwhile, through PDOS analysis, M\u00fclliken charge analysis, and d-band center analysis, there are two key fac-tors that contribute to the great improvements on the dehydrogenation catalytic activities of Cu3X(111). Firstly, the specific inherent properties of the second alloyed metal X, including the d-band center, are crucial to the adsorption and activation of ethanol on surfaces. Sec-ondly, the electronic distribution on the surfaces resulting from the difference of electronega-tivity between the metals Cu and X is associated with the dehydrogenation reaction barrier.

Three bologna formulations, each packaged with two packaging films were produced.

Instrumental a* values (measured during both light and dark storage at intervals of 7 or 14 days over 126 days of storage) and cured pigment concentration (measured at 14-day intervals over 84 days of storage) were significantly greater (P < 0.05) for the UCC-NEF treatment compared to its conventional film counterpart, UCC-CF. No significant differences (P > 0.05) for lipid oxidation (TBARS values) were observed with NEF. Trained sensory panelists, who evaluated samples at 14-day intervals over 70 days of storage, found significantly greater (P < 0.05) cured aroma, cured flavor, pink color and less off-flavor for uncured bologna packaged in NEF compared to conventional film.

The gene is bidirectionally transcribed, producing G4C2 repeats, r(G4C2)exp, in the sense and C4G2 repeats, r(C4G2)exp, in the antisense strands. Akin to other repeat expansions, those operating in c9ALS/FTD are highly structured, which contributes to their gain-of-function mechanism. Structural studies have revealed that r(G4C2)exp predominantly folds into a hairpin, which has periodic arrays of 1\u00d71 G/G internal loops and a G-quadruplex. Recent studies on small molecule probes revealed that r(G4C2)exp adopts a new hairpin structure in which the 1\u00d71 G/G internal loops transform into 2\u00d72 GG/GG internal loops. We first evaluated the performance of four different RNA force fields with conventional MD simulations and showed that only the one having revised \u03c7 and \u03b1/\u03b3 torsional parameters maintained the helicity of a model r(G4C2)2. We then used this force field to study the conformational dynamics adopted by 2\u00d72 GG/GG loops in a model system of r(UCUGGGGCCAGA)2 using temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (T-REMD) simulations covering over 1.7 ms cumulative simulation time. We further characterized the structure and underlying dynamics of these internal loops using traditional 2D NMR techniques, illustrating the possibility of adopting different configurations around the glycosidic bond, i.e., anti vs. syn, using a hairpin model, r(CCAGGGCAAGGAAACUUGGGCUGG). Results display that closing base pairs play an important role in the structure and dynamics of these systems with the most preferred configuration being in syn-anti/anti-syn and anti-syn/anti-syn. Analogous studies on r(C4G2) repeats, which fold into an array of 2\u00d72 CC/CC internal loops, revealed that this structure is not as dynamic as 2\u00d72 GG/GG internal loops, where the residues adopt all anti configurations, although the dynamics of the loop residues is affected by the closing base pairs. Collectively, these studies emphasize the unique sensitivity of r(G4C2)exp to small changes in stacking interactions, which is not observed in r(C4G2)exp, providing important considerations for further principles in structure-based drug design.

According to the kinetics measurement results at different relative humidities, ozone concentrations and stoichiometries of inorganic and organic solutes, this work finds that a high aerosol ionic strength can accelerate the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate at air-water interfaces, while a high aerosol viscosity prolongs the reaction timescales due to diffusion-limited kinetics. The kinetic multilayer model of aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (KM-SUB) is utilized to investigate the observed heterogeneous kinetics results and to retrieve the surface reaction rate coefficients. The KM-SUB simulations results indicate that the observed kinetics of sulfur oxidation in binary sodium thiosulfate aqueous micro-droplets with high ionic strengths is dominated by interfacial reactions, and the fitted surface reaction rate coefficients increase one order of magnitude when the droplet ionic strength increases around 40 M.

Interestingly, K-PBAs are appealing cathodes for Na-ion batteries (NIBs), due to the increased cation intercalation voltage compared to Na-PBAs. In such a hybrid NIB cell, where Na+ is in the electrolyte and K+ is in the PBA cathode, cation intercalation and electrochemical performance of the cathode can be significantly affected by [Fe(CN)6]4- anion vacancy. This work studies the effect of [Fe(CN)6]4- anion vacancy in K-PBAs on regulating K+/Na+ intercalation mechanism in hybrid NIB cells, by comparing two K-PBA cathodes with different vacancy contents. Experimental and computational results demonstrate that introducing a level of anion vacancy can maximize the number of K+ intercalation sites and enhance K+ diffusion in the PBA framework. This facilitates K+ intercalation and suppresses Na+ intercalation, resulting in a K+-dominated and high-discharge-voltage ion storage process in the hybrid NIB cell. The K-PBA cathode with 20% anion vacancy delivers 127 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and 63 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1, as well as retains 87% and 77% capacity after 100 and 300 cycles, respectively. It completely outperforms the counterpart with 7% anion vacancy, which exhibits increased Na+ intercalation but overall deteriorated ion storage.

Despite significant advances over the past 25 years, this reaction still suffered from an intrinsic limitation in the substitution pattern of the aryl halide, referred to as \u201cortho-constraint\u201d. When an ortho substituent is absent, the haloarene substrate often fails to undergo effective mono ortho-functionalization process, and either ortho-difunctionalization products or NBE-embedded byproducts predominate. To tackle this challenge, structurally-modified NBEs (smNBEs) have been developed, which were proved effective for the mono ortho-aminative, -acylative, and -arylative Catellani reactions of ortho-unsubstituted haloarenes. However, the smNBE strategy is incompetent for solving the ortho-constraint in Catellani reactions with ortho-alkylation, and to date there lacks a general solution to this challenging but synthetically useful transformation. Recently, our group developed the Pd/olefin catalysis, in which an unstrained hybrid cycloolefin ligand served as a covalent catalytic module to enable the ortho-alkylative Catellani reaction without an NBE mediator. In this work, we show that this chemistry could afford a new solution to ortho-constraint in the Catellani reaction. A functionalized hybrid cycloolefin ligand bearing an amide group as the internal base was designed, which allowed for mono ortho-alkylative Catellani reaction of iodoarenes suffering from ortho-constraint before. Mechanistic study revealed that the newly designed ligand is capable of both accelerating the C\u2212H activation and inhibiting side reactions, which accounts for its superior performance. The present work showcased the uniqueness of the Pd/olefin catalysis as well as the power of rational ligand design in metal catalysis.", "date": "2023-01-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we demonstrate that sequential disproportionation reactions can enable selective aggregation of two- or four electron-holes at a hypervalent iodine center. Disproportionation of an anodically generated iodanyl radical (i.e., I(II) species) affords an iodosylbenzene derivative (i.e., I(III) species). Subsequent iodosylbenzene disproportionation can be triggered to provide access to iodoxybenzene (i.e., I(V) species). Both the transient iodanyl radical intermediate that engages in disproportionation to afford I(III) species and the O-bridged bis-I(III) compound that mediates iodosylbenzene disproportionation to afford I(V) species have been directly characterized.

MOMs readily form low-dimensional structures, and so are ideal systems to realise physical examples of key quantum models, including the Haldane phase, where a topological excitation gap occurs in integer-spin antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains. Thus far the Haldane phase has only been identified for S = 1, with S \u2265 2 still unrealised because the larger spin imposes more stringent requirements on the magnetic interactions. Here, we report the structure and magnetic properties of CrCl2(pym) (pym=pyrimidine), a new quasi-1D S = 2 AFM MOM. We show, using X-ray and neutron diffraction, bulk property measurements, density-functional theory calculations and inelastic neutron spectroscopy (INS) that CrCl2(pym) consists of AFM CrCl2 spin chains (J1 = \u22121.13(4) meV) which are weakly ferromagnetically coupled through bridging pym (J2 = 0.10(2) meV), with easy-axis anisotropy (D = \u22120.11(1) meV). We find that although small compared to J1, these additional interactions are sufficient to pre- vent observation of the Haldane phase in this material.

In this paper we detail the methodology used to develop this force field, as well as the innovations and improvements introduced since the release of Parsley 1.0.0. One particularly significant feature of Sage is a set of improved Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters retrained against condensed phase mixture data, the first refit of LJ parameters in the OpenFF small molecule force field line. \nSage also includes valence parameters refit to a larger database of quantum chemical calculations than previous versions, as well as improvements in how this fitting is performed.

Both reversible and quasi-reversible redox reactions are treated. The simulations compute the time-dependent electric potential and ion distributions across the entire cell during a voltammetric scan. In this way, it is possible to obtain the interdependent faradaic and non-faradaic contributions to a CV and rigorously include all effects of the electric potential distribution on the rate of electron transfer and the local concentrations of the redox species Oz and Rz-1. Importantly, we demonstrate that the driving force for electron transfer can be different to the applied potential when electrostatic interactions are included. We also show that the concentrations of Oz and Rz-1 at the plane of electron transfer (PET) significantly depart from those predicted by the Nernst equation, even when the system is characterised by fast electron transfer/diffusion control. A mechanistic rationalisation is presented as to why the electric double layer has a negligible effect on the CV response of such reversible systems. In contrast, for quasi-reversible electron transfer the concentrations of redox species at the PET are shown to play an important role in determining CV wave shape, an effect also dependant on the charge of the redox species and the formal electrode potential of the redox couple. Failure to consider electrostatic effects could lead to incorrect interpretation of electron-transfer kinetics from the CV response. Simulated CVs at scan rates between 0.1 and 1000 V/s are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for the reduction of 1.0 mM Ru(NH3)63+ at a 2-mm diameter gold disk electrode in 1.0 M potassium nitrate.

A facile three-step diffusion process is proposed consisting of a bidentate acetate reaction with a bridging hydroxyl to form monodentate acetic acid, rotation of monodentate acetic acid, and dissociation of monodentate acetic acid to reform bidentate acetate and a hydroxyl. This study clearly demonstrates that the dynamics of bidentate acetate could be important in the formation of monodentate species, which are proposed to be crucial for selective ketonization.", "date": "2023-01-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Colloidal nanochemistry on the other hand is an emerging alternative for the synthesis of 2D TMDC nanosheet (NS) ensembles, allowing for the control of the reaction via tunable precursor and ligand chemistry. Up to now, wet-chemical colloidal syntheses yielded intertwined/agglomerated NSs with a large lateral size. Here, we show a synthesis method for 2D mono- and bilayer MoS2 nanoplatelets with a particularly small lateral size (NPLs, 7.4 nm \u00b1 2.2 nm) and MoS2 NSs (22 nm \u00b1 9 nm) as a reference by adjusting the molybdenum precursor concentration in the reaction. We find that in colloidal 2D MoS2 syntheses initially a mixture of the stable semiconducting and the metastable metallic crystal phase is formed. 2D MoS2 NPLs and NSs then both undergo a full transformation to the semiconducting crystal phase by the end of the reaction, which we quantify by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Phase pure semiconducting MoS2 NPLs with a lateral size approaching the MoS2 exciton Bohr radius exhibit strong additional lateral confinement, leading to a drastically shortened decay of the B exciton which is characterized by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Our findings represent an important step for utilizing colloidal TMDCs, for example small MoS2 NPLs represent an excellent starting point for the growth of heterostructures for future colloidal photonics.", "date": "2023-01-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We synthesized 19 derivatives for the structural optimization of the starch probe and discovered that fluorescein-5-tert-butyl carbamate is the most specific probe with the brightest fluorescence among them. Analysis using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants of starch metabolism and in vitro NMR experiments revealed that the probe forms a complex with starch and illuminates starch granules in leaf chloroplasts and root amyloplasts within 10 minutes after the probe infiltration into living plant tissues. The starch probe is applicable to track the changes in intracellular starch contents in response to circadian cycle or light conditions.

The conformational changes responsible for NPQ activation and their connection to specific quenching mechanisms are still unknown.\nHere, we investigate the pH-triggered conformational changes in the light-harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR) of mosses. By combining constant-pH molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling techniques, we find that the pH sensitivity of the complex is driven by the coupled protonation of three residues modulating the conformation of the short amphipathic helix placed at lumen side of the embedding membrane.

This work addresses the His85\uf0e0Gln mutant paradox where mutation of His\uf0e0Gln still shows efficient decarboxylation activity in CYP450OleT. The MD simulation of the H85Q mutant of CYP450OleT shows that in the absence of the histidine at 85th position, an Asp239 plays a similar role via a well-organized water channel.

In particular, we focus on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of a PdII complex supported by the mixed hard/soft 2,11-dithia[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane (N2S2) ligand . This is one of the few examples of a Pd complexes supported by a mixed hard-soft ligand which selectively produces CO from the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. Notably, unlike previously reported molecular Pd complexes, selective CO2RR occurs in presence of weak proton sources such as 2, 2, 2 trifluoroethanol (TFE) and phenol, at mild overpotentials (~160 mV) and with high rates (kobs = 4.5 x 103 s-1, with phenol as proton source) and at Faradaic efficiencies of up to 70% for CO, without any H2 being detected. As the catalyst was not stable to long term electrolysis, we analyzed possible decomposition routes for this catalyst and, based on the characterization of its reaction with CO by UV-vis, NMR, and IR spectroscopy, we propose the intermediacy of a binuclear [(N2S2)PdI(\u03b72-CO)]2 species toward the ultimate decomposition of the catalyst into free ligand and Pd0. Overall, these studies offer important insights into Pd catalyst decomposition and may explain the historically poor performance of related Pd molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction. In addition, the structurally-related hard N-donor diazapyridinophane (RN4)Pd complexes are shown to be unstable towards bulk electrolysis at cathodic potentials, suggesting that such compounds are ill-suited for CO2 electroreduction.

While this implementation of FRET in the gas phase promises detailed insights for fundamental and applied studies, the gas-phase environment also poses great challenges. For FRET, fluorophore pairs are typically covalently attached to strategic binding sites in the backbone of a biomolecule, using short linkers. The linker further increases the mobility of the dye, contributing to rotational averaging of the relative orientation of the transition dipole moments of donor and acceptor. However, little is known about the fluorophore\u2019s degrees of freedom in the gas phase and how it may be influenced by intramolecular interactions. In this study, we test the influence of a fluorophore\u2019s linker length on the measured FRET efficiencies in the gas phase to probe the mobility of the fluorophore. An increased FRET efficiency was observed with increasing linker length, ranging from 5.3 % for a linker consisting of 2 atoms to 27.7 % for a linker length of 13 atoms. To rationalize this trend, we profiled the conformational landscape of each model system with MD simulations. Employing state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques, we captured intramolecular interactions that promote a population shift towards smaller donor-acceptor separation for longer linker lengths and induce a significant increase in their acceptor dipole.

How a protein active site dictates the arrangement of the valences in the ground state, as well as the population of excited-state valence isomers, is poorly understood in part because of the magnetic complexity of these systems.

The most commonly-used DoE relies on the response surface methodology (RSM) to model the variable space of experimental condi-tions with a minimal number of experiments. However, the RSM leads to an exponential increase in the number of required experiments to be evaluated as the number of variables increases. Herein we describe a Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to optimize the continuous parameters (e.g. temperature, reaction time, reactant and enzyme concentrations etc.) of enzyme-catalyzed reactions with the aim of maximizing performance. Compared to existing Bayesian optimization methods, we propose an improved algorithm that leads to better results under limited resources and time for experiments. To validate the versatility of BOA for the optimization of the turnover number in enzyme-catalyzed reactions, we benchmarked its per-formance for a biocatalytic C-C bond-forming reaction as well as an amination reaction. Gratifyingly, up to 80% improvement compared to RSM and up to 360% improvement vs. previous Bayesian optimization algorithms was obtained.

In addition, prior examples of NCL using mercaptoproline have exhibited stalling of the reaction after thioester exchange, due to inefficient S\uf0aeN acyl transfer. Herein, we develop methods, using inexpensive Boc-4R-hydroxyproline, for the solid-phase synthesis of peptides containing N-terminal 4R-mercaptoproline and 4R-selenoproline. The synthesis proceeds via proline editing on the N-terminus of fully synthesized peptides on the solid phase, converting an N-terminal Boc-4R-hydroxyproline to the 4S-bromoproline, followed by SN2 reaction with potassium thioacetate or selenobenzoic acid. After cleavage from the resin and deprotection, peptides with functionalized N-terminal proline amino acids were obtained. NCL reactions with mercaptoproline proceeded slowly under standard NCL conditions, with the S-acyl transthioesterification intermediate observed as a major species. Computational investigations indicated that the bicyclic intermediates and transition states for S\uf0aeN acyl transfer are sufficiently low in energy (10-15 kcal mol\u20131 above starting material) that ring strain cannot explain slow S\uf0aeN acyl transfer. Instead, the bicyclic zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate has a low barrier for reversion to the S-acyl intermediate, causing reversion to the thioester (reverse reaction) to occur preferentially over elimination to generate the amide (forward reaction). We hypothesized that a buffer capable of general acid and/or general base catalysis could promote S\uf0aeN acyl transfer, and thus achieve greater efficiency in proline NCL. In the presence of 2 M imidazole at pH 6.8, NCL with mercaptoproline proceeded efficiently to generate the peptide with a native amide bond. NCL with selenoproline also proceeded efficiently to generate the desired products when a thiophenol thioester was employed as a ligation partner. After desulfurization or deselenization, the products obtained were identical to those synthesized directly, confirming that the solid-phase proline editing reactions proceeded stereospecifically and without epimerization.

In this work, we study the reaction mechanism underlying the electroreduction of furfural, an important biomass-derived platform chemical, combining grand-canonical (constant-potential) density functional theory -based microkinetic simulations and pH dependent experiments on Cu under acidic conditions. Our simulations indicate the second PCET step in the reaction pathway to be the rate- and selectivity-determining for the production of the two main products of furfural electroreduction on Cu, furfuryl alcohol and 2-methyl furan, at moderate overpotentials. We further identify the source of Cu\u2019s ability to produce both products with comparable activity in their nearly equal activation energies. Furthermore, our microkinetic simulations suggest that surface hydrogenation steps play a minor role in determining the overall activity of furfural electroreduction compared to PCET steps due to the low steady-state hydrogen coverage predicted under reaction conditions, the high activation barriers for surface hydrogenation and the observed pH dependence of the reaction.

For reasons of synthetic efficiency, these analogs were derived from 13-desmethylene-(-)-zampanolide, which we had previously shown to be an equally potent cancer cell growth inhibitor as the natural product. The synthesis of all compounds was based on a unified strategy that included final formation of the macrobicyclic core by an intramolecular HWE reaction and a stereoselective aza-aldol reaction to establish the C(20) stereocenter as the key steps. For the 5-desmethyl macrocycle, ring-closure relied on macrolactonization; however, elaboration of the macrocyclic aldehyde into the corresponding zampanolide analog was unsuccessful.All structural modifications investigated led to reduced cellular activity and lower microtubule-binding affinity compared to the parent 13-desmethylene-(\u2013)-zampanolide, which may be ascribed to increased conformational flexibility due to the formal reduction of double bonds or the removal of the C(17)-methyl group. Notwithstanding this general trend, the cellular potency of 2,3-dihydro-13-desmethylene zampanolide as the most potent analog identified remained within a 9-fold range of that of 13-desmethylene-(\u2013)-zampanolide (for 5 out of 6 cell lines). Notably, while the formal reduction of the C=C double bond of the enone system that is required for the covalent attachment of (\u2212)-zampanolide to beta-tubulin caused a drop in antiproliferative activity of several hundred fold, the compound does bind to microtubules and shows the typical cellular hallmarks of a microtubule-stabilizing agent.

Previously, we have implemented the GME for biomolecular dynamics, namely the quasi Markov State Model (qMSM), where we explicitly calculate the memory kernel and propagate protein dynamics using a discretized GME. qMSM can be constructed with much shorter MD simulation trajectories than the Markov State Model (MSM). However, since qMSM needs to explicitly compute the time-dependent memory kernels, it is heavily affected by the numerical fluctuations of simulation data when applied to study complicated conformational changes of biomolecules. This can lead to numerical instability of predicted long-time dynamics, greatly limiting the applicability of the qMSM in complicated molecules. In this paper, we propose a new theory, the Integrative GME (IGME), to overcome the challenges of the qMSM by using the time integrations of memory kernels. The IGME avoids the numerical instability induced by explicit computation of time-dependent memory kernel functions, giving more robust predictions of long-time dynamics. Using our analytical solution of the IGME, we propose a new approach to compute memory kernels and long-time dynamics in a numerically stable, accurate and efficient way. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we have applied the IGME in three biomolecules: the alanine dipeptide, the FIP35 WW domain, and Taq RNAP. In each system, the IGME achieves significantly smaller fluctuations for both memory kernels and long-time dynamics compared to the qMSM. We anticipate that the IGME can be widely applied to investigate complex conformational changes of biomolecules.", "date": "2023-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Curcumin, a small molecule natural product from the Turmeric (Curcuma longa) plant, has well-known anti-oxidant properties, resulting from its radical scavenging ability and inhibition of inflammation-associated factors. However, its lack of solubility, instability, and poor bioavailability and biodistribution characteristics are an impediment to its use. To circumvent these issues while retaining curcumin\u2019s biological activity, we synthesized twenty-one diarylidene-N-methyl-4-piperidones (DANMPs), four diheteroarylidene-N-methyl-4-piperidones (DHANMPs), and five spirobibenzopyran (SBP) derivatives. All were screened in terms of anti-oxidant activity via a cell-free 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and for drug-like properties in silico. In the former, some compounds possessed improved radical scavenging behavior versus ascorbic acid, which was used as a benchmark. Conformity to simulated Lipinski\u2019s parameters and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) studies indicated the DANMPs, DHANMPs, and SBPs to be potentially useful compounds. A subset of molecules was investigated in terms of their aqueous solubilities, which were significantly improved compared to that of curcumin. In vitro assessments of the cellular and anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds were conducted using RAW264.7 macrophages. RT-PCR and Griess assays were used to evaluate the presence of inflammatory/activated (M1) markers and production of nitric oxide (NO) species, which are associated with inflammation, respectively. While the compounds did not affect non-stimulated (na\u00efve) macrophages, they did reduce levels of markers and NO to extents similar to or better than curcumin in inflamed cells. Our results indicate that these pharmacophores possess anti-inflammatory properties and can be used as curcumin-substitutes with improved characteristics. Further investigation into their mechanisms of action and potential use in the treatment of inflammatory diseases is merited.", "date": "2023-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we demonstrate a new approach of nitrogen fixation to synthesize ammonia at ambient conditions via laser\u2013induced multiphoton dissociation of lithium oxide. Lithium oxide is dissociated under non\u2013equilibrium multiphoton absorption and high temperatures under focused infrared light, and the generated zero\u2013valent metal spontaneously fixes nitrogen and forms a lithium nitride, which upon subsequent hydrolysis generates ammonia.

Porphyrinic Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporate a photoactive dye in a porous material and are therefore promising candidates for artificial photosynthesis. The photochemical conversion of CO2 relies on the interactions between CO2, the proton source H2O, and the photoactive sites in the MOF pores. However, our understanding of these interactions and the photoreaction mechanism is still rather limited. Here, we studied the initial step of the artificial photosynthesis: CO2 sorption and activation in the presence of water. We have developed a combined vibrational and visible spectroscopic setup to simultaneously monitor the adsorption of CO2 into porphyrinic Zr-MOFs, namely PCN-222 and PCN-223, and the photophysical changes in the porphyrin linker as function of water concentration. Computational simulations further corroborate the experimentally obtained adsorption enthalpies. We found a shift of CO2 sorption site from the Zr-cluster to the center of the porphyrin macrocycle when PCN-MOFs were brought in contact with humidity greater than the water pore condensation concentration. The shift in sorption site was accompanied by a bending of the porphyrin macrocycle, which induced a change in color and, thus, a change in spectral overlap with light. Furthermore, CO2/H2O competition experiments revealed that the exchange of CO2 by H2O is pore-size-dependent. Therefore, both humidity and pore-size allow to tune the CO2 sorption site, CO2 capacity, and light harvesting in porphyrinic MOFs, which are key factors for CO2 photoreduction.", "date": "2023-01-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although the performance of CO2 electrolyzers has im proved substantially in the last decade, they still suffer from poor selectivity towards\nthe most desired products, ethylene and ethanol. This is in part due to the fact that a detailed mechanistic understanding of the selectivity towards various products is still lacking, although such an understanding is essential for process optimization. Herein, we perform microkinetic simulations based on constant potential density functional theory to elucidate the reaction pathways for CO(2) electroreduction on Cu towards the major multi-carbon products. We find that ethylene is the first product that bifurcates from the oxygenates, followed by acetate. Acetaldehyde is a direct intermediate in the production of ethanol. We provide atomistic level insights on the major role played by the electrode potential and electrolyte pH in determining the selectivity towards ethylene, oxygenates and methane, and relate the origin of the selectivity to general trends in electrochemical reaction energetics. We verify the results of our microkinetic simulations to an experimental database of previously reported measurements. Finally, we suggest guidelines for improving the selectivity towards the specific products.

While the underlying mechanism of such response is often attributed to the changes in counterion-condensation levels or alterations in the ionic conditions in the pervaded volume of the hydrogel, exact molecular origins are still unknown. By using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a polyacrylic acid hydrogel in explicit water as a model system, we simulate the uniaxial compression and uniaxial stretching deformations of a highly-swollen (i.e., $>$90\\% solvent content) hydrogel network and calculate the microscopic condensation levels of counterions around the gel chains. The counterion condensation is highly non-monotonic, and both compression and stretching increase the overall counterion condensation in the hydrogel with deformation. The effect weakens for weakly swollen hydrogels. The condensation profiles around the chains of the deformed hydrogel are highly anisotropic;  the condensation tends to increase for the stretched chains of the hydrogel. However,  this increase reaches a maximum and decreases as the chains are strongly stretched under uniaxial extension. Under compression, the condensation around the chains perpendicular to the deformation direction increases. For the same reason, the hydrogel chains in the constrained and unconstrained (deformation-free) directions exhibit opposing condensation behaviors. Further, the deformation-induced counterion condensation does not occur in a semi-dilute polyelectrolyte solution, suggesting the role of hydrogel topology constraining the chain ends in this phenomenon. Our results indicate that counterion condensation in a deforming polyelectrolyte hydrogel can be highly heterogeneous and depends on the conformations of constituting chains.", "date": "2023-01-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Hydrogels; Polyelectrolytes - Polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A prominent limitation to the upscaling of such technology is represented by the use of pressurized hydrogen gas. In this contribution, the role of hydrogen gas within the RCF of wheat straw biomass is investigated. The use of H2 was shown to enhance lignin depolymerization, by virtue of an improved hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation of lignin fragments, with a yield of phenolic monomers that increased from ~12 wt% of acid-insoluble lignin in the initial biomass under inert atmosphere, up to ~25 wt% under H2, for a reaction in methanol, at 250 \u00b0C, with Ru/C. The adoption of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol as hydrogen-donor solvents was also investigated in the absence of H2, and the use of ethanol was found to give the highest yield of monophenolics (up to ~20 wt%) owing to a better balance between solvolysis, hydrogenolysis, and hydrogenation of lignin. Nevertheless, a substantial loss of the carbohydrate fraction was observed for reactions performed at 250 \u00b0C, irrespective of hydrogen pressure and of the solvent employed. The use of a lower temperature of 200 \u00b0C in combination with H3PO4 resulted in an improved recovery of cellulose in the pulp and in the solubilization of hemicellulose and lignin, with the formation of monosaccharides (~14 wt% of polysaccharides in the initial biomass) and phenolic monomers (up to 18 wt%, in the absence of H2). Overall, the obtained results show that a tradeoff exists between the removal of H2 from the process and the production of low-MW phenolics during RCF, which can be improved by accurately tuning the process conditions.", "date": "2023-01-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the design of anionic Cu ligands, particularly those by Ma, has enabled the coupling of various classes of aryl halides and alkyl amines, most methods require conditions that can limit their utility on complex substrates. Herein, we disclose the development of anionic N1,N2-diarylbenzene-1,2-diamine ligands that promote the Cu-catalyzed amination of aryl bromides under mild conditions. Guided by DFT-calculations, these ligands were designed to (1) increase the electron density on Cu, thereby facilitating the rate of oxidative addition of aryl bromides, and (2) stabilize the active anionic CuI complex via a \u03c0-interaction. Under optimized conditions, structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl bromides and a broad range of alkyl amine nucleophiles, including pharmaceuticals bearing multiple functional groups, were efficiently coupled at room temperature. Combined computational and experimental studies support a mechanism of C\u2013N bond formation that follows a catalytic cycle akin to the well-explored Pd-catalyzed variants. Modification of the ligand structure to include a naphthyl residue resulted in a lower energy barrier to oxidative addition, providing a 30-fold rate increase relative to what is seen with other ligands. Collectively, these results establish a new class of anionic ligands for Cu-catalyzed C\u2013N couplings which we anticipate may be extended to other Cu-catalyzed C\u2013heteroatom and C\u2013C bond-forming reactions.

Among the promising circular polymers, polydiketoenamines (PDKs) stand out for their ability to undergo highly selective depolymerization in strong acid, allowing monomers to be recovered from additives and fillers. Varying the triketone monomer in PDK variants is known to strongly affect the depolymerization rate; however, it remains unclear how the chemistry of the crosslinker, far from the reaction center, affects the depolymerization rate. Here, we elucidate design rules for PDK acidolysis from a convergence of simulations and experiments. We demonstrate that a multi-path transition state theory approach to calculating reaction kinetics is essential to accurate modeling of small molecule hydrolysis kinetics and that the computational results match closely to experimental observations of both small molecule hydrolysis kinetics and PDK depolymerization. Notably, we found that a proximal amine in the crosslinker dramatically accelerates PDK depolymerization when compared to crosslinkers obviating this functionality. Moreover, the spacing between this amine and the diketoenamine bond offers a previously unexplored opportunity to tune PDK depolymerization rates. In this way, the molecular basis for PDK circularity is revealed and further suggests new targets for the amine monomer design to diversify PDK properties, while ensuring circularity in chemical recycling.", "date": "2023-01-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers); Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we use molecular simulations to investigate the formation and phase behavior of water glasses using the ML-BOP water model. We produce glasses through hyperquenching of water, pressure-induced amorphization (PIA) of ice, and pressure-induced polyamorphic transformations. Our simulations show that PIA of polycrystalline ice occurs at a lower pressure than for mono-crystalline ice, and through a different mechanism. The temperature dependence of the amorphization pressure of polycrystalline ice for ML-BOP agrees with experiments. We also find that ML-BOP accurately reproduces the density, coordination number, and struc-tural features of LDA, HDA and VHDA water glasses. We examine the kinetics and mechanism of the transformation between low-density and high-density glasses, and find that the sharp nature of these transitions in ML-BOP is similar to that in experiments and all-atom water models with a liquid-liquid transition. Transitions between ML-BOP glasses occur through a spinodal-like mechanism, similar to ice crystallization from LDA. Both glass-to-glass and glass-to-ice transformations have Avrami-Kolmogorov kinetics with exponent n=1.5\u00b10.2 in experiments and simulations. Importantly, ML-BOP reproduces the competition between crystallization and HDA\u2192LDA transition above the glass transition temperature Tg, and separation of their time scales below Tg, observed also in experi-ments.

Although most of the work using the ELF has been focused on the study of ground-state chemical reactivity, a growing interest has blossomed to apply these techniques to the nearly unexplored realm of excited states and photochemistry. Since accurate excited electronic states usually require to account appropriately for electron correlation, the standard single-determinant ELF formulation cannot be blindly applied to them, and it is necessary to turn to correlated ELF descriptions based on the two-particle density matrix (2-PDM). The latter require costly wavefunction approaches, unaffordable for most of the systems of current photochemical interest.

In particular, bridges must be formed between electrochemists and synthetic and material chemists to establish the unified approach necessary to develop MOF-based energy storage devices exhibiting competitive performance.\n", "date": "2023-01-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Energy; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Materials with large second-order nonlinearities (\u03c7(2)) can be used as entangled photon sources with high brightness. The source brightness scales as the square of the effective nonlinearity (deff ) which is an intrinsic property of the mate- rial. Understanding material factors which can significantly alter this intrinsic property is useful in developing new materials which are SPDC efficient. In our work, we focus on understanding factors affecting the entangled photon pair properties such as the arrangements of ligands within the Zn(3-ptz)3 metal-organic framework (MOF) crystal and temperature. We find that the arrangement and alignment of the pyridine rings in the crystal structure significantly affect the deff and birefringence (\u2206n). Smaller pyri- dine ring alignments relative to the optic c-axis increases the \u2206n, which in turn leads to larger photon pair correlation times (\u03c4c) in coincidence measurements.

For this reason, the choice of electrolyte has been primarily limited to the highly corrosive chloroaluminate systems based on aluminum trichloride (AlCl3). In this work, we demonstrate reversible room-temperature Al plating from an active-halide-free (AHF) organic electrolyte based on aluminum trifluoromethanesulfonate (Al(OTF)3) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), as well as its AlCl3 counterpart.

Via respiration, acetic acid bacteria can oxidize biomass ethanol into acetic acid using membrane-bound alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ADH and AlDH, respectively). Focusing on the ability of these enzymes to interact directly and electrically with electrode materials, we constructed a mediatorless bioanode for ethanol oxidation based on a direct electron transfer (DET)-type bienzymatic cascade by ADH and AlDH. The three-dimensional structural data of ADH and AlDH elucidated by cryo-electron microscopy were valuable for effectively designing electrode platforms with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and pyrene derivatives. DET-type bioelectrocatalysis by ADH and AlDH was improved by using 1-pyrene carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNT. The catalytic current densities for bienzymatic ethanol oxidation were recorded at the bioanodes modified by various ADH/AlDH ratios.

We describe a new affinity capture technique for top-down protein analysis, called microprobe-capture in-emitter elution (MPIE), which can directly couple a label-free optical sensing technology (next-generation biolayer interferometry, BLI) with MS. To implement MPIE, an analyte is first captured on the surface of a microprobe, and subsequently eluted from the microprobe inside an electrospray emitter. The capture process is monitored in real-time via BLI. When electrospray is established from the emitter to a mass spectrometer, the analyte is immediately ionized via electrospray ionization (ESI) for HR-MS analysis. By this means, BLI and HR-MS are directly coupled in the form of MPIE-ESI-MS. The performance of MPIE-ESI-MS was demonstrated by the analysis of \u03b2-amyloid 1-40 and transferrin using both standard samples and human specimens. In comparison to the conventional affinity capture techniques such as bead-based immunoprecipitation, MPIE innovates the affinity capture methodology by introducing real-time process monitoring and providing binding characteristics of analytes, offering more information-rich experimental results. Thus, MPIE is a valuable addition to the TD-MS sample preparation toolbox, and more applications of MPIE-ESI-MS in top-down protein analysis are expected.", "date": "2023-01-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Apparatus; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Most proposed catalytic cycles for the homogeneous hydrogenation of olefins using molecular H2 start with the oxidative addition of H2 by metal complexes to form two reactive M\u2013H bonds, often via a non-classical metal dihydrogen (M\u2013H2) intermediate. Previous reports had provided indirect evidence for an alternative mechanism involving direct hydrogen transfer from a metal-bound H2 molecule to a metal-bound olefin without the oxidative addition step. However, the key metal(olefin)(H2) and the corresponding ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) step had not been directly observed. Herein, we show that incorporating a precoordinated olefin in a P(C=C)P pincer ligand framework allows for the observation of both a non-classical Ni-(H2) complex and the Ni(alkyl)(hydrido) product of LLHT in rapid equilibrium with dissolved H2. The utility of this cooperative H2-activation mechanism for catalysis is demonstrated in the semihydrogenation of diphenylacetylene under mild conditions. Mechanistic investigations supported by DFT calculations back the central role of LLHT for both cooperative H2 activation and catalytic semihydrogenation.

In principle, several alkylation mechanisms, such as the stereoinvertive SN2-type mechanism and the stereoretentive oxidative addition (OA) mechanism can be operated, and mechanistic insights can be obtained from the stereochemical outcomes of these alkylation reactions. Previous stereochemical investigations on the alkylation reaction of palladacycle complexes mainly focused on the use of chiral secondary alkyl halides as stereochemical probes, leaving more synthetically relevant primary alkyl iodides untouched. In this work, deuterium-labeled primary alkyl iodides were selected as a stereochemical probe, and their reaction with C,C- and C,X-type palladacycle complexes, namely Catellani-type palladacycle intermediates and directing group (DG)-coordinated palladacycle complexes, were investigated both experimentally and computationally to elucidate the alkylation mechanism.

The key is the introduction of a new detection technique named ultrawide single sideband phase sensitive detection (UWSSB-PSD) to the conventional continuous wave EPR, which remarkably enhanced the sensitivity for the detection of broadband transient signals compared with the direct detection protocol. By repeatedly triggering a transient kinetic event f(t) (e.g., by laser flash photolysis) under a 100 kHz magnetic field modulation with precise phase control, this technique can build an ultrawide single sideband modulated signal. After single sideband demodulation, the flicker noise-suppressed signal f(t) with an ultrawide bandwidth is recovered.

Microbubbles form under the strong turbulence effect at the throat of a cavitation tube, transferring active species into a stream of water. As demonstrated by degradation rate of sulfathiazole, a model antibiotic compound in water, the main parameters identified from our experiments to be essential for the activation efficiency are the design of the cavitation tube, the flow rate of the water stream, and the distance from the discharge to the flow. Our three-dimensional numerical simulations reveal the impact of the tube dimensions on the multiphase flow characteristics. The simplicity of self-suction mechanism allowed us to set up a solar-driven, stand-alone cold plasma system to generate PAW outdoor.

Our process consisted of the generation of surface nanodroplet arrays, followed by a biphasic chemical reaction between droplets and the continuous flow of silver nitrate (AgNO3) precursor solution. The parameters in the formation and reaction of the droplet array were well controlled to maintain the uniformity of Ag nanostructures throughout the substrate.

Potential reasons include an individual\u2019s viral dose exposure, the affinity of an individual\u2019s ACE2 to the spike protein of the virus, and the ability of the individual\u2019s induced immune system to neutralize the virus. Beyond these, an individual\u2019s epitranscriptomic system could be among the causes as well. The viral RNA genome, once inside the host cell, can be subject to modifications by the host\u2019s epitranscriptomic machinery. Because the machinery is different in different individuals, it is reasonable to believe that RNA modifications are different among different individuals, and can positively or negatively affect downstream events that involve the RNA such as replication of viral genome, generation of viral mRNAs, viral protein production, RNA recognition by host\u2019s immune system, and packaging of RNA genome into new viral particles. In this context, we studied the effects of several RNA modifications including pseudouridine (\u03a8), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A) and N3-methylcytosine (m3C) on the catalytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 replication complex (SC2RC), which included RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We found that \u03a8, m5C, m6A and m3C had little effects on the activity, while m1A severely inhibited the enzyme. Both m1A and m3C disrupt canonical base pairing. It is interesting one of them inhibits the enzyme while the other does not. The fact that m1A inhibits SC2RC may imply that the modification can be difficult to identify using any method even though it may exist and play a critical role. Putting aside other mechanisms by which the modifications cause individualized symptoms, the results indicated that individuals with a higher chance of m1A modification may stop viral replication and have less severe symptoms. However, this contradicts the observations that individuals with clinical conditions such as cancer, obesity and diabetes, who have upregulated m1A modifications, are more vulnerable to COVID-19. This contradiction may be explained by the importance of the dynamic nature of epitranscriptomic modifications for viral survival.", "date": "2023-01-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This method is combined with a newly developed implementation of vibrational perturbation theory that can readily identify relevant anharmonic couplings among nearly degenerate vibrational states. IR-cryo-SEVI spectra are obtained by resonant infrared excitation of vinoxide anions via the fundamental C-O (\ud835\udf084, 1570 cm\u22121) or isolated C-H (\ud835\udf083, 2546 cm\u22121) stretching vibrations prior to photodetachment.

Excitation of the higher energy \ud835\udf083 mode results in a more complicated spectrum that requires consideration of the calculated anharmonic resonances in both the anion and neutral. From this analysis, information about the zeroth-order states that contribute to the nominal \ud835\udf083 wavefunction in the anion is obtained.

The results indicate that the reaction of IPA with \u2022OH radicals occurs in the ground state rather than the excited state and the rate constants obtained directly and from the effective approach are the same which confirmed the accuracy of the estimated pre-reactive complexes and the reaction mechanism. Rate constants and branching ratios show that H- atom abstraction from iso C-H (C2 atom) bond is the most kinetically preferable route up to 1000 K, while at higher temperature H-atom abstraction from the out-plane CH3 group (C3 atom) became the most dominant route with the high competition with that of in-plane CH3 group (C4 atom).

Cubane is the ideal bioisostere since it provides the closest geometric match to benzene. At present, however, all cubanes in drug design, like almost all benzene bioisosteres, act solely as substitutes for mono- or para-substituted benzene rings. This is due to the difficulty of accessing 1,3- and 1,2-disubstituted cubane precursors. The adoption of cubane in drug design has been further hindered by the incompatibility of cross-coupling reactions with the cubane scaffold, owing to a competing metal-catalyzed valence isomerization. Herein, we disclose expedient routes to 1,3- and 1,2-disubstituted cubane building blocks using a convenient cyclobutadiene precursor and a photolytic C\u2013H carboxylation reaction, respectively.

The synthesized nanocluster can be used for the rapid detection of heavy metal (Ag(I)) in the nanomolar concentration range in real environmental and biological samples. The strong green photoluminescence intensity of the nanocluster quenched significantly upon addition of Ag(I) due to the formation of bigger nanoparticles, thereby losing its energy quantization. A notable colour change from light yellow to reddish brown can also be observed in the presence of Ag(I) allowing its visual colorimetric detection. Portable paper strips fabricated with Cu-Trp NC can be reliably used for on-site visual detection of Ag(I) in the micromolar concentration range. The Trp-Cu NC possesses excellent biocompatibility making them suitable nanoprobe for cell imaging, thus can act as an in-vivo biomarker. The nanocluster showed a significant spectral overlap with an anticancer drug doxorubicin, thus can be used as an effective FRET pair.

However, de novo design of functional polymers is challenging due to the vast chemical space and an incomplete understanding of structure-property relations. Recent advances in deep generative modeling have facilitated the efficient exploration of molecular design space, but data sparsity in polymer science is a major obstacle hindering progress. In this work, we introduce a vast polymer database known as the Open Macromolecular Genome (OMG), which contains synthesizable polymer chemistries compatible with known polymerization reactions and commercially available reactants selected for synthetic feasibility. The OMG is used in concert with a synthetically aware generative model known as Molecule Chef to identify property-optimized constitutional repeating units, constituent reactants, and reaction pathways of polymers, thereby advancing polymer design into the realm of synthetic relevance. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we show that polymers with targeted octanol-water solubilities are readily generated together with monomer reactant building blocks and associated polymerization reactions. Suggested reactants are further integrated with Reaxys polymerization data to provide hypothetical reaction conditions (e.g. temperature, catalysts, solvents).

Effective field theories and ab initio techniques treating nucleons as point-like particles have been enormously successful in accounting for many nuclear properties, including structure. The methodologies, however, remain computationally intensive and complex to the novice. The proposed alternating quark model (AQM) is an entry-level geometric model of nuclear structure based on the radius of the proton. Alternating up- and down-quarks occupy average positions within linear or polygonal chains. Best-fit structural solutions form cylindrical lattices of stacked 6-nucleon (18-quark) rings exhibiting structural periodicity that repeats every 12 nucleons. A corresponding periodicity in nuclear magnetic moments validates the model. The quark alternation hypothesis produces a near-perfect correlation between predicted and accepted charge radii of stable nuclides through 36Ar.

A novel criterion of nuclear stability is demonstrated: Nuclides containing contiguous alternating quark sequences tend to be stable; those containing discontiguous quark sequences tend to be unstable.

Here, we demonstrate significant improvement in this interfacial electron transfer through the incorporation of electron- and ion-conductive polymers. We have designed these polymers with a conductive backbone and side chains that mimic ligands of catalytic centers in redox-active enzymes.

Benzaldehyde and its  derivatives  have been  found to  be promoters for zeolite catalysed methanol dehydration to DME at low temperature (110 to 150 oC).  For the 3-dimensional medium pore zeolite H-ZSM-5 (MFI) the promotion is readily reversible and the potency of the promoter can be tuned by varying the substituent on the aromatic ring of the aldehyde.  The most potent promoters are active at concentrations as low as 1 ppm relative to methanol.  High throughput experimentation (HTE) is used to screen and rank potential promoters and catalysts and to collect high quality kinetic data for the most promising candidates discovered.  The catalytic data and in-situ FT-IR-MS experiments combined with molecular modelling studies indicate a mechanism involving competitive adsorption of the aldehyde promoter on a Br\u00f8nsted acid (BA) site, followed by reaction with methanol to give a hemi-acetal intermediate.  Loss of water from the hemi-acetal intermediate generates a transient and highly reactive methyl oxonium species, [ArC(H)(=O-Me)]+, which then directly reacts with methanol via a SN2 mechanism to give DME and regenerate the aldehyde promoter and BA site.  The methyl oxonium species is stabilized by electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring and the solvent like effect of the zeolite pore walls. Molecular descriptors were calculated by molecular modelling for the 22 aromatic aldehyde promoters tested. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to build an interpretable model for aldehyde promotional activity in H-ZSM-5 and in another 3-dimensional medium pore zeolite, H-ZSM-11 (MEL).", "date": "2023-01-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To first validate our approach, we calculate free energy surfaces of alanine dipeptide and show that our GPU-enhanced DFTB calculations qualitatively agree with computationally-intensive hybrid DFT benchmarks, whereas classical force fields give significant errors.

To accelerate the NEVPT2 computation, Guo and Neese combined it with the local pair-natural orbital (PNO) method using the projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) as the underlying local basis [Guo et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 094111 (2016)]. In the present paper, we report the further development of the PNO-NEVPT2 method using the orthonormal and non-redundant localized virtual molecular orbitals (LVMOs) instead of PAOs. The LVMOs were previously considered to perform somewhat poorly compared to PAOs because the resulting orbital domains were unacceptably large in size. Our prior work, however, showed that this drawback can be remedied by re-forming the domain construction scheme using differential overlap integrals (DOIs) [Saitow et al., J. Chem. Phys. 157, 084101 (2022)]. In this work, we develop further refinements to enhance the feasibility of using LVMOs. We first developed a two-level semi-local approach for screening out so-called weak-pairs in order to select or truncate the pairs for PNO constructions more flexibly. As a refinement specific to the Pipek\u2013Mezey localization for LVMOs, we introduced an iterative scheme to truncate the Givens rotations using varying thresholds. We assessed the LVMO-based PNO-NEVPT2 method through benchmark calculations for linear phenylalkanes, which demonstrate that it performs comparably well relative to the PAO-based approach. In addition, we evaluated the Co-C bond dissociation energies for the cobalamin derivatives composed of 200 or more atoms, which confirms that the LVMO-based method can recover more than 99.85% of the canonical NEVPT2 correlation energy.

However, most nanomedicines enter the cell via endosomal/lysosomal pathways and typically only a small fraction of the cargo enters the cytosol inducing a therapeutic effect. To circumvent these inefficient drug delivery pathways, alternative approaches are desired. Inspired by fusion machinery found in nature, various synthetic fusogens have been developed to mediate the fusion of vesicles. Previously we used lipidated versions of the heterodimeric peptide pair E4/K4 to induce membrane fusion and applied this approach to deliver drugs in vitro and in vivo. Peptide K4 was designed to interact specifically with peptide E, but it was also shown to have an affinity for lipid membranes resulting in membrane remodeling. As the next step towards efficient in vivo membrane fusion for potential therapeutic applications, our rationale was to design efficient fusogen variants that could have multiple interactions simultaneously. To achieve this goal, we synthesized dimeric coiled-coil peptide variants of peptide K to facilitate improved fusion with peptide E-modified liposomes and mammalian cells. The secondary structure and self-assembly of various dimers were studied; the parallel PK4 dimer forms temperature-dependent higher-order assemblies, while linear K4 dimers form tetramer-like homodimers. The findings regarding the structures and membrane interactions of the PK4 dimer were supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Upon addition of the complementary peptide E4, the parallel PK4 dimer induced the strongest coiled-coil interaction resulting in a higher cellular uptake of the liposome-encapsulated cargo, as compared to the linear dimer and monomeric designs. Using a wide spectrum of endocytosis inhibitors, it was shown that membrane fusion was the main cellular uptake pathway. Delivery of the antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) resulted in efficient cellular delivery and concomitant antitumor efficacy. These findings not only offer important mechanistic insights into the design of coiled-coil driven membrane fusion systems but also provide novel strategies for developing peptide-based biomaterials.

The vibrational frequencies of the system and temperature also affect the reaction mechanism. The HOMO-LUMO gap of the Cu13 cluster rarely altered by adsorption species while that of a single Cu and Cu2 changed substantially when reactive species adsorbed on a single Cu atom or Cu2 cluster. This work also illustrates that the reaction mechanisms are sensitive to the size of Cu clusters.", "date": "2023-01-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Molecular dynamics simulations are among the most powerful methods for computing these properties, but their reliability depends on the accuracy of interatomic interactions. While first principles approaches provide the most accurate description of interatomic forces, they are computationally expensive. In contrast, classical force fields are computationally efficient, but have limited accuracy in interatomic force description. Machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Gaussian Approximation Potentials, trained on density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer a compromise by providing both accurate estimation and computational efficiency. In this work, we present a systematic procedure to develop Gaussian approximation potentials for selected 2DMs, graphene, buckled silicene, and <i>h</i>-XN (X = B, Al, and Ga, as binary compounds) structures. We validate our approach through calculations that require various levels of accuracy in interatomic interactions.  The calculated phonon dispersion curves and lattice thermal conductivity, obtained through harmonic and anharmonic force constants  (including fourth order) are in excellent agreement with DFT results. HIPHIVE calculations, in which the generated GAP potentials were used to compute higher-order force constants instead of DFT, demonstrated the first-principles level accuracy of the potentials for interatomic force description.

Recent experimental studies reveal strong energy dependence of the VUV photodissociation branching ratios to N(4S3/2)+N(2DJ) and N(4S3/2)+N(2PJ) product channels, the primary dissociation pathways in the 108,000-116,000 cm-1 energy region. This produces N(2DJ) and N(2PJ) excited atoms that differ significantly in their chemical reactivity. The branching ratios oscillate with increase in the VUV excitation energy. We use high-level ab initio quantum chemistry to compute the potential curves of 17 electronic excited states and their non-adiabatic and spin-orbit couplings. The dynamics follow the sequential evolution from the optically excited but bound   singlets. Spin-orbit coupling enables transfer to the dissociative triplet and quintet states. We compute the photodissociation yields through the dense manifold of electronic states leading to both exit channels. The dynamical simulations accurately capture the branching oscillations and enable a detailed look into the photodissociation mechanism. The major contribution to the dissociation is through the two lowest   states. However, for both isotopomers, at about 110,000 cm-1 there is an abnormally low dissociation rate that enables comparable participation of triplet   and quintet   electronic states. This leads to the first peak in the branching ratio. At higher energies, trapping of the population in the   bound triplet state occurs. This favors dissociation to the lower energy N(4S3/2)+N(2DJ) channel and results in the observed second switch in branching ratios.

This cross-activity helps explain SARs-CoV-2's strange respiratory symptoms and immune evasion abilities. In this present study, the biological roles of SARs-CoV-2 proteins were investigated utilizing bioinformatic techniques involving the search for conserved domains. According to the study, the S and ORF3a proteins of SARs-CoV-2 possess picornavirus/calicivirus capsid domains, can bind hemoglobin, heme, and porphyrin. Both Arg134 of ORF3a and Cys44 of E are iron-binding sites for heme. The ORF3a protein has a region that converts heme into iron and porphyrin. In addition to chitin and polyphenol binding domains, the S protein also contains hemocyanin and phenoloxidase-like domains. The S protein constructs Fe-polyphenol complexes to link the red blood cell membrane, allowing SARs-CoV-2 to hitch a ride on red blood cells for fast delivery to target organs. This type of capsid-like vector delays the immune system but does not significantly alter the function of red blood cells to transport oxygen. Due to the distortion of the cell membrane, red blood cells with an excess of viral particles release hemoglobin to harm the virus. The wbl domains of the S protein respond to nitration, and then phenoloxidase domains oxidize polyphenols, allowing the virus to shed from the red blood cell membrane. ORF3a also attack 1-beta chain of hemoglobin; however, the majority of hemoglobin may retain its native structure. Patients will have variable degrees of respiratory distress and coagulation symptoms, but the hemocyanin domains of the S protein can improve a patient's respiratory status by transporting oxygen.", "date": "2023-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In order to understand the nature of the intermediates involved in this transformation and explain the loss of selectivity for certain substrates, we have performed a Density Functional Theory investigation of the reaction mechanism at the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/Def2TZVPP level of theory. Our results indicate that cyclopropylcarbinyl cations are stable intermediates in this reaction, while bicyclobutonium structures are high-energy transition structures and as such are not involved, regardless of the substitution pattern on the substrate. Instead, multiple rearrangement pathways of cyclopropylcarbinyl cations have been located, including rotations around their \u03c0-bonds and ring openings to homoallylic cations. Importantly, the relative energies of these homoallylic cations and of the activation barriers to reach them are correlated to the nature of the substituents. While direct nucleophilic attack on the chiral cyclopropylcarbinyl cation is kinetically favored for most systems, the rearrangements become competitive with nucleophilic attack for the phenyl-substituted systems, leading to a loss of selectivity through a mixture of rearranged carbocation intermediates. As such, it appears that stereospecific reactions of chiral cyclopropylcarbinyl cations depend on the ability of these cations to access homoallylic structures, from which selectivity is not guaranteed.", "date": "2023-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Stereochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this work, we exploited the physical principle of electrostatic catalysis, in which the large electric fields exerted by the charged and polar chemical groups in enzyme active sites preferentially stabilize the more charge-separated transition state over the reactant state and thus accelerate reactions.

Activity is found to be negligible for isolated Pt atoms on ITO, increasing rapidly with Ptn size, such that Pt7/ITO and Pt8/ITO have roughly double the activity per Pt atom compared atoms in the surface layer of polycrystalline Pt. Both DFT and experiment find that hydrogen under-potential deposition (Hupd) results in Ptn/ITO (n = 4, 7, 8) adsorbing ~2 H atoms/Pt atom at the HER threshold potential, equal to ca. double the Hupd observed for bulk Pt or Pt nanoparticles.

It has been observed that the cyclopropane rings provide more rigid kinks in the lipid acyl chain compared to the double bonds and therefore further reduce the packing density of the membrane and subsequently enhance the membrane fluidity at low temperatures. They also inhibit the close packing of other lipids and deleterious phase separation by strongly interacting with them. Therefore, this study has explained why E. coli bacterial strain, susceptible to freezing environment, relies on the cyclopropanation of an unsaturated chain.", "date": "2023-01-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Specifically, solubility is directly proportional to the volumetric energy density of an energy storage device and thus affects its corresponding spatial footprint. Recently pyridiniums have been introduced as a class of ROMs with high persistence in multiple redox states at low potentials. Unfortunately, solubility of pyridinium salts in non-aqueous media remains low (generally less than 1 M), and relatively few practical molecular design strategies exist for generalized improvement of ROM solubility.  Herein, we convey the extent to which discrete, attractive interactions between C-H groups and the p-electrons of an aromatic ring (C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7pi interactions) can describe the solubility of N-substituted pyridinium salts in a non-aqueous solvent (acetonitrile).  We find a direct correlation between the extent of crystalline C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7pi interactions for each pyridinium salt and its solubility in acetonitrile (R2 = 0.93, solubility range = 0.3 \u2013 2.1 M).  The presence of C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7pi interactions reveals how large disparities in solubility between (e.g.) N-(p-tolyl)-4-phenyl-2,6-dimethylpyridinium (0.32 \u00b1 0.03 M) and N-(p-tolyl)-4-(p-tolyl)-2,6-dimethylpyridinium (1.06 \u00b1 0.03 M) tetrafluoroborate may arise despite differing in structure by only three atoms.

To tackle this challenge, we develop a chemically inspired convolutional neural network based on convolution block attention modules using density of states of unrelaxed initial structures (IS-DOS) as inputs.

Here we present a theoretical pK data set PHMD549, which was successfully applied to four distinct machine learning methods, including DeepKa that was proposed in our previous work. To reach a valid comparison, EXP67S was selected as the test set. Encouragingly, DeepKa was improved significantly and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, except for the constant-pH molecular dynamics, which was utilized to create PHMD549.  More importantly, DeepKa reproduced experimental pKa orders of acidic dyads in five enzyme catalytic sites. Apart from structural proteins, DeepKa was found applicable to intrinsically disordered peptides. Further, in combination with solvent exposures, it's revealed that DeepKa offers the most accurate prediction under the challenging circumstance that hydrogen bonding or salt bridge interaction is partly compensated by desolvation for a buried side chain. Finally, our benchmark data qualify PHMD549 and EXP67S as the basis for future developments of protein pKa prediction tools driven by artificial intelligence.

A wide variety of chemoenzymatic and fully enzymatic methods have been reported over the last 30 years to integrate the cofactor regeneration in biocatalytic oxidations. However, the most examples are limited to homogeneous systems where the reuse of both enzymes and chemical catalysts are challenging. In this work, we co-immobilized an alcohol dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus with a flavin derivative (FMN), which performs as an organocatalyst that oxidizes NADH back to NAD+. This latter oxidized cofactor is sequentially utilized by the dehydrogenase to oxidize 1,\uf077-diols. Remarkably, the immobilization chemistry of the FMN determines its efficiency to recycle the nicotinamide cofactor and, unlike in its free state, the immobilized FMN can oxidizes NADH in dark. This was possible because the support where both enzyme and FMN are immobilized also captures NADH, and makes the electron transfer from the substrates to the cofactors more efficient. This work illustrates how the co-immobilization and confinement of bio and chemical catalysts on solid materials (heterogeneous system) enable chemoenzymatic cascades that are precluded in solution (homogeneous system).", "date": "2023-01-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Biocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Furthermore, the mixing time of organic molecules in a 200 nm phenolic SOA particle exceeds 1 h above 3 km in the troposphere, which has implications for the long-range transport of pollutants.", "date": "2023-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Chemical crosslinking and in situ polymerization have been suggested to increase the membrane rigidity and dispersion stability of lipid vesicles.

Here we present highly robust multilamellar lipid vesicles through the self-assembly of pre-formed, cationic large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with hydrolyzed collagen peptides (HCPs). The cationic LUVs undergo vesicle-to-vesicle attachment and structural reorganization through polyionic complexation with HCPs, resulting in the formation of multilamellar collagen-lipid vesicles (MCLVs). The resulting MCLVs exhibit excellent structural stability against variations in pH and ionic strength and the addition of surfactants. Particularly, the MCLVs maintain their structural stability against repeated freeze-thaw stresses, proving the excellent stabilization effect of HCPs on lipid lamellar structures.

In this combined theoretical and experimental study, we investigate the use of heavy atoms in the form of trimethylsilyl groups as a tool to reduce the intensity of the vibrations in the 2-phenylpyridinato ligands of emissive iridium(III) complexes that contribute to the vibrationally coupled modes that broaden the emission profile. An underutilised computational technique, Frank-Condon vibrationally coupled electronic spectral modelling, was used to identify the key vibrational modes that contribute to the broadening of the emission spectra in known benchmark green-emitting iridium(III) complexes. Based on these results, a family of eight new green-emitting iridium complexes containing trimethylsilyl groups substituted at different positions of the cyclometalating ligands has been prepared to explore the impact that these substituents have on reducing the intensity of the vibrations and the resulting reduction in the contribution of vibrationally coupled emission modes to the  shape of the emission spectra. We have demonstrated that locating a trimethylsilyl group at the N4 or N5 position of the 2-phenylpyridine ligand damps the vibrational modes of the iridium complex and provides a modest narrowing of the emission spectrum of 8-9 nm (or 350 cm-1). The strong correlation between experimental and calculated emission spectra highlights the utility of this computational method to understand how the vibrational modes contribute to the profile of the emission spectra in phosphorescent iridium(III) emitters.

Our results show that acetone and methanol dispersion solvents interact differently with the perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomer Aquivion, which is composed of hydrophobic backbones and hydrophilic ionic heads. Acetone solvates more with the hydrophobic backbones in the PFSA compared to methanol. Consequently, the ionomer film fabricated from casting Aquivion and acetone mixture on a flat surface is more continuous and hydrophobic than its methanol counterpart. Such ionomer-solvent interaction also leads to a more uniform and flooding-tolerant GDE when producing the copper catalyst layer with acetone (acetone-CL) compared to methanol (methanol-CL). As a result, acetone-CL yields higher selectivity to C2+ products at high current density, up to 29 % greater than methanol-CL at 500 mA cm-2. Ethylene is the primary product for both CLs, reaching 47.5  4.0 % and 43.9  5.5 % at 300 mA cm-2 for acetone-CL and methanol-CL, respectively.

We report that dicationic relatives of guanidinium can be conveniently synthesised in a two-step one-pot procedure from tetramethylurea. Triflic anhydride is used to generate an isouronium intermediate. Substitution of the bound triflate with pyridines yield the dicationic tetramethyldiiminium bis(triflate) nucleophile adducts (TMDINu).

The observation of a chelation effect in the 2,2\u2019-bipyridine adducts supports Lewis acidic character of the diiminium \u03c0-system and flexibility towards accepting another bond. High fluoride, hydride, and oxide affinities are demonstrated, leading to their classification as soft and hard Lewis superacids.

Within this work we highlight the importance of two crucial terms, other than orbital energies, that contribute to the excitation energies and show how to quantify them from quantum chemistry computations: an attractive Coulomb and a repulsive exchange interaction. Using this framework, we explain under which circumstances the lowest excited state of a molecule, of either singlet or triplet multiplicity, is not accessed via the HOMO/LUMO transition and show two paradigmatic examples. In the case of the push-pull molecule ACRFLCN we highlight how the lowest triplet excited state is a locally excited state lying below the HOMO/LUMO charge transfer state due to enhanced Coulomb binding.In the case of the naphthalene molecule, we highlight how the HOMO/LUMO transition (the 1L_a state) becomes the second excited singlet state due to its enhanced exchange repulsion term.

Non-sewered sanitation (NSS) systems have the potential to provide safely managed sanitation and achieve strict wastewater treatment standards. One such NSS treatment (backend) technology is the NEWgeneratorTM, which includes an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR), nutrient recovery via ion exchange, and electrochlorination. Although the system has been shown to achieve robust treatment of real waste streams for over 100 users, the technology\u2019s relative life cycle sustainability across deployment locations remains unclear. This study characterizes the financial viability and life cycle environmental impacts of the NEWgeneratorTM and prioritizes opportunities to advance system sustainability through targeted improvements and deployment. The costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the NEWgeneratorTM (general case) leveraging grid electricity were 0.139 [0.113 \u2013 0.168] USD\u00b7cap-1\u00b7d-1 and 79.7 [55.0 \u2013 112.3] kg CO2-eq\u00b7cap-1\u00b7yr-1, respectively.

Examining targeted improvements revealed the relative change in median cost and GHG emissions to be -21% and -3% if loading is doubled (i.e., doubled users per unit), -30% and -12% with additional sludge drying, and +9% and -25% with the addition of a membrane contactor, respectively, with limited benefits (0-5% reductions) from an alternative photovoltaic battery, low-cost housing, or improved frontend operation.

To design feasible data-driven workflows it is necessary to estimate the value of information and balance it with the number of experiments and resources required. Basing this kind of workflow on actual physical models appears to be a more feasible strategy as compared to data-extensive empirical statistical methods. Here we show an algorithm that constructs and evaluates kinetic models of different complexity. The algorithm facilitates the evaluation of the experimental data quality and quantity requirements needed for reliable discovery of the rates driving the corresponding chemical models. The influence of the quality and quantity of data on the obtained results was indicated by the accuracy of the estimates of the kinetic parameters. We also show that this method can be used to find correct reaction scenarios directly from simulated kinetic data with little to no overfitting. Well-fitting models for theoretical data can then be used as a proxy for optimizing the underlying chemical systems. Taking real physical effects into account, this approach goes beyond: we show that with the kinetic models one can make a direct, unbiased, quantitative connection between kinetic data and the reaction scenario.

However, their practical development is greatly plagued by the challenge that high-temperature annealing (> 700 \u00b0C) has to be used for realizing disorder-order phase transition (DOPT) due to the high activation barrier (Ea), which always leads to severe particle sintering, morphology change, and makes it highly challenging for gram-scale preparation of desirable PtM iNCs. Here, we report a general low-melting-point metal induced bond strength weakening strategy to promote DOPT of PtM (M = Ni, Fe, Cu, Zn) alloy catalysts.

X-ray spectroscopic studies, in-situ electron microscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the Sn-facilitated DOPT mechanism at record-low temperature involves the weakened bond strength and reduced Ea via Sn doping, the formation and fast diffusion of low coordinated surface free atom, and subsequent L10 nucleation.

However, such contradictory mechanisms underlying H2A oxidation are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery of Fe leaching during catalytic H2A oxidation using Fe-N-C nanozyme as a ferritin mimic and its influence in selectivity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the heterogeneity, Fe-Nx sites in Fe-N-C primarily catalyzed the H2A oxidation and 4e ORR via an iron-oxo intermediate; meanwhile marginal N-C sites catalyzed the 2e ORR via an O2 intermediate with H2O2 production, although which was less favorable in kinetics and hardly observable in the early stage. Nonetheless, trace O2 accumulated and attacked Fe-Nx sites, leading to a linear leakage of unstable Fe ions up to 420 ppb when the concentration of H2A increased. As a result, a substantial fraction (~40%) of N-C sites on Fe-N-C were activated, and a new path for Fenton-type H2A oxidation was finally enabled. After Fe ions diffused into the bulk solution, the ORR at the N-C sites stopped at H2O2 production, which was the origin for the pro-oxidant effect by H2A. This work highlights the Fe-leakage occurring on Fe-N-C nanozymes and uncovers the multifaceted insights of ORR selectivity in H2A oxidation under realistic conditions.\n\n", "date": "2023-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Biocatalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms; Redox Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A more detailed structural information is fundamental to improve our understanding of their influence on petroleum properties.

In this work, we present a new methodology for profiling such compounds by liquid-liquid extraction and selective derivatization using 4-bromo-N-methylbenzylamine (4-BNMA) followed by liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Orbitrap HRMS). The fragmentation of 4-BNMA derivatives produces a pair of unique product ions, m/z 169 and 171, which enables the identification of chromatographic sections containing carboxylic acids. The mass spectra of these fractions are extracted, with the acids further computationally isolated based on the unique isotope pattern from the incorporated bromine atom. The method was optimized and validated using seven acid standards and designs of experiments (DOEs), assuring robustness and sensitivity for non-target screening purposes. This method successfully detected up to 380 carboxylic acids in six Danish North Sea crude oil, with up to two carboxyl groups and other heteroatom functionalities.

Recent successes in bioconjugation chemistry have inspired the search for more biocompatible chemical reactions, which has prompted us to investigate Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) olefinations, iconic reactions used widely in organic synthesis that would give rise to new selective protein olefinations. Our choice of HWE olefinations was inspired by the growing number of methods for the generation of aldehydes as transient reactive groups in proteins and the potential for mild and simple reaction conditions. Here we show that HWE on aldehydes produced by both chemical and enzymatic methods is fully compatible with physiological conditions and highly selective in small and large proteins, including therapeutic antibodies.  By exploiting the wide range of easily accessible HWE reagents provided by organic chemistry, we show that the reaction kinetics can be fine-tuned over orders of magnitude by judicious use of substituents. The electrophilic nature of the HWE products can be tuned to allow for subsequent nucleophilic additions, including thiol- and phospha-Michael additions, enabling two-step dual labelling strategies. Our results demonstrate that HWE olefination of aldehydes in proteins provide efficient and selective bioconjugation chemistries that are orthogonal to existing methods.", "date": "2023-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Seeded CdSe@CdS nanorods have shown increasing performance with increasing rod length. This observation was rationalized by the increasing lifetime of the separated charges, as a large distance between holes localized in the CdSe seed and electrons localized at the metal tip decreases their recombination rate. However, the impact of nanorod length on electron-to-tip localization efficiency or pathway remained an open question. Therefore, we investigated the photo-induced electron transfer to the metal in a series of Ni tipped CdSe@CdS nanorods with varying length. We find that the transfer processes occurring from the region close to the semiconductor-metal interface, the rod region, and the CdSe seed region depend in different ways on the rods length. The rate of the fastest process from excitonic states generated directly at the interface is independent of the rod length but the relative amplitude decreases with increasing rod length as the weight of the interface region is decreasing. The transfer of electrons to the metal tip from excitons generated in the CdS rod region depends strongly on the length of the nanorods which indicates an electron transport limited process, i.e., electron diffusion towards the interface region followed by fast interface crossing. The transfer originating from CdSe excitonic states again shows no significant length dependence in its time constant as it is probably limited by the rate of overcoming the shallow confinement in the CdSe seed.", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In these domains, the  use of grand-canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) in combination with  implicit solvation models has become popular. GC-DFT can be conveniently applied not only to metallic surfaces, but also to semi-conducting oxides and sulfides and is, furthermore, sufficiently robust to achieve a consistent description of reaction pathways. However, the accuracy of implicit solvation models for solvation effects at interfaces is in general unknown. One promising way to overcome the limitations of implicit solvents is going towards hybrid quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) models. For capturing the electrochemical potential dependence, the key quantity is the capacitance, i.e., the relation between the surface charge and the electrochemical potential. In order to retrieve the electrochemical potential from a QM/MM hybrid scheme, an electrostatic embedding is required. Furthermore, the charge of the surface and of the solvent regions have to be strictly opposite in order to consistently simulate charge-neutral unit cells in MM and in QM. To achieve such a QM/MM scheme, we present the implementation of electrostatic embedding in the popular VASP code. This scheme is broadly applicable to any neutral or charged solid/liquid interface. Here, we demonstrate its use in the context of GC-DFT for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a noble-metal-free electrocatalyst, MoS2. We investigate the effect of electrostatic embedding compared to the implicit solvent model for three contrasting active sites on MoS2: (i) the sulfur vacancy defect which is rather apolar. (ii) an Mo anti-site defect, where the active site is a surface bound highly polar OH group and (iii) a reconstructed edge site which is generally believed to be responsible for most of the catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic embedding leads to almost indistinguishable results compared to the implicit solvent for apolar systems, but has a significant effect on polar sites. This demonstrates the reliability of the hybrid QM/MM, electrostatically embedded solvation model for electrified interfaces.", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, a lack of understanding of the fundamental underlying principles has long stymied our ability to fully harness the power of these interactions. Fortunately, advances in affordable computing power together with new quantum chemistry methods have increasingly enabled a detailed atomic-level view. Empowered by this more nuanced perspective, synthetic practitioners are now adopting these techniques with growing enthusiasm.\nIn this review, we narrate our recent results rooted in state-of-the-art quantum chemical computations, describing pivotal roles for electrostatic interactions in the organization of transition state (TS) structures to direct reactivity and selectivity in the realm of asymmetric organocatalysis. To provide readers with a fundamental foundation in electrostatics, we first introduce a few guiding principles, beginning with a brief discussion of electrostatic interactions and electrostatics-dominated non-covalent interactions as well as and their modulating factors. We then describe computational approaches to capture these effects, primarily through representative case studies. Subsequently, we cover some general strategies that have been utilized to impart stereocontrol in asymmetric organocatalysis, presenting our own results along with selected highlights from other groups. \nWe then briefly cover our most significant recent computational investigations in three specific branches of asymmetric organocatalysis, beginning with chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. We disclose how CPA-catalyzed asymmetric ring openings of meso-epoxides are driven by stabilization of a transient partial positive charge in the SN2-like TS by the chiral electrostatic environment of the catalyst. We also report on substrate-dependent electrostatic effects from our study of CPA-catalyzed intramolecular oxetane desymmetrizations. For non-chelating oxetane substrates, electrostatic interactions with the catalyst confers stereoselectivity, whereas oxetanes with chelating groups adopt a different binding mode that overrides this electrostatic stereodetermination and erodes selectivity. In another example, computational approaches revealed a pivotal role of CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and NH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding in CPA-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolinones. These interactions control selectivity during the enantiodetermining intramolecular amine addition step, and their strength is modulated by substrate positioning within the electrostatic environment created by the catalyst, allowing us to rationalize the effect of introducing o-substituents. Next, we describe our efforts to understand selectivity in a series of NHC-catalyzed kinetic resolutions. We discovered that electrostatic interactions are the common driver of selectivity. Finally, we discuss our breakthrough in understanding asymmetric silylium ion-catalyzed Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition of cinnamate esters to cyclopentadienes. The diastereoselectivity of these transformations is guided by CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O electrostatic interactions that selectively stabilize the endo-transition state. Additionally, we deduced the geometry of the preferred binding mode to explain the requirement for a 9-fluorenylmethyl ester to achieve high selectivity.\nWe conclude with a brief overview of the outstanding challenges and the potential roles of computational chemistry in enabling the exploitation of electrostatic interactions in asymmetric organocatalysis.\n", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we explore the possibility of combining the computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework and the demonstrated accuracy of the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential to train a DNN potential for large-scale simulations of water across its phase diagram. We find that the DNN potential is able to reliably reproduce the MB-pol results for liquid water but provides a less accurate description of the vapor-liquid equilibrium properties. This shortcoming is traced back to the inability of the DNN potential to correctly represent many-body interactions. An attempt to explicitly include information about many-body effects results in a new DNN potential that exhibits opposite performance, being able to correctly reproduce the MB-pol vapor-liquid equilibrium properties but losing accuracy in the description of the liquid properties. These results suggest that DeePMD-based DNN potentials are not able to correctly \"learn\" and, consequently, represent many-body interactions, which implies that DNN potentials may have limited ability to predict properties for state points that are not explicitly included in the training process. The computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework can still be exploited to train DNN potentials on data-driven many-body potentials, which can thus enable large-scale, \"chemically accurate\" simulations of various molecular systems, with the caveat that the target state points must have been adequately sampled by the reference data-driven many-body potential in order to guarantee a faithful representation of the associated properties.", "date": "2023-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Machine Learning; Physical and Chemical Properties; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Computer-assisted methods have been proven to be able to simulate the reaction mechanism at the atomic level of detail. However, these methods tend to be expensive to be used in a large scale as it is needed in protein engineering campaigns. To alleviate this situation, machine learning methods can help in the generation of predictive-decision models. Herein we train different regression algorithms for the prediction of the reaction energy barrier of the rate-limiting step of the hydrolysis of mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid by the MHETase of Ideonella sakaiensis. As training data set we use steered QM/MM MD simulation snapshots and their corresponding pulling work values. We have explored three algorithms together with three chemical representations. As outcome, our trained models are able to predict pulling works along the steered QM/MM MD simulations with a mean absolute error below 3 kcal mol-1 and a score value above 0.90. More challenging is the prediction of the energy maximum with a single geometry. Whereas the use of the initial snapshot of the QM/MM MD trajectory as input geometry yields a very poor prediction of the reaction energy barrier, the use of an intermediate snapshot of the former trajectory brings the score value above 0.40 with a low mean absolute error (ca. 3 kcal mol-1).

For polydisperse samples, this inversion problem, being a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, is ill-posed and is typically handled using cumulant expansions or regularization methods. Here, we introduce a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing the measured scattering intensity time autocorrelation data using both the cumulant expansion method and regularization methods, with the latter implemented using various commonly employed algorithms including NNLS, CONTIN, REPES, and DYNALS. Additionally, the GUI also enables a comparison of the size distributions generated by various algorithms and an evaluation of their performance.

However, existing methods are difficult to use in terms of practicality, pyrophoricity, and lack of scalability and applicability. Herein, we report the development of a lithium(0)-mediated mechanochemical anionic cyclodehydrogenation reaction for the first time. This reaction could be easily performed using a conventional and easy-to-handle lithium(0) wire at room temperature, even under air, and the reaction of 1,1-binaphthyl is complete within 30 min to afford perylene in 94% yield. Using this novel and user-friendly protocol, we investigated substrate scope, reaction mechanism, and gram-scale synthesis. As a result, remarkable applicability and practicality over previous methods, as well as limitations, were comprehensively studied by computational studies and NMR analysis.

Remarkably, these architectures show a dis-tinct difference in their porous features, e.g., JUC-621 with qtz net exhibits permanent mesopores (up to ~ 2.3 nm) and high surface area (~ 2060 m2 g-1), which far surpasses those of JUC-620 with dia net (pore size of ~1.2 nm  and surface area of 980 m2 g-1).

Deep generative models have recently emerged as a powerful method for generating novel therapeutic candidates from existing datasets; however, there has been less research focused on evaluating the search spaces associated with these generators from which they sample their new data-points.  In this research we employ five deep learning model architectures for de novo generation of antimicrobial peptide sequences and assess the properties of their associated latent spaces. We train a RNN, RNN with attention, WAE, AAE and Transformer model and compare their abilities to construct desirable latent spaces in 32, 64, and 128 dimensions.  We assess reconstruction accuracy, generative capability, and model interpretability and demonstrate that while most models are able to create a partitioning in their latent spaces into regions of low and high AMP sampling probability, they do so in different manners and by appealing to different underlying physicochemical properties. In this way we demonstrate several benchmarks that must be considered for such models and suggest that for optimization of search space properties, an ensemble methodology is most appropriate for design of new AMPs.

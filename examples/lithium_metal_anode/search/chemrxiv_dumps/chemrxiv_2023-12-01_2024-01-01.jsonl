Its optical principle is highly sensitive to thin layers, offering insights into diverse structural parameters such as surface area, pore size, and porosity. While existing setups rely on capillary condensation of volatile compounds (such as water), their applicability is typically restricted to pore dimensions < 50nm.

However, achieving high conversion over a wide operating temperature range while avoiding over-oxidation to NOx is a significant challenge. Commercial Pt catalysts have full NH3 conversion at low temperatures but suffer from low N2 selectivity. To mitigate this challenge, it is crucial to limit the over-oxidation of NH3. In this study, we developed a bi-metal surface catalyst with improved Pt atom efficiency. The PtSCuO/Al2O3 catalyst consists of Pt atoms on the surface of CuO nanoparticles. It achieves full NH3 conversion at 250 \u00b0C with WHSV of 600 mlNH3h-1g-1 which is 50 \u00b0C lower than the commercial Pt/Al2O3, and maintains high N2 selectivity through all temperature window (150-450 \u00b0C). At 200 \u00b0C, PtSCuO/Al2O3, exhibited a staggering 30-fold increase in activity compared to the commercial Pt/Al2O3. Operando XAFS studies reveal that the surface Pt atoms in PtSCuO/Al2O3 not only enhance the redox ability of Cu species but also alter the redox rate of Cu species, which improves the while reaction rate of the NH3-SCO reaction. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Pt sites and Cu sites in PtSCuO/Al2O3 contributes to improved selectivity via the internal selective catalytic reduction (i-SCR) route.

This study demonstrates that the recently developed condensed layer deposition (CLD) method can be used for depositing nanoscopic (sub-10 nm thick) titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers onto high surface area platinized carbon foam electrodes. Characterization of the overlayers by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) showed that the films are amorphous, while X-ray photoelectron microscopy confirmed that they exhibit a TiO2 stoichiometry. Electrodes were also characterized by hydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd) and carbon monoxide (CO) stripping, demonstrating that the Pt electrocatalysts remain electrochemically active after encapsulation. Additionally, copper underpotential deposition (Cuupd) measurements revealed that TiO2 overlayers are effective at blocking Cu2+ from reaching the TiO2/Pt buried interface and were used to estimate that between 43-98% of Pt surface sites were encapsulated.

Traditional methods of fabrication of drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) employ the random sequence form of linear PLGA to yield non-crosslinked polymeric NPs that form when the polymer nanoprecipitates out of solution. Given the large-scale use of PLGA-based polymeric drug delivery systems to date, it is crucial to be able to control the ratio and sequence of lactic and glycolic components in the overall drug delivery system, which in turn can impact factors such as stability, drug loading, drug release and degradability. In this work, we present a novel PLGA-inspired NP polymerization technique, which allows the formation of NPs via the cross-linking of precisely sequenced short oligolactoglycolic acid dimethacrylates (OLGADMAs). Following the synthesis of a range of OLGADMAs we successfully generated a library of NPs via this rapid and surfactant-free nanopolymerization method, which permits the simultaneous NP formation and encapsulation of drugs such as dexamethasone. Our results indicate that NPs produced through this nanopolymerization technique with precisely controlled sequences exhibit heightened stability compared to conventionally sequenced and non-sequence controlled PLGA, as evidenced by minimal pH changes over a five-week span. This improved stability is attributed to simultaneous crosslinking and co-polymerization of the OLGADMAs. Moreover, the long-acting NPs demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity and uniform cellular uptake in vitro. We conclude that the ability to precisely regulate the sequence of short PLGA-inspired monomers and employ a unique in situ nanopolymerizing reaction results in exceptionally stable NPs for sustained drug delivery and opens exciting possibilities for the development of a range of long-lasting drug delivery systems with programmable structure and function.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Controlled-Release Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The compressive moduli and stability of hydrogels in vitro were modelled using a response surface method, enabling to decouple biochemical and biophysical properties. As biological systems use mechanical forces to regulate several processes, from tissue regeneration to cancer development, we selected alginate-based hydrogels with compressive moduli of breast tissues (1-20 kPa) model different stages of breast cancer development in vitro, and as new drug screening technologies. Human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were cultured on several hydrogels and as different in vitro models (i.e., 3D models and 2.5D models). All hydrogels are cytocompatible, allowing cells growth up to 1 week. We selected 2.5D in vitro models to investigate the correlation between drug efficacy and microenvironment/ECM stiffness, as more similar to standard 2D in vitro models (i.e., 2D/TCP). We selected doxorubicin as models drug, as first-line treatment for breast cancer.

Mechanism studies reveal that this asymmetric electron migration environment and hybrid n-\u03c0*, \u03c0-\u03c0* instincts serve an afterglow and radical radiance at ambient conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate the applications of colorful CPPL for displays and encryptions via manipulation of both excitation and observation time.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Aggregates and Assemblies; Optical Materials; Physical and Chemical Properties; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For this, Porous Boron Nitride (PBN)-PBN 950 and PBN 1050 at two different porosities with low (high) and high (low) specific surface area (SSA) and aspect ratio (AR) respectively, both composed of 2D porous flakes of quasi-crystalline BN of hexagonal phase, arranged in rod and flower pattern were obtained via gas-solid interaction at 950 and 1050oC respectively. Nanofluids of both PBNs in TO displayed a linear relationship between porosity and insulation characteristics with ~26-39 % rise in AC Breakdown Voltage along with Resistivity. It was explained by the role of nanofiller porosity in providing large interfacial zones and deep traps for quantitively scavenging and holding streamer charges at the oil-nanofiller interface. Further, despite of being quasi-crystalline and porous, both PBNs in TO upgraded the thermal properties by quasi-ballistic transfer of acoustic phonons via 2D flakes of hexagonal phase. However, the thermal conductivity varied inversely with porosity with ~ 32.5 - 28 % surge with PBN 950 and PBN 1050, respectively at 50oC. This trend was theoretically supported as well as explained due to the increase in phonon-defect scattering owing to the increase in porosity and pore asymmetry together with reduced AR in PBN 1050. Finally, the unchanged flash and pour points with negligible increase in acidity over months plus the aforementioned results at low filler fractions establishes the superiority of PBN over other BN nanofillers for applications in liquid insulation in future", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Ceramics; Thermal Conductors and Insulators; Nanofluidics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For example, the amount of adsorbed material, as a function of concentration of the material which is not adsorbed, obeys Langmuir's equation. In this paper we argue this relation is valid only for macroscopic (large enough) systems. However, when particle numbers of adsorbate molecules and/or adsorbing sites are small, Langmuir's model fails to describe the chemical equilibrium of the system. This is because the kinetics of forming, or the probability of observing, occupied sites arises from two-body interactions, and as such, ought to include cross-correlations between particle numbers of the adsorbate and adsorbing sites. The effect of these correlations, as reflected by deviations in predicting composition when correlations are ignored, increases with decreasing particle numbers and becomes substantial when only few adsorbate molecules, or adsorbing sites, are present in the system. In addition, any change that augments the fraction of occupied sites at equilibrium (e.g., smaller volume, lower temperature, or stronger adsorption energy) further increases the discrepancy between observed properties of small systems and those predicted by Langmuir's theory. In contrast, for large systems these cross-correlations become negligible, and therefore when expressing properties involving two-body processes, it is possible to consider independently the concentration of each component. By applying statistical mechanics concepts, we derive a general expression of the equilibrium constant for adsorption. It is also demonstrated that in ensembles in which total numbers of particles are fixed, the magnitudes of fluctuations in particle numbers alone, can predict the average chemical composition of the system. Moreover an alternative adsorption equation, predicting the average fraction of occupied sites from the value of the equilibrium constant, is proposed.

For example, the structural changes of a protein can often be followed with spectroscopic tools by utilizing such an interaction. Streptavidin-bound 5-(and-6)-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) biocytin is one of the few systems with which CPI can actually be observed via the fluorescence of TMR. While it has been suggested that the fluorescence is quenched when the ligand is bound to the binding pocket of streptavidin and is recovered after biotin occupies the binding pocket to replace TMR, no clear evidence has been provided yet. In order to gain a better understanding of this CPI, here we propose a possible binding site of TMR in the streptavidin, and predict the binding affinity values of biotin and the TMR moiety of TMR-biocytin conjugate. We estimate that the biotin affinity (-20.2 \u00b1 1.4 kcal/mol) is significantly higher than the TMR-biocytin affinity (-6.91 \u00b1 0.72 kcal/mol and -8.06 \u00b1 0.79 kcal/mol), which supports the earlier explanation on the fluorescence quenching and recovery of biotinylated dyes. We also discover that TMR cannot bind to the streptavidin pocket as perfectly as biotin does, but that it rather blocks the entrance portion of the binding pocket. Fluorescence quenching of TMR-biocytin by streptavidin is measured with time-resolved fluorescence to show that the average fluorescence lifetime of TMR-biocytin decreases from 3.54 ns to 2.54 ns in the presence of excess streptavidin. Based on the distance between TMR and the nearby tryptophan residues, we propose that the nearby tryptophan residues of streptavidin are the potential quenchers of the dye unit fluorescence.", "date": "2023-12-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the molecular factors influencing the performance of MOFs in capturing water from the air remain elusive. Among all MOFs, Ni2X2BTDD (X = F, Cl, Br) stands out as a promising water harvester due to its ability to adsorb substantial amounts of water at low relative humidity (RH). Here, we use advanced molecular dynamics simulations car- ried out with the state-of-the-art MB-pol data-driven many-body potential to monitor water adsorption in the three Ni2X2BTDD variants as a function of RH. Our simulations reveal that the type of halide atom in the three Ni2X2BTDD frameworks significantly influences the corresponding molecular mechanisms of water adsorption: while water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with the fluoride atoms in Ni2F2BTDD, they tend to form hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atoms of the triazolate linkers in Ni2Cl2BTDD and Ni2Br2BTDD. Importantly, the large size of the bromide atoms reduces the void volume in the Ni2Br2BTDD pores, which enable water molecules to initiate an extended hydrogen-bond network at lower RH. These findings not only underscore the prospect for precisely tuning structural and chemical modifications of the frameworks to optimize their interaction with water, but also highlight the predictive power of simulations with the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential.

In such cases, it becomes imperative to construct a training set that includes the most diverse, representative, and informative samples. Here, a novel regression tree-based active learning algorithm is employed for such a purpose. It is applied to predict band gap and adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of materials that results from the virtually infinite combinations of their building units. Simpler and low dimensional descrip- tors, such as the Stoichiometric-120 and geometric properties, found here to better represent MOFs in the low data regime, are used to compute the feature space for this model. The partition given by a regression tree constructed on the labeled part of the dataset is used to select new samples to be added to the training set, thereby limiting its size while maximizing the prediction quality. Through tests on the QMOF, hMOF, and dMOF data sets, we show that our method is effective in constructing small training data sets to learn regression models that predict well the target properties, thus reducing the label- ing cost. Specifically, our active learning approach is highly beneficial when labels are unevenly distributed in the descriptor space and when the label distribution is imbalanced, which is often the case for real world data.

Given 6PPD's application as an antioxidant in a wide array of rubber products and wastes, cost-effective measurement of 6PPD is important for product and waste management. We herein developed a naked-eye colorimetric method for the rapid measurement (<10 min) of 6PPD in rubber products and wastes with low cost (<$1 per sample). The inspiration for this method stems from the observation of the formation of red-colored products when 6PPD is exposed to oxidants, at concentrations as low as 0.65 mg/L. The remarkable selectivity of the method was evaluated by 15 other structurally diverse phenols and anilines. LC-UV and mass spectrometry results corroborated N-1,3-dimethyl butyl-N\u2019-phenyl quinone diamine (6QDI) as the primary oxidation product.

We further validated the method by applying it to the measurement of 6PPD in a wide array of rubber products and wastes, with 6PPD detected in 22 out of 50 samples.

Here we demonstrate a mixed-dimensionality 2D/1D/2D MoS2/SWCNT/WSe2 hetero-trilayer that enables ultrafast photoinduced exciton dissociation, followed by charge diffusion and slow recombination. Importantly, the hetero-trilayer serves to double charge carrier yield relative to a MoS2/SWCNT hetero-bilayer, and also demonstrates the ability of the separated charges to overcome inter-layer exciton binding energies to diffuse from one TMDC/SWCNT interface to the other 2D/1D interface, resulting in coulombically unbound charges. Interestingly, the hetero-trilayer also appears to enable ef- ficient hole transfer from SWCNTs to WSe2, which is not observed in the identically prepared WSe2/SWCNT heterobilayer, suggesting that new dynamic pathways may be opened up by increasing the complexity of nanoscale heterostructures.

Such formats help to ensure that results can be replicated and published. With the rise of digitalization, artificial intelligence has become increasingly important in combination with the scientific literature sources of data. This synergy serves as a foundation of robust models following central principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible,  Interoperable, Reusable) data. By having access to more precise data, it is reasonable to anticipate the development of improved models. Specifically, large neural networks have demonstrated a high level of responsiveness to the quality of the data used. Therefore, enhancing the data quality can potentially lead to a reduction in the size of neural networks. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven to be incredibly effective at replicating human tasks. This is a significant improvement that not only automatizes process but also leads to better results. By combining human and LLM assistance, we can produce higher-quality content and solve repetitive tasks that would otherwise take years to complete. Those generative AI assistants can follow instructions to transform and extrapolate existing text.  Our contribution outlines a method for automatically extracting experimental data of molecules from literature. Essentially by our prompt engineering, we demonstrate that this process can be made more cost-effective. Secondly, we use automated fact checking principles to ensure the original data quality as well as the data retrieval by LLM.

In this work, we address this challenge for aggregates of azobenzene, a prototypical molecular switch, performing on-the-fly surface hopping calculations combined with semiempirical configuration interaction electronic structure and augmented with transition density matrix analysis to characterize exciton evolution.

This excited-state localization process is extremely ultrafast, occuring within first 10 fs of photodynamics. We observe virtually no exciton transfer of the localized excitons in the n\u03c0* manifold. However, the transfer may occur via secondary pathways involving \u03c0\u03c0* states or the ground state.

We demonstrate that the dependence of \u03b3SL on the applied surface charge exhibits an asymmetric behaviour relative to the neutral surface.

On the contrary, at negative potential bias, \u03b3SL shows a weaker response to the charging of the electrode. Changes in \u03b3SL greatly affect the total areal capacitance predicted by the Young-Lippmann equation but have negligible impact on the simulated total areal capacitance indicating that the EDL structure is not directly correlated with the wettability of the surface and different interfacial mechanisms drive the two phenomena. The proposed model is validated experimentally by studying the electrowetting response of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations.

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs), classically applied for metal removal from water, as a therapeutic strategy for depleting intracellular labile copper pools in triple negative breast cancer models through the metal-chelating groups present on PDA surface. By using the activity-based sensing probe FCP-1, we could track the PDA-induced labile copper depletion while leaving total copper levels unchanged, and link it to the selective MDA-MB-231 cell death. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that PDA NPs increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, potentially through the inactivation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a copper-dependent antioxidant enzyme. Additionally, PDA NPs were found to interact with the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, which may contribute to enhanced ROS production. We employed an in vivo tumor model to validate the therapeutic efficacy of PDA NPs.  Remarkably, in the absence of any additional treatment, the presence of PDA NPs alone led to a significant reduction in tumor volume by a factor of 1.66 after 22 days of tumor growth. Our findings highlight the potential of PDA NPs as a promising therapeutic approach for selectively targeting cancer by modulating copper levels and inducing oxidative stress, leading to tumor growth inhibition as shown in these triple negative breast cancer models.

Neuroinflammation is majorly caused by activating the brain\u2019s residential macrophage cells called microglia, which increases the generation of reactive species including nitric oxide via the iNOS pathway. In addition, NO regulates lysosomal functions and exhibits complex effects on lysosomal machinery to neutralize foreign pathogens through phagocytosis and improve host-defense inflammatory response. To date, lack of efficient probes to monitor lysosomal NO and phagocytosis processes in the least explored human microglia during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, a unique design strategy was adopted for the first time by avoiding the conventional control amination reaction approach to develop lysosomal specific-NO probe, PDM-NO, which can discriminate activated microglia from its resting state. The non-fluorescent probe at physiological pH exhibits turn-on response towards NO only at lysosomal pH (4.5-5.5). PDM-NO demonstrated lysosomal specificity in activated HMC3 cells and enabled monitoring phagocytosis process with a several advantages compared to commercial E. coli bio-particles. Moreover, this probe can effectively map the overexpression and dynamics of lysosomal NO levels against SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus-induced neuroinflammation in HMC3. Thus, lysosome-specific PDM-NO is a potential fluorescent marker for detecting RNA virus infection in human microglia and excellent molecular probe for monitoring phagocytosis during neuroinflammation.

A dissociative mechanism is thermodynamically favored over an associative one, with the formation of a metaphosphate transition state and direct participation of water solvent molecules.

Here we study the nucleation and growth of CuPd icosahedra and their consecutive assembly into extended closed-packed face-centered cubic (fcc) supercrystals.

The supercrystal formation as well as their disassembly are triggered by temperature. Our study demonstrates that depletion effects can be crucial in the direct synthesis of supercrystals.

Ongoing research endeavours and clinical investigations continually unveil the vast potential of porphyrin-based PDT in combatting a wide range of diseases, spanning from cancer and infections to viral ailments. Furthermore, porphyrins hold promise in addressing drug-resistant cancers and antimicrobial resistance through non-invasive PDT, offering efficient alternatives to commercially available PDT drugs. In the context of advanced cancer management, porphyrin-based PDT offers the prospect of combinatorial therapy, enabling a sequence of immunogenic post-PDT actions that can effectively overcome anticancer resistance and tackle metastatic cancers. The future of PDT appears promising, with porphyrin scaffolds expected to play pivotal roles in advancing this field.", "date": "2023-12-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we find, surprisingly, that the effective catalytic activity towards ethylene improves when there is a larger fraction of less active sites acting as reservoirs of *CO on the surface of Cu nanoparticle electrocatalysts. In an adaptation of chemical transient kinetics to electrocatalysis, we measure the dynamic response of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) cell when the feed gas is abruptly switched between Ar (inert) and CO. When switching from the Ar to CO, CO reduction (COR) begins promptly, but when switching from CO to Ar, COR can be maintained for several seconds (delay time), despite the absence of the CO reactant in the gas phase. A three-site microkinetic model captures the observed dynamic behavior and shows that Cu catalysts exhibiting delay times have a less active *CO reservoir that exhibits fast diffusion to active sites. The observed delay times and the estimated *CO reservoir sizes are affected by catalyst preparation, applied potential, and microenvironment (electrolyte cation identity, electrolyte pH, and CO partial pressure). Notably, we estimate that the *CO reservoir surface coverage can be as high as 88\u00b17% on oxide-derived (OD-Cu) at high overpotentials (-1.52 V vs. SHE) and that increases in reservoir coverage coincide with increased turnover frequencies to ethylene. We also estimate that *CO can travel substantial distances (up to 10s of nm) prior to desorption or reaction. It appears that active C-C coupling sites, by themselves, do not control selectivity to C2+ products in electrochemical COR; the supply of CO to those sites is also a crucial factor. More generally, the overall activity of Cu electrocatalysts cannot be approximated from linear combinations of individual site activities. Future designs must consider the diversity of the catalyst network and account for inter-site transportation pathways.", "date": "2023-12-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These extended path lengths also facilitate flow through measurements by avoiding congestion of the flow cell by protein aggregates. Despite the advantages presented by laser-based mid-IR spectroscopy of proteins, extraction of secondary structure information from spectra, especially in the presence of complex multi-component matrices with overlapping spectral features, remains an impediment that requires fine tuning of evaluation algorithms (e.g., band fitting, interpretation of second derivative spectra etc.).  Results: In this work, the use of multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) for the analysis of a chemical de- and renaturation experiment has been demonstrated, since this technique offers the second-order advantage of extracting spectral signatures and concentration profiles even in the presence of unknown, uncalibrated constituents. Furthermore, we exhibit a partial least squares regression (PLSR) based subtraction of matrix component spectra prior to MCR-ALS as a method to obtain secondary structure information even in the absence of reference spectra. These approaches are showcased using the online reaction monitoring of the titration of \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2-LG) in water against the surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and octaethylene glyol monododecyl ether (C12E8), using a commercially available laser-based IR spectrometer. Results for the automated PLSR correction plus MCR-ALS approach compare favorably to an MCR-ALS standalone approach using initial estimates as well as analysis of secondary structure using data processed with a manual baseline correction.  Significance: The herein described chemometric approach suggests a way to simplify the challenge of handling complex matrices in protein structure analysis by isolating the background from the protein contributions, prior to analysis via other soft-modelling techniques.

Free-energy calculations are primarily computed by utilizing classical molecular dynamics simulations based on all-atom force fields (FF) to model the interactions in the system. Present standard classical all-atom FFs contain fixed partial charges on the atoms and hence electrostatic interactions are modeled between them. The parametrization process to determine these partial charges usually relies on quantum mechanics or semi-empirical calculations of the molecule in the gas phase or homogenous water surrounding. These present standard parametrization schemes of the partial charges neglect, therefore, polarization effects from the protein surrounding. The absence of protein polarization effects can lead to significant errors in free energy calculations in proteins. We present a parametrization scheme for the partial charges of ligands, named protein induced polarization (PIP) charges, which account for the electrostatic polarization due to the protein-surrounding. The scheme involves single-point quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations of the ligand charges in the protein/water surrounding. Using PIP ligand partial charges, we have calculated the relative binding free energies (RBFEs) of well-studied protein-ligand systems. We show here that RBFEs computed with PIP charges are either significantly improved or at least comparable to those computed with non-polarized standard GAFF charges. Overall, we present a simple-to-use parametrization scheme to include protein polarization in any type of binding free energy calculations. The parametrization scheme increases accuracy in RBFE calculations while it does not add significant computation time to standard parametrization procedures.

Here, we report the design, chemical synthesis, and biological evaluation of the regeneration capacity of a PSK-like peptide library. Our set of thirteen PSK analogues included N-terminal modifications, amino acid substitutions, incorporation of diastereomers, and backbone N-methylation.

Although various types of perfluoroalkylation reagents have been developed, the established nucleophilic perfluoroalkylation reagents have faced certain limitations. This work aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel nucleophilic perfluoroalkylation reagent, known as 4-pyridyl perfluoroalkyl sulfide (4-PySRf), which demonstrates a distinctive mechanism of perfluoroalkyl anion release based on the N-boryl pyridyl anion chemistry developed in our research group. In the presence of a diboron(4) compound and an alcoholate base, the 4-PySRf reagent efficiently undergoes perfluoroalkyl transfer reactions with a range of electrophiles. Unique to this reagent, compared to established nucleophilic perfluoroalkylation reagents, is its suitability for the effective transfer of functionalized perfluoroalkyl groups, as well as for intramolecular perfluoroalkylation reactions. Meanwhile, the 4-PySRf reagent exhibits excellent chemical stability, making it an ideal precursor for multi-step synthetic sequences. These attributes offer a robust strategy for synthesizing complex molecules incorporating perfluoroalkyl groups.

The software package Chemprop implements the D-MPNN architecture, and offers simple, easy, and fast access to machine-learned molecular properties. Compared to its initial version, we present a multitude of new Chemprop functionalities such as the support of multi-molecule properties, reactions, atom/bond-level properties, and spectra. Further, we incorporate various uncertainty quantification and calibration methods along with related metrics, as well as pretraining and transfer learning workflows, improved hyperparameter optimization, and other customization options concerning loss functions or atom/bond features. We benchmark D-MPNN models trained using Chemprop with the new reaction, atom-level and spectra functionality on a variety of property prediction datasets, including MoleculeNet and SAMPL, and observe state-of-the-art performance on the prediction of water-octanol partition coefficients, reaction barrier heights, atomic partial charges, and absorption spectra.

The probes are minimally perturbative, the nitrile stretching mode appears in an otherwise uncongested spectral region, and the spectra report on the local environment around the probe. Nitrile frequencies and lineshapes, however, are difficult to interpret, and theoretical models that connect local environments with vibrational frequencies are often necessary. However, the development of both more accurate and intuitive models remains a challenge for the community. The present work provides an experimentally consistent collection of experimental measurements, including IR absorption and ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra, to serve as a benchmark in the development of future models. Specifically, we catalog spectra of the nitrile stretching mode of methyl thiocyanate (MeSCN) in fourteen different solvents including non-polar, polar, and protic solvents. Absorption spectra indicate that \u03c0 interactions may be responsible for observed lineshape differences between aromatic and aliphatic alcohols. We also demonstrate that a recent Kamlet-Taft formulation describes the center frequency MeSCN. Further, we report cryogenic infrared spectra that may lead to insights into the peak asymmetry in aprotic solvents. 2D IR spectra measured in protic solvents serve to connect hydrogen bonding to static inhomogeneity.

The carbonyl molecules occupied high relative abundance (45%-70%) in six different types of dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples.

While noble metals are used extensively as catalysts for transfer hydrogenation, one major challenge for their deployment is related to their sustainability. In this work, we synthesized mixed-metal oxides of earth-abundant Co and Ni. We characterized these catalysts using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and tested their reactivity for CTH of acetophenone. Among the catalysts we tested, we noted that the spinel NiCo2O4 demonstrated the highest conversion of acetophenone (75%) and highest selectivity for ethylbenzene (90%), so we applied it to valorization of switchgrass lignin extracted under mild operating conditions by cosolvent enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation (CELF). The catalytically depolymerized lignin showed an increase in selectively deoxygenated monomeric compounds. Using 2D-NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated the lignin displayed highly reduced aliphatic carbons resulting from the reduction reaction at the C\u03b1 sites mediated by our catalyst material.

Apart from the acute condition, an association of photosensitive events and an increased risk of skin cancer have been repeatedly reported. However, photosensitizing properties of drugs and chemical compounds are also deliberately utilized as a treatment modality, for example as photodynamic therapy in oncology. While certain chemical features have been shown to induce photosensitivity more frequently, the matter is still not conclusively understood and commonly used photobiological assays are discussed to be affected by several limitations. In the present work we investigated the feasibility of predicting photosensitizing effects of drugs and chemical compounds via state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based workflows.\nMethods: A dataset of 2,200 drugs was used to train three distinct models (logistic regression, XGBoost, and a deep learning model) to predict photosensitizing attributes based on the SMILES string. Labels were obtained from a list of previously published photosensitizers resulting in 205 photosensitizing drugs. Data was partitioned using an 80/10/10 training-validation-test split by molecular scaffold. External evaluation of the different models was performed using the tox21 dataset and included a technical interpretation of prediction scores as well as a pharmacological interpretation.\nResults: ROC-AUC ranged between 0.8939 (deep learning model) and 0.9525 (XGBoost) during training, while in the test partition it ranged between 0.7785 (deep learning) and 0.7927 (XGBoost). The models were employed to facilitate predictions on the external validation set. Analysis of the top 200 compounds of each model resulted in 55 overlapping molecules. Fifteen of those were fluoroquinolones, a class of commonly reported photosensitizers. Prediction scores in this subset corresponded well with culprit substructures suspected of mediating photosensitizing effects.\nDiscussion: All three models appeared capable of predicting photosensitizing effects of chemical compounds. However, compared to the simpler model (logistic regression) the complex models (XGBoost and Chemprop) appeared to be more confident in their predictions as exhibited by their distribution of prediction scores. The evaluation of the models on external data further solidified the feasibility of molecular property prediction for photosensitizing abilities. A qualitative analysis of fluoroquinolones in the external dataset based on available photobiological evidence showed that their prediction scores corresponded well with their chemical structure.\n", "date": "2023-12-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While prevalent black-box methods like density functional theory (DFT) and coupled-cluster theory (e.g., CCSD(T)) have significantly advanced our understanding of chemical reactivity, they frequently fall short in accurately describing multiconfigurational transition states and intermediates. Achieving a more accurate description necessitates the use of multireference methods. However, these methods have not been used at scale due to their often-faulty predictions without expert input. Here, we overcome this deficiency through the use of automated multiconfigurational pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) calculations. We apply this method to 908 automatically generated main-group organic reactions. We find that 68% of these reactions present significant multiconfigurational character, in which the automated multiconfigurational approach often provides a more accurate and/or efficient description than DFT and CCSD(T). This work presents the first high-throughput application of automated multiconfigurational methods to chemical reactivity, and is enabled by automated active space selection algorithms and the computation of electronic correlation with the on-top functionals of MC-PDFT. The combination of these two new developments can be used in a black-box fashion, avoiding significant active space inconsistency error in both single- and multireference cases and providing accurate multiconfigurational descriptions when needed.", "date": "2023-12-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here we present a new approach to creating highly selective recognition surfaces using phage display biopanning against metal-organic nanosheets (MONs) and demonstrate their use as the next-generation of biomolecular recognition surfaces. Three MONs (ZIF-7, ZIF-7-NH2 and Hf-BTB-NH2) were chosen as initial targets to demonstrate how simple synthetic modifications can enhance selectivity towards specific amino acid sequences. Each MON system was added to a solution containing every possible combination of 7-residue peptides attached to bacteriophage hosts and the highest affinity binding peptides for each system was identified via successive biopanning rounds. In each case only a single peptide sequence was isolated (YNYRNLL \u2013 ZIF-7, NNWWAPA \u2013 ZIF-7-NH2 and FTVRDLS \u2013 Hf-BTB-NH2). This indicates that these MONs are highly selective, which is attributed to their 2D nanosheet structure. Zeta potential and contact angle measurements were conducted on each MON and combined with calculated properties for the peptide sequences and binding studies to provide insights into the relative importance of electrostatic, hydrophobic and co-ordination bonding interactions. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to model phage binding and the Hf-BTB-NH2 MON coated QCM produced a 5-fold higher signal for FTVRDLS functionalised phage compared to phage with generic peptide sequences. Further studies focusing on Hf-BTB-NH2 confirmed that the VRDL sequence was highly conserved, and on-target binding exhibited equilibrium dissociation constants that are comparable to natural recognition materials. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies indicated a 4600-fold higher equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for FTVRDLS compared to those obtained for off-target sequences, comparable to those of antibodies (KD = 4 x10-10).

Archaeal bipolar lipids are among the most unusual lipids occurring in nature because of their presumed ability to span the entire membrane.

Here we have utilized synthesis to enable in-depth biophysical investigations on a series of archaeal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids having symmetric or unsymmetric combinations of polar head groups. We showed that these lipids self-assemble to form membrane-bound vesicles in aqueous media, encapsulate polar molecules, and reconstitute a functional integral membrane protein. Membrane thicknesses and electron density profiles were investigated by performing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging on unilamellar vesicles of GDGT lipids. SAXS studies on bulk aqueous dispersions of GDGT lipids over a large temperature range (10-90 \u00b0C) allowed us to identify lamellar and non-lamellar phases and their interconversions under various buffer conditions. We also studied how the propensity to form various mesophases is reflected in the functional behavior of the GDGT membranes. Specifically, we asked whether vesicles overwhelmingly composed of GDGTs can undergo fusion as it is difficult to conceptualize such behavior with the assumption that such membranes have a monolayer structure. Interestingly, we observed that GDGT vesicles undergo fusion with influenza virus with lipid mixing kinetics comparable to that with vesicles composed of typical monopolar phospholipids.

Herein, we introduce a general synthesis route to amorphous MOFs by making use of a vapor diffusion method, which allows to precisely control the growth kinetics. Twenty-two different amorphous MOF colloids were successfully synthesized by selecting 11 metal ions and 17 organic ligands. Moreover, by introducing pre-formed core-nanoparticles (NPs), a conformal and homogeneous amorphous MOFs coating with controllable thickness can be grown on core-NPs to form core-shell colloids. The versatility of this amorphous coating technology was demonstrated by synthesizing over 100 new core-shell composites from 19 amorphous MOF shells and over 30 different core-NPs. Besides, various multifunctional nanostructures, such as conformal yolk-amorphous MOF shell, core@metal oxides, and core@carbon, can be obtained through one-step transformation of the core@amorphous MOFs. This work significantly enriches the St\u00f6ber method and introduces a platform, enabling the systematic design of colloids exhibiting different level of functionality and complexity.

CO2 RR over single atom catalysts (SAC) is widely known to result in chemical compounds such as carbon monoxide and formic acid that contain only one carbon atom (C1). Indeed, at least two active sites are commonly believed to be required for C-C coupling to synthesize compounds such as ethanol and propylene (C2+ ) from CO2 . However, experimental evidence suggests that Iron Phthalocyanine (PcFe), which possesses only a single metal center, can produce a trace amount of C2+ products. To the best of our knowledge, the mechanism by which C2+ products are formed over a SAC such as PcFe is still unknown. Using density functional theory (DFT), we analyzed the mechanism of CO2 RR to C1 and C2+ products over PcFe. Due to the high concentration of bicarbonate at pH=7, CO2 RR competes with HCO3 \u2013 reduction. Our computations indicate, that bicarbonate reduction is significantly more favourable. However, the rate of this reaction is influenced by H3 O+ concentration. For the formation of C2+ products, our computations reveals that C-C coupling proceeds through the reaction between in-situ formed CO and PcFe(\"0\")-CH2 or PcFe(\"-I\")-CH2 intermediates. This reaction step is highly exergonic and requires only low activation energies of 0.44 eV and 0.24 eV for PcFe(\"0\")-CH2 and PcFe(\"-I\")-CH2 . The DFT results, in line with experimental evidence, suggest that C2+ compounds are produced over PcFe at low potentials whereas CH4 is still the main post-CO product.", "date": "2023-12-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This is due to the absence of grain boundaries in these materials, which prevents the build-up of bulk crystallographic strain during electrochemical cycling. Compared to their polycrystalline counterparts, there is a need to study single-crystalline Ni-rich cathodes using operando X-ray methods in uncompromised machine-manufactured industry-like full cells to understand their bulk degradation mechanisms as a function of different electrochemical cycling protocols. This can help us identify factors to improve their long-term performance. Here, through in-house operando X-ray studies of pilot-line-built LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2\u2013Graphite A7 pouch cells, it is shown that their electrochemical capacity fade under harsh conditions (2.5\u20134.4 V and 40 \u00b0C for 100 cycles at C/3 rate) primarily stems from the high-voltage reconstruction of the cathode surface from a layered to a cubic (rock salt) phase that impedes Li+ kinetics and increases cell impedance. Post-mortem electron and X-ray microscopy show that these cathodes can withstand severe anisotropic structural changes and show no cracking when cycled under such conditions. Comparing these results to those from commercial Li-ion cells with surface-modified single-crystalline Ni-rich cathodes, it is identified that cathode surface passivation can mitigate this type of degradation and prolong cycle life. In addition to furthering our understanding of degradation in single-crystalline Ni-rich cathodes, this work also accentuates the need for practically relevant and reproducible fundamental investigations of Li-ion cells and presents a methodology for achieving this.

Here, we have used the mesoscopic numerical simulation technique, the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), in a D2Q9 framework to study the flow characteristics of a real shear thickening fluid through converging-diverging channels. In addition, we have developed a theory based on the lubrication assumptions in the shallow cross\u2013section of the channels. We compare the numerical results with the theoretical results for the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids through converging-diverging conical channels followed by uniform height channels. Numerical results indicate sizable differences in the pressure distribution in the converging-diverging regions. The difference in the theoretical calculations and numerical predictions depends on the viscosity and angle of the converging and diverging sections. Further, we compare the effect of the flow of a real STF through the above channels.  We find that the pressure drop is higher near the throat region than the uniform part of the channel, and consequently, shear rates are high. Due to that thickening, fluid flow happens in the throat region, which gets further displaced towards the outlet of the channel. The theory also gives approximately similar predictions as found by the LBM study.", "date": "2023-12-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Among the different methods, the most popular docking strategy, semi-flexible docking (rigid-receptor and flexible-ligand model), ignores the conformational changes of proteins. When the binding interaction between ligands and proteins adheres to an \"induced-fit\" paradigm, fully flexible methods such as molecular dynamics simulation are needed, but they can be computationally demanding. In an effort to strike a balance between computational speed and precision, flexible docking techniques, as exemplified by AutoDock Vina and AutoDockFR, treat selected protein side chains as flexible parts. However, these methods are still not fast enough in high throughput virtual screening tasks, and some of the algorithms are not specifically optimized for flexible-receptor sampling. In this work, we propose DSDPFlex, an improved receptor-flexible docking method. We accelerated the flexible docking process using GPU parallelization. We also implemented optimizations with respect to sampling, scoring, and search space to prevent redundant search and false-positive solutions, to further improve the efficiency and accuracy. To estimate the performance of DSDPFlex, a cross-docking dataset was constructed. Upon cross-docking tests, DSDPFlex obtained a 19.1% top-1 success rate, which is higher than AutoDock Vina, and the average runtime is ~1 second per task, representing a ~250-fold acceleration with respect to Vina. The generalizability of the method is validated on other commonly used test sets; the adaptability to different systems is also discussed. With improvement in both speed and accuracy, DSDPFlex is expected to show potential in docking-based studies.", "date": "2023-12-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this pursuit, eight traditional and understudied SARS-CoV-2 viral targets like the main protease (Mpro), RNA polymerase (RdRp), Envelope protein (Evp), Receptor binding domain (S-RBD), Human receptor angiotensin (hACE2), Spike protein, uridine specific endoribonuclease (nsp15) and capping protein (nsp16) are selected.

In fact, these sets of small natural product molecules highlight similar or greater binding affinity with multiple proteins compared to traditional-approved drugs like Ramdesivir, Nirmatrelvir and Molnupiravir. Based on the ADMET profiling, it can be verified that these sets of natural products exhibit the optimal pharmacokinetic parameters.

In solution, the equilibrium between the [3+3] and the less reported [2+2] macrocycle was investigated, and both macrocycles were fully characterised. Solvent templating during crystallisation was used to form new packing motifs for the [3+3] macrocycle and an unreported [4+4] macrocycle.

However, due to the complicated chemical pathways involved, achieving high selectivity and efficiency towards specific reduction products remains challenging. In fact, the design of more selective and efficient catalysts often relies on trial-and-error approaches, which are very time consuming and resource intensive.  In response, driven by the inherent importance of CO adsorption energy in the conversion of CO2 into C2+ hydrocarbons and alcohols, we propose a two-step approach employing machine learning classification and regression algorithms to predict CO binding energies on CuM(111)/(100) (M = Al, Ti, V, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Nb, Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hf, W, Ir, Pt, Au) bimetallic surfaces. Firstly, we assess the stability of each adsorption site by utilizing classification algorithms. Subsequently, focusing exclusively on the stable sites, we employ regression models to predict the adsorption energies of CO. Remarkably, by employing a Gradient Boosting Classifier and Neural Networks for classification, together with a Gradient Boosting Regressor for regression, we predict CO binding energies with high level of robustness and accuracy for Cu bimetallic alloys with up to 17% of surface impurity concentrations. The accuracy of our models is demonstrated by F1 scores exceeding 98% and MSE below 0.05 eV^2 for the classification and regression parts, respectively.

While most studies recognize the involvement of factors such as core composition, size, shape, and ligand chemistry in the effectiveness of Au NPs for radiation-induced cancer treatment, there is a scarcity of direct assessments that connect the photophysical properties of the nanomaterial with the observed cellular or biological outcomes.

The PDBbind, a widely used dataset, can be improved in this regard. This work presents an enhanced version of the PDBbind v.2020 refined set concerning structural preparation, a voxel representation of these structures suitable for DL model training and a diverse set of docking-generated poses that could be used to develop new scoring functions for pose prediction. We also introduce DockTGrid, a software library developed to generate these voxel representations, which can be adapted to create new molecular features. With this work, we aim to provide the CADD community with high-quality, accessible resources to facilitate the development of DL models for drug discovery.

A robust model of how protein structure determines emission color would greatly aid the engineering of red-shifted mutants, but no consensus has been reached to date. In this work, we apply deep mutational scanning to systematically assess twenty functionally important amino acid positions on FLuc for red-shifting mutations, predicting that an unbiased approach would enable novel contributions to this debate. We report dozens of red-shifting mutations as a result, a large majority of which have not been previously identified. Further characterization revealed that mutations L286V and T352M, in particular, cause pure red emission with much of the light being >600 nm. The red-shifting mutations identified by this high-throughput approach provide strong biochemical evidence for the multiple-emitter mechanism of color determination, and point to the importance of a water network in the enzyme binding pocket for altering the emitter ratio.

In this study, adhesive films made from dopamine (DA) and citric acid (CA) modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are presented. These films are exclusively derived from bio-based materials, following an environmentally friendly and easily reproducible process that is also scalable. They exhibit robust adhesion and easy detachment from various substrates, such as stainless steel (138 \u2013 191 kPa), particularly in the presence of moisture. In contrast to the extended degradation time of pure PVA, the composite films prepared in this study show accelerated degradation under anaerobic conditions. Notably, modified biofilms (P1DA1CA1, P1DA2CA1) exhibit superior degradation compared to conventional plastic PVA, with the exception of P1DA1CA2. The slower degradation in P1DA1CA2 is attributed to the higher acidic concentration contributed by citric acid. The study delves into the morphological changes of the prepared and degraded films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the degradation process is characterized through chromatographic techniques. The study suggests that dopamine (DA) and citric acid (CA) molecules penetrate the interplanar distance of P chains, as supported by powder X-ray diffraction studies, thereby expediting the degradation process. Additionally, the inclusion of CA enhances the stability of DA molecules against oxidation, increases H-bonding, and acts as a plasticizer. These synergistic interactions are further corroborated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), SEM, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile studies. The introduction of DA and CA imparts self-healing properties to the films due to the presence of multiple H-bonds. Tensile studies reveal that the strength of self-healed samples approaches that of pristine samples.

Nevertheless, the overall energy conversion efficiency achieved by metal oxide photoelectrodes has shown significant limitations because of their poor charge transport. In this regard, epitaxial BiVO4 thin film provides a suitable research platform for acquiring insights into the carrier dynamics and energy relaxation pathways. In this work, epitaxial BiVO4 thin films were prepared through a solution-based method combined with a rapid thermal annealing system. By systematically examining a series of annealing parameters, such as annealing temperature and heating ramp rate, and tracking the isothermal evolutions of epitaxial quality and film morphology, we establish a comprehensive model for transforming solution-derived BiVO4 films into epitaxial layers. In particular, the tendency of losing vanadium from BiVO4 at higher processing temperatures imposes an optimal annealing duration for obtaining highly compact films without pinholes. For BiVO4 films below 60 nm thickness, the solid-state epitaxial transformation is achieved in seconds; thicker films require a higher thermal budget and, thus, longer annealing times for the coarsening of heteroepitaxial grains to complete. The capability of this deposition method is exemplified by Mo- and Co-doped BiVO4 (001) films on YSZ (001), as well as the undoped BiVO4 (010) films grown on STO (001). The structural uniformities of these samples, prepared by the facile metal-organic decomposition method, are higher than the films prepared by vacuum-based techniques such as pulsed-laser deposition. We also identify the BiVO4 (010) film as more effective in harvesting photons from the solar spectrum than the BiVO4 (001) film.

Owing to their unique molecular structures, CNBs have intriguing properties with applications in synthetic materials, host\u2013guest chemistry, optoelectronics, and so on. Although a considerable number of CNBs with diverse forms have been synthesized to date, no systematic nomenclature is available yet for this important family of macrocycles. Moreover, little is known about the detailed isomerism of CNBs, which, in fact, exhibits greater complexity than that of carbon nanotubes. The copious variety of CNB isomers, along with the underlying structure\u2013property relationships, bears fundamental relevance to the ongoing design and synthesis of novel nanobelts. In this paper, we propose an elegant approach to systematically enumerate, classify, and name all possible isomers of CNBs. Besides the simplest, standard CNBs defined by chiral indices (n, m), the nonstandard CNBs (n, m, l) involves an additional winding index l. Based on extensive quantum chemical calculations, we present a comprehensive study of the relative isomer stability of CNBs containing up to 30 rings. A simple Hu\u0308ckel-based model with a high predictive power reveals that the relative stability of standard CNBs is governed by the \u03c0 stabilization and the strain destabilization induced by cylindrical carbon framework, and the former effect prevails the latter. For nonstandard CNBs, a third stability factor, the H...H repulsion in the benzo[c]phenanthrene-like motifs, is shown to be also important and can be incorporated into the simple quantitative model. In general, lower-energy CNB isomers have a larger HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, suggesting that their thermodynamic stability coincides with kinetic stability.

The highest intensities occur in narrow gaps between particle pairs aligned parallel to the field polarization. Despite the structural diversity of the monolayers investigated, we find the highest hot-spot intensity adjacent to a nanoparticle strongly correlates with the particle\u2019s resonant frequency, though the introduction of realistic variability in nanoparticle dielectric parameters weakens the link. These trends hold for different nanoparticle compositions, and predictions are compared to experimentally prepared monolayers of tin-doped indium oxide nanocrystals. Though defectivity only modestly influences ensemble extinction peak frequency and surface-enhanced infrared absorption, increasing structural disorder broadens spectral lineshapes and boosts surface-enhanced Raman scattering enhancement factors. The magnitude of spectroscopic enhancement and the sensitivity of optical properties to local structural order depends primarily on dipole polarizability contrast. These results can help inform tolerances and tradeoffs relevant to designing materials and assembly protocols to achieve desired optical properties for applications, including sensitive molecular detection.", "date": "2023-12-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We performed an accumulated 564.7\u03bcs all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations (system size ~200K atoms) of model condensates formed by a scaffold RNA oligomer and a scaffold peptide rich in arginine (Arg).

We found that the Arg-rich peptide can form the largest number of hydrogen bonds and bind the strongest to the scaffold RNA in the condensate, relative to the Lys- and ADMA-rich peptides. Our MD simulations also showed that the Arg-rich peptide diffused more slowly in the condensate relative to the other two guest peptides, which is consistent with a recent fluorescence microscopy study. There was no significant increase in the number of cation-\u03c0 interactions between the Arg-rich peptide and the scaffold RNA compared to the Lys-rich and ADMA-rich peptides.

The use of semantic web technology enables comparison of processed and standardized data, information, and knowledge at the repository scale. We demonstrate the utility of the developed framework, the Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), to leverage the results obtained from screening 1,600 plant extracts against trypanosomatids and streamline the identification of new antiparasitic compounds.

Their rich dynamics and transformations during the cell cycle are orchestrated by specific membrane-targeted molecular machineries many of which operate through energy dissipation. Likewise, man-made molecular rotary motors powered by light have previously shown drastic effects on cellular systems, but their physical roles on and within lipid membranes remain largely unexplored. Here we systematically investigate the impact of rotary molecular motors on well-defined biological membrane systems, focusing on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Notably, we observe dramatic mechanical transformations of these systems upon motor irradiation, indicative of motor-induced membrane expansion. We systematically explore the influence of several factors on this phenomenon, such as motor concentration and membrane composition, and find that in particular, membrane fluidity plays a crucial role in motor-induced deformations. At the same time, only minor contributions from local heating and singlet oxygen generation are observed. Most remarkably, we find that membrane area expansion under the influence of the motors continues as long as irradiation is maintained, and the system stays out-of-equilibrium.

This versatility originates from a strong correlation between a complex electronic structure and a flexible geometry which is easily tunable by the surrounding protein environment. Here, we investigated how the different L1 and L2 sites of the major trimeric light-harvesting complex (LHCII) of green plants tune the electronic structure of the two embedded luteins, and how this reflects on their ultrafast dynamics upon excitation. By combining molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, we found that the two luteins feature a different conformation around the second dihedral angle in the lumenal side. The s-cis preference of the lutein in site L2 allows for a more planar geometry of the \u03c0-conjugated backbone, which results in an increased degree of delocalization and a reduced excitation energy, explaining the experimentally observed red shift. Despite these remarkable differences, according to surface hopping simulations the two luteins present analogous ultrafast dynamics upon excitation: the bright S2 state quickly decays (in \u223c50 fs) to the dark intermediate Sx, eventually ending up in the S1 state. Furthermore, by employing two different theoretical approaches (i.e., F\u00f6rster theory and an excitonic version of surface hopping), we investigated the experimentally debated energy transfer between the two luteins.

In this work, we investigate the friction between biomimetic hair surfaces in the presence of adsorbed complexes formed from cationic polyelectrolytes and anionic surfactants in aqueous solution. For this purpose, we apply non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations using the coarse-grained MARTINI model. We develop new MARTINI parameters for cationic guar gum (CGG), a functionalized, plant-derived polysaccharide. The surface complexation of CGG and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on virgin and bleached hair is studied using a sequential adsorption approach, whereby CGG is deposited first, followed by SDS. The stability of the adsorbed complexes with respect to compression were then tested using squeeze-out simulations, where some of the water and SDS molecules are removed from the contact. Finally, we carry out sliding NEMD simulations to assess the boundary lubrication performance of the polyelectrolyte-surfactant complex compressed between virgin and chemically damaged biomimetic hair surfaces. We observe synergistic friction behaviour for the CGG-SDS complex, which gives lower shear stress than either pure CGG or SDS. We observe large reductions in the shear stress by the CGG-SDS complex at relatively low normal stress (\u2264 20 MPa) compared to water. At higher normal stresses, which are probably beyond those usually experienced during hair manipulation, SDS and water are squeezed out and the shear stress with the complex increases to levels higher than those observed for pure water due to increased interdigitation. Thus, the CGG-SDS complex generally increases the friction coefficient, but decreases the adhesive Derjaguin offset compared to pure water. The outcomes of this work are expected to be beneficial to fine-tune and screen sustainable hair care formulations to provide low friction and therefore a smooth feel and superior entanglement behaviour.", "date": "2023-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Polyelectrolytes - Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Consequently, researchers are often bound to use lower-level electronic structure methods such as density functional theory or second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). Here, we demonstrate on a representative example that gold-standard potentials can now be effectively constructed for molecules of 15 atoms using off-the-shelf hardware. This is achieved by accelerating the CCSD(T) computations via the accurate and cost-effective frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach. The Delta-machine learning (Delta-ML) approach is employed with the use of permutationally invariant polynomials to fit a full-dimensional PES of the acetylacetone molecule, but any other effective descriptor and ML approach can similarly benefit from the accelerated data generation proposed here. Our benchmarks for the global minima, H-transfer TS, and many high-lying configurations show the excellent agreement of FNO-CCSD(T) results  with conventional CCSD(T) while achieving a significant time advantage of about a factor of 30-40. The obtained Delta-ML PES shows high fidelity from multiple perspectives including energetic, structural, and vibrational properties. We obtain the symmetric double well H-transfer barrier of 3.15 kcal/mol in excellent agreement with the direct FNO-CCSD(T) barrier of 3.11 kcal/mol as well as with the benchmark CCSD(F12*)(T+)/CBS value of 3.21 kcal/mol.

Very often, these crystals are based on hydrophobic molecules. One method for delivering crystal-forming hydrophobic drugs is by means of lipid nanoparticle carriers. However, so far, a characterization of the potential crystallization of fully hydrophobic molecules in a lipid environment has never been reported. In this work we investigate the crystallization behaviour of two model hydrophobic chains, n-eicosane (C20) and n-triacontane (C30), in phospholipid bilayers. We combine static 2H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and show that C30 can indeed crystallize inside DMPC and POPC bilayers. The phase transition temperatures of C30 are slightly reduced inside DMPC, and rotator phase formation becomes a two-step process: Pre-organized n-alkane chains assemble in rotator-phase crystallites just as fast as bulk C30, but further addition of molecules is notably slower. Under the same isothermal conditions, different crystal forms can be obtained by crystallization in the membrane and in bulk. In excess water conditions, homogeneous nucleation of C30 is observed. The initial anisotropic molecular arrangement of C30 molecules in the membrane is readily re-covered upon reheating, showing reversibility. The shorter C20 molecules on the other hand become trapped in the DMPC membrane gel-phase upon cooling and do not crystallize.

Technologies that take advantage of this reaction also allow for a reduction in nitrogen waste accumulation enabling more balance in the global nitrogen cycle. However, high selectivity toward ammonia (NH3) is imperative for process viability. Recent studies suggest that proton plays a role in achieving high NH3 production; yet, systematic examination of the impact of proton on NO3RR selectivity is not widely conducted due to the lack of effective control over proton availability during electrolysis. Here, we employed a bipolar membrane (BPM)-based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system to investigate the influence of protons on the selectivity of NO3RR. The BPM generates a robust proton flux during electrocatalytic reactions, making it a suitable candidate for investigating the proton effects on NO3RR. We employed the interposer layer (mixed cellulose ester membrane filter) and proton scavenger (CO32-) as an approach to control the proton flux. Furthermore, we redesigned the configuration of BPM-based MEA cells, allowing us to regulate the mass transfer of the reactants (e.g.  proton and nitrate), creating local environments that favor ammonia formation. We find that a moderate proton supply allowed for an increase in ammonia yield by 576% when compared to the standard membrane electrode assembly, and a high selectivity of 26 (NH3 over NO2-) was achieved at an applied current density of 200 mA cm-2 with electrolyte mirrors that found in wastewater. Our work introduces a novel approach to address the selectivity of NO3RR from the perspective of cell design and the findings lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the influence of proton on selective NH3 synthesis from nitrate.\n \n", "date": "2023-12-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

The common consensus is that the material exhibits local Jahn-Teller distortions that dynamically reorient, resulting in a time-averaged undistorted R3 \u0305m structure. Through a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and variable-temperature X-ray diffraction (VT-XRD), we explore Jahn-Teller distortions in LiNiO2 as a function of temperature. Static Jahn-Teller distortions are observed at low temperatures (T < 250 K), followed by a broad phase transition occurring between 250 K and 350 K, leading to a highly dynamic, displacive phase at high temperatures (T > 350 K), which does not show the four short and two long bonds characteristic of local Jahn-Teller distortions. This transition is seen in AIMD simulations via abrupt changes in the calculated pair distribution function and the bond-length distortion index, and in X-ray diffraction via the monoclinic lattice parameter ratio amon/bmon and  angle, the fit quality of an R3 \u0305m-based structural refinement, and a peak-sharpening of the diffraction peaks on heating consistent with the loss of distorted domains. Between 250 K and 350 K, a mixed-phase regime is found via the AIMD simulations where distorted and undistorted domains coexist. The repeated change between the distorted and undistorted states in this mixed phase regime allows the Jahn-Teller long axes to change direction, these pseudorotations of the Ni-O long axes being a side effect of the onset of the displacive phase transition. Antisite defects, involving Li ions in the Ni layer and Ni ions in the Li layer, are found to pin the undistorted domains at low temperatures, impeding cooperative ordering at a longer length scale.", "date": "2023-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study introduces a straightforward, rudimentary, and environmentally sustainable method to enhance the antimicrobial activity of two less potent antimicrobial agents, fostering consistent and repetitive synergism against drug-resistant clinical bacteria. The aqueous extract of fresh leaves and flowers of Calotropis procera was subjected to a reaction with a 1 mg/mL ampicillin solution under heat and acidic conditions. The resultant sample exhibited pronounced synergy and heightened susceptibility against resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp, augmenting their zones of inhibition from 0 mm to 16.8 mm and from 5.3 mm to 21.4 mm, respectively.

Preliminary experiments on other alkyl chain derivatives that contain the ATD motif suggest that oscillatory motion is a general characteristic of this family of molecular crystals.

Here, we present a versatile method, namely, differentiable coarse-graining (DiffCG), which combines multi-objective optimization and differentiable simulation. The DiffCG approach is capable of constructing robust CG models by iteratively optimizing effective potentials to simultaneously match multiple target properties. We demonstrate our approach by concurrently optimizing bonded and non-bonded potentials of a CG model of polystyrene (PS) melts. The resulting CG-PS model accurately reproduces both structural and thermodynamic properties of the AA counterpart. More importantly, leveraging the multi-objective optimization capability, we develop a precise and efficient CG model for PS melts that is transferable across a wide range of temperatures, i.e., from $400$ to $600$ K. It is achieved via optimizing a pairwise potential with nonlinear temperature dependence in the CG model to simultaneously match target data from AA-MD simulations at multiple thermodynamic states.

In con-trast, in the presence of protein-based foods, this reaction was accelerated, and it even proceeded at significantly lower PQQ concentrations (i.e., 600-times lower). It was also deduced that milk can accelerate the reaction between PQQ and various amino acids, primary amines, and secondary amines. Investigations into the reaction rate revealed that food ca-talysis is a non-enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to demonstrate that the components of milk interacted with the amino substrates owing to the ability of amines to react with quinones on colloidal surfaces. Finally, the application of skimmed milk enhanced the PQQ detection limit during HPLC following IPQ derivatization. Such food catalysts therefore show promise in the fields of biocatalysis and food technology.", "date": "2023-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we reproduce and explain this full range of relaxation behaviours using a semi-classical model that combines crystal field theory with elastic inter-molecular interactions.

Thus, the differentiating yield allows the numerical evaluation of the contribution of energy variation to the yield for each intermediate and transition state in the reaction path network. In other words, a comparison of these values automatically extracts the factors affecting the yield from a complicated reaction path network consisting of numerous reaction paths and intermediates.

Including an accurate description of radical species extends the scope of possible applications to bond dissociation energy prediction, for example, in the context of cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism. The transferability of the MACE potential was validated on the COMP6 dataset, containing only closed-shell molecules, where it reaches better accuracy than the readily available general ANI-2x potential. MACE achieves similar accuracy on two CYP metabolism-specific datasets, which include open- and closed-shell structures. This model enables us to calculate the aliphatic C-H bond dissociation energy (BDE), which allows us to compare reaction energies of hydrogen abstraction, which is the rate-limiting step of the aliphatic hydroxylation reaction catalysed by CYPs. On the \u201cCYP 3A4\u201d dataset, MACE achieves a BDE RMSE of 1.37 kcal/mol and better prediction of BDE ranks than alternatives - the semi-empirical AM1 and GFN2-xTB methods and the ALFABET model by St. John et al.1 that predicts bond dissociation enthalpies. Finally, we highlight the smoothness of the MACE potential over paths of sp3C-H bond elongation and show that a minimal extension is enough for the MACE model to start finding reasonable minimum energy paths of methoxy radical-mediated hydrogen abstraction.

However, despite its advantages, the intrinsic properties of MoTe2, like the low chemical activity of its basal plane, also resulted in several technological challenges. To overcome these limitations, several methods have been explored, with single atom doping emerging as a particularly promising approach. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the influence of single atom impurities on the chemical activity of MoTe2. A total of 22 dopants were selected from the p-block of the periodic table, ranging from boron to bismuth. Specifically, we examined the adsorption of oxygen molecules (O2) on the doped structures to assess their impact on layer chemical activity. Our findings revealed that doping was energetically favorable for all investigated atoms, and it had a significant effect on surface activity. Notably, doping with dopants from groups 13-15, especially those with low atomic number, results in significant increased adsorption strength, leading to weakening of the molecular bonding in O2 by up 5.72 eV, hinting at the potential use as catalyst. Additionally, we identified certain molecules, primarily from group 17, with a remarkably high adsorption energy to charge transfer ratio. This leads to excellent sensing characteristics, where the response to adsorption in their carrier concentration is increased 100-fold over the pristine MoTe2, while sensor recovery is estimated between 0.01 and 2 s.

In the field of computational chemistry, researchers use host-guest systems, relatively simple exemplars of noncovalent binding, to train and test the computational methods used in drug discovery. Indeed, host-guest systems have been developed to support the community-wide blinded SAMPL prediction challenges for over a decade. While seeking new host-guest systems for the recent SAMPL9 binding prediction challenge, which is the focus of the present PCCP Themed Collection, we identified phenothiazine as a privileged scaffold for guests of \u03b2 cyclodextrin (\u03b2CD) and its derivatives. Building on this observation, we used calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy to characterize the noncovalent association of native \u03b2CD and three methylated derivatives of \u03b2CD with five phenothiazine drugs. The strongest association observed, that of thioridazine and one of the methyl derivatives, exceeds the well-known high affinity of rimantidine with \u03b2CD. Intriguingly, however,  methylation of \u03b2CD at the 3 position abolished detectible binding for all of the drugs studied. The dataset has a clear pattern of entropy-enthalpy compensation. The  NMR data show that all of the drugs position at least one aromatic proton at the secondary face of the CD, and most also show evidence of  deep penetration of the binding site. The results of this study were used in the SAMPL9 blinded binding affinity-prediction challenge, which are detailed in accompanying papers of the present Themed Collection. These data also open the phenothiazines and, potentially, chemically similar drugs, such as the tricyclic antidepressants, as relatively potent binders of \u03b2CD, setting the stage for future SAMPL challenge datasets and for possible applications as drug reversal agents.", "date": "2023-12-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Gilson", "abstract": "Software to more rapidly and accurately predict protein--ligand binding affinities is of high interest for early-stage drug discovery, and physics-based methods are among the most widely used technologies for this purpose. The accuracy of these methods depends critically on the accuracy of the potential functions they use. Potential functions are typically trained against a combination of quantum chemical and experimental data. However, although binding affinities are among the most important quantities to predict, experimental binding affinities have not to date been integrated into the experimental dataset used to train potential functions. In recent years, the use of host--guest complexes as simple and tractable models of binding thermodynamics has gained popularity due to their small size and simplicity, relative to protein--ligand systems. Host--guest complexes can also avoid ambiguities that arise in protein--ligand systems, such as uncertain protonation states. Thus, experimental host--guest binding data are an appealing additional data type to integrate into the experimental dataset used to optimize potential functions. Here, we report the extension of the Open Force Field Evaluator framework to enable the systematic calculation of host--guest binding free energies and their gradients with respect to force field parameters, coupled with the curation of 126 host--guest complexes with available experimental binding free energies. As an initial application of this novel infrastructure, we optimized generalized Born (GB) cavity radii for the OBC2 GB implicit solvent model against experimental data for 36 host--guest systems. This refitting led to a dramatic improvement in accuracy for both the training set and a separate test set with 90 additional host--guest systems. The optimized radii also showed encouraging transferability from host--guest systems to 59 protein-ligand systems. However, the new radii are significantly smaller than the baseline radii and lead to excessively favorable hydration free energies (HFE). Thus, users of the OBC2 GB model currently may choose between GB cavity radii that yield more accurate binding affinities or GB cavity radii that yield more accurate HFEs. We suspect that achieving good accuracy on both will require more far-reaching adjustments to the GB model. We note that binding free energy calculations using the OBC2 model in OpenMM gain about a 10x speedup relative to corresponding explicit solvent calculations, suggesting a future role for implicit solvent absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations in virtual compound screening. This study proves the principle of using host--guest systems to train potential functions that are transferrable to protein--ligand systems, and provides an infrastructure that enables a range of applications.", "date": "2023-12-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Iron catalysts often have unique open-shell structures that easily undergo spin crossover in chemical transformations, a feature rarely found in noble metal catalysts. Unfortunately, little is known currently about how the open-shell structure and spin crossover affect the reactivity and selectivity of iron catalysts, which makes the development of iron catalysts a low efficient trial-and-error program. In this paper, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the iron-catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkynes is typical spin-crossover catalysis. Deep insight into the electronic structures of a set of well-defined open-shell active formal Fe(0) catalysts revealed that the spin-delocalization between the iron center and the 1,10-phenanthroline ligand effectively regulates the iron center\u2019s spin and oxidation state to meet the opposite electrostatic requirements of oxidative addition and reductive elimination, respectively, and the spin crossover is essential for this electron transfer process. The triplet transition state was essential for achieving high regioselectivity through tuning the nonbonding interactions.

Furthermore, high energy resolution fluorescence detected XAS (HERFD-XAS) at the S K-edge was used to measure Fe-S bond covalencies and record their variation with the average valence of the Fe atoms. While the Fe-S(thiolate) covalency evolves linearly, gaining 11% per bond and hole, the Fe-S(3) covalency evolves asystematically, reflecting changes in the magnetic exchange mechanism. A strong discontinuity manifested for superoxidation to the all-ferric state, distinguishing its electronic structure and its potential (bio)chemical role from its redox congeners.

The intrinsic macrocycle exhibits innate structural flexibility resulting in dynamic conformational changes. However, the intriguing mechanisms controlling flexibility remain unknown. To shed light on this, a genome mining-based discovery of a terpene synthase, MicA, that is responsible for the biosynthesis of a non-flexible eunicellane skeleton, was presented, enabling us to propose a feasible theory that configurations of bridging carbons and their adjacent double bond govern flexibility in eunicellane structures. Notably, isotopic labeling experiments, together with density functional theory calculations, revealed that bacteria-derived MicA follows the catalytic route mainly as coral-derived eunicellane synthase through consecutive 1,14-ring closure, two 1,2-hydride shifts, 1,10-cyclization, and final deprotonation. Furthermore, structural analysis of the artificial intelligence-based MicA model and mutational studies provided an insightful basis for the enzymatic mechanism, featuring a new 2E-configured eunicellane scaffold formation by mutant MicAV220A. Finally, parallel studies of all eunicellane synthases in nature discovered to date, including 2Z-GGPP incubations and DFT-based Boltzmann population computations, revealed that a trans-fused bicycle with a 2Z-configured alkene restricts conformational flexibility resulting in a non-flexible eunicellane skeleton.

Here, we report that electrophoresis on paper (used to conduct/enhance paper-based assays) can create a non-steady-state electric circuit. We studied electrophoresis on 4-mm wide nitrocellulose-membrane strips utilized in lateral-flow immunoassays; the voltage was applied to strip termini immersed in reservoirs with a running buffer. If the total supplied power exceeded approximately 0.5 W, neither the electric current nor the temperature map reached their steady states on a multi-minute time scale. The current grew slowly to its maximum and then slowly decreased, and the temperature map evolved slowly, with one or more hot spots appearing and disappearing gradually in different positions on the strip. The slow evolution of a temperature map led to the occurrence of a terminal hot spot in which the strip burned. No chaotic behavior was observed, i.e., time dependences of both the current and temperature map were reproducible. We analyzed major processes involved in paper-based electrophoresis and explained the non-steady-state behavior. Unlike ordinary electric circuits with metal conductors, paper-based electrophoresis involves two slow processes: (i) intense buffer evaporation from hot spots and (ii) buffer supply from the reservoirs by an interplay of the capillary penetration and the electroosmotic flow. These processes affect heat generation and/or dissipation on the strip and, accordingly, the resistivity profile along the strip. The slow evolution of the resistivity profile is responsible for the non-steady-state behavior. Our work is the first detailed and conclusive study of heat maps in electrophoretically-enhanced LFA. We demonstrate spatiotemporal temperature distribution, which emphasizes the need for the empirical study of thermal behaviors due to the inability to create predictive quantitative models of the complex interplay of multiple processes, including evaporation.

Now, a combination of in-situ and ex-situ 3D electron diffraction, high-resolution imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and electron energy-loss spectroscopy uncovered clear differences between x=0.25 and x=0.5 in the pristine structure, as well as in the\ntransformations upon high-temperature reduction. In La0.5Sr1.5MnO4\u2212\u03b4, Ruddlesden-Popper n=2 layer defects and an amorphous surface layer are present, but not in\nLa0.25Sr1.75MnO4\u2212\u03b4. After annealing at 700\u00b0C in 5% H2/Ar, La0.25Sr1.75MnO4\u2212\u03b4 transforms to a tetragonal 2D incommensurately modulated structure with modulation vectors q1 = 0.2848(1) \u00b7 (a* +b*) and q2 =0.2848(1) \u00b7 (a* -b*), whereas La0.5Sr1.5MnO4\u2212\u03b4 only partially transforms to an orthorhombic 1D incommensurately modulated structure, with q = 0.318(2) \u00b7 (a* - b*). Perovskite domains grow at the crystal edge at 700\u00b0C in 5% H2 or vacuum, due to the higher La concentration on the surface compared to the bulk, which leads to a different thermodynamic equilibrium. Since it is known that a lower degree of oxygen vacancy ordering and a higher amount of perovskite blocks enhance oxygen mobility, those differences in defect structure and structural transformation upon reduction, might all contribute to the higher conductivity of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4\u2212\u03b4 in solid oxide fuel cell anode conditions compared to other La/Sr ratios.", "date": "2023-12-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Solid State Chemistry; Fuel Cells; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Several different types of compressed-air energy storage have been considered, including constant-volume approaches such as salt dome or artificial vessel storage and newer constant-pressure approaches such as submerged cavern storage. This manuscript proposes a novel approach where abandoned, flooded mineshafts are pressurized with air, displacing water downward in the shaft but upward in other hydraulically-linked shafts in the same geological complex. This approach is something of a hybrid between compressed-air storage and pumped storage and is thermodynamically distinct in that neither pressure nor volume are constant. An application to the abandoned goldmine shafts of South Africa\u2019s Witwatersrand geological complex is considered, and thermodynamic analysis indicates that this approach offers around 10% greater energy density than conventional compressed air energy storage, and that a single mineshaft could have isothermal storage capacity exceeding 1GWh, with some operational advantages specific to the Witwatersrand context, meriting further research to design processes.", "date": "2023-12-15", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

The gas-phase potential energy surface of the initial unimolecular decomposition reactions is computed with M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p), following which energies are refined using the G4 and CBS-QB3 composite methods. Rate constants are computed using the transition state theory. The energies are integrated within the atomization method to assess for the first time the standard enthalpy of formation of \u03b2-D-xylopyranose, 4-methoxy-5-carboxy-\u03b2-D-xylopyranose, and 2-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-xylopyranose: -218.2, -263.1, and -300.0 kcal mol-1, respectively. For all isomers, the activation enthalpies of ring-opening are considerably lower, 43.8-47.5 kcal mol-1, than the ring-contraction and elimination processes, which show higher values ranging from 61.0-81.1 kcal mol-1. The functional groups exert a notable influence, lowering the barrier of discrete elementary reactions by 1.9-8.3 kcal mol-1, increasing thus the reaction rate constant by 0-4 orders of magnitude relative to unsubstituted species. Regardless of the functionalization, the ring-opening process always exhibits the highest reactivity characterized by a rate constant on the order of 101 s-1, significantly surpassing the values associated with ring-contraction and elimination, which fall in the range 10-4-10-10 s-1. Remarkably, these kinetics are contingent on the functionalization specificities and the relative orientation of reacting centers. A relatively simple chemical reactivity and bonding analysis partially support the elaborated thermokinetic approach.

Although experimentally facile, this bond choice may impart sub-optimal drug properties to the overall PROTAC molecule. Here, we show that a suite of BRD4 PROTAC degraders were prepared via diverse amine-acid couplings beyond the amide bond, where the bromo-domain inhibitor JQ1 carboxylic acid was used as the acid and the E3-derived (Cereblon or Von Hippel Lindau) par-tial PROTACs served as the amine.

Calculated physico-chemical properties for these ten diversly linked PROTACs showed a wide range of lipophilicity, polar surface area, and hydrogen bonding characteristics. Ultimately, when these compounds were evaluated for BRD4 degradation, several of them showed improved efficacy.

These approaches accelerate drug discovery by helping researchers efficiently identify, prioritize, and optimize compounds. Nonetheless, when investigating properties that depend on the interaction between a ligand and its corresponding protein, a compelling need arises to incorporate the protein counterpart information within the models. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to incorporate 3D structural information to improve our understanding of the underlying protein-ligand interactions. However, incorporating 3D information into GNNs is not always straightforward. To address the challenge, we introduce a model called InterGraph, which models the protein-ligand interaction as topological multigraphs.  By leveraging a topological representation, InterGraph offers a comprehensive approach to a graph representation of the intricate spatial organization and connectivity patterns within protein-ligand systems. We introduce interaction spheres that assign varying edge densities, capturing the proximity-based influence of interactions. This approach enables us to capture the characteristics of the interaction network, filtering out the ones that are beyond 9 \u00c5 from the ligand since they are not considered relevant or established. Finally, we trained the model using a ligand binding dataset from PDBbind and tested it on a hold-out test set, achieving an RMSE value of 1.34. Our findings have demonstrated the power of the multigraph to encode the importance of close interactions, a factor that is relevant in the context of binding affinity. On average, our model accurately predicts binding affinity values for several protein-ligand complexes and exhibits higher accuracy for hydrolase, lyase, and families of proteins involved in mediating protein-protein interactions.

This hyperpolarization is then transferred to the bulk sample via nuclear spin diffusion. However, the involvement of the protons in the biradical in the cross-effect DNP process has been under debate. In this work, we address this question by exploring the hyperpolarization pathways in and around bis-nitroxides. We demonstrate that for biradicals with strong electron-electron interactions, as in the case of the AsymPols, the protons on the biradical may not be necessary to quickly generate hyperpolarization.

Here, we investigate allosteric binding between drugs and eume- lanin using computational techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and free energy calculations. Eumelanin, composed of DHI and DHICA molecules, was utilized in different systems, including aggregated and random arrangements, with the addition of neutral or charged eume- lanin and selected drug molecules (chloroquine, levofloxacin, timolol, methotrexate, and diclofenac). The MD simulations revealed conformational changes in both eumelanin and drug molecules upon interaction along with the creation of binding sites or cavities. Evaluation of binding free energy through Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations indicated that neutral timolol and charged di- clofenac exhibited the strongest binding to DHI aggregated bundles, while both neutral and charged methotrexate showed the strongest binding in random DHI systems. In contrast, neutral and charged chloroquine displayed the strongest binding in random systems with DHICA (neutral and charged) respectively. Following MD simulations, DFT calculations were employed to further investigate the strength of drug-eumelanin binding. By utilizing the drug-eumelanin poses obtained from MD simulations, DFT calculations demonstrated that the binding strength is influenced by the structural orientation and conformation of both the drug and eumelanin molecules. Overall, drug-eumelanin binding depends on various factors, including conformational changes in both the drug and eumelanin, the charges of the molecules, the presence of binding sites (especially in DHI eumelanin), the occurrence of \u03c0-\u03c0 and hydrogen bond interactions, and the surrounding solvent environment.", "date": "2023-12-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In practice, this measurement records the interferometric scattering signal of individual nanoparticles in solution as they land and stick on a coverslip, exhibiting an intensity that varies linearly with particle volume, and an adsorption rate that reflects the solution-phase transport kinetics of the system. Together, such measurements provide a multidimensional gauge of particle size and concentration in solution over time. However, the landing kinetics of particles in solution also manifest a measurement frequency limitation imposed by the slow long-range mobility of particle diffusion to the measurement interface. Here we introduce a new technique that offers a novel means to overcome the inherent diffusion-controlled sampling limitation of spontaneous mass photometry. We term this methodology, electrophoretic deposition interferometric scattering microscopy (EPD-iSCAT). This approach uses a coverslip supporting a conductive thin film of indium tin oxide (ITO). Charging this ITO film to a potential of around 1 V electrophoretically draws charged nanoparticles from solution and binds them in the focal plane of the microscope. Regulating this potential offers a direct means to control particle deposition. Thus, we find for a 0.1 nM solution of 50 nm polystyrene nanoparticles that the application of +1 V to an EPD-iSCAT coverslip assembly drives a electrophoetic deposition rate constant of 1.7 s\u22121 \u03bcm\u22122 nM\u22121. Removal of the potential causes deposition to cease. This user control of EPD-iSCAT affords a means to apply single-molecule mass photometery to monitor long-term changes in solution owing to slow kinetic processes. In contrast with conventional coverslips chemically derivatized with charged thin films, EPD-iSCAT maintains a deposition rate that varies linearly with bulk concentration.", "date": "2023-12-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study integrates a fluorescent \u201cbenzo-indole\u201d chromophore with a pH-sensitive \u201cphenol\u201d moiety into a single covalent skeleton to build a sensitive, red-shifted, cell-permeable pH probe (Mito-pH2).

Our design ensures that Mito-pH2 exhibits pH-sensitive dual-excitation and dual-emission peaks enabling ratiometric pH-sensing. Further, Mito-pH2 reports an increase in pH in the pH range of 3-9 through a striking colour change from yellow to purple making it a sensitive all-purpose colorimetric pH probe. A combination of DFT calculations and spectroscopy shed light on likely sensing mechanisms including photophysics. Quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging reveals that Mito-pH2 can detect dynamic changes in mitochondrial pH upon extracellular pH modulation with little or no measurable cytotoxicity during live imaging.

PYP is one of the PAS-domain model proteins that regulates negative phototactic signal response, and its photoreaction is well characterized. In turn, a protein dimer is usually required to maintain its function as a PAS family domain. However, no partner protein for the signaling pathway of PYP has been identified yet. Here, we investigated the intermolecular interaction of PYP with a charged homopolypeptide, poly-L-lysine, in situ by combining chiral vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations and VSFG spectral calculations. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach enabled us to study the structure and orientation of proteins at interfaces based on probing the chiral N-H stretching and amide I and II vibrational modes. We found that PYP has a preferred orientation at the PLL interface, mainly due to dipole-dipole interaction, despite its water-soluble, i.e., cytoplasmic nature. Interestingly, the interaction surface and the orientation of PYP resulted in our model being nearly identical to a homodimer of PYP and a heterodimer in CNBh domains consisting of a PAS member.

It was confirmed that the GNS could reasonably reproduce the assembly process, even under the toughest scenario, in which the experimental conditions differed between the training and testing data. Practically, this means that the GNS trained by the first 24 hour images could predict the cell types obtained three weeks later.

Despite their utility in the synthesis of high-value functional molecules, distinct methods for the preparation of alkyl chlorides are underrepresented. Here, we report a visible-light-mediated dual catalysis strategy for the modular synthesis of highly functionalized and structurally diverse \u03b2-aryl-alkyl chlorides via the coupling of diaryliodonium salts, alkenes and potassium chloride. A visible-lighted activated photocatalyst reduces a diaryliodonium salt to form an aryl radical, which adds to an alkene acceptor to create a \u03b2-aryl-alkyl radical. This radical undergoes chlorine group transfer to form the \u03b2-aryl-alkyl chloride product. A distinctive aspect of this transformation is the operation of two chlorine atom-transfer path-ways, which are dictated by the electronic properties of the open shell species arising from the substituted alkene and leveraged by the deployment of different metal group-transfer reactions. The scope of the reaction is broad in the aryl and alkene component and pro-vides access to a range of complex alkyl chlorides in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies identified a multifaceted role for the chloride anion in facilitating the overall transformation, which could inform the selection of appropriate group-transfer catalysts when nucleophiles other than halides are used.", "date": "2023-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The majori-ty of catalytic approaches focus on a single activation mode, such as enhancing the electrophilicity of the carboxylic acid partner using a Lewis acid. In contrast, nature effortlessly forges and breaks amide bonds using precise arrays of Lew-is/Br\u00f8nsted acidic and basic functional groups.

Specifically, the combination of pyridine N-oxide and Zr open metal sites within the framework MOF-808-py-Nox produces a heterogeneous catalyst that facilitates amide bond formation with broad functional group compat-ibility. We propose that the formation of a hydrogen-bonding network at the defect sites helps to lower the energy barrier for amide bond formation. MOF-808-py-Nox can be recycled at least five times without losing crystallinity or catalytic activity.

However, reported artificial means of methanethiol production indicate the necessity of gas-phase condition, rather than aqueous-phase setting, for this prebiotic reaction to occur. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this dilemma was mitigated by subseafloor supercritical CO2. Under supercritical CO2 with a geochemically feasible concentration of hydrogen, up to 7.9% conversion of hydrogen sulfide to methanethiol was achieved at 200 \u00b0C on molybdenum sulfide catalyst deposited in a carbonate-NaCl solution. Effective formations of carbon monoxide, methane, and formate were also observed. On the present ocean floor, discharges of liquid and supercritical CO2 occasionally occur in close vicinity to hydrothermal vents. Geological records of ancient seafloor suggest prevalence of such CO2 fluxes associated with hydrothermal activities. Our experimental results link these facts with the protometabolism scenario, leading to the possibility that the generation and transportation of methanethiol through the subseafloor CO2 fluxes constituted the beginning steps of protometabolism in primordial ocean hydrothermal systems.

As a bottom-up technique, HDX-MS provides information at peptide-level resolution, allowing structural localisation of dynamic changes. Consequently, HDX-MS data quality is largely determined by the number of peptides that are identified and monitored after deuteration. Integration of ion mobility (IM) into HDX-MS workflows has been shown to increase data quality by providing an orthogonal mode of peptide ion separation in the gas-phase. This is of critical importance for challenging targets such as integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which often suffer from low sequence coverage and/or redundancy in HDX-MS analyses. The increasing complexity of samples being investigated by HDX-MS, such as membrane mimetic reconstituted and in vivo IMPs, has generated need for instrumentation with greater resolving power. Recently, Giles et al. developed cyclic ion mobility (cIM), an IM device with racetrack geometry that enables scalable, multi-pass IM separations. Using 1-pass and multi-pass cIM routines, we use the recently commercialised SELECT SERIES\u2122 Cyclic\u2122 IM spectrometer for HDX-MS analyses of 4 detergent solubilised IMP samples and report its enhanced performance. Furthermore, we develop a novel processing strategy capable of better handling multi-pass cIM data.

However, when used in monotherapy, HDAC6 inhibition by selective inhibitors fails to show pronounced anti-cancer effects.

We predict that the lowest excited states of these silicon nanoparticles are excitonic in character and that the corresponding excitons are completely delocalised over the volume of the particle. The size of the excitons is precited to increase proportionally with the particle size. Conversely, we predict that the fundamental gap, the optical gap, and the exciton binding energy increase with decreasing particle size. The exciton binding energy is predicted to counter-act the variation in the fundamental gap and hence to reduce the variation of the optical gap with particle size. The variation in the exciton binding energy itself is probably caused by a reduction in the dielectric screening with decreasing particle size. The intensity of the excited state corresponding to the optical gap and other low energy excitations are predicted to increase with decreasing particle size. We explain this increase in terms of the \u2018band structure\u2019 becoming smeared out in reciprocal space with decreasing particle size, increasing the \u2018overlap\u2019 between the occupied and unoccupied quasiparticle states and thus, the oscillator strength. Fourier transforms of the lowest excitons show that they inherit the periodicity of the frontier quasiparticle states. This combined with the delocalisation of the exciton and the large exciton binding energy means that the excitons in silicon nanoparticles combine aspects of Wannier-Mott, delocalisation and effect of periodicity of the underlying structure, and Frenkel, large exciton binding energy, excitons.

Forward calculations of methane column loadings, based on detailed emission inventories at fine spatial resolution, coupled with fine spatial scale gridded chemical transport models, have the potential to inform approaches used in inversion calculations. As a case study of a forward calculation of methane column loadings, a site-level emission inventory for >104 oil and gas production and midstream sites was coupled with a gridded chemical transport model to estimate the variability in column loadings associated with routine emissions and large emission events from oil and gas facilities over a seven-month period. Data sets of gridded column concentrations at a one-hour temporal resolution and a 1.33 km horizontal spatial resolution have been created and archived. Ratios of the total column methane enhancements associated with emission events to the total column enhancements due to routine methane emissions were evaluated for various emission scenarios. The results indicate that in an oil and gas production region typical of the United States, a horizontal spatial resolution of ~1 km is needed for a 1000 kg/hr emission event to routinely produce a doubling of column methane loadings, compared to a baseline of enhancements in column loadings due to routine emissions. Enhancements ratios for column methane due to nearby emission events were generally insignificant. The enhancement ratio represents a relatively simple metric that could facilitate rapid and simple identification of emission events.", "date": "2023-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Molecular oxygen is likely to present and known to strongly affect various polymerization processes, yet the role of oxygen in distillation column fouling remains poorly understood. Building upon the foundations laid in our preceding study [Pang et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2023, 62, 36, 14266\u201314285], this work presents a detailed kinetic modeling approach to investigate the impact of oxygen on polymer fouling in a typical debutanizer. The fouling model incorporates molecular oxygen as a primary source of contamination in the feedstock and encompasses a comprehensive network of chemical reactions, phase equilibria, and interphase transport phenomena. Critical model parameters are derived from quantum chemistry calculations to ensure accuracy. The sensitivity of fouling rates to varying levels of dissolved oxygen is examined. We find that even small traces (ppb level) of molecular oxygen contaminant in the feedstock can significantly accelerate fouling growth in the colder section. Furthermore, the dominant pathways of fouling are observed to shift over time due to diffusion limitations.

A series of Zn-Cu alloy catalysts are developed to drive the electrochemical reduction of nitrate, where the hydroxylamine intermediate formed in the electroreduction process can undergo a chemical reaction with the cyclohexanone present in the electrolyte to produce the corresponding oxime.

In order to test these compounds we employed three different IM-MS platforms (Agilent 6560 IM-QToF, Waters Synapt G2 and a home-built variable temperature drift-tube IM-MS) and used them to investigate six different generations of dendrimers in two buffer gases (helium and nitrogen).

The rigidity of each dendrimer was probed using collisionally activated as well as high-temperature IM-MS experiments, where no evidence for significant CCS change ensued.

In the present work, we present a new protocol to enhance the quality of group 1 monoatomic ions (specifically Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) with respect to their interactions with common polar model compounds in biomolecules in condensed phases in the context of the Drude polarizable force field. Instead of adjusting pre-existing individual parameters for ions, model compounds, and water, we employ atom-pair specific LJ (known as NBFIX in CHARMM) and through-space Thole dipole screening (NBTHOLE) terms to fine-tune the balance of ion-model compound, ion-water, and model compound-water interactions. This involved establishing a protocol for the optimization of NBFIX and NBTHOLE parameters targeting the difference between molecular mechanical (MM) and quantum mechanical (QM) potential energy scans (PES). It is shown that targeting PES involving complexes that include multiple model compounds and/or ions as trimers and tetramers yields parameters that produce condensed phase properties in agreement with experimental data. Validation of this protocol involved the reproduction of experimental thermodynamic benchmarks, including solvation free energies of ions in methanol and N-methyl acetamide, osmotic pressures, ionic conductivities, and diffusion coefficients within the condensed phase. These results show the importance of including more complex ion-model compound complexes beyond dimers in the QM target data to account for many-body effects during parameter fitting.

In this study, we report on the synthesis of GOs from graphite (Gr) powder and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) using an improved Hummers\u2019 method. We extensively investigated the effects of particle size and specific surface area of the Gr and GNP precursors on their oxidation, which have not been addressed in literature. The results from Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses show that the GO made from Gr powder with a large surface area and small size has a higher degree of oxidation with about 9.8% carboxyl functional groups. This provides more opportunities for interactions with different molecules, including asphalt components. In this regard, we investigated the impact of carboxyl-rich GO (higher oxidation percentage) on the high-temperature performance of asphalt binder through rotational viscosity, rheology, multiple stress creep and recovery (MSCR), and anti-aging property measurements. Our experimental results indicate that GO obtained from the Gr powder precursor (designated ox-Gr) can significantly improve the high-temperature performance of asphalt binder. For example, the introduction of only 2 wt.% GO to a performance grade asphalt binder (PG 67-22) can dramatically increase its complex shear modulus (G*), as well as decrease the phase angle (\u03b4), at high temperatures. The MSCR tests showed that the addition of GO to asphalt binder effectively mitigates its permanent deformation and improves its elastic response, as demonstrated by about 39% reduction in the creep compliance (J_nr) and an impressive 297% increase in the percent recovery (\u03b5R) of the GO-modified binder.

It is discovered that \u03b2-furanoside is the most permeable configurational isomer across a lipid protomembrane as compared with other isomers, and becomes the most abundant isomer through permeation. In the meantime, phosphate can be transported across the lipid membrane and preserved inside the protocell in its soluble form, thereby circumventing its abundance and availability issues.

The effects of environmental samples observed in bioassays addressing various endpoints in the endocrine, namely thyroid hormone pathways, remain largely unexplained with known active chemicals. Transthyretin (TTR) is a serum transport protein distributing thyroid hormones to target tissues in vertebrates; its binding inhibition by xenobiotics may lead to adverse effects such as impaired (neuro)development. In this study, we describe a novel approach for the identification of compounds with the potential to bind to TTR, based on the specific separation of these compounds in a pull-down assay followed by non-target analysis (NTA). The pull-down assay using purified TTR protein was established and optimized with known TTR ligands. The method was applied to separate and identify compounds responsible for TH displacing activity in highly complex wastewater and surface water samples. The samples after the pull-down assay elicited TH displacing activity and the specific separation of TTR ligands provided a substantial reduction of chromatographic features from the original complex water extract. The applied non-target screening workflow resulted in the identification of 34 structures. Thirteen identified compounds with available analytical standards were quantified in the original water extracts and their TH-displacement potency was confirmed.

While the anodes, e.g., graphite and lithium, have been historically acknowledged as critical hurdles for fast-charging batteries, the stability of the cathodes under sustained high-rate cycling has not been well studied. In this work, we have investigated the fast cycling (10 - 15 minutes charging time) of LiMn2O4 (LMO) under practical conditions (90% loading of cathode material with an areal capacity of 1 mAh/cm2). We find through advanced characterisation that in the presence of LiPF6-based electrolyte, the high rate cycling of LMO causes a cascade of bulk LiMn2O4\u2192LiMnO2 phase changes, accompanied by oxygen release, initiating electrolyte degradation. Together, these factors play a compounding role in the capacity loss during cycling, even with high-rate compatible anodes, e.g., Li4Ti5O12 (LTO). The combination of a commercial, high-capacity, micro-structured LMO cathode and novel electrolyte, prepared by using a novel lithium salt, lithium 1,1,1,3,3,3, (tetrakis) hexafluoroisopropoxy borate, in a mixture with commercial electrolyte, overcomes these limitations. The performance improvement is attributed to the synergy between the unique cathode structures and the formation of a facilitative boron-rich cathode electrolyte interface. Cycling of the LMO|LTO cells show 98 mAh/g initial discharge capacity at 4C-4D cycling with the novel electrolyte with 91% capacity retention after 1500 cycles, while charging to 90% of total capacity in 10 minutes.

It has recently been recognized that such cations, when generated from chiral electrophiles, are themselves chiral and can react with nucleophiles stereospecifically. However, the CPC and BCB cations are in equilibrium with each other and with other related structures such as the cyclobutyl (CB) and homoallyl (HA) cations, from which stereospecificity is not guaranteed. Currently, the effect of substitution on the composition of cation mixtures containing CPC/BCB/CB/HA cations is not understood, precluding the prediction and control of the major products generated from such cations. Using Density Functional Theory and DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations, we have studied the electronic and steric effects on the equilibria between mono- and polysubstituted C4H7+ cations. Our results indicate that electron-donating groups at the C1 position favor CPC structures, while BCB/CB structures are favored for the C2 position and HA structures for the C3/C4 positions. Electron-withdrawing groups yield shallower potential energy surfaces where many related structures are energetically accessible. Strong Hammett correlations (\u03c3+) are observed for the various substituent effects, which appear to be additive in nature. In addition, BCB cations with more substituents are energetically destabilized compared to CPC cations, except with donating substituents at the C2 position.

We study active site models of non-heme iron hydroxylases and their vanadium-based mimics using density functional theory to determine if vanadyl is a faithful structural mimic. We identify crucial structural and energetic differences between ferryl and vanadyl isomers owing to the differences in their ground electronic states, i.e., high-spin (HS) for Fe and low-spin (LS) for V. For the  succinate cofactor bound to the ferryl intermediate, we predict facile interconversion between monodentate and bidentate coordination isomers for ferryl species but difficult rearrangement for vanadyl mimics. We study isomerization of the oxo intermediate between axial and equatorial positions and find the ferryl potential energy surface to be characterized by a large barrier of ca. 10 kcal/mol that is completely absent for the vanadyl mimic. This analysis reveals even starker contrasts between Fe and V in hydroxylases than have been observed for this metal substitution in non-heme halogenases. Analysis of the relative bond strengths of coordinating carboxylate ligands for Fe and V reveals that all the ligands show stronger binding to V than Fe owing to the LS ground state of V in contrast to the HS ground state of Fe.

A key obstacle to including internal fragments in TD-MS workflows stems from potential ambiguities in their assignments, which can severely impact the confidence of assignments and increase false discovery. To utilize internal fragments in TD-MS precisely, it is therefore crucial to discern ambiguous internal fragment assignments. Here, we demonstrate that by including ion mobility, ambiguous internal fragments can be discerned to enable more confident assignments. For example, the \u03b2-Casein-derived internal fragments a115\u00ac-x132 and a114\u00ac-x131 were both assigned to 1000.51 m/z; however, ion mobility of this m/z showed two different arrival time distributions: 25.5 ms and 30.0 ms.

For the test proteins myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase II, \u03b2-Casein, and bovine serum albumin, the inclusion of ion mobility discerned internal fragments increased sequence coverage from <55% to >85%, which is near complete sequence coverage for these proteins. By applying this method to a protein complex, trustuzamab, the sequence coverage and sequence information returned for both the heavy and light chains were 85% and 90% respectively. These data demonstrate that the inclusion of ion mobility in TD-MS experiments can enhance the confidence of internal fragment assignments, and significantly extend protein sequence information relative to TD-MS experiments that do not incorporate ion mobility.", "date": "2023-12-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Supramolecular hydrogels based on peptides with interesting optical properties are rarely reported and explored. Although robust crystals based on short peptides have shown optical waveguiding capabilities, their rigidity is the main issue to overcome in the quest for soft biocompatible materials. Here, we report on a microfluidic-assisted formation of a heterochiral short peptide hydrogel that exhibit active optical waveguiding property thanks to the incorporation of two different dyes, Thioflavin T and Rhodamine B, in the hydrogel structure. Using our microfluidic platform, different parameters such as concentration of peptide, type of dye and its concentration, and flow rate have been rapidly explored, with remarkable low reagents consumption. In this way, it was possible to develop peptide hydrogel waveguides with good optical loss values, modulating the emission in diverse spectral regions. The use of microfluidics to prepare these hydrogels makes possible the preparation of structures of high length-to-diameter aspect ratio, which otherwise are hard to devise from bulk conditions. Overall, this work broadens the use of supramolecular self-assembly of peptides to create functional materials with additional versatility to polymeric hydrogels, thanks to the possibility of tuning structure by changing amino acids sequence.

Their virus binding/release processes involve a gradually acidifying environment following the natural intracellular trafficking pathways. Therefore, understanding their pH-dependent binding properties with glycan ligands is of great importance. We have recently developed densely glycosylated gold nanoparticles (glycan-GNPs) as a powerful new tool for probing DC-SIGN/R multivalent lectin-glycan interaction (MLGI) mechanisms. It not only can provide quantitative MLGI affinities but also important structural information, such as binding site orientation and binding modes. Herein, we further employ the glycan-GNP probes to investigate the pH dependency of DC-SIGN/R MLGI properties. We find that DC-SIGN/R MLGIs exhibit distinct pH dependence over the normal physiological (7.4) to lysosomal (\u223c4.6) pH range. DC-SIGN binds glycan-GNPs strongly and stably from pH 7.4-5.4, but the binding is weakened significantly as pH decreases to < 5.4. This is fully consistent with DC-SIGN\u2019s role as an endocytic recycling receptor. In contrast, DC-SIGNR\u2019s affinity with glycan-GNPs is enhanced with the decreasing pH from 7.4 to 5.4, peaking at pH 5.4, and then reduced as pH is further lowered.

We speculate that the ionic surfactants distribute themselves more loosely and deeply through the top layers of the aqueous solution than do neutral surfactants, with gaps between the surfactants that may be filled with salty water. This difference is supported by prior molecular dynamics simulations and ion scattering measurements of surfactant solutions.

Thermodynamically, Ti@Cu can be easily synthesized and oxidized in an aqueous solvent, as indicated by its low formation energy (-1.60 eV) and free energy (-0.92 eV) for oxidation. Catalytically, the introduction of bystander oxygen species facilitates the hydrogenation of residual *O after the generation of C2 products in eCO2RR on the Ti@Cu surface. This results in an inclination for eCO2RR on Ti@Cu to predominantly produce C1 product CH4 (\u0394GRDS = 0.51 eV), while on the O-Ti@Cu and OH-Ti@Cu surfaces, there is a respective tendency towards the production of C2 products CH2CH2 (\u0394GRDS = 0.51 eV) and CH3COOH (\u0394GRDS=0.45 eV). Importantly, the potential required for eCO2RR on pure Ti@Cu is 0.70 V, notably lower than the 0.86 V needed for the *O hydrogenation. This confirms the stability of oxygen species (*O and *OH) on Ti@Cu under electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism under varying electrochemical conditions (different potential and acidity) revealed that Ti@Cu favored CH4 production at pH = 1, 7, and 13, whereas both O-Ti@Cu and OH-Ti@Cu surfaces tended to produce CH2CH2 and CH3COOH at pH 1 and CH4 at pH = 7 and 13.

While the infrared (IR) spectrum only requires the electric dipole moment, the vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectrum further requires knowledge of the magnetic dipole moment, for which we provide relevant expressions to be used under polarizable force fields. The AMOEBA force field was employed here to model alanine in the neutral and zwitterionic isolated forms, solvated by water or nitrogen, and as a crystal. Within this framework, comparison of the electric and magnetic dipole moments to those obtained with nuclear velocity perturbation theory based on density-functional theory for the same MD trajectories are found to agree well with one another.

Experimental results showed an 18% reduction in specific energy use while achieving the same degree of salt removal (20mM to 12mM). Furthermore, the resin wafer enabled complete desalination to potable drinking levels at a current density previously unachievable within practical operating voltage limits (4.93 mA/cm2).

Phase transformations in adsorbed fluids often involve long-lasting metastable states and hysteresis that has been well-documented in gas adsorption-desorption and nonwetting fluid intrusion-extrusion experiments. However, theoretical prediction of the observed nanophase behavior remains a challenging problem. The mesoscopic canonical, or mesocanonical, ensemble (MCE) is devised to study the nanophase behavior under conditions of controlled fluctuations to stabilize metastable and labile states. Here, we implement the MCE Monte Carlo (MCEMC) simulation scheme, called the gauge cell method, which allows to produce van der Waals type isotherms with distinctive swings around the phase transitions regions.  The constructed isotherms determine the positions of phase equilibrium and spinodals, as well as the nucleation barriers separating metastable states.

We demonstrate the unique capabilities of the MCEMC method in quantitative predictions of experimental observations compared with the conventional grand canonical and canonical ensemble simulations.

In this study, we aimed to identify the major hTTR ligands in Canadian indoor dust and sewage sludge by employing protein-guided nontargeted analysis. hTTR binding activities were detected in all 11 indoor dust and 9 out of 10 sewage sludge samples (median 458 and 1134 \u03bcg T4/g in dust and sludge, respectively) by the FITC-T4 displacement assay. Through employing protein Affinity Purification with Nontargeted Analysis (APNA), 31 putative hTTR ligands were detected including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Two of the most abundant ligands were identified as hydrocarbon surfactants (e.g., dodecyl benzenesulfonate), which were confirmed by authentic chemical standards. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) of hydrocarbon surfactants were explored by investigating the binding activity of 11 hydrocarbon surfactants to hTTR. Optimal carbon chain length (C12-14) was found to achieve a high binding affinity. By employing de novo nontargeted analysis, another abundant ligand was surprisingly identified as a di-sulfonate fluorescent brightener, 4,4'-Bis(2-sulfostyryl)biphenyl sodium (CBS). CBS was validated as a nM-affinity hTTR ligand with an IC50 of 345 nM.

A crucial step in manufacturing these devices involves utilizing highly pure REEs, often obtained through complex and non-sustainable processes. These processes are vital in isolating individual REEs from mixtures containing non-REEs and other REEs. There exists an urgent requirement to explore alternative techniques that enable the selective recovery of REEs through more energy-efficient processes. To overcome the limitations mentioned above, we have developed a microbead-based technology featuring immobilized lanthanide binding peptides (LBPs) for the selective adsorption of REEs. This technology does not require the utilization of external stimuli but uses gravity-based separation processes to separate the bound REE from the unbound REE. We demonstrate this technology's potential by enriching two relevant REEs (Europium and Terbium). Furthermore, despite their similar chemical properties, we present the distinctive binding preference of the LBPs for a specific rare earth element over another. Moreover, these LBPs exhibit no binding affinity towards other frequently encountered industrial ions. Finally, we demonstrate the recovery of REEs through a change in system conditions and assess the reusability of the microbeads for subsequent adsorption cycles. We anticipate that this approach addresses the challenges of REE recovery and demonstrates the potential of biomolecular strategies in advancing sustainable resource management.\n", "date": "2023-12-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Recently, it was shown that CeO2 can selectively catalyse this reaction but we still lack information regarding the reaction mechanism. Using density functional theory (DFT) modelling we explore possible reaction mechanisms that allow for the polymerization of CO2. According to our computations the reaction is initialized by the adsorption of CO2 in an oxygen vacancy. Owing to the rich defect chemistry of ceria a large number of suitable sites are available at the surface. C-C bond formation is achieved through an aldol condensation type mechanism which comprises the electrochemical elimination of water to form a carbene. This carbene then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2 . The reaction mechanism possesses significant similarities to the corresponding reaction in synthetic organic chemistry. Since the mechanism is completely generic it allows for all relevant steps of the formation of hard carbon like chain growth, chain linkage and the formation of side chains or aromatic rings. Surprisingly, ceria mainly serves as an anchor for CO2 in an oxygen vacancy while all other subsequent reaction steps are almost completely independent from the catalyst.

This transformation was hypothesized to go through a double-displacement mechanism\nformed by a glycosylation step and a cyclization step. During the glycosylation step, E270 protonates\nthe O2 of the \u03b1-D-fructofuranosyl group in the subsite \u20131 (\u20131 sugar), and E291 attacks the anomeric\ncarbon forming a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (GEI) and releasing a water molecule.

However, also solvation free energies come into play in two ways: (i) by modulating the adsorption free energy together with solute-surface interactions, as the solute has to penetrate the water adlayer in contact with the surface and get partially desolvated (which costs free energy); (ii) by regulating transport across the interface, i.e. the free energy profile from the bulk to the interface, which is strongly non-monotonic due to the unique nature of metal/aqueous interfaces.

This project is a collaboration between the Mi'kmaq Nation, Upland Grassroots, and researchers at several institutions who conducted phytoremediation field trials using hemp to remove PFAS from soil at the former Loring Air Force base, which has now been returned to the Mi\u2019kmaq Nation. PFAS were analyzed in paired hemp and soil samples using targeted and non-targeted analytical approaches. Additionally, we used hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to degrade PFAS in the harvested hemp tissue. We identified 28 PFAS in soil and found hemp uptake of 10 of these PFAS. Consistent with previous studies, hemp exhibited greater bioconcentration for carboxylic acids compared to sulfonic acids, and for shorter-chain compounds compared to longer-chain. In total, approximately 1.4 mg of PFAS was removed from the soil via uptake into hemp stems and leaves, with an approximate maximum of 2% PFAS removed from soil in the most successful area. Degradation of PFAS by HTL was nearly 100% for carboxylic acids, but a portion of sulfonic acids remained. HTL also decreased precursor PFAS and extractable organic fluorine.

In this work, we propose two novel classes of cycloarenes, the generalized kekulenes and the clarenes. Using density functional theory, we carry out a comprehensive study of all possible isomers of the generalized kekulenes and clarenes with different sizes. By applying a simple Hu\u0308ckel model, we show that \u03c0 delocalization plays a crucial role in determining the relative stability of isomers. We also discover that \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is commonly present in certain larger clarenes and provides a considerable additional stabilization effect, making the corresponding isomers the lowest-energy ones. Among all considered typical looped polyarenes, generalized kekulenes and/or clarenes are revealed to be the energetically most stable forms, suggesting that these novel cycloarenes proposed here would be viable targets for future synthetic work.

A widely adopted approach is to treat retrosynthetic prediction as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) translation task, where the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) of a product is translated into the SMILES of its corresponding reactants. However, these sequence-based models using SMILES also face many issues, including limited performance, lack of interpretability, and controllability. In this work, we introduce a novel chemical language for retrosynthetic prediction named E-SMILES, which is an extension of SMILES specially designed for seq2seq retrosynthetic prediction. This language not only documents the static molecular structure but also encodes the editing operations of the molecule in the retrosynthetic process, enabling it to characterize retrosynthesis reactions more effectively. By using E-SMILES, seq2seq retrosynthetic models can simulate the stepwise retrosynthetic analysis strategy of chemists, ensuring the matching of atoms between the predicted reactants and product, and yielding more interpretable and controllable predictions. Furthermore, E-SMILES is naturally aligned with the product's SMILES, reducing the edit distance between the model's input and output sequences. This liberates the model from learning the complex SMILES syntax and allows it to focus more on the retrosynthesis process itself. Leveraging E-SMILES, our retrosynthesis model achieves top-1 accuracies of 58.9% and 68.5% on the USPTO-50k dataset, with and without given reaction class, respectively, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art results. We envisage that E-SMILES can serve as a new foundational tool, promoting the development of sequence-based retrosynthetic prediction methods.", "date": "2023-12-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Microorganisms carrying Rieske oxygenases are able to quickly adapt their substrate spectrum to alternative carbon and energy sources that are structurally related to the original target substrate, yet the molecular events responsible for this rapid adaptation are not well understood. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by unproductive activation of O2, the so-called O2 uncoupling, in the presence of the alternative substrate exert a selective pressure for increasing the oxygenation efficiency of Rieske oxygenases. To that end, we studied wild-type 2-nitrotoluene dioxygenase (2NTDO) from Acidovorax sp. strain JS42 and five enzymes variants that have evolved from laboratory evolution experiments with 3- and 4-nitrotoluene as alternative growth substrates. The enzyme variants showed a substantially increased oxygenation efficiency towards the new target substrates concomitant with a reduction of ROS production, while mechanisms and kinetics of enzymatic O2 activation remained unchanged. Structural analyses and docking studies suggest that point mutations in enzyme variants occurred at residues lining both substrate and O2 transport tunnels enabling tighter binding of the target substrates in the active site. Increased oxygenation efficiencies measured in vitro for the various enzyme (variant)-substrate combinations correlated linearly with in vivo changes in growth rates for evolved Acidovorax strains expressing the variants. Our data suggest that the selective pressure from oxidative stress towards more efficient oxygenation by Rieske oxygenases was most notable when O2 uncoupling exceeded 60%.

Yet, models for precisely predicting the conductance of a nanopore in both an open and a blocked state are lacking, which leads to significant errors in the determination of the expected blockage depth from a given translocating molecule and of the pore diameter and length. Here, using oblate spheroidal coordinates as a framework to study the conductance of a nanopore, we demonstrate that the widely used Kowalczyk et al. model significantly overestimates the contribution from the access region in the presence of a cylindrical obstruction. We present a highly precise analytical model for the blocked conductance of 2D nanopores and extend it to cylindrical pores of varying membrane thicknesses. Using finite element simulations, our results show that errors in the calculation of the conductance blockage are maximal for pores with aspect ratios of d/L\u22485, but are minimal for both d/L\u226b1 and d/L\u226a1. The model presented is especially precise for ultra-thin membranes, with prediction errors below 3% for all pore sizes tested with a membrane thickness of 0.3 nm.

The majority of free carriers were experimentally found to be generated by hot dissociation in ordered interfaces. Finally, the separation pathways were unable to reach the threshold in amorphous interfaces, which accounts for the experimentally low efficiencies of free carrier generation in amorphous blends.

Requirements for ulta-high purities traditionally necessitate use of virgin sources and thereby hinder the capture, purification, and reuse of these costly gases. Most importantly, gaseous PFCs are incredibly potent greenhouse gases with atmospheric lifetimes on the order of 103-104 years, and thus any environmental emissions have an outsized and prolonged impact on our climate. The development of sorbents that can capture PFC gases from industrial waste streams has lagged substantially behind the progress made over the last decade in capturing CO2 from both point emission sources and directly from air. Herein, we show that the metal\u2013organic framework Zn(fba) (fba2\u2013 = 4,4\u2019-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis-benzoate) displays an equilibrium selectivity for CF4 adsorption over N2 that surpasses those of all water-stable sorbents that have been reported for this separation. This selectivity is enabled by adsorption within narrow corrugated channels lined with ligand-based aryl rings, a site within this material that has not previously been realized as being accessible to guests. Analyses of adsorption kinetics and X-ray diffraction data are used to characterize sorption and diffusion of small adsorbates within these channels and strongly implicate rotation of the linker aryl rings as a gate that modulates transport of CF4 through a crystallite. Multi-component breakthrough measurements demonstrate that Zn(fba) is able to resolve CF4 and N2 under flowing mixed-gas conditions. Taken together, this work illuminates a more complete picture of the dynamic structure of Zn(fba), and also points toward general design principles that can enable large CF4 selectivities in sorbents with more favorable kinetic profiles.

Electrochemically-driven CO2 capture processes utilizing redox-active organics in aqueous flow chemistry show promise for nonflammability, continuous-flow engineering, and the possibility of being driven at high current density by inexpensive, clean electricity. We show that the deprotonated hydroquinone-CO2 adducts, whose insolubility limits the utility of the quinone-hydroquinone redox couple, become soluble when alkylammonium cations are introduced. Consequently, we introduce alkylammonium groups to anthraquinone via covalent bonds, making the resulting bis[3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]-anthraquinones (BTMAPAQs) soluble. We report the first aqueous quinone flow chemistry-enabled electrochemical CO2 capture process, which occurs at ambient temperature and pressure, and show that it proceeds via both a pH-swing and a nucleophilicity-swing mechanism. 1,5-BTMAPAQ reaches the theoretical capture capacity of two CO2 molecules per quinone from 1-bar CO2-N2 mixtures for which the CO2 partial pressure is as low as 0.05 bar, or the applied current density is as high as 100 mA/cm2, or the organic concentration is as high as 0.4 M. The energetic cost ranges from 48 to 140 kJ/molCO2. In a crude simulated flue gas composed of 3% O2, 10% CO2, and 87% N2, 1,5-BTMAPAQ electrolyte reversibly captured and released 50% of the theoretical capacity during an exposure of over 4 hr. It outperforms its isomeric counterparts 1,4-, and 1,8-BTMAPAQ in capture capacity and O2 tolerance, demonstrating a substituent position effect on the reactivity of isomers with CO2 and O2.

In this study, we explore the proposition that these effects are due to mesoscopic mass transport. Basis for the underlying mechanism is the kinetic competition that arises from exchanging surface-bound, yet volatile, reaction intermediates between the electrode and the bulk electrolyte. The electrocatalyst's morphology can be decisive in driving this competition since its surface area directly affects the probability that a diffusing species will return to the surface for continued reaction, rather than escape as an early partially-converted product. We argue that this competition is relevant for a number of technologically important reactions, including e.g. different products during the electrochemical CO2 reduction on Cu-based catalysts. Combining microkinetic and transport modeling in a multi-scale approach, we specifically explore and quantify this effect for various showcase examples in the experimental literature.

Comparing against experimental data further establishes catalyst roughness as a descriptor that unifies the effects of meso-, micro- and atomic-scale morphology on selectivity through transport.

To mitigate this, simple and versatile methods for strong PDI aggregate emission without extensive synthetic demands or adverse effects on photophysical properties are highly desirable but still lacking. In this study, we report a straightforward strategy to enhance the solid-state emission of PDI by introducing through-space charge transfer (TSCT) via controlled radical polymerization, which can efficiently distort the typical face-to-face PDI stacking, enabling greatly enhanced deep red emission. This is achieved by growing electron-donating star-shape styrenic (co)polymers from a multidirectional electron-accepting PDI initiator.

The incorporation of polycyclic aromatic monomers further shifted the emission into the near-infrared region, albeit with a reduced intensity. Overall, the emission of the PDI-based TSCT polymers can be systematically manipulated by leveraging the balance between PDI stacking and the TSCT degree, as confirmed by both experimental study and theoretical calculations.

The search for effective treatments against this highly mutable virus has been a significant challenge. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of Naringenin-7-O-glucoside (N7G), a bioactive flavone glycoside, in the context of COVID-19. Known for its wide-ranging pharmacological effects, including antiviral, antibacterial, antimalarial, and anticancer properties, Utilizing gene expression data from the EBI Expression Atlas, we analyzed lung samples from deceased COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals to understand N7G\u2019s molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Our enrichment analysis revealed a significant association of N7G targets with biological functions and pathways crucial in immune responses and cellular signaling. We highlighted the importance of pathways such as HIF-1, AGE-RAGE, and IL-17 in the pathogenesis of diseases like COVID-19. Suppressing the HIF-1 pathway could mitigate lung inflammation, while targeting the AGE-RAGE pathway, a key player in oxidative stress and inflammation, emerges as a promising strategy. Modulating the IL-17 pathway, implicated in cytokine storms during infection, could also be effective. Furthermore, the relaxin signaling pathway, known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, was identified as a potential target for post-COVID-19 syndrome or long-haul COVID. We prioritized SERPINE1, MMP7, and MMP1 as key therapeutic targets. Elevated SERPINE1 levels in COVID-19 patients have been linked to early mortality risk and are involved in processes like platelet degranulation and fibrinolysis impairment, contributing to thrombocytopenia. MMP1 and MMP7, part of the matrix metalloproteinases family, play crucial roles in tissue homeostasis and have been identified as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19, linked to pulmonary edema and severe inflammatory responses. Our molecular docking and MD simulation studies, conducted over 200 ns in triplicates, demonstrated stable complex formation of N7G with MMP7 and SERPINE1. N7G consistently occupied the zinc binding catalytic site of MMP7, similar to other MMP7 inhibitors, and tightly bound to the inhibitor site of SERPINE1, indicating strong interactions. The MMGBSA analysis confirmed the stability of these complexes, suggesting the effective inhibitory potential of N7G against these targets. Although N7G showed transient complex formation with MMP1, its role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, particularly in inflammation, cannot be ignored. Elevated MMP1 levels have been associated with increased inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients, underscoring its importance as a therapeutic target. In conclusion, our study identifies MMP7, MMP1, and SERPINE1 as critical immune-related targets of N7G in combating COVID-19. The results position N7G as a potential novel inhibitor for treating COVID-19-induced lung inflammation and long-haul COVID. However, these initial findings require further validation. This study contributes to the understanding of natural compounds in viral infection treatment, opening pathways for exploring flavonoids like N7G against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.

While top-down approaches typically require genetic engineering or complex logic circuits, bottom-up assembly of chemical building blocks to form protocell models remains to be a major challenge. Herein we describe giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with biomimetic lipid membranes capable of sensing environmental redox cues. The GUVs employ activity-based sensing through designer phospholipids that are fluorescently activated under a specific reductive (hydrogen sulfide) or oxidative (hydrogen peroxide) condition. These synthetic phospholipids, derived from 1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine, possess a head group with heterocyclic aromatic motifs and, thus, deviate significantly from the natural phosphocholine. Despite structural deviation in the head group, designer phospholipids (0.5\u20131.0 mol%) mixed with natural lipids can vesiculate, and the resulting GUVs (7\u201320 \u00b5m in diameter) remain intact after redox sensing. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations gave insight into how these lipids are positioned within the hydrophobic core of the membrane bilayer and at the membrane-water interface.

One promising approach to stabilize homochirality in such systems is chirality transfer from a chiral auxiliary to a moiety displaying dynamic chirality. Herein, we introduce a new approach for dynamic chirality stabilization in conformationally flexible azahelicene species via crystallization-induced intermolecular chirality transfer in Au(I) complexes featuring azahelicene (dibenzo[c,g]carbazole and benzo[c]carbazole) and enantio-pure chiral N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands with a complementary tailored shape. Crystallization of these azahelicene Au(I) complexes not only suppresses the dynamic chirality of the diben-zocarbazole species, but also stabilizes their homochirality through the intermolecular conjunction between the chiral NHC and dibenzocarbazole ligands. In the Au(I) benzocarbazole complexes, the intermolecular conjunction and chirality transfer in the crystals induces chirality in the initially achiral benzocarbazole ligand. Furthermore, the crystallization of the studied complexes activates their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, which were suppressed in solution. Importantly, chirality transfer to significant CPL enhancement; the complexes that feature chirality transfer within the crystal structure exhibit luminescence dissymmetry factors 5 to 10 times higher than those of the complexes without chirality transfer.", "date": "2023-12-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.); Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Murakami", "abstract": "Perovskite passivation has been vital for obtaining highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Phenylethylammnonium (PEA)-based passivator is one of the most major categories as it is effective in improving PSC performances taking advantages of its large absorption energy over perovskite surface. However, this conventional passivator suffers from thermal stability issues; under thermal stress even at moderate temperature (e.g., 50\u2103) for several minutes, the overlayer of the perovskite passivated with PEA iodide salt (PEAI) transforms to a two-dimensional perovskite of (PEA)2PbI4, which hampers carrier transfer, thus negating the passivation effects and/or degrading the photovoltaic (PV) performances. Herein, we propose a novel yet simple strategy to address the thermal stability issue using a newly synthesized PEA bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PEA-TFSI) additive for poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) hole transport materials (HTMs). Upon the deposition of the PTAA HTM solution with a PEA-TFSI additive over the perovskite layers, the PEA cations spontaneously passivated the perovskite, forming a monolayer-like passivation overlayer. The resulting PEA-based passivation did not cause crystallization at the elevated temperature of 85\u2103; hence, it did not cause PV performance drop due to the thermal stress and retained a higher PV performance compared to the samples with the conventional Li-TFSI additive for over 800 h. Besides, compared to PSCs with Li-TFSI, PSCs with PEA-TFSI exhibited an improvement in stability under humid conditions (30\u2103, 50% relative humidity) for over 600 h, taking advantage of the resulting hydrophobicity. The optimal PEA-TFSI additive enhanced the PV performance, reaching a power conversion efficiency of up to 22.1% (21.2% in the quasi-steady state). These values are relatively high in the PTAA-based PSCs with an n-i-p structure particularly without using lithium species, which is considered to be detrimental for PSCs. These high PV performances were most likely attributed to improved affinity at the interface between PTAA and the perovskite, which is hardly attainable by an aliphatic ammonium passivator, and the PEA passivation effects. These results provide novel insights into the commonly used PEA-based perovskite passivation particularly in combining thermally stable PTAA HTMs and the promising alkylammonium spontaneous passivators, which spurs the further development of PSCs.", "date": "2023-12-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Existing ML software can proficiently model covalent ligands but lack comprehensive utility across large chemoproteomics sites. Challenges persist in predicting and assessing cryptic ligandable sites and sites beyond cysteine, demanding advanced computational tools. As cysteine-ligandable proteins represent only ~20% of the quantifiable proteome, there is a requirement for ligandability mapping of other nucleophilic amino acids.

However, developing a cell-permeable, fluorescent sensor for selective imaging of Mn2+ ions in the aqueous cellular milieu has remained a challenge. This is because Mn2+ is a weak binder to ligand scaffolds when compared to other physiological metal ions, in water. Further, Mn2+ ions quench fluorescent dyes leading to turn-off sensors that are not applicable for in vivo imaging. Hence, the few existing small molecule-based sensors are not exclusively Mn2+ ion selective and suffer from low aqueous solubility. The only reported protein and DNA-based probes are cell-impermeable and show either sub-optimal selectivity or low sensitivity. Here we report a novel, completely water-soluble, reversible, fluorescent turn-on, Mn2+ selective sensor with a Kd of 1.4 \u00b5M for Mn2+ ions.  The probe enters cells within 15 min of direct incubation and was applied to image Mn2+ ions in living mammalian cells in both confocal fluorescence intensity and lifetime-based set-ups. In a key experiment, we show that the probe was able to visualize Mn2+ dynamics in live cells revealing differential Mn2+ localization and uptake dynamics in disease model cells replicating conditions of Mn-transporter defect induced Parkinsonism when compared to normal cells.

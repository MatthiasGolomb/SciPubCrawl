In the case of the Haber-Bosch iron based catalyst, the rate-limiting step is believed to be the decomposition of nitrogen molecules on the Fe(111) surface. This step leads to the production of atomic nitrogen on the surface N* that unless are hydrogenated and eventually released as NH3 molecules, remain on the surface. Thus, it is important to ascertain how a high N* coverage affects nitrogen dissociative chemisorption. To answer this question, we study the properties of the Fe(111) surface at different N* coverage both at room and operando temperature. Using state-of-the-art simulations, we have already found that, at high temperatures, the surface atoms are highly mobile and that the catalytic centers normally associated with the surface activity acquire a finite lifetime [1]. Here, we discover that the N* surface atoms are highly mobile and that coverage reduces but does not eliminate iron mobility. The N* atoms promote the formation of metastable iron triangular surface structures whose chemical composition can be described as F e_3^*N_i^* i = 1, 4. These structures are the result of the frustrated drive of the system towards a more stable Fe4N phase. As a consequence of the formation of these structures, nitrogen atoms tend to cluster, reducing their poisoning effect. At the same time, the reduction in the number of catalytic centers is counteracted by an increase in their lifetime. The combined effect is that the barrier for dissociation is not significantly altered at least up to the maximum coverage studied here of 50%.", "date": "2023-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, there is an absence of algorithms for selecting CG representations of molecules from which complex properties, including molecular electronic structure, can be accurately modeled.

Moreover, CGMP provides the first approach by which to quantify the degeneracy of ``good\" CG representations conditioned on specific prediction targets, facilitating the development of more transferable CG representations.

Due to the stability towards high voltages combined with a relatively high Li-ion conductivity Li3InCl6 has been considered as catholyte with the potential to compensate Li6PS5Cl shortcomings. Despite previous claims about its (electro)chemical instability, we hypothesize that Li3InCl6 remains a promising choice when (i) triple junctions between Li3InCl6, Li6PS5Cl, and Ni-rich cathodes are avoided and (ii) the cut-off voltage is below 3.6 V (vs Li/In). Therefore, a core-shell-structured cathode, i.e., LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O\u2082 particles with a 100 nm thick pin-hole-free Li3InCl6 layer, has been developed using mechanofusion. When employed in a solid-state battery with a cut-off voltage of 3.58V (vs Li/In) a specific capacity enhancement of about 80 mAh/g at any C-rate (0.1 to 1C) was achieved. The stability of Li3InCl6 as well as its functionality to prevent Li6PS5Cl from decomposition and cathode particles from mechanical degradation has been demonstrated, by synchrotron operando XRD and, e.g., post-mortem analysis using Plasma FIB SEM and XPS. This study shows that Li3InCl6 can be used as catholyte when applied appropriately.", "date": "2023-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Coating Materials; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Analysis of the mean square displacement confirms the diameter of the particles in aqueous media, and enables us to compare their brightness with that of biocompatible SWCNTs.

One such area is the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to chemistry. Here we describe a new activity that applies ML regression analysis to the common physical chemistry laboratory experiment on the electronic absorption spectra of cyanine dyes. In the classic version of this experiment, students collect experimental spectra and interpret them using the Kuhn free electron model, based on the quantum mechanical particle-in-a-box (PIB). Our new computational activity has students train regression models of increasing complexity to predict the wavelength of maximum absorption for different cyanine dyes using a set of 13 molecular features. In addition, the activity introduces methods for evaluating and interpreting regression models. Ultimately, students are prompted to use their regression analysis results to generate hypotheses for what molecular properties underlie cyanine dye absorption, leading them naturally to the PIB model. In this report, we provide a dataset, reference code implementations in Mathematica and Python notebooks, and an example lab protocol with an introduction to cyanine dyes and the ML techniques. This activity can be completed in a single 3-hour lab period by upper-level undergraduate students with relatively little prior programming experience.

Measurement campaigns typically measure a subpopulation of facilities, and these measurements are extrapolated to a larger region or basin. Methane emissions from oil and gas systems are inherently variable and intermittent, which makes it difficult to determine whether a sample population is sufficiently large to be representative of a larger region. This work proposes a framework using a case study of an operator in the Green River Basin that assesses selection of sample populations, extrapolation of measurements to a larger region, and methods for estimating the error associated with extrapolation. This work also identifies a new metric, the capture ratio, which has a strong correlation with extrapolation error (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient = -0.75). The strength of this correlation between the capture ratio, which takes into account the skewness of source-level emissions, and extrapolation error suggests that understanding the distributions of source-level emissions distributions is necessary when identifying sample populations and extrapolating measurements. The results from this work can be broadly applied to inform the selection and extrapolation of site measurements when developing methane emission inventories.

One serious concern for any fluorescent voltage indicator, whether chemically synthesized or genetically encoded, is phototoxicity. We have been exploring self-healing fluorophores that use triplet state quenchers (TSQs) as a means to reduce the already low phototoxicity of VoltageFluor dyes developed in our lab. We previously showed that conjugation of the TSQ cyclooctatetraene (COT) to a fluorescein based VoltageFluor dye substantially reduced phototoxicity. Here, we show that this approach can be applied to far-red Silicon rhodamine dyes. COT-conjugated Si-rhodamines show improved photostability and reduced phototoxicity in hiPSC-CMs compared to the unmodified dye. This enables imaging of hiPSC-CMs for up to 30 minutes with continuous illumination. We show that this effect is mediated by a combination of reduced singlet oxygen production and lower loading in the cellular membrane.

The only alternative is then to screen larger numbers of compounds as is done in the present work using computer simulations for a class of near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes.

Based on these principles, we design a large set of complexes that are tested for larger ligand-field splitting in static quantum chemistry calculations.  For the subset of complexes with increased ligand-field splitting, we then perform nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and identify two promising near-infrared emitter with potential similar or increased emission quantum yield compared to the VCl_3(ddpd) reference.

In recent years, several in silico models for SoM prediction have become available, many of which include a machine-learning component. The bottleneck in the further development of these approaches is the coverage of distinct atom environments and rare and complex biotransformation events with high-quality experimental data. In this context, active learning strategies could yield higher data efficiency and, in addition, provide guidance to experimentalists on which atom environments to investigate next for maximum information gain.  Here we report on the development and validation of FAME.AL, an active learning approach for site-of-metabolism prediction that builds on the previously published FAst MEtabolizer (FAME 3).

Siegel", "abstract": "Maintaining interfacial contact between the Li metal anode and the solid electrolyte is a key challenge in developing Li metal-based solid-state batteries (LMSSB). At moderate discharge rates, relatively slower diffusion within the anode results in roughening and void formation in Li near this interface. The resulting reduction in interfacial contact focuses the Li-ion current during plating to a reduced number of contact points, generating high local current densities that nucleate dendrites. One approach to minimize void formation is to apply high stack pressure, which enhances plastic flow in the anode. Nevertheless, the use of pressure has drawbacks, as it facilitates fracture within the solid electrolyte. Here, an alternative strategy for minimizing void formation is described. Using a multi-scale model, it is shown that targets for capacity and current density in LMSSBs can be achieved by reducing the grain size of Li to exploit fast grain boundary (GB) diffusion. Diffusion rates along a diverse sampling of 55 tilt and twist GBs in Li were predicted using molecular dynamics, and found to be 3 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than in the bulk. Using these atomic-scale data as input, a meso-scale model of Li depletion in the anode during discharge was developed. The model predicts that smaller, columnar grains are desirable, with grain sizes of approximately 1 \u03bcm or less needed to meet performance targets.  As micron-sized grains are two orders of magnitude smaller than those in common use, strategies for controlling grain size are discussed.

The structure of the salt with fumaric acid was solved by powder X-ray diffraction. We further characterized the salts with vibrational spectroscopic and thermoanalytical methods. We report a broad tunability of the aqueous solubility of thiabendazole by salt formation. Reformulation with maleic acid provided a 60-fold increase in solubility, while saccharin and oxalic acid gave a modest improvement. Fumaric acid resulted in a solid with only slightly higher solubility. Fur-thermore, saccharin is a sweetener, while the acids taste sour. Therefore, the salts formed also result in an in-trinsic improvement of palatability. These results can inform new strategies for oral and chewable tablet for-mulations for treating helminthic infections.

Molecular dynamics simulations at the molecular mechanics level of theory are best adapted to gain complementary insights to experiments regarding the structure and dynamics of such organic films. However, standard force fields tend to capture only weak physisorption interactions. This is inadequate for ligands that are strongly adsorbed such as carboxylates on metal surfaces. To address this limitation, we employ the Gaussian Lennard-Jones (GLJ) potential, which incorporates an attractive Gaussian potential between the surface and ligand atoms. Here, we develop this approach for the interaction between cobalt surfaces and carboxylate ligands. The accuracy of the GLJ approach is validated through the analysis of the interaction of oxygen with two distinct cobalt surfaces. The accuracy of this method reaches a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of about 3 kcal/mol across all probed configurations, which corresponds to a percentage error of roughly 4%. Application of the GLJ force field to the dynamics of the organic layer on these surfaces reveals how the ligand concentration influences the film order, and highlights differing mobility in the x and y directions, attributable to surface corrugation on Co(1120). GLJ is versatile, suitable for a broad range of metal/ligand systems, and can, subsequently, be utilized to study the organic film on the adsorption/desorption of reactants and products during a catalytic process.", "date": "2023-10-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To address those problems, we have contributed to both dataset creation and predictor benchmark in this study. Firstly, we construct a non-histone acetylation site bench- mark dataset, namely NHAC, which includes 11 subsets according to the sequence length ranging from 11 to 61 amino acids.

To overcome this problem, comprehensive studies of the processes leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona are required. Since such dynamical studies require high spatial and temporal resolution, nanoparticles utilized in it should enable combined experimental and simulation studies. Interactions at nano-bio interface are defined by nanoparticle surface properties such as topography, charge and surface chemistry. Hence, as the preliminary step towards deep understanding of the processes of corona formation it is necessary to develop nanoparticles employing various biocompatible materials and characterize their surface properties. In this work, we applied molecular dynamics simulation to study surface structure of organic core-shell nanoparticles formed by self-assembly of synthetic molecules composed of DOPE lipid, carboxymethylglycine spacer and biotin. Lipid moieties form the hydrophobic core, spacer motifs serve as a hydrophilic shell and biotin residues function as targeting ligand. By mixing such function-spacer-lipid, spacer-lipid and lipid-only constructs at various molar ratios, densities of the ligand and spacer on nanoparticle surface were modified. For convenient analysis of the structure and dynamics of all regions  of nanoparticles\u2019  surface, we compiled topography maps based on atomic coordinates. It was shown that an increase in the density of the shell does not reduce exposure of the core, but increases shell average thickness. Biotin, due to its alkyl valeric acid chain and spacer flexibility, is localized primarily near the hydrophobic core and its partial presentation on the surface occurs only in nanoparticles with higher ligand densities. However, an increase in biotin density leads to its clustering. In turn, ligand clustering diminishes stealth properties of the shell and targeting efficiency. Based on nanoparticle surface structures we determined the optimal density of biotin. Experimental studies reported in the literature confirm these conclusions. We also suggest design tips to achieve preferred biotin presentation. Simulation results are consistent with the synchrotron SAXS profile.

Since experimental access to this data is not straightforward, a new methodology is critically needed to access this information and to accelerate the development of more effective polymer prodrug nanoparticles, and replace the time-consuming and resource-intensive traditional trial-and-error strategy.

While traditional methods mostly relied upon screening large chemical libraries for early-stage drug-design, the AI-based approaches can help identify novel target-specific molecules by sampling from a much larger chemical space. Although this has increased the possibility of finding diverse and novel molecules from previously unexplored chemical space, this has also posed a great challenge for medicinal chemists to synthesize at least some of the AI-designed novel molecules for experimental validation. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a novel forward synthesis-based generative AI method, which is used to explore the synthesizable chemical space. The method uses a structure-based drug design framework, where the target protein structure and a target-specific seed fragment from co-crystal structures can be the initial inputs. A random fragment from a purchasable fragment library can also be the input if a target-specific fragment is unavailable. Then a template-based forward synthesis route prediction and molecule generation is performed in parallel using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method where, the subsequent fragments for molecule growth can again be obtained from a purchasable fragment library. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to utilize MCTS for forward synthesis route prediction. The rewards for each iteration of MCTS are computed using a drug-target affinity (DTA) model based on the docking pose of the generated reaction intermediates at the binding site of the target protein of interest. With the help of the proposed method, it is now possible to overcome one of the major obstacles posed to the AI-based drug design approaches through the ability of the method to design novel target-specific synthesizable molecules.

We have also extended our study to include five complexes reported earlier possessing +4 and +5 oxidation states to offer clues to improve the SMM characteristics. Our calculations reveal several advantages in fine-tuning the oxidation state in lanthanide SMMs, and this includes (i) the lanthanide-ligand covalency found to increase as high as 45% compared to the LnIII counterpart (ii) yield barrier height for magnetization reversal as high as 8500 cm-1, an unprecedented tuning up to three times larger compared to the best-in-class LnIII counterpart (iii) among various ways to stabilise such high-oxidation state including encapsulation yield several targets with HoO2@SWCNT(4,4) predicted to yield an impressive energy barrier of ~5400 cm\u22121 (iv) the stronger lanthanide-ligand bonds also found to help in tuning the spin-phonon relaxation as stronger bonds found to offset the vibrations that cause the relaxation, potentially yield larger blocking temperatures - offering a never-before-seen strategy to new class lanthanide SMMs. ", "date": "2023-10-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Magnetism; Theory - Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The combination of such strategies with automated laboratory equipment and/or high-performance computing in a suggest-make-measure closed-loop constitutes a self-driving laboratory (SDL), which have been endorsed as a next-generation technology for autonomous scientific experimentation. Despite the promise of early SDL prototypes, a lack of flexible experiment planning algorithms prevents certain prevalent optimization problem types from being addressed. For instance, many experiment planning algorithms are unable to intelligently deal with failed measurements resulting from a priori unknown constraints on the parameter space. Such constraint functions are pervasive in chemistry and materials science research, stemming from unexpected equipment failures, failed/abandoned syntheses, or unstable molecules or materials. In this work, we provide a comprehensive discussion and benchmark of BO strategies to deal with a priori unknown constraints, characterized by learning the constraint function on-the-fly using a variational Gaussian process classifier and combining its predictions with the typical BO regression surrogate to parameterize feasibility-aware acquisition functions. These acquisition functions balance sampling parameter space regions deemed to be promising in terms of optimization objectives with avoidance of regions predicted to be infeasible. In addition to benchmarking feasibility-aware acquisition functions on analytic optimization benchmark surfaces, we conduct two realistic optimization benchmarks derived from previously reported studies: inverse design of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials with unknown stability constraints, and the design of BCR-Abl kinase inhibitors with unknown synthetic accessibility constraints. We deliver intuitive recommendations to readers on which strategies work best for various scenarios.

Various factors, such as environmental conditions, composition, and external fields, can influence its outcomes and rates. Indeed, controlling this rate-determining step towards phase separation can affect the resulting material structure and properties, which are crucial for a range of scientific fields. Atomistic simulations can be exploited to gain insight into nucleation mechanisms - an aspect difficult to ascertain in experiments - and estimate nucleation rates. However, the microscopic nature of simulations affects the phase behaviour of nucleating solutions when compared to macroscale counterparts. An additional challenge is the inadequate timescales accessible to standard molecular simulations to simulate nucleation directly; this is due to the inherent rareness of nucleation events, which may be apparent in silico at even high supersaturations. In recent decades, molecular simulation methods have emerged to circumvent length- and timescale limitations. However, it is not obvious which simulation method is most suitable to study crystal nucleation from solution.  This review surveys the recent advances in this field, shedding light on typical nucleation mechanisms and the appropriateness of various simulation techniques for their study. Herein, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the complexities associated with modelling crystal nucleation from solution and identify areas for further research.

In response to these challenges, we present a robust and general approach to bacterial identification based on their unique enzymatic activity profiles. This method delivers results within 90 minutes, utilizing an array of highly sensitive and enzyme-selective chemiluminescent probes. Leveraging our recently developed technology of chemiluminescent luminophores, which emit light under physiological conditions, we have crafted an array of probes designed to rapidly detect various bacterial hydrolytic enzymatic activities, including some associated with antibiotic resistance. The analysis of chemiluminescent fingerprints from a diverse panel of prominent bacterial pathogens has revealed distinct enzymatic activity profiles for each strain. The reported universally applicable identification procedure offers a highly sensitive and expeditious means to delineate bacterial enzymatic activity profiles.

The question as to the thermodynamic stability of such structures has received much less attention. Here, we present a novel experimental method to quantify amyloid fibril stability based on chemical depolymerisation and Taylor dispersion analysis. The relative concentrations of fibrils and monomer at equilibrium are determined through an in situ separation of these species through Taylor dispersion in laminar flow inside a microfluidic capillary. This method is highly sample economical, using much less than a microliter of sample per data point and its only requirement is the presence of aromatic residues because of its label-free nature. Using this method, we investigate the differences in thermodynamic stability between different fibril polymorphs of \u03b1-synuclein and quantify these differences for the first time. Importantly, we show that fibril formation can be under kinetic or thermodynamic control and that a change in solution conditions can both stabilise and destabilise amyloid fibrils.

Here, we model two theoretical mechanisms of forming Boolean gates based on geochemically plausible reaction systems that could have preceded complex biopolymers. The mechanisms exploit simple bistable autocatalytic systems to encode binary variables and use heterogeneous dilution rates to differentially activate or deactivate autocatalysis in different reactors. We found that NOT, AND, and OR gates, as well as more complex logic circuits, can spontaneously arise from connected, well-mixed flow reactors based on (i) catalysis by a heterodimer between mutually inhibitory autocatalysts or (ii) selectively permeable tunnels connecting reactors.

These hybrid states are created by strong coupling between molecules and photons in resonant optical cavities and can even occur in the absence of light when the molecule is strongly coupled with the electromagnetic fluctuations of the vacuum field. We present a first-principles model to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics of such polaritonic states inside optical cavities by leveraging graphical processing units (GPUs). Our first implementation of this model is specialized for a single molecule coupled to a single photon mode confined inside the optical cavity, but with any number of excited states computed using complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) and a Jaynes-Cummings type Hamiltonian. Using this model, we have simulated the excited-state dynamics of a single salicylideneaniline (SA) molecule strongly coupled to a cavity photon with the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) method. We demonstrate how the branching ratios of the photo-deactivation pathways for this molecule can be manipulated by coupling to the cavity. We also show how one can stop the photoreaction from happening inside an optical cavity.

Herein, we detail our recent syntheses of dynamic, nanostructured worm-gel materials and their implementation as regenerable adsorbents for water treatment. Photo-controlled atom transfer radical polymerization-induced self-assembly (PhotoATR-PISA) was employed to synthesize various polymer nanstructures, including dispersed spheres, worms, and vesicles, and nanostructured worm-gels, via the synthesis and simultaneous, in situ assembly of BAB triblock copolymers. Two dynamic, disulfide-functionalized macroinitiators (SS-MI-1 and 2) with different degree of polymerization and one non-dynamic macroinitiator (CC-MI) were synthesized via polymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate) (OEGMA). PhotoATR-PISA was then implemented via the chain extension from SS-MI-1, 2 and CC-MI with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) or benzyl methacrylate (BMA) forming BAB-type triblock copolymer nanoparticles in situ. The final morphology in PhotoATR-PISA was influenced not only by conventional factors such as solids content and block DP but also by unimer exchange rates yielding arrested, nanostructured worm-gels in many instances and arrested vesicle-gels in one instance. These PISA-gel materials were implemented as adsorbents for phenanthrene, a model compound registered as a priority pollutant by US EPA, from aqueous solutions. The chemical tunability of these materials enabled enhanced, targeted removal of phenanthrene facilitated by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions as evidenced by the increased adsorption capacities of PBMA-based PISA-gels when compared to PGMA. Furthermore, the dynamicity of disulfide worm-gels (SS-WG) enabled disulfide exchange-induced regeneration stimulated by UV light. This UV-responsive exchange was investigated for POEGMA macroinitiators as well as dissolved triblock copolymers, dispersed nanoparticles and SS-WG materials. Finally, the regenerability of the PNT-saturated SS-WG adsorbents induced by UV irradiation (\u03bb = 365 nm) was examined and compared to control worm-gels without disulfides demonstrating enhanced recovery of adsorption capacity under mild irradiation conditions.", "date": "2023-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Organic Polymers; Polymer morphology; Environmental Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We discovered that the exposure of CdSe NPLs to Cu(I) precursor led to the transformation of NPLs into Cu2\u2212xSe while maintaining their nanoplatelet morphology. The replacement of Cd(II) with Cu(I) prevailed over the formation of doped structures. In the case of Cu(II) precursor, we observed that Cu(II) was first reduced to Cu(I) before being intercalated into the host lattice, resulting in synthesis of Cu2\u2212xSe, similar to CER with Cu(I) precursors but without preservation of the initial morphology of NPLs. Interestingly, the presence of oxygen was found to facilitate the cation exchange processes in CdSe NPLs, whereas a nitrogen atmosphere suppressed the CER. Despite the similar ionic sizes of Cu(I) and Cu(II), the substitution of Cd(II) with Cu(II) was found to be challenging, possibly due to the involvement of redox processes resulting in the significant deterioration of initial CdSe NPLs.

Intermetallic compounds of a base metal with passive film-forming element are effective oxygen evolution anodes for metal electrowinning.  Cobalt-silicon alloys and titanium-nickel intermetallics are demonstrated as examples and related to the proposed paradigm of electrochemical dealloying. These systems illustrate the effects of scale in practical electrochemistry, where \u2018scale\u2019 has multiple meanings: the transition to practise; formation of surface deposits; and the evolution of the interface in extended use.  In the case of cobalt-silicon alloys, the microstructure of the metal is critical. A highly porous surface layer is developed, within which the active phase is \u2018nanostrands\u2019 of cobalt metal in \u2018nanoconfinement\u2019 within a slowly-dissolving silicide matrix.  Within the confined environment, a saturated solution of cobalt salt causes a salt film over the cobalt metal under which an oxygen-evolving cobalt anodic oxide is stabilised.  In the case of TiNi, a nickel-rich surface forms over a thin titanium anodic oxide. Oxygen evolution occurs by field-assisted electron tunnelling to the surface nickel titanium oxide states. Field-driven ion migration both leads to these active states and leads to a slow dissolution of the metal. There is a useful range of composition between 51 and 55 wt% Ni (46 \u2013 50 at %) which balances ductility against dissolution rate: excess titanium leading to a continuous phase of Ti2Ni results in a very brittle material; separation of TiNi3 leads to more rapid dissolution. In practise however, intrusion of oxygen during casting of large plates segregated Ti as the oxide Ti4Ni2O leading to separation of TiNi3 . The more rapid dissolution of this phase, in association with formation of MnO2 from Mn salts present in plant electrolyte, led in association with oxidation of cobalt salts to deposition of an adherent surface scale under which the solution became strongly acidic.  The accelerated anode dissolution led to an under-scale of TiO2 which further increased acidification. Impractically rapid destruction of the anode resulted. The work illustrates how mass-transport and microstructure in the evolving interphase between electrode and electrolyte can interact in subtle ways important for practical application.", "date": "2023-10-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Alloys", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

One of the notable by products is sugarcane mill mud. This work is focused on the hydrothermal activation of mill mud waste sourced from a sugar mill. The objective was to produce an economically feasible adsorbent material suitable for pesticide adsorption applications. Significant alterations were noted in the mill mud that underwent hydrothermal activation, encompassing discernible chemical and physical modifications, accompanied by altered surface properties. Comprehensive characterisations using electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The hydrothermal activation process resulted in a transformation of the physical structure, shifting from agglomerated multiple layers to discrete forms characterised by single layers. The evaluation of the highest adsorption capacities for organic compounds, carried out using the methylene blue dye assay, demonstrated a significant increase at least three times after activation. It is noteworthy that the hydrothermally activated mill mud displayed a mono-layer adsorption profile, which contrasts with the untreated mill mud sample. The adsorptivity of the activated mill mud was assessed in relation to imidacloprid, a commonly used pesticide in Australian sugarcane farms. The objectives of this evaluation were to assess the efficacy of the mill mud as an adsorbent for pesticide.

Using a combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, valence to core - X-ray emission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, here we showed that 1AlCu proceeds with nitrate mechanism, in which side-on coordination of O2 at a CuI(NH3)xOfw (fw = framework) is the rate-limiting step in the oxidation half-cycle.

Here, we study this system under the influence of a rotating gravitational field. High amplitudes are able to completely disrupt droplet-droplet interactions, making it possible to identify a transition between field-dominated to interaction-dominated regimes. The system displays complex hysteresis behavior, the details of which are connected to the emergence of linear mesoscale structures. These mesoscale features display an elasticity that is governed by the balance between gravity and long-ranged vapor-mediated attractions. We find that disorder plays an important role in determining the dynamics of these features. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to anneal the system by progressively reducing the field amplitude, a process that reduces configurational energy compared to a rapid quench.

By probing the orientational relaxation dynamics of an infrared probe embedded in the polymer matrix, the free volume element size and its probability distribution can be derived. Two distinct timescales of anisotropy decay of the nitrile probe in phenyl selenocyanate at ~10 and ~200 ps were assigned to two different wobbling-in-a-cone (WIAC) motions of the probe. In this study, using ultrafast infrared pump-probe (IR-PP) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we investigate the rotational dynamics of phenyl selenocyanate (PSC), 2-methylphenyl selenocyanate (MPSC), and 2,2-dimethylphenyl selenocyanate (DMPSC) embedded in poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly (2-phenoxyethyl acrylate) (PPEA) and poly (2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) polymers to unravel the role of the internal rotational fluctuation of the nitrile group around the C(Ph)-Se(CN) bond vector on the rotational anisotropy as well as their biocompatible properties. We show that with increasing the steric effect by one or two methyl groups substituted at the ortho positions of the phenyl ring, the short-time rotational anisotropy dynamics of the nitrile group becomes 5-6 times slower in MPSC (28.7 \u00b1 1.4) and DMPSC (31.9 \u00b1 1.8) compared to that in PSC (4.8 \u00b1 0.5 ps), and the corresponding amplitude decreases. These experimental observations indicate that the faster (~10 ps) rotational anisotropy component of phenyl selenocyanate in polymers originates from the internal rotational fluctuation of a nitrile group instead of a WIAC motion. The simulated dihedral fluctuation time-correlation functions of PMMA show that its segmental motions are substantially slower than the long-time component of rotational anisotropy by a factor of ~30-40, suggesting that the slow anisotropy decay component (~200 ps) reflects the static free volume element sizes in these polymers. This approach further reveals a larger free volume element size of 4.90 \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5 for PPEA and 5.07 \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5 in PMEA, having a longer sidechain length than that of PMMA (3.3 \u00b1 0.03 \u00c5), which could potentially impact the water permeability and hence biocompatibility of the respective polymers.

Particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics (PRCFD) simulations are the most promising approach to accurately predict the behavior of these reactors, since they take explicitly into account the local packed bed structure. In this work, a conjugated heat and mass transfer model for use in PRCFD simulations is presented to couple the fluid flow through the fixed bed with transport and reaction in the porous catalyst, while guaranteeing the no-slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface. For this purpose, the solutions of the solid and fluid domain are computed separately and are coupled by calculation and updating the boundary condition at the particle surface. Due to the consideration of secondary gradients, the developed transfer model is also valid for unstructured calculation meshes containing non-orthogonal cells at the fluid-solid interface. Such meshes are often used to resolve complex geometries, such as a packed bed, in a computationally efficient manner. The coupling approach is validated using cases for which an analytical solution or literature correlations derived from experimental data are available. The simulation results of a short catalytic packed bed with rings catalyzing the partial oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride exemplify the potential of PRCFD involving reactions to analyze the catalyst performance in great detail.", "date": "2023-10-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

In metal nanocluster dimers, coupling of the plasmons leads to the emergence of two distinct types of modes: (1) bonding dipole plasmons (BDP), which occurs when charge oscillates synchronously within each nanocluster, and (2) charge transfer plasmons (CTP), which occurs when charge oscillates between two conductively linked nanoclusters. Although TDDFT-based modeling has uncovered some trends in these modes, it is computationally expensive for large dimers, and quantitative analysis is challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the semiempirical quantum mechanical method INDO/CIS produces trends comparable to those seen in TDDFT and enables us to quantify the CTP character of each excited state. In end-to-end Ag nanowire dimers, the longitudinal states have CTP character that decreases with increasing gap distance and nanowire length. In side-by-side dimers, the transverse states have CTP character, and the larger spatial overlap means that the CTP character is larger than in the end-to-end dimers, particularly for the longer nanowires. In side-by-side dimers where one nanowire is shifted along the length of the other, the CTP character of the longitudinal states peaks when the dimer is shifted by two Ag-Ag bond lengths, while the transverse states show decreasing CTP character as displacement increases. Our study demonstrates that INDO is capable of modeling metal nanocluster dimers at a low computational cost, making it possible to study larger dimers that are difficult to analyze using TDDFT.", "date": "2023-10-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As water is inevitable in DAC, DESs designed for DAC must be able to function in the presence of water. Addition of water to DESs is believed to have a strong impact on DES properties, including hydrogen bond networks, molecular transport, and interactions with CO2. This study employs classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the impact of water addition on the structural and intermolecular properties of DESs composed of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cations ([EMIM]) and 2-cyanopyrrolide anions ([2CNPyr]) along with three different hydrogen bond donors - ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and monoethanolamide (MEA). Results show significant structural changes in the DESs due to addition of water, including enhanced interactions between CO2 and [EMIM], [2CNpyr], and MEA.

We report a combined simulation and experimental study of (reversible) ion-transfer reactions involved in anodic Ag corrosion, a model system for interfacial electrochemical processes generating or consuming ions. With the explicit modeling of the electrode potential and a hybrid implicit-explicit solvation model, the density functional theory calculations produce free-energy curves predicting thermodynamics, kinetics, partial charge profiles, and reaction trajectories. The calculated (equilibrium) free-energy barriers (0.2 eV), and their asymmetries, agree with experimental activation energies (0.4 eV) and transfer coefficients, which were extracted from temperature-dependent voltage-step experiments on Au-supported, Ag-nanocluster substrates.  The use of Ag nanoclusters eliminates the convolution of the kinetics of Ag+(aq.) generation and transfer with those of nucleation or etch-pit formation. The results indicate that the barrier is controlled by the bias-dependent competition between partial solvation of the incipient ion, metal-metal bonding and electrostatic stabilization by image charge. Both the latter factors are weakened by more positive bias. We also report simulations of the bias-dependence of defect generation relevant to nucleating corrosion by removing an atom from a perfect Ag(100) surface, which is predicted to occur via a vacancy-adatom intermediate. Together, these experiments and calculations provide the first validated, accurate, molecular model of the central steps that govern the rates of important corrosion/deposition reactions of broad relevance across the energy sciences.", "date": "2023-10-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we have presented a one-pot facile way to introduce Cu and P centres in a NiFe-based nanoalloy to get novel transition metal-based hierarchical nanostructures that show enhanced catalytic activity as well as remarkable stability. As evident from electron micrographs (EMs) followed by Electrochemically Active Surface Area (EASA) calculations, the introduction of Cu and P increases the active surface area compared to NiFe nanoalloy. Understanding the relationship between the local geometry of catalytically active sites and the OER activity is an invincible step for more advanced material fabrication.

This electronic modulation of the newly developed hierarchical structures results in faster OER kinetics with an overpotential of 213 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2.

We develop scalable, diastereomerically pure, six-step synthetic routes with just one chromatographic purification to access four key cis- and trans-piperazine-fused cyclic disulfide and diselenide cores. Fluorogenic redox probes using the disulfide-piperazines are activated >100-fold faster than the previously known monoamines, allowing us to deconvolute the kinetics of the reduction and the cyclisation steps during activation. The cis- and trans-fused diastereomers have remarkably different reductant specificities: the cis disulfides are activated only by strong vicinal dithiol reductants, but the trans-fused disulfides are activated even by moderate concentrations of monothiols such as GSH. Thus, although both disulfides are substrates for redoxins, in cellular applications the cis-disulfide probes were found to selectively report on reductive activity of thioredoxins, while the trans-disulfides are more rapidly but more promiscuously reactive. Finally, we showcase efficient late-stage synthetic diversification of the piperazine-disulfides, promising their broad applicability as robust cleavable cores for redox probes and prodrugs in biology, for solid phase synthesis and purifications, and as stimulus-responsive linkers for bifunctional reagents and antibody-drug conjugates.", "date": "2023-10-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is the most abundant PFAS in drinking water. Although different degradation strategies for PFOA have been explored, none of them disintegrates the PFOA backbone rapidly under mild conditions. Herein, we report a molecular copper electrocatalyst that assists in the degradation of PFOA up to 93% with 99% defluorination rate within 4 h of cathodic controlled-current electrolysis. The current-normalized pseudo-first-order rate constant has been estimated to be quite high for PFOA decomposition (3.32 L h\u20131 A\u20131), indicating its fast degradation at room temperature. Furthermore, comparatively rapid decarboxylation over the first 2 h of electrolysis has been suggested to be the rate-determining step in PFOA degradation. The related Gibbs free energy of activation has been calculated as 22.6 kcal/mol based on the experimental data. In addition, we did not observe the formation of short-alkyl-chain PFASs as byproducts that are typically found in chain-shortening PFAS degradation routes. Instead, free fluoride (F\u2013), trifluoroacetate (CF3COO\u2013), trifluoromethane (CF3H), and tetrafluoromethane (CF4) were detected as fragmented PFOA products along with the evolution of CO2 using gas chromatography (GC), ion chromatography (IC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, suggesting comprehensive cleavage of C\u2013C bonds in PFOAs.

As a result, the overall output color from LEDs is significantly different than the anticipated emission. To unveil the origin of this discrepancy, here, we provide comprehensive analyses and show that the shift in the EL is neither caused by any structural/optical interactions between CsCu2I3 and electron transport layers (ETL) nor by the degradation of 1D CsCu2I3. Instead, it depends on the carrier imbalance on CsCu2I3, mainly due to the difference in electron mobility of the ETLs and the electron density on the CsCu2I3 layer.

It holds significant potential for renewable energy generation, transportation, and storage, heralding a cleaner and more sustainable future. Recent trends have shown increased use of single-atom catalysts (SACs), particularly metal-N4 moieties grown on graphene-based 2D materials, for enhancing ORR efficiency. However, the rational design of SAC for high-performance ORR faces challenges due to unclear structure-property relationships and the limits of conventional experimental trial-and-error approaches. In this study, we harnessed the power of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques, to explore 144 SACs featuring dual interacting M1-N4 and M2-N4 moieties (M1, M2 = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag Ir, Pt, Au), denoted as M1-M2, grown on graphene. Of all the catalysts we examined, Fe-Pd emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive overpotential of 0.211 V vs. RHE in alkaline conditions \u2014 outperforming most previously reported SACs. Even more striking, 25 of the evaluated SACs surpassed the renowned Fe-N4 SAC in catalytic efficiency, including more economically viable alternatives like Fe-Ag.

We further demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by exhaustively screening thousands of [CuOCu]2+ sites across hundreds of Cu-zeolites for the industrially relevant methane activation reaction. Specifically, this large-scale analysis of the entire International Zeolite Association (IZA) database identifies a set of previously unexplored zeolites (i.e., MEI, ATN, EWO, and CAS) that show the highest ensemble-averaged rates for [CuOCu]2+-catalyzed methane activation.

As such, the development of synthetic approaches to achieve precisely ordered material building blocks, a process often complicated by the dynamic and sensitive nature of supramolecular interactions in many organic molecules, is critical in realizing efficient functional devices and emergent physical properties. To this end, we leveraged the long-range anisotropic ordering intrinsic to a class of 1D van der Waals (vdW) crystals comprised of sub-nanometer-thick transition metal trichalcogenide (MCh3; M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta; Ch = S, Se) chain subunits to guide the assembly of supramolecular \u03c0-conjugated peptide building blocks. Through this synthetic strategy, we realized morphologically well-defined organic-inorganic heterointerfaces that display drastically altered photophysical properties and are capable of photocurrent generation. Owing to the structural correspondence between the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions of the organic quaterthiophene (4T)-based \u03c0-conjugated peptides (DDD-4T) and the periodic sulfur ordering along the (100) planes of inorganic niobium sulfide (NbS3) 1D vdW crystals, we found that organic \u03c0-conjugated peptide monomers can readily form 1D supramolecular assemblies on the surface of the underlying inorganic crystal. Optimal assembly conditions allowed for the controlled deposition and growth of the peptide assemblies on the crystal surfaces as validated by a combination of fluorescence microscopy, photoluminescence map-ping, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and computational molecular dynamics simula-tions.

However, electrophoretic separations remain largely unrecognized in contemporary lipidomics research as compared to various chromatographic and ion mobility methods. Herein, we introduce a novel derivatization protocol based on 3-methyl-1-p-tolyltriazene (MTT) as a safer alternative to diazomethane for quantitative phospholipid (PL) methylation (~ 90%), which enables their rapid analysis by multisegment injection-nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-NACE-MS). Isobaric interferences and ion suppression effects were minimized by performing an initial reaction using 9-fluorenylmethyoxycarbonyl chloride prior to MTT with a subsequent back extraction in hexane. This charge-switch derivatization strategy expands lipidome coverage when using MSI-NACE-MS under positive ion mode with improved resolution, greater sensitivity and higher throughput (~ 3.5 min/sample), notably for zwitter-ionic PLs that are analyzed as their cationic phosphate methyl esters. Our method was validated by analyzing methyl-tert-butyl ether extracts of reference human plasma, which allowed for a direct comparison of 48 phosphatidylcholine and 27 sphingomyelin species previously reported in an inter-laboratory lipidomics harmonization study. The potential for plasma PL quantification by MSI-NACE-MS via a serial dilution of NIST SRM-1950 was also demonstrated based on estimation of relative response factors using their reported consensus concentrations from a lipidomics harmonization study. Also, lipid identification was supported by modeling characteristic changes in the electrophoretic mobility for cationic PLs in conjunction with MS/MS.

Here, we developed a molecular computing platform termed as Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD), utilizing the features of DNA polymerase-mediated strand extension and displacement to achieve robust linear weight encoding as well as exponential weight encoding. This approach not only ensures precise molecular diagnostics but also enables precise identification of specific infection types. The DNA polymerase-based digital DNA strand displacement guaranteed high specificity in molecular reactions and reduced the number of DNA strands used in molecular computing. We conducted double-blind experiments to diagnose and identify bacterial or viral infection samples accurately. Furthermore, we demonstrated two approaches (cascade strand displacement and multi-way DNA junction) for computing capability upgradation, enabling weighted calculations for at least 15 feature biomarkers. Digital DNA strand displacement lays the foundation for more intricate and accurate molecular computing and diagnostics.", "date": "2023-10-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Biochemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A growing body of evidence points also to a significant functional role of HA C-terminal domain, which however remains incompletely understood. Our computational study aimed to elucidate the structural and functional interdependencies within the HA C-terminal region, encompassing the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytoplasmic tail (CT). In particular, we were interested in conformational shift of the TMD in response to varying cholesterol concentration in the viral membrane and in its modulation by the presence of CT. Using free energy calculations based on atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we characterized transitions between straight and tilted metastable TMD configurations under varying conditions. We found that the presence of CT is essential for achieving a stable, highly tilted TMD configuration. As we demonstrate, such configuration of HA membrane anchor likely supports the tilting motion of its ectodomain which needs to be executed during membrane fusion. This finding highlights the functional role of, so far relatively overlooked, CT region.", "date": "2023-10-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Cell and Molecular Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we introduce an electrochemical noise measurement technique as a tool for quantification of the formation of a biofouling layer on the surface of gold. The technique uniquely affords thermodynamic and kinetic information without applying an external bias (potential and/or current) hence allowing the system to be appraised in its innate state. The technique relies on the analysis of non-Faradaic current and potential fluctuations that are intrinsically generated by the interaction of charged species at the electrode surface, i.e. gold. An analytical model is extended to explain the significance of parameters drawn from the statistical analysis of the noise signal. This concept is then examined in buffered media in the presence of albumin, a common protein in blood and a known source of fouling layer in biological systems.

In initial mode of action studies, we show that it targets the bacterial membrane without inducing pore formation or depolarisation. Instead, it releases its carbon monoxide ligands around the membrane and inhibits the bacterial respiratory chain.

The need to reduce the environmental impact and toxicity of plasticizers means that viable alternatives to phthalates must be found. This has become a major current challenge. Bacterial polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) like poly(hydroxy-octanoate) (PHO) appear to be promising precursors for meeting these expectations. Bacterially synthesized from sustainable resources such as plastic waste or biomass, PHOs possess ester functions and alkyl side chains that are relevant for plasticizing some rigid polymers such as PVC or thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). In this preliminary and conceptual study, oligomers of PHO with terminal hydroxyl functions (PHO-diol) were successfully synthesized by transesterification from PHO. The addition of alkyl chain ends was achieved by reaction with hexyl mono-isocyanate, to produce PHO-hexyl. These 2 compounds were tested for their plasticizing properties. Rigid PVC and TPU matrices were selected to evaluate the different additives (PHO-diol, PHO-hexyl and two conventional reference phthalates) at different concentrations. Polymer glass transition temperatures (Tg) were significantly reduced with all plasticizers. Plasticizing effects similar to those of phthalates were obtained with PHO-hexyl, both on the thermal and mechanical properties, compared to PHO-diol wich shows less plasticizing effects. The processability of a very rigid and brittle bio-based TPU was greatly improved with the addition of just 15 % of PHO-hexyl as plasticizer into the TPU matrix, as well as with the commercial phthalates. It is opening up a wide range of applications for this previously hardly exploitable sustainable betulin-based TPU. PHO-hexyl is thus emerging as a very promising example of a sustainable plasticizer and a potentially credible alternative to phthalates.

We exemplify this by extending the BaYxSn1-xO3-x/2 solid solution beyond the reported limit to a previously unreported composition and by exploring the Nb-Al-P-O composition space showing the applicability of the workflow to polyanion-based compositions beyond oxides.", "date": "2023-10-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Solid State Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We propose new biomimetic fluorescent lipid microparticles for membrane receptor targeting and sensing. The particles are functionalized with tailor-made fluorescent lipids targeted towards lectins or biotin membrane receptor and can be specifically recognized and internalized by cells as evidenced by their phagocytosis in primary murine bone-marrow derived macrophages. By using a FRET pair of fluorescent mannolipids, it was possible to detect the presence of concanavalin A in solution by energy transfer showing that the particles can sense receptor binding at the interface and the associated movement of the ligands at the site of adhesion.

However, cancer cells downregulate gasdermin and develop membrane repair mechanisms to resist pyroptosis. Therefore, an artificial membrane disruptor (AMD) that can directly mediate membrane rupture in pyroptosis-deficient cells and induce antitumour immune responses in a controllable manner is valuable in preclinical and clinical research. Here, we have established a micron-scale Ce6-based artificial membrane disruptor (AMD) to directly induce plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in gasdermin-deficient tumour cells. Compared to free Ce6 molecules, micron-scale AMDs specifically localised Ce6 to the plasma membrane without labelling other organelles. Due to the plasma membrane specificity, AMDs mediated irreversible and fast PMR under 660 nm red light. In addition, our AMDs were able to mediate PMR and lytic cell death in a catalytic manner, such that the Ce6 used by AMDs is one-fifth that of Ce6 alone when mediating 80% of cancer cell death. In vivo, our AMDs exhibited tumour targeting and penetration, indicating that light-driven PMR was tumour specific. We applied AMDs to antitumour therapy in gasdermin-deficient tumours, the results showed that all tumours could be efficiently eliminated with negligible damage to major organs by synergising with anti-PD-1 therapy. Tumour regression was correlated with PMR-mediated inflammation and T-cell-based immune responses. Our study provides new insights for designing the bioinspired membrane disruptor for PMR and mediating anti-tumour immunotherapy. In addition, AMD is a reliable tool for investigating the immunogenicity of PMR in vitro and in vivo.", "date": "2023-10-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Transition metals, especially the less expensive and more abundant 3d metals, are appealing as catalysts for ethanol dehydrogenation. As a single atom adsorbed to ethanol, these metals are likely to have enhanced selectivity and activity, in addition to maximized utilization efficiency. Density functional theory calculations were performed with Gaussian16 to investigate these ideas using both the B3PW91 and PBEPBE functional. The presented work explores the use of 18 different single metal atoms as catalysts in the first dehydrogenation of ethanol. All of the 3d metals, as well as eight 4d and 5d metals, were investigated as catalysts for this reaction. Three ethanol dehydrogenation pathways were studied for each metal catalyst: \u03b1-H, \u03b2-H, and o-H cleavage. Analysis of the energies of each reaction allowed for a determination of the dehydrogenation pathway most favored by each metal catalyst, and ultimately yielded a top catalyst for each dehydrogenation pathway. Based on the results of these calculations, the best predicted catalyst for o-H cleavage was scandium, for \u03b2-H and \u03b1-H cleavage was platinum. However, differences in the B3PW91 and PBEPBE results suggest that \u03b2-H cleavage could also be favored for Pt, and that another possible top catalyst for \u03b2-H cleavage could be Pd.

Manufactured via extrusion, these monoliths often contain a heterogeneous distribution of channels, due to defects in the die or inhomogeneous drying. The effect of such heterogeneities on CO2 capture process performance is not well investigated. In this modelling work, the performance of a fixed bed, an ideal monolith and monoliths containing a wall size distribution are compared in a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) cycle.  At high adsorption gas velocities, using a monolith allows for a higher productivity (0.8 mmol/kg s) compared to a fixed bed (0.68 mmol/kg s) and a lower energy demand (190 kWh /ton CO2 versus 320 kWh/ton CO2). When the monolith contains a distribution of wall sizes, the process performance decreases. The recovery drops from 81 % to 65 % for the widest distribution studied (3\u03c3=120%). Similarly, the throughput drops from 0.8 mmol/kg s to 0.6 mmol/kg s and the energy demand increases from 190 kWh /ton CO2 to 270 kWh/ton CO2.

We present a comparative analysis of OP/TOP descriptors using CASSCF and DCD-CAS(2) wavefunctions for a diverse range of molecular systems, including X$-$O bonds in X$-$OH (where X = H, Li, Na, H$_2$B, H$_3$C, H$_2$N, HO, F) and Li$-$X' (where X' = F, Cl, and Br) molecular test systems.

Additionally, we examine the Li--F dissociation profile using OP/TOP descriptors. Our study reveals that chemical bonds formed between atoms with varying electronegativities exhibit overlap density shifted towards the more electronegative atom, as predicted by the OP/TOP descriptors. Quantitative assessments using critical point overlap density and its Laplacian descriptors show reduced spreading in bonds with increasing electronegativity differences. The sensitivity of OP/TOP descriptors to ionic/neutral inversion during Li--F dissociation showcased their potential in elucidating intricate bond phenomena.

An orthorhombic CsPbBr3 perovskite nano-crystal (NC) obtained from bromide precursor dibromoisocyanuric acid, can work efficiently as a visible light photocatalyst (blue LED, 5 mol % and TON ~ 18.11) under O2 atmosphere and in acetonitrile (dielectric constant \u03b5 ~ 37.5). The synthesis of diaryl sulfides and a diaryl selenide were achieved via template-free C-H functionalization of electron-rich arenes. The electron-rich arenes also helped to enhance the stability of the CsPbBr3 perovskites photocatalyst within the reaction system. The orthorhombic and bromide-rich CsPbBr3 NC displayed superior photocatalytic activity than cubic CsPbBr3 NCs and was found to be environmentally benign. After the reaction, only 32 ppb of Pb(II) was leached out (ICP-OES analysis) which is quite lower than the maximum permissible limit for drinking water of humans (50 ppb).", "date": "2023-10-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of their biological functions in a spatio-temporal perspective, there is a great need for nanoscale sensitive tools that allow real-timeiin detection of these reactive species. Currently, intracellular radical probes are based on chemical reactions that could significantly alter radical levels during detection. Due to the excellent biocompatibility and favorable photophysical properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV\u2012) centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (fNDs), the fNDs can serve as a powerful and chemically inert nanotool for intracellular radical detection. In this study, a positively charged nanogel (NG) coating was prepared to prevent the precipitation of fNDs and promote cellular internalization. After internalization of nanodiamond-nanogels (fND-NGs), different stimulators, namely somatostatin (SST), triphenylphosphonium (TPP), and trans-activator of transcription (TAT) peptide, which are widely used cell- or organelle- targeting ligands in medicine, drug delivery, and diagnostics, were applied to stimulate the cells. In parallel, the intracellular radical changes under stimulation of SST, TPP, and TAT ligands were monitored by fND-NGs in a home-built ODMR microscope. Our method allows for detecting intracellular radicals in-situ and monitoring their real-time changes during incubation with the targeting ligands in a single living cell.

We establish quorum sensing in emulsion droplet swarms that float at a water surface and cluster above a critical density. Our design involves competition between 1) a surface tension gradient that is generated upon release of a surfactant from the oil droplets, and thereby drives their mutual repulsion, and 2) release of a surfactant precursor from the droplets, that forms a strong imine surfactant which suppresses the surface tension gradient and thereby causes droplet clustering upon capillary attraction. The production of the imine-surfactant depends on the population density of the droplets releasing the precursor, so that the clustering only occurs above a critical population density. We exploit the pH-dependence of the imine-surfactant formation to trigger quorum sensing upon a base stimulus, establish dynamic droplet swarms that cluster and spread upon spatiotemporally varying acid and base conditions, and couple the clustering of two droplet subpopulations to a chemical reaction that generates of a fluorescent signal. We foresee that quorum sensing enables control mechanisms in droplet-based systems that display collective responses in contexts of e.g. sensing, optics or dynamic controlled droplet-reactors.

The first approach draws upon Fermi-Dirac statistics to elucidate the behaviour of electrons in mesoscopic systems. This classical framework has provided valuable insights into the quantum mechanical aspects of persistent currents in confined metal structures. In contrast, a very recent and promising theoretical avenue incorporates the concept of spin-orbit coupling, which has emerged as a novel explanation for mesoscopic persistent currents. This approach highlights the role of intrinsic spin properties of electrons and their interactions with the crystal lattice, offering a fresh perspective on this phenomenon. Moreover, this paper underscores the important role played by geometry in shaping mesoscopic persistent currents.

However, there has not been a detailed analysis of the mechanism including the aqueous formation equilibria and the absorption spectra of the iron chlorides; neither has there been an analysis of which iron chloride is the main chromophore. Here we present the results of experiments of photolysis FeCl_3 \u00b7 6H_2O in specific wavelength bands, an analysis of the absorption spectra of the title compounds from n=1..4 made using density functional theory, and the results of an aqueous phase model that predicts the abundance of the iron chlorides with changes in pH and ion concentrations. Transition state analysis is used to determine the energy thresholds of the dissociations of the species. Based on a speciation model with conditions extending from dilute water droplet to acidic seawater droplet to brine to salty crust, and the absorption rates and dissociation thresholds, we find that FeCl_2^+ is the most important species for chlorine production for a wide range of conditions. The mechanism was found to be active in the range of 400 to 530 nm with a maximum around 440 nm.

Single particle detection presents a substantial challenge due to its time-consuming process and is conducted solely offline. To get more information about the distribution, fluxes and sources of microplastics in the atmosphere, a reliable and fast online measurement technique is of utmost importance. Here we demonstrate the use of autofluorescence of microplastic particles for their online detection with a high sensitivity towards different widely used polymers.

This study contemporaneously deployed two top-down (TD) aerial methods across 14 midstream facilities, extending work done in Brown et al.1. Methods produced multiple whole-facility estimates at each facility, resulting in 773 individual paired estimates (same facility, same day), and robust mean estimates for each facility. Mean estimates for each facility, aggregated across all facilities, differed by nearly 2:1 (49% [32% to 68%]). At 6 of 14 facilities, the methods produced mean estimates that differed by more than a factor of two. These data suggest that one or both methods did not produce accurate facility-level estimates, at a majority of facilities and in aggregate across all facilities.\n\tOverall results are augmented with two case studies where TD estimates at two pre-selected facilities were coupled with comprehensive onsite measurements to understand factors driving the divergence between TD and bottom-up (BU) emissions estimates. In 3 of 4 paired comparisons between the intensive onsite estimates and one of the TD methods, the intensive onsite surveys did not conclusively diagnose the difference in estimates. In these cases, our work suggests that the TD methods mis-estimate emissions an unknown fraction of the time, for unknown reasons. While two methods were selected for this study, it is unlikely that the issues identified here are confined to these two methods; similar issues may exist for other similar whole-facility methods, on midstream and/or other facility types. These findings have important implications for the construction of voluntary and regulatory reporting programs that rely on emission estimates for reporting, fees or penalties, or for studies using whole-facility estimates to aggregate TD emissions to basin or regional estimates.\n", "date": "2023-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The properties of D-A dimer models, computed with electronic structure calculations, are often employed to predict properties of D-A materials. One of the most important D-A dimer quantities is the degree of charge transfer (DCT) in the S1 state, which correlates with properties such as fluorescence lifetimes and intersystem crossing rates. Predictive metrics of the S1 DCT generally require an excited state quantum chemistry calculation. Presented here is a novel metric for predicting the degree of charge transfer (DCT) in the S1 electronic state of D-A materials, computed solely with ground state orbital analysis. This metric computes the average of two quantities: (1) the degree of similarity between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in the donor molecule and the D-A complex and (2) the degree of similarity between the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in the acceptor molecule and the D-A complex. A linear relationship between this similarity metric and the DCT in the S1 state (HOMO \u2192 LUMO transition) is demonstrated for a data set of 31 D-A dimers. The integration of this novel orbital structure- function relationship into high-throughput screening methods is discussed alongside best practices for choosing molecular geometries and quantifying the DCT.", "date": "2023-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, analyzing fluorescent radicals at ambient conditions remains a challenging task, because radicals are usually unstable in air. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, research aimed at controlling fluorescence wavelengths through substituent changes has not yet been accomplished. Here, we report diverse metastable diarylacetonitrile (DAAN) radicals, which contain different substituents, generated by polymeric mechanochemical reactions. The DAAN radicals, generated by ball-milling powdered polystyrene together with DAAN derivatives, were dispersed within the polystyrene matrix, where they retained their radical state, which allowed measuring solid-state fluorescence spectra. These measurements revealed that a wide range of fluorescence wavelengths from green to red (\u03bbem,max = 517\u2013635 nm) can be achieved only by changing the substituents on the aromatic rings in these DAAN radicals. This phenomenon has not been observed for the well-studied triarylmethyl radicals. The fluorescence wavelength of these DAAN radicals can be precisely estimated by time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The amount of DAAN radicals generated upon ball-milling is discussed in conjunction with DFT calculations and experimental results. Our results suggest that the orbital interactions with polymeric mechanoradicals, the bond-dissociation enthalpy, and the steric protection of the radical center are of paramount importance for the generation of DAAN radicals. The results of this study can be expected to provide useful guidelines for the development of advanced fluorescent radicals.", "date": "2023-10-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The validation of the CAT-NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR-triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer-aided screening, CAT-NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue-penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote-controlled rescue of drug molecules.

Despite advances in stem cell and gene therapy as well as the recent approval of a new anti-sickling drug, therapeutic limitations subsist. Herein, we investigate, through molecular dynamics (MD), the effect of nine 5-mer cyclic peptides (CPs), tailor-designed to bind to the hydrophobic pocket or its surroundings, involved in key lateral contacts of HbS fibers. The size of the CPs was chosen to minimize proteolysis and favor cell penetration, while still allowing blocking the abovementioned region. Our results show that the CPs bind to the HbS pocket, orthogonally to the surface of the protein, with some revealing exceedingly long residence times. These CPs display a moderate to high specificity, exhibiting molecular recognition events in unbiased simulations, even at a HbS:CP (1:1) ratio. Further, hydration and binding free energies from alchemical and umbrella sampling MD indicate that all CPs should be soluble, although hydrophobic peptides are slightly self-aggregation prone. The respective CP-CP dimerization free energy is, nevertheless, higher (by a factor of ~ 6) than the HbS-CP binding free energy. A much lower (by a factor of ~ 6) HbS-CP binding free energy, longer residence times, and higher specificity are also found relative to a previously reported CP with modest in vitro antisickling activity.

Recently, the single chip integration of a DNP microsystem operating at 11 GHz (ESR)/16 MHz (NMR) has been demonstrated [27]. Here, we report on single chip DNP microsystems operating at 200 GHz (ESR)/300 MHz (NMR). The single chip integrated microsystems consist of a single or an array of microwave oscillators operating at about 200 GHz for ESR excitation/detection and of a radio frequency receiver operating at about 300 MHz with frequency downconversion for NMR detection. The proposed microsystems, integrated into a single chip of about 1 mm^2, eliminate the need of a high power microwave generator (e.g., a gyrotron) and high quality microwave waveguides. The NMR excitation is performed with a non-integrated coil. To exemplify its possible applications, 1H DNP enhanced NMR experiments on solid samples of volumes from 100 pL to 4 nL are performed at temperatures from 15 to 300 K.

Given that sebum sampling is facile and non-invasive, its potential for use in clinical biochemistry diagnostic assays should be explored including the parameters for standard operating procedures around collection, transport, and storage. To this aim we have here investigated the reproducibility of mass spectrometry data from sebum in relation to both storage temperature and length of storage. Sebum samples were collected from volunteers and stored for up to four weeks at a range of temperatures: ambient (circa 17 \u02daC), -20 \u02daC and -80 \u02daC. Established extraction protocols were employed and the samples were analysed by two chromatographic mass spectrometry techniques and data investigated using PCA, PLS-DA and ANOVA.\nWe cannot discriminate samples as a function of storage temperature or time stored in unsupervised analysis using data acquired via TD-GC-MS and LC-IM-MS, although the sampling of volatiles was susceptible to batch effects.  This study indicates that the requirements for storage and transport of sebum samples that may be used in clinical assays are far less stringent than for liquid samples and indicate that sebum is suitable for remote and at home sampling prior to analysis.\n", "date": "2023-10-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In contrast to their classical SN1 and SN2 reactions, we present an al-ternate perspective, the catalytic nature of alkyl electrophiles through noncovalent interactions (NCIs). The involvement of NCIs by carbon electrophiles (possessing polar Csp3-X bonds) in stabilizing conformations of small molecules and biomole-cules has recently been discovered. Nevertheless, their catalytic role in activating small molecules has not been observed. As the \"X\" group evolves into an effective leaving group, carbon electrophiles develop strong positive potentials on the carbon surface (\u03c3-hole). However, small atomic size and steric congestion resulting from the presence of four groups around the carbon atom pose challenges in establishing strong \u03c3-hole interactions with nucleophilic acceptors. This unique behavior of alkyl electrophiles has deterred chemists from exploring their potential as catalysts in chemical transformations. In groundbreaking revelation, we demonstrate for the first time that alkyl electrophiles function as Lewis acid catalysts in activating carbonyls for acetal formation and related reactions through NCIs. We meticulously chose a range of alkyl electrophiles and discovered a striking correlation between their molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface energies and their catalytic efficacy in acetal-forming reactions. Our comprehensive approach, which encompassed both experimental and theoretical investigations, provided robust support for the catalytic potential of alkyl electrophiles through non-covalent carbon bond interactions.

Existing automatic PES mapping tools usually rely on predefined knowledge or on computationally expensive on-the-fly quantum-chemical calculations. In this work, we have developed a method for discovering novel reaction pathways and automatically mapping out the PES when only being given a starting species. We have therefore extended the reactive molecular dynamics simulation tool ChemTraYzer2.0 (Chemical Trajectory Analyzer, CTY) for this PES-mapping algorithm. To explore PESs with low-temperature reactions, we applied the acceleration method Collective Variable-driven Hyperdynamics (CVHD). This involved the development of tailored collective variable (CV) templates, which are discussed in this study. The PES mapping algorithm can generate new seed species, automatically start replica simulations for new pathways, and stop the simulation when a reaction has been found, reducing the computational cost of the algorithm. It is validated for known pathways in various pyrolysis and oxidation systems: hydrocarbon isomerization and dissociation (C4H7 and C8H7 PES), mostly dominant at high temperatures, low-temperature oxidation of n-butane (C4H9O2 PES) and cyclohexane (C6H11O2 PES). As a result, in addition to new pathways showing up in the simulations, common isomerization and dissociation pathways were found very fast: for example, 44 reactions of butenyl radicals including major isomerizations and decompositions within about 30 minutes wall time and low-temperature chemistry such as the internal H-shift of RO2 \u2192 QO2H within one day wall time. Furthermore, since CTY keeps track of all found geometries of the reactants, transition states, and products, PES mapping facilitates automated higher-level calculations without a priori knowledge.

J. S. Mey", "abstract": "Markov state models (MSM) are a popular statistical method for analyzing the conformational dynamics of proteins, including protein folding. With all statistical and machine learning (ML) models choices must be made about the modeling pipeline that cannot be directly learned from the data. These choices, or hyperparameters, are often evaluated by expert judgment or, in the case of MSMs, by maximizing variational scores such as the VAMP-2 score. Modern ML and statistical pipelines often use automatic hyperparameter selection techniques ranging from the simple: choosing the best score from a random selection of hyperparameters to the complex: optimization via e.g., Bayesian optimization. In this work, we ask whether it is possible to automatically select MSM models this way by estimating and analysing over 16'000'000 observations from over 280'000 estimated MSMs. We find that differences in hyperparameters can change the physical interpretation of the optimization objective making automatic selection difficult.

However, other parameters which specify the VAMP-2 score (lag time and number of relaxation processes scored) have only negligible influence on model selection.

The main technique in TDA is persistent homology, which tracks topological invariants over the filtration of point cloud data using algebraic topology.

We address these challenges by introducing knot data analysis (KDA), a new paradigm that incorporating curve segmentation and multiscale analysis into the Gauss link integral.  The resulting multiscale Gauss link integral (mGLI) recovers the global topological properties of knots and links at an appropriate scale but offers multiscale feature vectors to capture the local structures and connectivities of each curve segment at various scales. The proposed mGLI significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in benchmark protein flexibility analysis, including earlier persistent homology-based methods.

Challenges for computing thermodynamic and kinetic quantities for pharmaceutically relevant receptor-ligand complexes include the size and flexibility of the ligands, large-scale conformational rearrangements of the receptor, accurate force field parameters, simulation efficiency, and sufficient sampling associated with rare events. Our recently developed multiscale milestoning simulation approach, SEEKR2 (Simulation Enabled Estimation of Kinetic Rates v.2), has demonstrated success in predicting unbinding (Koff) kinetics by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in regions closer to the binding site. The MD region is further subdivided into smaller Voronoi tessellations to improve the simulation efficiency and parallelization. To date, all MD simulations are run using general molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. The accuracy of calculations can be further improved by incorporating quantum mechanical (QM) methods into generating system-specific force fields through reparameterizing ligand partial charges in the bound state. The force field reparameterization process modifies the potential energy landscape of the bimolecular complex, enabling a more accurate representation of the intermolecular interactions and polarization effects at the bound state. We present QMrebind (Quantum Mechanical force field reparameterization at the receptor-ligand binding site), an ORCA-based software that facilitates reparameterizing the potential energy function within the phase space representing the bound state in a receptor-ligand complex. With SEEKR2 Koff estimates and experimentally determined kinetic rates, we compare and interpret the receptor-ligand unbinding kinetics obtained using the newly reparameterized force fields for model host-guest systems and HSP90-inhibitor complexes. This method provides an opportunity to achieve higher accuracy in predicting receptor-ligand Koff rate constants.

However, only a small number of analyses are conducted in negative ion mode, which has led to a dogmatic bias toward positive ion mode despite advantageous properties of the negative polarity, including lower background noise and divergent tandem mass spectrometry behavior.  We hypothesized that this bias was rooted in the relatively poor ionization efficiency of anionic functional groups seen in biochemistry; to explore this notion herein we evaluated 25 ions based on three criteria: (1) signal intensity relative to a sodium dodecylsulfate internal standard; (2) resistance to collision induced dissociation based on survival of the precursor ion; and (3) diagnostic tandem mass spectrometry behavior. Among these species, highly fluorous ions exhibiting weakly coordinating and hydrophobic properties contributed to enhanced signal intensities. Trifluoromethanesulfonyl-containing ions proved to be unexpectedly labile, while tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate anion (23) and bis(nonafluoro-1-butane)sulfonimidate (25) were determined to be of optimal signal intensity with signal intensity ratios relative to sodium dodecylsulfate (12 + Na+) of 332.0% \u00b1 25.0% and 939.0% \u00b1 92.0%, respectively, as well as survival yields of 100.0% \u00b1 0.0% and 72.6% \u00b1 0.8% at \u201350 eV. To further emphasize their optimal signal intensity, ions tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate anion (23) and bis(nonafluoro-1-butane)sulfonimidate (25) were comparable in signal intensity across solvents of acetonitrile, methanol, isopropanol, water, and their respective 1:1 mixtures. Facile preparation of various salts of bis(nonafluoro-1-butane)sulfonimidate led to additional evaluation of cation effects where the signal intensity ratio ranged from 939.0% \u00b1 92.0% to 3195.0% \u00b1 145.0% across K+, NH4+, Na+, and H+ counter cations. The dogma of negative ion mode being less sensitive was then challenged by the analysis of the signal intensity of ion 25 to tetra-n-butylammonium, tetra-n-butylphosphonium, and (4-methylphenyl)diphenylsulfonium cations. These experiments showed that 25 was more sensitive by between 136.2% \u00b1 5.5% and 180.7% \u00b1 13.8%, thereby successfully challenging the positive polarity bias.", "date": "2023-10-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using element and oxidation state specific near-ambient pressure XPS\n(NAP-XPS) to probe charge transfer and second order, non-\nlinear vibrational spectroscopy, which is sensitive to symmetry changes based on charge (de)localization coupled with DFT a detailed picture of environmental effects on charge-transfer induced spin transitions is presented. The molecular cluster, Co3Fe2(tmphen)6(\u03bc-CN)6(t-CN)6, abbrev. Co3Fe2, shows changes in electronic behavior depending on chemical environment. NAP-XPS shows that temperature changes induce a metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) in Co3Fe2 between a Co and Fe center, while cycling between ultrahigh vacuum and\n2 mbar water at constant temperature, causes oxidation state changes not fully captured by the MMCT picture. Sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) probes the role of the cyanide ligand, which controls the electron (de)localization via the superexchange coupling. Spectral shifts and intensity changes indicate a change from a charge delocalized, Robin-Day Class II/III high spin state to a charge localized, Class I low spin state consistent with DFT. In the presence of a H-bonding solvent the complex adopts a localized electronic structure, while removal of the solvent delocalizes the charges and drives a MMCT. This change in Robin-Day classification of the complex as a function of chemical environment results in\nreversible switching of the dipole moment, analogous to molecular multiferroics.

Different analytical strategies aim to characterise certain facets of particles but are difficult to combine to provide a more comprehensive picture.\nIn this work, we suggest the on-line hyphenation of optofluidic force induction (OF2i) with Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (ICP-ToF-MS) to harness their complementary technology-specific advantages and to promote comprehensive particle characterisations.

Its nanoparticles, known as catalytic labels or nanozymes, exhibit remarkable peroxidase-like properties and serve as effective antioxidants. Unsurprisingly, the demand for synthesizing Prussian Blue nanoparticles with customizable sizes is on the rise. In this study, we unveil a novel approach to synthesizing Prussian Blue nanoparticles. In this work, the synthesis of Prussian Blue nanoparticles by reducing an equimolar mixture of FeCl3 and K3[Fe(CN)6] with hydrogen peroxide in different water-alcohol mixtures was demonstrated for the first time. Alcohols with a lower dielectric constant (propanol-1, isopropyl alcohol, and tert-butanol) contribute to an increase in nanoparticle size, particularly at mole fractions of 0.02-0.05 and beyond. Conversely, alcohols with a higher dielectric constant (ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol, excluding glycerol) demonstrate the ability to decrease nanoparticle size at mole fractions of 0.2-0.26 and higher. Building upon these findings, we present a scalable and reproducible method for preparing small Prussian Blue nanoparticles, measuring 30-40 nm, with enhanced peroxidase-like activity using 79.2% ethylene glycol as a solvent. The proposed mechanism behind the effect of ethylene glycol involves the limitation of both growth and secondary aggregation of Prussian Blue nanoparticles.

Producing them in existing production plants by a rapid isocyanate-free self-blowing process from room temperature (RT) formulations is a long-lasting challenge. The recent water-induced self-blowing of non-isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) formulations composed of a CO2-based tri-cyclic carbonate, diamine, water and a catalyst, successfully addressed the isocyanate issue, however failed to provide foams at RT. Herein, we elaborate a practical solution to empower the NIPU foam formation in record timeframes from RT formulations. We generate cascade exotherms by the addition of a highly reactive triamine and an epoxide to the formulation of the water-induced self-foaming process. These exotherms, combined to a fast crosslinking imparted by the triamine and epoxide, rapidly raise the temperature to the foaming threshold and deliver hybrid NIPU foams in 5 minutes with KOH as catalyst. Careful selection of the monomers enables producing foams with a wide range of properties, as well as with an unprecedented high bio-based content up to 90 wt%. Moreover, foams can be upcycled into polymer films by hot-pressing, offering them a facile reuse scenario. This robust cheap process opens huge perspectives for greener foams of high bio-based contents, expectedly responding to the sustainability demands of the foam sector. It is potentially compatible to the retrofitting of industrial foaming infrastructures, which is of paramount importance to accommodate existing foam production plants and address the huge foam market demands.", "date": "2023-10-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

By modulating input pulse voltages and flash times, SiC with two different phases, 3C-SiC and 6H-SiC, can be selectively synthesized, each with phase purity of 90-99%.

N-AC was prepared from kraft lignin - a carbon-rich and abundant by-product of the pulp industry, using nitric acid as the activator and urea as the N-dopant. The reported carbonization process under a nitrogen atmosphere renders a product with a high yield of 30% even at high temperatures up to 800 \u00b0C. The N-AC exhibited a substantial high N content (4\u20135 %), the presence of aliphatic and phenolic OH groups, and a notable absence of carboxylic groups, as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Boehm\u2019s titration. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of mesopores with an average diameter of 3 nm. Porosity analysis indicated that micropores constituted the majority of the pore structure, with 86% of pores having diameters less than 0.6 nm. According to BET adsorption analysis, the developed porous structure of N-AC boasted a substantial specific surface area of 1000 m2 g\u22121. N-AC proved to be a promising adsorbent for air and water purification. Specifically, N-AC exhibited a strong affinity for CO2, with an adsorption capacity of 1.4 mmol g\u22121 at 0.15 bar, and 20 \u00b0C and it demonstrated the highest selectivity over N2 from the simulated flue gas system (27.3 mmol g\u22121 for 15:85 v:v CO2:N2 at 20 \u00b0C) among all previously reported nitrogen-dopped AC materials from kraft lignin. Moreover, N-AC displayed excellent reusability and efficient CO2 release, maintaining an adsorption capacity of 3.1 mmol g\u22121 (at 1 bar and 25 \u00b0C) over ten consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles, confirming N-AC as a useful material for CO2 storage and utilization. The unique cationic nature of N-AC enhanced the adsorption of herbicides in neutral and weakly basic environments, which is relevant for real waters. It exhibited an impressive adsorption capacity for the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at 96 \u00b1 6 mg g\u22121 under pH 6 and 25 \u00b0C according to the Langmuir-Freundlich model. Notably, N-AC preserves its high adsorption capacity towards 2,4-D from simulated groundwater and runoff from tomato greenhouse, while performance in real samples from Fyris river in Uppsala, Sweden, causes a decrease of only 4-5%. Owing to the one-step process, high yield, the annual abundance of kraft lignin, and the use of environmentally friendly activating agents, N-AC has substantial potential for large-scale industrial applications.

Our results show conical intersection topographies are highly sensitive to the electron correlation included in the model: by changing the amount (and type) of correlated orbitals, conical intersection topographies vastly change, and the changes\nobserved do not follow any converging pattern towards the topographies obtained with the largest and most correlated active spaces.

To that end, researchers are turning to organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) as the display materials due to higher energy saving and richer color compared to liquid crystal displays (LCDs). However, one major setback of the OLED technology is that the devices are very sensitive to the impurities present in the OLED materials, impacting device lifetime, stability, and overall performance. The isolation of large quantities of the main OLED components from the synthetic impurities is challenging using the traditional purification process (i.e., train sublimation), which has poor reproducibility, and high capital and operating cost. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) could lend itself as an alternative technique for the profiling of impurities and their purification. In this study, we investigated the use of SFC to analyze a mixture of amorphous monomeric molecular glasses with charge-transporting property typical of OLED materials. The separation behavior of four different chromatographic columns containing the stationary phases 1-aminoanthracene (1-AA), naphthyl, 2-ethylpyridine, and C-18 were examined to perform the SFC separations. The effect of using three different co-solvents (i.e., isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran) to the CO2 mobile phase on the separation selectivity and resolution was also investigated. For the probe mixture used, the naphthyl column in combination with the addition of acetonitrile as co-solvent provided the best separation in terms of resolution.

Controlling, understanding and sometimes mitigating such anisotropy is a critical issue in the development of 3D printing. We demonstrate and quantify in this work electrical anisotropy in conductive materials processed by the so-called Digital Light Processing (DLP) method. In this method, which enjoys high resolution and high speed, layers of polymers, are successively cross-linked by UV irradiation of 2D patterns. Here, we use acrylate based resins and carbon nanotube as conductive fillers for their low percolation threshold that allows realizing conductive and still sufficiently transparent materials for UV irradiation. Conductivity parallel to the layers of 3D printed objects is found to be much greater than conductivity perpendicular to the layers. This electrical anisotropy is explained by the high contact resistance between printed layers. High contact resistance results from the slow diffusion of carbon nanotubes from the uncured material towards the interface of the cured object. We found that implementing a delay time before curing successive layers, or decreasing the matrix viscosity with temperature, to promote diffusion of the conductive particles allow substantial reduction of the contact  resistance between layers. As a result, conductivity anisotropy can be reduced by almost two orders of magnitude.

Four MOFs, namely Sc-TBAPy, Al-TBAPy, Y-TBAPy, and Fe-TBAPy (TBAPy: 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoic acid)pyrene), were characterized and evaluated for their ability to remediate GP from water. Among these materials, Sc-TBAPy demonstrates superior performance in both the adsorption and degradation of GP. Upon light irradiation for 5 min, Sc-TBAPy completely degrades 100% of GP in a 1.5 mM solution. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that Sc-TBAPy exhibits enhanced charge transfer character compared to the other MOFs, as well as suppressed formation of emissive excimers that could impede photocatalysis. This finding was further supported by hydrogen evolution half-reaction (HER) experiments, which demonstrated Sc-TBAPy\u2019s superior catalytic activity for water splitting. In addition to its faster adsorption and more efficient photodegradation of GP, Sc-TBAPy also exhibits selective oxidation of GP, avoiding the formation of toxic aminomethylphosphonic acid observed with the other M3+-TBAPy MOFs. To investigate the selectivity observed with Sc-TBAPy, electron spin resonance, depleted oxygen conditions, and solvent exchange with D2O were employed to elucidate the role of different reactive oxygen species on GP photodegradation. The findings indicate that singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a critical role in the selective photodegradation pathway achieved by Sc-TBAPy. \nIntroduction\n", "date": "2023-10-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Emerging chemical technologies can \u201cupcycle\u201d plastic waste by producing high-value products (e.g., olefins that can be used to produce virgin-grade polymers) and  are more scalable, as they can process a broader range of waste plastics (e.g., complex mixtures obtained from post-consumer and post-industrial waste). In this work, we study the economic and environmental benefits of deploying an upcycling infrastructure in the continental United States for producing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) from post-consumer plastic waste. Our analysis aims to determine the market (economy) size that the infrastructure can create, the degree of circularity that it can achieve, prices for waste and derived products, and environmental benefits of diverting plastic waste from landfill and incineration facilities. The analysis is based on a computational framework that integrates techno-economic analysis, lifecycle assessment, and value chain (supply chain) optimization. Our results demonstrate that the infrastructure generates a market (economy) of nearly 20 billion USD; moreover, we show high market values of upcycled products propagate through the value chain to create positive prices for plastic waste (generating significant incentives for residents to provide their waste). In other words, upcycling technologies open opportunities for residents to receive compensation for providing their plastic waste (waste is a valuable commodity in the infrastructure). Our analysis also indicates that the infrastructure can achieve a degree of circularity of 34% (relative to the total rates of residential plastic waste produced) and leads to significant environmental benefits over alternative waste disposal methods (decreases greenhouse gas emissions of incineration by 69-75\\% and avoids the deployment of 86 new landfills over the next 50 years).

Cohesive kinetic analysis, which is often used in thermocatalysis and involves quantitative model fitting for data collected over a wide range of reaction conditions, requires more data but also provides a more robust strategy for interrogating reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report a robotic system that improves the experimental workflow for collecting electrochemical rate data by automating sequential testing of up to ten electrochemical cells that can each have a different electrode, electrolyte, gas-phase reactant composition, and applied voltage. We use this system to investigate the mechanism of carbon dioxide electroreduction to carbon monoxide at several immobilized metal tetrapyrroles. Specifically, at cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP), and iron phthalocyanine (FePc), we see signatures of complex reaction mechanisms, where observed bicarbonate and CO2 order dependences change with applied potential. We illustrate how phenomena such as electrolyte poisoning and potential-dependent degrees of rate control can explain the observed kinetic behaviors. Our mechanistic analysis suggests that CoPc and CoTPP share a similar reaction mechanism, akin to one that has been previously proposed, whereas the mechanism for FePc likely involves a species later in the catalytic cycle as the most abundant reactive intermediate.

Catherine Lam; Edouard  Asselin", "abstract": "We examined the effects of prolonged exposure to high temperature and water on epoxy-based powder barrier coatings applied to steel panels, which are commonly used in many industrial applications including oil & gas pipelines. The coatings\u2019 performance was evaluated over 85 weeks at 65\u00b0C using deionized water. We also compared the mass transport properties of free-standing coating films with the barrier performance of the coated steel panels. This research lays the groundwork for predicting cumulative damage and time-dependent barrier performance of defect-free coating systems. Despite the fact that these coating systems are intended for decades of in-service use, we found that degradation effects caused by permeant sorption within the coatings can be detected as early as 8 weeks in the ageing process. The first 200 days of exposure emerged as critical for underlying corrosion reactions, marking the completion of epoxy network degradation and the onset of a steady state in mass transport mechanisms. Despite the protective barrier coatings, we observed readily occurring under-coating oxidation of the steel substrate after 182 days, as confirmed by cross-sectional and focused ion beam milling analysis. We also analyzed the adhesion strength of the coated panels over time. The epoxy-based coating\u2019s pull-off strength declines rapidly due to water-induced plasticization, but the adhesion properties of the epoxy network show a slight recovery due to secondary cross-linking by Type II bound water. This study underscores the complexity associated with predicting the time-to-failure for epoxy coating systems. However, the data and analyses provided herein offer valuable insights into the implications of extreme exposure conditions, aiding in the construction of lifetime predictions using a stochastic process. In real-world scenarios, pipelines undergo various fluctuations in parameters like temperature and humidity, potentially leading to failure. A deterministic physical/chemical model under simplified conditions can serve as input for the probability distribution function of future failure events.

The permeability of salt through the free-standing coating films was measured using reverse osmosis techniques under hydraulic pressures relevant to industrial use. These tests showed that fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) and high-performance powder coating (HPPC) have low salt permeability. Accelerated exposure tests were then conducted on the coated steel panels, subjecting them to humidified environments, ultraviolet (UV) light, and salt/fog conditions, all in accordance with ASTM D5894. Some of the exposure conditions (e.g., intensity of UV light and humidity) were modified to examine the impact of each parameter on the relative performance of these coating systems. The reversibility of the coating properties was characterized by a thermal cycling protocol and adhesion performance analysis. Alternative exposure to dry- and wet-cycles (at 60\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C, respectively), salt/fog conditions and UV light results in irreversible damage to the coatings as early as two weeks in. However, coated panels exposed to a lower UV intensity (one tenth of the value defined by the standard) showed minimal degradation of FBE, meaning that the most critical parameter was the UV radiation exposure. For one 336-h ageing sequence under UV exposure, the HPPC exhibited superior performance compared to FBE. More importantly, our extended exposure sequences showed that while the FBE coating structure undergoes a slow ablation process, indicating significant surface damage, it still retains its effectiveness as a barrier. However, the osmotic pressures around coated pipes and the pre-existing, unavoidable, porosity throughout the coating thickness can facilitate local through-thickness pinholes, which could potentially serve as areas susceptible to cathodic disbondment.

First, typical polymer and biomolecular input formats, such as protein data bank (PDB) files, lack adequate chem- ical information needed for the parameterization of new chemistries. Second, polymers are typically too large for accurate partial charge generation methods. In this work, we employed direct chemical perception through the Open Force Field toolkit to create a flexible polymer simulation workflow for organic polymers, encompassing everything from biopolymers to soft materials. We propose and test a new input specification for monomer information that can, along with a 3D conformational geometry, param- eterize and simulate most soft material systems within the same workflow used for smaller ligands. The monomer format encompasses a subset of the SMIRKS substructure query language to uniquely identify chemical information and repeating charges in under-specified systems through matching atomic connectivity. This workflow is combined with several different approaches for automatic partial charge generation for larger systems. As an initial proof-of-concept, a variety of diverse polymeric systems were parameterized with the Open Force Field toolkit, including functionalized proteins, DNA, homopolymers, cross-linked systems, and sugars. Additionally, shape properties and radial distribution functions were computed from molecular dynamics simulations of PEG, PNIPAAm, and PAAm homopolymers in aqueous solution and compared to previous simulation results in order to demonstrate a start-to-finish work- flow for simulation and property prediction.

We aimed to determine if this method could quantify protein encapsulation and track changes and if proteins could be tuned to bind to these particles. Our results showed that FITC-labeled proteins had apparent association constants in the micromolar range, with hydrophobicity as the dominant factor enhancing the affinities. Confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging supported these results and provided additional information about protein distribution within the particles. We also tested the feasibility of tuning avidin affinity (AVI) for SHS particles with a biotin ligand. We found that increasing the amount of biotin initially enhanced AVI binding, but then reached saturation, which we hypothesize results from non-covalent cross-linking caused by strong biotin/AVI interactions. CLSM images showed that the linker also impacted AVI distribution within the particles.

Exploiting the different stabilities of transition metals in acidic media, we demonstrate that ascorbic acid selectively leaches low-value spinel electrode material (LiMn2O4) from mixed cathode electrode (LiMn2O4 /layered Ni-rich oxide) in minutes, allowing both phases to be effectively recovered separately. This process facilitates upcycling of the Li/Mn content from the resultant leachate solution into higher-value LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC) phases. The remaining nickel-rich layered oxide can be directly regenerated through a hydrothermal hydroxide process, which also decomposes the PVDF binder, thereby avoiding fluorine contamination of the recovered layered oxide. We report electrochemical data for the regenerated layered oxide phase while also showing that the leachate can be upcycled to next generation materials. Furthermore, while literature recycling studies are commonly performed on model systems, we illustrate here the approach on a real end of life EV battery.

Additionally, the effect of the potential hold time at both LPL and UPL on the metal dissolution has also been investigated. The findings demonstrate that the dissolution rate of both metals is proportional to the hold time at UPL, regardless of the applied potential window, while the hold time at the LPL does not appear to be as detrimental to the stability of metals. Nevertheless, the total dissolution of metals has been once again significantly lower for the narrower potential window of 0.7\u20130.85 VRHE rather than 0.6\u20130.95 VRHE.", "date": "2023-10-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Two TADF dendrimers with different rigid and planar N-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as acceptors were designed and synthesized. By modulating the molecular geometry, compound 2GCzBPN that possesses a strongly twisted geometry exhibits TADF, while 2GCzBPPZ, possessing a less twisted geometry, shows dual emission with an emission peak at 475 nm associated with the monomer and one at 575 nm linked to aggregates that is TADF. This dual emission is both concentration-dependent and temperature-dependent in solution. This is the first observation of aggregate emission from TADF dendrimers in solution. The control of the contributions from intramolecular and intermolecular charge-transfer states permits a wide color tuning from sky blue through white to yellow light emission. We demonstrate how 2GCzBPPZ can serve as a temperature sensor and exhibits excellent temperature sensitivity across a very wide temperature range (70 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C) in n-hexane, accompanied by a significant spectral response, ranging from yellow to white, and then blue emission, which is the widest detected temperature range and color response reported for an organic luminescent material in solution and also to the best of our knowledge the first small molecule TADF compound used for colorimetric temperature sensing. By embedding 2GCzBPPZ into paraffin, we demonstrated a spatio-temperature sensor that showed a noticeable emission shift from yellow to green and ultimately to blue as the temperature increased from 20 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C. Finally, solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using these two dendrimer emitters showed divergent performance, with a three-times higher maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 15.0% for the device with 2GCzBPPZ compared to the device with 2GCzBPN (5.3%).

Here we developed a class of bioinspired, sequence-defined polymers, i.e., polypeptoids, as tailored polymer brushes for surface modification of semiconductor substrates. Polypeptoids featuring a terminal hydroxyl (\u2013OH) group are designed and synthesized for efficient melt grafting onto the native oxide layer of Si substrates, forming ultrathin (~1 nm) monolayers.

Importantly, the polypeptoid brush monolayers remain compatible with electron-beam lithographic patterning and retain their chemical characteristics even under harsh lithographic conditions. Electron-beam lithography is used over polypeptoid brushes to generate highly precise, binary nanoscale patterns with localized functionality for the selective immobilization (or passivation) of biomacromolecules such as DNA origami or streptavidin onto addressable arrays. This surface modification strategy with bioinspired, sequence-defined polypeptoid brushes enables monomer-level control over surface properties with a large parameter space of monomer chemistry and sequence, and therefore is a highly versatile platform to precisely engineer semiconductor/bio interfaces for bioelectronics applications.", "date": "2023-10-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Polymer brushes; Nanofabrication", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This is in part due to the complexity of the systems that involve multiple synthetic steps and components, namely the MgCl2 support, a transition-metal chloride, and several organic modifiers, known as donors, that are used prior and in some instances during the activation step with alkyl aluminum. Due to the favorable NMR properties of V and its use in Ziegler-Natta catalysts, we utilize 51V solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure of VOCl3 on MgCl2(thf)1.5. The resulting catalyst shows similar ethylene polymerization activity as its Ti analogues. Using carefully benchmarked DFT calculations, the experimental 51V NMR signature was analyzed to elucidate the structure of the surface sites. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the 51V NMR signature contains information about the coordination environment, i.e. the type of ancillary, ligands and the morphology of the MgCl2 support. Analysis of the NMR signatures shows that the adsorption of VOCl3 on MgCl2(thf)1.5 generates a well-defined hexacoordinated V-oxo species containing one alkoxy and four chloride ligands, whose local geometry results from the interaction with an amorphous MgCl2 surface. This study illustrates how NMR spectroscopy, which is highly sensitive to the local environment of the investigated nuclei, here V, enables us to identify the exact coordination sphere and to address the effect of support morphology on surface site structures.\n", "date": "2023-10-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Polymers; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Our findings reveal that Cs+ movement across the membrane from the anode to the cathode is governed by migration and drags H2O via electroosmosis. H2O diffusion then allows Cs+ diffusion further within the gas diffusion electrode. When decreasing the applied voltage, the concentration gradient causes Cs+ quickly to diffuse back to the anode. The H2O content in the macro-porous layer remains at the same level, thus showcasing an origin of gas diffusion electrode flooding.

Hydrogen-bonded assemblies between a benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) achiral phosphine ligand coordinated to copper and an enantiopure BTA monomer are engaged in a concomitant copper-hydride catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydroamination process, yielding mainly one of the possible stereoisomers in good yield. The nature of the product stereoisomer is related to the handedness of the helices and can thus be directed in a predictable way by the nature of the major enantiopure BTA present in the assemblies. Accordingly, a sequential reaction, during which the handedness of the supramolecular helices is switched in between the hydrosilylation and hydroamination steps, mainly yields the diastereoisomer that cannot be obtained in the aforementioned concomitant process. The strategy allows all stereoisomers to be obtained with similar selectivities. This work paves the way for the development of supramolecular helical catalysts as a platform to readily access molecules embedding several stereogenic centers.", "date": "2023-10-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The main proteases of these viruses are promising targets for antiviral development. Peptidyl protease inhibitors containing Pro derivatives, mimicking rigid Leu at the P2 position, have emerged as potent drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, despite several theoretical disadvantages compared to non-Pro rigid Leu mimetics: loss of a critical hydrogen bond due to the Pro tertiary amide and the unique PPII conformation associated with Pro, contrasting the protease-preferred \u03b2-strand conformation in the solution phase. Interestingly, despite these potential drawbacks, Pro derivatives that mimic a rigid Leu at the P2 position manage to either enhance or maintain inhibitory activities when compared to non-Pro derivatives. In this study, we analyzed over 200 crystal structures of main protease-bound peptidyl inhibitors of major RNA viruses. Our analysis revealed a previously unnoticed preference of these main proteases for the P2 residues of peptidyl inhibitors to adopt the PPII conformation, contrasting the traditional \u03b2-strand conformation. Furthermore, our unbiased all-atom classical MD simulations of literature examples confirm that using Pro-based rigid Leu mimetics constrains the P2 residue to the enzyme-preferred PPII conformation in the solution phase. This leads to a significant reduction in configurational entropy, comparable in magnitude to a typical strong hydrogen bonding interaction when compared to non-Pro P2 residues. Despite the loss of a critical hydrogen bond, this phenomenon accounts for the enhanced binding affinities of peptidyl protease inhibitors that feature Pro-based rigid Leu mimetics as the P2 residue. These findings provide new insights into the binding dynamics of peptidyl protease inhibitors with viral main proteases and highlight the importance of new strategies to constrain the P2 residue of peptidyl inhibitors in the PPII conformation, without sacrificing the P2 amide hydrogen, which will further enhance the binding affinities.", "date": "2023-10-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The nanocrystals are covalently bonded to polymer brush layers that are grafted from the Si-air interfaces inside the nanostructure using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), and their presence and position of the quantum dots was previously characterized by synchrotron X-ray fluorescence tomography.  We report both continuous wave (cw) emission spectra and time-resolved time-correlated single photon counting.  In time-resolved measurements, we observe that the total emission rate greatly increases when the quantum dots are transferred from suspension to the silicon nanostructures, likely due to quenching (or increased non-radiative decay) that is tentatively attributed to the presence of Cu-catalyst during the synthesis. In this regime, continuous wave emission spectra are known to be proportional to the radiative rate and thus to the local density of states.  In spectra normalized to those taken on flat silicon outside the crystals, we observe a broad and deep stop band that we attribute to a 3D photonic band gap with a relative bandwidth up to 26%. The shapes of the relative emission spectra match well with the theoretical density of states spectra calculated with the plane wave expansion.

The complexes were characterized using two-color-resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI), laser induced fluorescence (LIF), single vibronic level fluorescence (SVLF), and photoionization efficiency spectroscopic methods. The 0_0^0 band of the S1\u2190S0 electronic transition of 27DAI-H2O complex was observed at 33074 cm-1, largely red shifted by 836 cm-1 compared to that of the bare 27DAI. From the R2PI spectrum, the detected modes at 141 (v\u2019Tx), 169 (v\u2019Ty) and 194 (v\u2019Ry) cm-1 were identified as the internal motions of H2O molecule in the complex.

The structural determination was aided by the detection of \u03bdNH and \u03bdOH values in the ground and excited state complex using the FDIR and IDIR spectroscopies. The detection of \u03bdNH at 3414 and \u03bdOH at 3447 cm-1 in 27DAI-H2O have shown an excellent correlation with the most stable structure consisting of N(1)-H\u2027\u2027\u2027O and OH\u2027\u2027\u2027N(7) hydrogen bonded bridging water molecule in the ground state. The structure of the complex in the electronic excited state (S1) were confirmed by corresponding bands at 3210 (\u03bdNH) and 3265 cm-1 (\u03bdOH). The IR-UV hole burning spectroscopy confirmed the presence of only one isomer in the molecular beam. The ionization energy (IE) of the 27DAI-H2O complex was obtained as 8.7890.001 eV, which was significantly higher than the 7AI-H2O complex. The 1:2 complex 27DAI-(H2O)2 was identified by a strong transition at 32565 cm-1, which was red shifted by 1345 cm-1. The corresponding FDIR spectrum resulted three bands at 3207, 3261 and 3385 cm-1, which are assigned as the hydrogen bonded \u03bdNH of 27DAI and two \u03bdOH vibrations from solvent-bridge connecting N(1)H and N(7) groups.

The lower excitation and higher ionization energies of the 27DAI-H2O complex compared to 7AI-H2O established higher stabilization of N-rich molecules.

While HPH is comparatively simple conceptually, the homogenization process involves complex engineering physics which is influenced by the varied processing conditions and highly diverse inputs with each use-case requiring its own treatment. The successful application of a HPH process indubitably requires practitioners to draw upon insights from multiple domains and the optimization for each case.

During this fully reversible process a CN double bond is established under concomitant aromatization and thiophene-ring opening. The metastable zwitterion thus possesses a positively charged extended aromatic structure and an appendant conjugated thiolate function. It can further photoisomerize between a more stable Z and a less stable E isomer, resulting in effective three-state photoswitching. Unusual for diarylethenes, the metastable isomers show negative solvatochromism and redshifted absorption in apolar solvents. Thermal stability of the zwitterions can be modulated from a dissipative to a highly stable behavior in response to pH, again in a fully reversible manner.

The 4f orbitals of lanthanide(III) complexes are often referred to as \u201catom-like\u201d, reflecting their isolated nature, and are promising substrates for the optical preparation of specific quantum states. To better understand the photophysical properties of 4f states and assess their promise for quantum applications, theoretical building blocks are required for rapid screening. In this study, an atomic-level perturbative calculation (spin-orbit crystal field, SOCF) is applied to various Yb(III) complexes to investigate their linear absorption and emission through a fitting mechanism of their experimentally determined transition energies and oscillator strengths. In particular, the optical properties of (thiolfan)YbCl(THF) (thiolfan = 1,1\u2032-bis(2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-thiomethylenephenoxy)ferrocene), a recently reported complex with a ultranarrow optical linewidth, are computed and compared to those of other Yb(III) compounds. Through a symmetry descent procedure and a transition energy sampling study, major contributors to the optical linewidth are identified. We find that low-symmetry crystal fields, combined with the ultra-high similarity of states resulting from an anisotropic crystal field, create particularly isolated f-f transitions and narrow linewidths. Simultaneously, we find that these atom-like transitions have highly correlated excited-ground energy fluctuations that serve to greatly suppress inhomogeneous line-broadening. This article illustrates how SOCF can be used as a low-cost method to probe the influence of symmetry and ligands on the optical properties of Yb(III) complexes to assist the development of novel lanthanide series quantum materials.

Crystal structures of a Taq polymerase/double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) complex containing a DS-DN pair in the 3\u2019 terminus showed a parallelly stacked geometry for the pre-insertion, and an intercalated geometry for the post-insertion structure. Unconventional orientations of DS-DN inside a DNA duplex have inspired scientists to investigate the conformational orientations and structural properties of UBP-incorporated DNA. In recent years, computational simulations have been used to investigate the geometry of DS-DN within the DNA duplex; nevertheless, unresolved questions persist owing to inconclusive findings. In this work, we investigate the structural and dynamical properties of DS and DN inside a ds-DNA strand in aqueous solution considering both short and long DNA templates using polarizable, and non-polarizable classical MD simulations. Flexible conformational change of UBP with major populations of Watson-Crick-Franklin (WCF) and three distinct non-Watson-Crick-Franklin (nWCFP1, nWCFP2, nWCFO) conformations through intra and inter-strand flipping have been observed. Our results suggest that a dynamical conformational change leads to the production of random distribution of several intermediates. Simulations with a short ds-DNA duplex suggest nWCF (P1 and O) as the predominant structures, whereas long ds-DNA duplex simulations indicate almost equal populations of WCF, nWCFP1, nWCFO. DS-DN in the terminal position is found to be more flexible with occasional mispairing and fraying. Overall, these results suggest flexibility and random conformational distribution of the UBP as well as indicate varied conformational distribution with the increase of the length of the DNA strand.", "date": "2023-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To address this challenge, we develop an algorithm that instead partitions the charge based on the electron localization function (ELF), a popular scheme for visualizing chemically important features in molecules and solids. The algorithm uses Bader segmentation of the ELF to find the electride electrons and Voronoi segmentation of the ELF to identify atoms. We apply this method, \u201cBadELF\u201d, to the quantification of atomic radii and oxidation states in both ionic compounds and electrides.

However the catalytic generation of carbanion equivalents particularly from sp3-hybridized alkyl scaffolds, remains an underdeveloped goal in chemical synthesis. To align with the demands of modern synthetic protocols, a general method for the catalytic generation of alkyl carbanions must operate under benign reaction conditions and access commercially available feedstock chemicals. Alkenes constitute an attractive source of latent alkyl carbanion equivalents, however methods for the conversion of carbon-carbon  bonds into carbanions is challenged by the need for precious metals and aggressive stoichiometric reductants.

We demonstrate that alkene radical anions engage in catalytic, metal free, intermolecular C-C bond-forming reactions with carbonyl derivatives, in a manner analogous to Grignard reagents. Under this reaction manifold, the alkene can be considered a dicarbanion synthon offering new opportunities for orthogonal diversification.

In this study, machine learning methods are proposed to facilitate the simultaneous extraction of intra- and inter-cycle features from VIT cycling datasets for the knees prediction of LIBs. The length of each cycling data is made the same by realigning the data in terms of voltage or using zero-padding, depending on the type of dataset used.

The effectiveness of the catalyst is demonstrated with crocin and 17\u03b2-estradiol, the former being a natural carotenoid used as a screening tool, and the latter being a common hormonal disruptor. Our work shows that under visible light illumination, our supported black TiO2 is able to degrade these water contaminants with greater efficiency than conventional TiO2. Using this framework we envision that our findings can contribute to the production of inexpensive, large-scale solar or LED-based water decontamination systems which would be rapidly deployable to sites in need. Operation of such systems would require minimal training and could be monitored remotely.  In addition to the catalyst\u2019s non-toxicity and in-flow compatibility, the material also has a long shelf life and is easy and inexpensive to produce, making it an attractive candidate for developing water treatment devices", "date": "2023-10-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It has a fully conju-gated \u03c0-system, making it similar to graphene. Zinc porphene has recently been synthesized and shown to be a semiconduc-tor (Nat. Comm., 2023, 14, 6308.). This is in contrast with all previous predictions of its electronic structure, which indi-cated metallic conductivity. We show that the gap-opening in zinc porphene is caused by a Peierls distortion of its unit cell from square to rectangular, thus giving the first account of its electronic structure in agreement with experiment. Accounting for this distortion requires a proper treatment of electron delocalization, which can be done using hybrid functionals with a substantial amount of exact exchange. Such a functional, PBE38, is then applied to predict the properties of many first tran-sition row metalloporphenes, some of which have already been prepared. We find that changing the metal strongly affects the electronic structure of metalloporphenes, resulting in a rich variety of both metallic conductors and semiconductors, which may be of great of interest to molecular electronics and spintronics. Properties of these materials are mostly governed by the extent of the Peierls distortion and the number of electrons in their \u03c0 system, analogous to changes in aromaticity observed in cyclic conjugated molecules upon oxidation or reduction. These results give an account of how the concept of antiaromaticity can be extended to periodic systems.

Metastable states, i.e. supersaturation, within individual micron-sized droplets are studied using both an optical trap and a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance. When irradiated with intense visible light, amide bond formation is observed to occur and can be monitored using vibrational bands in Raman spectra.

Nonetheless, our understanding of the formation mechanism remains limited. This work aims to provide insight into the molecular processes governing the structural construction of carbamazepine (CBZ) and griseofulvin (GSF) channel-type ICs in the presence of guest polymers. Leveraging microdroplet melt crystallization, we successfully unveiled the single-crystal structures of these ICs, enabling theoretical analysis. Our investigation, which encompasses structural analysis, density functional theory calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, elucidates the disparity between CBZ and GSF channels in terms of their autonomy in the absence of guest polymers. CBZ molecules can spontaneously assemble into stable channel structures independently, capitalizing on their unique mortise-tenon architecture and robust \u03c0...\u03c0 interactions. In contrast, GSF channels lack sufficient support from weak Cl...O and C-H...\u03c0 intermolecular interactions and necessitate the insertion of guest molecules to stabilize their structures. Regardless of the structural reliance on guest polymers, channel size is determined by the size, shape, and conformation of the host molecules, as well as intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, while the eleven structurally determined drug-polymer ICs adopt diverse approaches to construct channel structures, their channel sizes consistently fall within a narrow range of 3.86-5.18 \u00c5, slightly larger than the radial diameter of the guest polymers (2.83-3.50 \u00c5). Consequently, we propose that a crucial prerequisite for the formation of drug-polymer ICs is that the host molecules have the capacity to self-assemble into a porous structure with accommodating channels for guest polymers. Additionally, our results confirm the efficacy of microdroplet melt crystallization in rapidly synthesizing drug-polymer ICs and cultivating their single crystals of high quality and sufficient size. This achievement overcomes the challenges associated with structure elucidation and promises to promote further research into the formation mechanism of drug-polymer ICs.

Usually, it takes two to five minutes for the temperature of the sample inside the NMR probe to stabilize at a fixed value set for the experiment. However, in some cases, the NMR sample tubes are flame-sealed, such as when working with volatile solvents, atmosphere-sensitive samples, or calibration samples for long-term use. When these samples are placed inside the NMR probe, the spectrometer controls the lower portion (liquid phase) of the NMR sample tube with a gas flow at a fixed temperature, while the upper portion (vapor) is at ambient temperature. This probe design creates a unique temperature gradient across the sample, leading to vapor pressure build-up, particularly inside a sealed NMR tube. By analyzing the temperature-dependent line shape changes of a chemical exchange process, we report that under standard experimental conditions, the sample temperature can take up to two to three hours (instead of minutes) to stabilize. The time scale of the liquid-vapor equilibrium process is much slower, with a half-life exceeding 35 minutes, in contrast to the two-minute duration required to obtain each spectrum. As a result, each spectrum represents the time-averaged status of the double bond rotation observable from the liquid phase of the sample. This phenomenon is exclusively due to the liquid-vapor equilibrium process of the flame-sealed NMR tube and is not observable otherwise.", "date": "2023-10-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While emergent interfacial crystalline order precedes heterogeneous nucleation, its importance in the nucleation mechanism is unclear. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and path sampling techniques to demonstrate that crystalline order in its traditional sense is not predictive of the outcome of heterogeneous nucleation of close-packed crystals. Consequently, structure-based collective variables (CVs) that reliably describe homogeneous nucleation can be poor descriptors of heterogeneous nucleation. This divergence between structure and nucleation outcome is accompanied by an intriguing dynamical anomaly wherein low- coordinated crystalline particles outpace their liquid-like counterparts. Both these anomalies are morphologically associated with low-coordinated crystalline particles participating in bridges connecting crystalline domains. We also demonstrate that reliance on ineffective CVs yields a flawed comprehension of the nucleation mechanism by overestimating the face-centered cubic (FCC) content of crystalline nuclei in the systems and surfaces considered here. We use committor analysis, high-throughput screening, and machine learning to devise CV optimization strategies, and present suitable structural heuristics within the metastable fluid for CV pre-screening.

Generally, pNMR shifts for systems with more than one unpaired electron depend on the orbital shielding contribution and a temperature-dependent term. The latter includes the zero-field splitting, the hyperfine coupling, and the g- tensor. For consistency, we calculate these three tensors at the same level of theory, i.e. using scalar-relativistic X2C augmented with spin\u2013orbit perturbation theory. Results for pNMR chemical shifts of transition-metal complexes reveal that this X2C-DFT framework can yield good results for both the shifts and the individual tensor contributions of metallocenes and related systems, especially if the hyperfine coupling (HFC) constant is large. For small HFC constants, the relative error is often large and sometimes the sign may be off. 4d and 5d complexes with more complicated structures demonstrate the limitations of a fully DFT-based approach. Additionally, a Co-based complex with very large zero-field splitting and pronounced multireference character is not well described. Here, a hybrid DFT-multireference framework is necessary for accurate results. Our results show that X2C is sufficient to describe relativistic effects and computationally cheaper than a fully relativistic approach. Thus, it allows to use large basis sets for converged hyperfine couplings. Overall, current-dependent meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and local hybrid functionals show some potential, however, the currently available functionals leave a lot to be desired.

In this work, we introduce NHC-CDI-functionalized Cu catalysts, which demonstrate a remarkable increase in activity for multicarbon product formation, surpassing bare Cu electrodes by more than an order of magnitude. These hybrid catalysts operate efficiently in a gas diffusion configuration, achieving a multicarbon product selectivity of 58% with a partial current density of \u221280 mA/cm2. Using modified pulsed voltammetry measurements, we found that the activity for multicarbon product formation is closely linked to the surface charge that accumulates during electrocatalysis, resulting from the buildup of CO2RR intermediates.

This process regulates the homeostasis and the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the bioavailability of growth factors and cytokines. Overexpression of heparanase has been observed under various pathological conditions, such as cancer, angiogenesis, and inflammation, suggesting HPSE a promising therapeutic target. However, despite decades of research on HPSE inhibitors, no small-molecule HSPE inhibitor has been approved by regulatory agencies. In this study, we used computational tools to provide insights into small-molecule HPSE inhibitors design. We performed a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding profile analyses of 48 diverse small-molecule HPSE inhibitors reported by various research labs. Our results identified the key binding residues on HPSE that should be targeted in inhibitor design, considering both their importance in facilitating interactions with the inhibitor and their functional roles. We also performed energy analyses to create a binding energy map showing the energy breakdown on HPSE residues. To guide future HPSE small-molecule inhibitor discovery, we built a pharmacophore model based on key binding features identified in this study. We also selected and discussed good binding modes discovered through MD.

We discovered that treatment of these catalysts at temperatures between 750 and ~1,000 \u00baC under the flow of CO and NO in the presence of steam (reactive aging in reducing atmosphere) leads to dispersion of ceria nanoparticles and creates a novel catalytic architecture with high density (up to 10 wt%) of atomically dispersed, ultra small CexOy clusters densely covering alumina, as confirmed by XPS, FTIR and AC-STEM characterization. These clusters possess markedly higher oxygen mobility (and therefore oxygen storage capacity), leading to easier extraction of oxygen with the formation of abundant Ce+3 sites and oxygen vacancies. Because of this, these catalysts (in the absence or presence noble metals, such as Rh and Pt) possess much improved activity for multiple industrially important catalytic reactions such as NO and N2O reduction, as well as CO and NO oxidation even after exposure to harsh aging conditions, with activity superior to fresh catalyst even for aged samples, providing a general pathway to creating more efficient PGM/ceria catalysts. Our study therefore reveals novel catalyst architecture with atomically dispersed ceria clusters with superior redox properties under conditions where typical catalyst sintering is generally assumed to occur and allows to utilize these materials as supports for more effective general catalysis.

In this study, we investigated the antifungal activity of PA and its derivatives on a panel of yeast. PA had a fungistatic effect on S. cerevisiae and a fungicidal effect on plasma membrane-damaged Candida albicans mutants. Live cell fluorescent microscopy experiments revealed that PA increases chitin production and modifies its cell wall distribution. Chitin production and cell growth returned to normal after prolonged incubation. The antifungal activity of PA was reduced in the presence of exogenous chitin, suggesting that potentiation of chitin production is a stress response that helps the yeast cell overcome the effect of this antifungal stilbenoid. Growth inhibition was also reduced by metal ions, indicating that PA affects metal homeostasis.

While high-level solid-state density functional theory (DFT) methods allow for mostly reliable discrimination of the low energy structures, their high computational cost is problematic because of the need to evaluate tens to hundreds of thousands of trial crystal structures to fully explore typical crystal energy landscapes. Consequently, lower-cost but less accurate empirical force fields are often used, sometimes as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme involving multiple stages of increasingly accurate energy calculations. Machine learned potentials (MLPs), trained to reproduce the results of ab initio methods with computational cost close to that of force fields, can improve the efficiency of CSP by reducing or eliminating the need for costly DFT calculations at the final stages of CSP. Here, we investigate active learning methods for training MLPs with CSP datasets. The combination of active learning with the well-developed sampling methods from CSP yields potentials in a highly automated workflow that are relevant over a wide range of the crystal packing space. To demonstrate these potentials, we illustrate efficiently re-ranking large, diverse crystal structure landscapes to near-DFT accuracy from force field-based CSP, improving the reliability of the final energy ranking.

Specifically, a dihedral angle of 36-40\u00b0 leads to very efficient reverse intersystem-crossing (rISC) on the order of 10^9 s^-1 due to spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) mediated by the sulfur atoms in combination with a small E(S1-T1) of ca. 56 meV (calc. 20 meV). In addition, the chiral carbene ligand leads to the generation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with high dissymmetry values g(lum) of up to 3.3x10^-2 in polystyrene (PS).", "date": "2023-10-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Compounds; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The stabilization of the 3MC state relative to the 3MLCT state in the mesocate was explained by a reduction in ligand field strength due to distortion near the ligand bridge which causes further deviation from octahedral geometry compared to the helicate.

We tailor the distribution and ratio of facets on copper by electrochemically oxidizing and reducing the surface in chloride-rich aqueous solutions. We then address the formation of new facets with voltammetric lead (Pb) underpotential deposition (UPD). We first record the voltammetric lead UPD on different single facets, which have intense peaks at different potential values. We use this data to decouple each facet peak-contribution in the lead (Pb) UPD curves of the tailored and multifaceted copper surfaces and quantify the geometry of the active sites. We combine experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the ligand effect of chloride anions on the copper facet distribution during the surface oxidation/electrodeposition treatment.

Cellulose fiber-based super-bridging agents are sustainable, reusable, and versatile materials that considerably improve floc separation in conventional settling tanks or via alternative screening separation methods. In this study, the effectiveness of fiber-based materials for wastewater treatment was evaluated at lab-scale (0.25 L) and at pilot-scale (20 L) for two separation methods, namely settling and screening. For the fiber-based method, the performance of floc separation during settling was slightly affected by an 80x upscaling factor. A small decrease in turbidity removal from 93 and 86 % was observed for the jar and pilot tests, respectively, suggesting that fiber-based super-bridging agents could be implemented in full-scale water treatment plants. By contrast, the turbidity removal of the conventional treatment, i.e., no fibers with a settling separation, was largely affected by the upscaling with a decrease in turbidity removal from 84 to 49 %, for jar and pilot tests, respectively. The tested fibers increase the robustness of treatment by providing better floc removal than conventional treatment under several challenging conditions such as low settling time and screening with coarse screen mesh size. Furthermore, at both lab-scale and pilot-scale, the use of fiber-based materials reduced the demand for coagulant and flocculant, potentially lowering the operational costs of water treatment plants and reducing the accumulation of metal-based coagulants and synthetic polymers in sludge.

Here, we analyze a series of three geometrically-tunable S = \u00bd Cu(II) porphyrins with varying degrees of ruffling distortion in the ground state. Theoretical calculations predict that increased distortion should activate low-energy ruffling modes (~50 cm-1) for spin-phonon coupling, thereby causing faster spin relaxation in distorted porphyrins. However, experimental T1 times do not follow the degree of ruffling, with the highly distorted copper tetraisopropylporphyrin (CuTiPP) even displaying room-temperature coherence. Local mode fitting indicates that the true vibrations dominating T1 lie in the energy regime of bond stretches (~200 \u2013 300 cm-1), which are comparatively insensitive to the degree of ruffling. We employ resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy to determine vibrational modes possessing both the correct energy and symmetry to drive spin-phonon coupling. The rR spectra uncover a set of mixed symmetric stretch vibrations from 200 \u2013 250 cm-1 that explain the trends in temperature-dependent T1.

Several researchers observed a significant increase in water flow through graphene-based nanotubes. Graphene sheets are deformable, so we represent nano/Angstrom-size tubes with a deformable wall model using the small displacement structural mechanics with a linear pressure-area relationship. We assume the lubrication assumption in the shallow tubes, and using the microstructure of confined water along with slip at the capillary boundaries, we derive the model for deformable nanotubes. Our derived model also facilitates the flow dynamics of Newtonian fluids under different conditions as its limiting cases, which have been previously reported in the literature. We compare the predictions by our deformable-wall and rigid-wall model with the experimental results and the MD simulation predictions by multiple literatures. Many studies were well-predicted by the rigid-wall model with slips. However, we find that there are many studies with high porosity and thin wall tubes, where elasticity or deformability of the tube is essential in modelling, which is well-predicted by our deformable-wall model with slips. In our study, we focus on investigating the impact of two key factors: the deformability of the nanotubes and the slip length on the flow rate. We find that the flow rate inside the tube increases as the deformability $1/\\alpha$ increases (or corresponding thickness $\\mathcal{T}$  and elastic modulus $E$ of the wall decreases). We find that the flow rate in deformable tubes scales as $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  1/\\alpha^0 $ for $\\Big ( \\Delta p/\\alpha A_o \\Big )  \\ll 1$, $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  1/\\alpha $ for $\\Big ( \\Delta p/\\alpha A_o \\Big )  \\sim O(10^{-1})$ and $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  \\alpha^2 $ for $\\Big ( \\Delta p/\\alpha A_o \\Big ) \\sim O(1)$. We also find that, for a given deformability factor $\\alpha$, the percentage change in flow rate in the smaller diameter of the tube is much larger than the larger diameter. As the tube diameter decreases for the given reservoir pressure, $\\Delta \\dot{m}/\\dot{m}$ increases $A_o^{-1}$ followed by $A_o^{-2}$ after a threshold with the tube diameter. We find that for the rigid tube, where the deformability parameter $1/\\alpha=0$, the mass flow rate varies linearly, i.e., $\\dot{m}_{\\text{rigid}} \\sim  \\Delta p $, whereas for the deformable tubes, the flow rate scales as $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  \\Delta p^2 $ for $ \\Big ( \\Delta p/\\alpha A_o \\Big )  \\sim O(10^{-1})$ during transition from $\\dot{m}_{\\text{rigid}} \\sim  \\Delta p $ to $\\sim  \\Delta p^3 $, and finally to $\\dot{m}_{\\text{deformable}}\\sim  \\Delta p^3 $ for $ \\Big  ( \\Delta p/\\alpha A_o \\Big )  \\sim O(1)$. We further find that the slip also significantly increases the mass flow rate in the nanotubes. Still, the deformability has, in comparison, a more substantial effect in increasing the mass flow rate to several orders than the slips.", "date": "2023-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanodevices; Nanofluidics; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although the detection of dissolved nitric oxide in vivo has been widely explored, highly sensitive (i.e. low part-per-trillion level), selective, and humidity resistant detection of gaseous nitric oxide in air remains challenging. In the field, humidity can have dramatic effects on the accuracy and selectivity of gas sensors, confounding data and leading to overestimation of gas concentration. Highly selective and humidity resistant gaseous NO sensors based on laser-induced graphene (LIG) were recently reported, displaying a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.3 ppb. Although highly sensitive (LOD = 590 ppq) single-wall carbon nanotube NO sensors have been reported, these sensors lack selectivity and humidity resistance. In this report, we disclose a highly sensitive (LOD = 2.34 ppt), selective, and humidity resistant nitric oxide sensor based on a whispering-gallery mode (WGM) microtoroid optical resonator. Excellent analyte selectivity was enabled via novel ferrocene-containing polymeric coatings synthesized via RAFT polymerization. Utilizing a Frequency Locked Optical Whispering Evanescent Resonator (FLOWER) system, the microtoroid\u2019s real-time resonance frequency shift response to nitric oxide, was tracked with sub-femtometer resolution. The lowest concentration experimentally detected was 6.4 ppt, which is the lowest reported to date. Additionally, the performance of the sensor remained consistent across different humidity environments. Lastly, the impact of the chemical composition and molecular weight of the novel ferrocene-containing polymeric coatings on sensing performance was evaluated. We anticipate that our results will have impact on a wide variety of fields where NO sensing is important such as medical diagnostics through exhaled breath, determination of planetary habitability, marine science, climate change, air quality monitoring, and treating cardiovascular and neurological disorders. \n \n", "date": "2023-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the present article, we aim to investigate whether the chosen RTIL can preferentially solvate any of the RE cations under study.  First, the RTIL binding to the RE cation is studied in the gas phase, and then explored with continuum solvation models employing RTIL parameters. First, we considered the formation of the first solvation shell, where the PF6- anions directly bond with the Ln(III) cation. We then further surrounded the first solvation shell with [MMI]+ cations to form the second solvation shell. The stability of PF6- coordinated complexes is studied by calculating the binding energy values. The number of PF6- anions for both Ln(III) cations starts with three ligands and goes until the maximum binding energy in the RTIL medium is reached. The coordination number and binding modes of PF6- depend on the size of the RE cation. Comparing the binding energy values between the RE cations for the first solvation shell complexes, it is noticed that Yb-complexes have relatively greater binding energy than Nd-complexes.  We have further performed a Boltzmann analysis to find out the most dominant conformer among each category of PF6- coordinated complexes. A study using Natural Population Analysis shows that after complexation with PF6- the charge on the Yb-centers lower to a greater extent than Nd-centers, implying stronger bonding between Yb and PF6-, which is in harmony with the binding energy analysis. Overall, the computational investigation provides an in-depth understanding of the complexation phenomena of RE cations in RTIL, which can be useful for the practical separation of RE cations using RTIL.", "date": "2023-10-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Emissions detections (`plumes') from these studies are also frequently scaled to basin level. However, little information exists to determine if plumes detected fugitive emissions or known, reported, maintenance activities. This study analyzed an aircraft field study in the Denver-Julesberg basin to quantify how often plumes identified maintenance events, using a geospatial inventory of 12,629 O&G facilities with facility outlines. Study partners (7 midstream and production operators) provided timing and location of 5910 maintenance events that occurred in a 6-week period. Results indicated three substantial uncertainties with potential bias unaddressed by current prior studies. First, plumes often detect maintenance events, which short-duration, large, and poorly estimated by aircraft methods: 9.2% to 48% [35% to 62%] of plumes on production were likely due to known maintenance events. Second, data indicated that plumes on midstream facilities were both infrequent and unpredictable, calling into question whether these estimates were representative of midstream emissions. Finally, 4 plumes attributed to O&G, representing 19% of all emissions, were not aligned with any location that would logically create emissions. While it is unclear how frequently this occurs, in this study it had material impact on emissions estimates and was detectable only with complete geospatial information. While aircraft emissions detection remains a powerful tool for identifying methane emissions on oil and gas facilities, this study indicates that additional data inputs, such as detailed GIS data, a more nuanced analysis of emission persistence and frequency, and improved sampling strategies are required to accurately scale plume estimates to basin emissions.", "date": "2023-10-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, due to inherent noise in the NISQ devices, VQE results on NISQ devices often deviate significantly from the results obtained on noiseless statevector simulators or traditional classical computers. The iterative nature of the VQE further amplifies the errors in each loop. Recent works have explored ways to integrate deep neural networks (DNN) with VQE to mitigate the iterative errors, albeit, primarily limited to the noiseless statevector simulators. In this work, we trained DNN models across various quantum circuits and examined the potential of two DNN-VQE approaches, DNN1 and DNNF, for predicting the ground state energies of small molecules in the presence of device noise. We carefully examined the accuracy of the DNN1, DNNF, and VQE methods on both noisy simulators and real quantum devices by considering different ansatzes of varying qubit counts and circuit depths. Our results illustrate the advantages and limitations of both VQE and DNN-VQE approaches. Notably, both DNN1 and DNNF methods consistently outperform the standard VQE method in providing more accurate ground-state energies in noisy environments. However, despite being more accurate than VQE, the energies predicted using these methods on real quantum hardware remain meaningful only at reasonable circuit depths (depth = 15, gates = 21). At higher depths (depth = 83, gates = 112), they deviate significantly from the exact results. Additionally, we find that DNNF does not offer any notable advantage over VQE in terms of speed. Consequently, our study recommends DNN1 as the preferred method for obtaining quick and accurate ground state energies of molecules on the current quantum hardware, particularly for quantum circuits with lower depth and fewer qubits.", "date": "2023-10-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Quantum Computing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The designed sensing motif thus functions toward two opposite directions, composition or decomposition of the self-assembled structure, in an input-dependent manner.

A number of features influence intermolecular interactions, including the molecular conformation of amphiphiles (through modulation of the dipole moment and molecular packing). The conformational potential energy landscape (PEL) for amphiphiles has a topology that is dictated not only by intramolecular degrees of freedom and interactions (e.g., internal hydrogen bonds) but also by how different conformations are influenced by direct solvent-solute interactions. Atomistic molecular simulations can sample the conformational ensemble, yet when monomeric units have high degrees of freedom they generate a huge amount of high-dimensional complex data.

Resiniferatoxin provides pain relief by binding as an agonist to transient vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), a nociceptive ion channel. Resiniferatoxin targets the TRPV1 channel and activates it, allowing calcium cations to flow in and desensitize the TRPV1 receptors, producing an analgesic effect. Resiniferatoxin was recently designated as a Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA for the treatment of the pain caused by knee osteoarthritis, a common degenerative joint disease caused by aging, joint injury, and obesity. Studies suggest that osteoarthritis is linked with chronic inflammation through a cycle of injury, inflammation, and repair. Multiple studies involving TRPV1 agonists have shown anti-inflammatory properties, presenting TRPV1 agonists as a potential inhibitor for the progression of osteoarthritis.

Despite many successes, the use of RBFEs can often be limited by automation problems, in particular the setup of such calculations. Atom mapping algorithms are an essential component in setting up automatic large-scale hybrid topology RBFE calculation campaigns.  Traditional algorithms typically employ a 2D subgraph isomorphism solver (SIS) in order to estimate the maximum common substructure (MCS). SIS-based approaches can be limited by time-intensive operations and issues with capturing geometry-linked chemical properties, leading potentially to suboptimal solutions. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Kartograf, a geometric-graph-based algorithm that uses primarily the 3D coordinates of atoms to find a mapping between two ligands. In free energy approaches, the ligand conformations are usually derived from docking or other previous modeling approaches giving the coordinates a certain importance. By considering the spatial relationships between atoms related to the molecule coordinates, our algorithm bypasses the computationally complex subgraph matching of SIS-based approaches and reduces the problem to a much simpler bipartite graph matching problem. Moreover, Kartograf effectively circumvents typical mapping issues induced by molecule symmetry and stereoisomerism, making it a more robust approach for atom mapping from a geometric perspective. To validate our method, we have calculated mappings with our novel approach using a diverse set of small molecules and used the mappings in relative hydration and binding free energies calculations. The comparison with two SIS-based algorithms showed that Kartograf offers a fast alternative approach.

Classic psychedelics are a group of compounds that exhibit structural similarities to the naturally occurring neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). Acting on the 5-HT type 2A receptors (5-HT2AR), psychedelics induce enduring neurophysiological changes which parallel their therapeutic psychological and behavioral effects. Recent pre-clinical evi-\ndence suggests that the ability of psychedelics to exert their action is determined by their ability to permeate the neuronal membrane to target a pool of intracellular 5-HT2AR. In this computational study, we employ classical molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling techniques to investigate the permeation behavior of twelve selected tryptamines and to characterize the interactions that drive the process. We elucidate the impact of N-alkylation, indole ring substitution and positional modifications, and protonation on their membrane permeability. Dimethylation of the primary amine group and the introduction of a methoxy group at position 5 exhibited an increase in permeability. Morevoer, there is a significant influence of positional substitutions on the indole groups and the protonation of the molecules substantially increase the energy barrier at the center of the bilayer, making the compounds highly impermeable.

A natural and computationally efficient choice to simulate this correlated dynamics are trajectory-based methods where the quantum-mechanical electronic evolution is coupled to a classical-like nuclear dynamics.

Many recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial biomarkers for a variety of cancers.  Methods In this study, we create a decision tree model for the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer using a calculated miRNAs\u2019 attributes, such as sequence-based characteristics, predicted miRNA target genes, and gene pathways. This series of attributes is extracted from both differentially expressed blood-based miRNAs in laryngeal cancer and random, non-associated with cancer miRNAs.  Results Several machine-learning (ML) algorithms were tested in the ML model, and the Hoeffding Tree (HT) classifier yields the highest accuracy (86.8%) in miRNAs-based recognition of laryngeal cancer. Furthermore, HT-based model is validated with the independent laryngeal cancer datasets and can accurately diagnose laryngeal cancer with 86% accuracy. We also explored the biological relationships of the attributes used in HT-based model to understand their relationship with cancer proliferation or suppression pathways.  Conclusion Our study demonstrates that the proposed model and an inexpensive miRNA testing strategy have the potential to serve as a cost-effective and accessible method for diagnosing laryngeal cancer.

Here we assess the current status of describing liquid water using ab initio molecular dynamics, with a special focus on the performance of all the later generation Minnesota functionals. Findings are contextualized within the current knowledge on DFT for describing bulk water under ambient conditions and compared to experimental data. We find that, contrary to the prevalent idea that local and semilocal functionals overstructure water and underestimate dynamical properties, M06-L, revM06-L, and M11-L understructure water, while MN12-L and MN15-L overdistance water molecules due to weak cohesive effects. This can be attributed to a weakening of the hydrogen bond network, which leads to dynamical fingerprints that are over fast. While most of the hybrid Minnesota functionals (M06, M08-HX, M08-SO, M11, MN12- SX, and MN15) also yield understructured water, their dynamical properties generally improve over their semilocal counterparts. It emerges that exact exchange is a crucial component for accurately describing hydrogen bonds, which ultimately leads to corrections in both the dynamical and structural properties. However, an excessive amount of exact exchange strengthens hydrogen bonds and causes overstructuring and slow dynamics (M06-HF). As a compromise, M06-2X is the best performing Minnesota functional for water, and its D3 corrected variant shows very good structural agreement. From previous studies considering nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), the hybrid revPBE0-D3, and the rung-5 RPA (RPA@PBE) have been identified as the only two approximations that closely agree with experiments. Our results suggest that the M06-2X(-D3) functionals have the potential to further improve the reproduction of experimental properties when incorporating NQEs through path integral approaches. This work provides further proof that accurate modeling of water interactions requires the inclusion of both exact exchange and balanced (non-local) correlation, highlighting the need for higher rungs on Jacob\u2019s ladder to achieve predictive simulations of complex biological systems in aqueous environments.", "date": "2023-10-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, we introduce an active learning (AL) framework for our recently developed machine-learning based adaptable bond topology (MLABT) model that uses datasets generated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations that are both minimalistic and informative. Employing MLABT integrated with AL and DFT, we explore fracture behavior in highly crosslinked thermosets, assessing the variations in fracture behavior induced by system temperature, temperature fluctuations, strain rate, cooling rate, and degree of crosslinking. Notably, we discover that while fracture is minimally affected by temperature, it is strongly influenced by strain rate, suggesting the absence of the time-temperature superposition in thermoset plasticity. Furthermore, while the structural disparities introduced by different network annealing rates influence the elastic properties, they are inconsequential for thermoset fracture. In contrast, network topology emerges as the dominant determinant of fracture, influencing both the ultimate strain and stress.

Illuminating the interactions between MPs and heavy metals (HMs) is crucial for understanding the transport and fate of HM-loaded MPs in specific environmentally relevant scenarios.  Herein, the adsorption of copper (Cu2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions over poly-ethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particulates before and after heat persulfate oxidation (HPO) treatment was comprehensively evaluated in simulated swine wastewater.  The effects of intrinsic properties (i.e., degree of weathering, size, type) of MPs and environmental factors (i.e., pH, ionic strength, and co-occurring species) on adsorption were investigated thoroughly.  It was observed that HPO treatment expedites the fragmentation of pristine MPs, and renders MPs with a variety of oxygen-rich functional groups, which are likely to act as new active sites for binding both HMs.  The adsorption of both HMs is pH- and ionic strength-dependent at a pH of 4 to 6.  Co-occurring species such as humic acid (HA) and tetracycline (TC) appear to enhance the affinity of both aged MPs for Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions via bridging complexation.  However, co-occurring nutrient species (e.g., phosphate and ammonia) demonstrate different impacts on the adsorption, improving uptake of Cu2+ by precipitation while lowering affinity for Zn2+ owing to the formation of soluble zinc-ammonia complex.  Spectroscopic analysis indicates that the dominant adsorption mechanism mainly involves electrostatic interactions and surface complexation.

At the heart of this phenomenon is the light-induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri-aryloxy-substituted quinones resulting in ana-quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana-isomer.

An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner (3\u20137). The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons (8). This process has already been used widely for catalytic reductions; however, limitations towards strong bonds and electron rich substrates remain (9,10). Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant.

Irradiation of the metal-free catalyst by violet light enables the cleavage of strong carbon-fluoride bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron-rich substrates.

Finding innovative materials is key to advancing research areas for sustainable energy conversion, such as electrocatalysis. Artificial intelligence (AI)-guided optimization bears great potential to autonomously learn from data and plan new experiments, identifying a global optimum significantly faster than traditional design of experiment approaches. Furthermore, it is vital to incorporate essential electrocatalyst features such as activity and stability into the optimization campaign to screen for a truly high-performing material. In this study, a multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) was used in conjunction with an experimental high-throughput (HT) pipeline to refine the composition of a non-noble Co-Mn-Sb-Sn-Ti oxide toward its activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid. The viability of the MOBO algorithm was verified on a gathered data set, and an acceleration of 17x was achieved in subsequent experimental screening compared to a hypothetical grid search scenario. During the ML-driven assessment, Mn-rich compositions were critical to designing high-performing OER catalysts, while Ti incorporation into MnOx triggered an improved activity after short accelerated stress tests. To examine this finding further, an operando mass spectrometry technique was used to probe the evolution of activity, metal dissolution, and surface area over 3 h of operation. This work demonstrates the importance of respecting the multiobjective nature in electrocatalyst performance during HT campaigns.

However recently, several groups have popularized the idea of predicting activation energies directly, based on nothing more than the reactant and product graphs, a sufficiently complex neural network, and a broad enough dataset. Here, we have revisited this task using the recently developed Reaction Graph Depth 1 (RGD1) transition state dataset and several newly developed graph attention architectures.

However, in pristine ZGNRs, the spin polarized transmission is not observed due to symmetric anti-parallel distributions of the spin densities between the edges. Here, the hypothesis is, any physical or chemical process that breaks such anti-parallel spin-symmetry can induce spin-polarized transmission in the ZGNRs. In this work, we have established this proof-of-concept by depositing the trimethylenemethane (TMM) radical on 6ZGNRH and investigating the quantum transport properties by employing the density functional theory in conjunction with nonequilibrium Green\u2019s function (DFT-NEGF) method. Although TMM has a high magnetic moment (2 \u00b5B ), it does not induce magnetization in 6ZGNRH when TMM is physisorbed. But, during the chemisorption of TMM, it forms the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 bond with the 6ZGNRH in a particular geometric configuration where the pz orbitals of carbon atoms of TMM have maximum overlap with the pz orbitals of carbon atoms of 6ZGNRH. The chemisorption of TMM transfers the spin moment to 6ZGNRH, which breaks the edge spin-symmetry of pristine 6ZGNRH. The adsorption of TMM radical results in transmission dips in the transmission spectra due to interference between localized states of TMM and 6ZGNRH states.

Direct photochemical degradation resulted in 6PPDQ half-lives ranging from 17.5 h at 20 \u00b0C to no observable degradation over 48 h at 4 \u00b0C. Sensitization of excited triplet state pathways using Cs+ and Ar purging demonstrated that 6PPDQ does not decompose significantly from a triplet state relative to a singlet state. However, assessment of processes involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenchers and sensitizers indicated that singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical do significantly contribute to the degradation of 6PPDQ. Investigation of these processes in natural lake waters indicated no difference in attenuation rates for direct photochemical processes at 20 \u00b0C. This suggests that direct photochemical degradation will dominate in warm waters while indirect photochemical pathways will dominate in cold waters, involving ROS mediated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Overall, the aquatic photodegradation rate of 6PPDQ will be strongly influenced by the compounding effects of environmental factors such as light screening and temperature on both direct and indirect photochemical processes. Transformation products were identified via UHPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry, revealing four major processes: 1) oxidation and cleavage of the quinone ring in the presence of ROS, 2) dealkylation, 3) rearrangement, and 4) deamination. These data indicate that 6PPDQ can photodegrade in cool, sunlit waters under the appropriate conditions: t1/2 = 17.4 h \u2013 no observable decrease (direct); t1/2 = 5.2 \u2013 11.2 h (indirect, CDOM)", "date": "2023-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Hydrology and Water Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A rigorous theoretical treatment of molecular polaritons requires the treatment of matter and photon degrees of freedom on equal quantum mechanical footing.  In the limit of molecular electronic strong or ultrastrong coupling to one or a few molecules,  it is desirable to treat the molecular electronic degrees of freedom using the tools of ab initio quantum chemistry, yielding an approach we refer to as ab initio cavity quantum electrodynamics, where the photon degrees of freedom are treated at the level of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we present an approach called Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction theory to provide ground- and excited-state polaritonic surfaces with a balanced description of strong correlation effects among electronic and photonic degrees of freedom.  This method provides a platform for ab initio cavity quantum electrodynamics when both strong electron correlation and strong light-matter coupling are important, and is an important step towards computational approaches that yield multiple polaritonic potential energy surfaces and couplings that can be leveraged for {ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of polariton chemistry.", "date": "2023-11-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Theory - Computational; Optics; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Can machine learning be leveraged to overcome this hurdle? Utilizing different fingerprints may indeed lead to improved results. However, is there a single machine-learning approach that can effectively address selectivity across all kinases. In this study, the author collect kinase activity data from PubChem database (January 2023) using Uniprot IDs for each kinase. Each Uniprot ID is associated with its unique dataset, and duplicate points were removed to ensure accuracy. The data was then appended together, and any datasets containing fewer than 120 points were discarded. Each data point was categorized as either Active (1) or Inactive (0) based on the activity data. Two fingerprinting approaches were employed for predictions: MACCS fingerprints and Morgan2 (ECFP2) with a 2048-bit representation. The combined dataset was then divided into two subsets, one featuring imbalance data and another with balanced data. Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network models were applied to both datasets. To evaluate the performance of these models, various metrics were employed, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). The results showed that Morgan fingerprinting performed slightly better than MACCS fingerprinting. A total of 480 target IDs was produced, with 452 unique IDs identified. On each dataset(balance and imbalance), two models were developed for both fingerprints, resulting in a combined total of 1920 predictions. Interestingly, the imbalance data yielded higher specificity compared to the balanced data. Each model has been deployed and made publicly available at (github.com/phalem/minKLIFSAI). However, the current data on all kinases is not yet sufficient to enable machine learning to reliably discover selective inhibitors", "date": "2024-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Unfortunately, OCT is not ideal for mass spectrometry (MS) assays. The media perfuses through tissues, resulting in persistent polymer contamination causing issues for sensitive analyses. Complete removal of all OCT media background would enable techniques such as MS imaging (MSI) to be bridged to clinically relevant samples stored in biobanks which possess extensive medical histories. Even though methods have been outlined for spatial lipidomics and proteomics, many still avoid these tissues despite vast potential for biological discoveries applying MS or MSI.\nMETHODS \nReference FF human pancreas was prepared within OCT media and cryosectioned for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MSI. Sample preparation protocols using aqueous ammonium formate for spatial lipidomics, and a variety of solutions for fixation, delipidation, and salt removal enabled spatial proteomics as well. MSI was performed on a UHMR HF Orbitrap MS detected broad classes of lipids and intact proteins, enabling an assessment of polymer perfusion and signal delocalization over a broad mass range to evaluate any deleterious artifacts.\nRESULTS \nWe observe lower polymer contamination from OCT tissues with ammonium formate washes as expected, with several caveats. This was most effective in negative ion mode, where in tandem with the boosted lipid signal positive results were achieved for phospholipids (600-900 Da) and higher mass lipids (>1250 Da). Positive ion mode analyses can be completed for phospholipids, but the condensation of alkali adducts to protonated forms not only increased lipid signals, but also increased signals of larger, persistent PEG oligomers (>1250 Da) which were not previously reported. Even with extensive tissue washing completing a spatial proteomics protocol, the removal of all remnant artifacts of OCT media was not feasible.\nCONCLUSIONS \nThe finding of these persistent remnant polymers from the OCT embedding process has several consequences for MSI, directly effecting primary performance of the MALDI source and lipid and protein analyses. This does not mean OCT tissues should not be or cannot be used for spatial omics by MSI, but several quality control and quality assurance measures should be implemented, and we discuss paths forward and several considerations.", "date": "2024-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Therefore, experiments in a fixed bed reactor filled with a commercial iron catalyst and activated carbon impregnated with manganese chloride as a sorbent were conducted. Modelling of NH3 synthesis, including an ideal separation, allowed the prediction of increase in the NH3 yield, showing potential effects in both, the equilibrium and the kinetic regime of the synthesis reaction. Experiments investigating the formation of NH3 in different arrangements of catalyst and sorbent beds demonstrated the feasibility of sorption under reaction conditions with the selected sorbent. Further, an up to 30 % increase in NH3 yield through in situ sorptive removal, aligning well with model-based predictions, was observed in the respective experiments.

This uses novel SISCAPA antibodies bound to magnetic beads and subsequent analysis of captured and purified SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NCAP) peptides.

Using a one-pot protocol, we first form an electrophilic chloroborazole and then react it with an aryl lithium (ArLi). By selecting the appropriate ortho-substituent, we can guide\nthe ArLi to add to the BN-core in a specific way, ultimately controlling the stereochemical outcome of the three-substitution reaction. Rationalization of the stereochemical model through computational analysis allowed us to show that when aryl lithium nucleophiles bearing rigid long-range ortho-substituents are used, i.e., stiff substituents. The ortho-substituent shields its side of the electrophilic B3N3 core, biasing the incoming ArLi to add anti at each addition step, forming the final tri-aryl borazine exclusively as cc-isomer. Leveraging this stereoselective approach, prototypical multichromophoric borazine derivatives were prepared, and we showcased how the stereochemical arrangement of these chromophores distinctly influences their redox behavior.

We have previously demonstrated that by altering the sterics of the ligand and aryl groups of an Au(III) oxidative addition complex, one can modulate the kinetics of the bimolecular coordination and induce rate constants up to 16,600 M^\u22121s^\u22121. To further enhance the rate of coordination, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the steric properties of the P,N-ligated Au(III) oxidative addition complex as well as the thermodynamics of the S-arylation reaction. This allowed for the accelerated screening of 13 new Au(III) oxidative addition complexes. Three of the more sterically available, synthetically accessible P,N-ligands were synthesized, incorporated into Au(I) and Au(III) complexes, and their rates determined experimentally. The comprehensive mechanistic insights from the DFT calculations led to the development of new reagents with bimolecular coordination rate constants as fast as 20,200 M^\u22121s^\u22121. Further experimental characterization of these reagents\u2019 efficacy as S-arylation reagents led to a proposed switch in selectivity-determining step for the fastest reagent, which was further confirmed by profiling the reductive elimination kinetics.

To investigate this, household dust samples from four different groups of individuals were analyzed using metabolomics/exposomics and metagenomics approaches: PD+/LRRK2+ (PD patients with pathogenic LRRK2 variants; n=11), PD-/LRRK2+ (individuals with pathogenic LRRK2 variants but without PD diagnosis; n=8), iPD (PD of unknown cause; n=11), and a matched, healthy control group (n=11). The dust was complemented with metabolomics and lipidomics of matched serum samples, where available. A total of 1,003 chemicals and 163 metagenomic operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) were identified in the dust samples, of which ninety chemicals and ten mOTUs were statistically significant. Reduced levels of 2-benzothiazolesulfonic acid (BThSO3) were found in the PD-/LRRK2+ group compared to the PD+/LRRK2+. A negative and statistically significant association was observed between BThSO3 and Pseudomonas spp. (detected via metagenomics), which are known for degrading benzothiazoles.

Additionally, we observe that finetuning shows synergism with advanced prompt engineering such as chain-of-thought prompting. Consequently, our best finetuned models outperform the formally much more powerful GPT-4o model. All tools and datasets are made openly available for future research. We believe that this research lays the groundwork for a wider adoption of LLMs for DSLs in chemistry and beyond.", "date": "2024-09-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Traditional approaches relying on external photosensitizers, comprising of 4d/5d metal complexes, often face challenges in intermolecular electron transfer, and attachment of photosensitizing arms to the catalyst increases dependency on intramolecular electron transfer kinetics, underscoring the need for a more integrated solution. We report a new Cu(II) complex, K[CuNDPA] (1[K(18-crown-6)]), bearing a dipyrrin amide-based trianionic tetradentate ligand, NDPA (H3L), which is capable of harnessing light energy, despite having a paramagnetic Cu(II) center, without any external photosensitizer and photocatalytically reducing CO2 to CO in acetonitrile: water (19:1 v/v) with a TON as high as 1132, a TOF of 566 h-1 and a selectivity of 99%. This complex also shows hemilability in the presence of water, which not only plays a role in a proton relay mechanism but also helps stabilize a crucial Cu(I)-NDPA intermediate. The hemilability was justified by the formation of N3O (2) and N2O2 (3) coordinated congeners of the N4 bound complex 1. The overall mechanism was further investigated via spectroscopic techniques like EPR, UV-vis, and Spectroelectrochemistry, culminating in the justification of a single electron-reduced Cu(I)NDPA species as a proposed intermediate. In the next step, the binding of CO2 to Cu(I) complex and subsequent electron transfer to form Cu(II)-CO2\u2022\u203e was indirectly probed by a radical trapping experiment via the addition of p-methoxy-2,6-ditertbutylphenol that led to the formation of a phenoxyl radical.

Graph kernels are used to transform molecular graphs into fixed-length vectors, which, based on their capacity of measuring similarity, can be used as fingerprints for machine learning (ML). To date, graph kernels have mostly focused on the atomic nodes of the graph. In this work, we developed a graph kernel based on atom\u2013atom, bond\u2013bond, and bond\u2013atom (AABBA) autocorrelations. The resulting vector representations were tested on regression ML tasks on a dataset of transition metal complexes; a benchmark motivated by the higher complexity of these compounds relative to organic molecules. In particular, we tested different flavors of the AABBA kernel in the prediction of the energy barriers and bond distances of the Vaska\u2019s complex dataset (Friederich et al., Chem.

For a variety of ML models, including neural net- works, gradient boosting machines, and Gaussian processes, we showed that AABBA outperforms the baseline including only atom\u2013atom autocorrelations. Dimensionality reduction studies also showed that the bond\u2013bond and bond\u2013atom autocorrelations yield many of the most relevant features.

The photochemical degradation of fluridone (FLU), an herbicide applied worldwide to waterways for the eradication of invasive freshwater species, was investigated under simulated sub-arctic conditions typical of high-latitude surface waters. Temperature had a strong effect on the photochemical degradation of FLU, with half-lives for direct photochemical degradation ranging from approximately 40 h at 22 \u00b0C to 118 h at 9 \u00b0C under constant irradiation. Assessment of indirect processes involving reactive oxygen species indicated that FLU will primarily react with hydroxyl radicals (\u2219OH) and not singlet oxygen (1O2) produced by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the environment. These results were corroborated by Fenton experiments, resulting in a calculated second order rate constant for the reaction with \u2219OH of 8.37 x 109 M-1 s-1.

We use CNEO-TST with CNEO density functional theory (CNEO-DFT) to predict reaction rate constants for two prototypical gas-phase hydrogen-atom transfer reactions and their deuterated isotopologic reactions. The CNEO-TST is similar to conventional TST except that it employs constrained minimized energy surfaces to include zero-point energy and shallow tunneling effects in the effective potential. We find that the new theory predicts reaction rates quite accurately at room temperature. The effective potential surface must be generated by CNEO theory rather than by ordinary electronic structure theory, but because of the favorable computational scaling of CNEO-DFT, the cost will remain economical even for large systems. Our results show that dynamics calculations with this approach achieve accuracy comparable to variational TST with a semiclassical multidimensional tunneling transmission coefficient at and above room temperature.

Promising light-activated anticancer activity was observed in U-87MG cells for [3](PF6)2 while the two other compounds were inactive([1](PF6)2) or non-activated ([2](PF6)2). In non-cancerous SH-SY5Y cells the light-activated complexes surprisingly enhanced cell proliferation in a manner similar to Donepezil. While significantly higher amounts of Ru were found in SH-SY5Y cells upon green light irradiation, in particular for [3](PF6)2, this cell proliferation effect was independent from ruthenium cellular uptake. Given the importance of Ca2+ levels for the normal function of neurons, we also examined Ca2+ accumulation upon treatment with ruthenium and light. Increased Ca2+ uptake was found in cells treated with inactivated [1](PF6)2 , [2](PF6)2 , or with green light only. Upon treatment with [3](PF6)2 intracellular Ca2+ content was not changed in the dark but it significantly increased upon light activation, without observable sign of cell death. The structure-dependent action of the ruthenium compounds on Ca2+ homeostasis suggested a docking studies with the NMDA, serotonin, and AMPA receptors, which all act on calcium levels. Docking revealed that [3](PF6)2 interacts with the NMDA receptor, which might be responsible for the enhanced Ca2+ uptake upon light activation in SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, although [3](PF6)2 was phototoxic to U-87MG cells, the combination of this prodrug and green light irradiation enhanced the survival of neuronal-like cells and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, probably via interaction with the NMDA receptor. These findings highlight the potential of ruthenium-based PACT prodrugs in treating glioblastoma cells while maintaining the viability of nearby, healthy neuronal cells", "date": "2024-09-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

The careful assessment of a range of literature data allowed TADF-emitting complexes to be identified, having a singlet-triplet energy gap \u0394EST in the range 14 to 100 meV. The TADF contribution at room temperature (RT) is assessed from experimental data and computational modelling. While typically characterised by a relatively fast metal-facilitated phosphorescence, Ir(III) complexes may additionally benefit from the TADF mechanism, leading to even larger radiative rate constants kr. The typical features of such complexes that emerge are (i) dinuclearity, (ii) significant overlap between the absorption and emission spectra, and (iii) radiative decay rates kr > 106 s\u20131 at RT. Our findings suggest that, due to the presence of 1,3MLCT states the \u0394EST of many Ir(III) complexes is sufficiently small to allow the re-population of their S1 states at RT. Nevertheless, if the f(S1->S0) has low singlet oscillator strength, the effect of TADF on the luminescence may be insignificant. Hence, whilst TADF might be widespread among Ir(III) complexes, its effect on photoluminescence may often be negligible. As luminescent iridium(III) complexes are common in various areas of study, this work may disrupt research on a broader scale beyond the immediate realm of photophysics.

In this study, we have developed a new design to upgrade the Masuko Supermasscolloider from a traditional batch mode to continuous circulation. This upgrade includes a pump-controlled circulating system, an in-line viscosimeter for real-time measurement of cellulose suspension viscosity, and a power meter to monitor and evaluate the energy consumption of both the pump and the grinder throughout the process. These modifications address the limitations of scaling up NFC production, offering a more efficient and effective approach. We investigated the production of NFC from cellulose feedstock derived from miscanthus biomass under various conditions, including different initial cellulose concentrations (1 wt%, 1.5 wt% and 2 wt%) and processing volumes (15L and 25 L) at different grinding time (from 15 minutes to 120 minutes, with 15 minutes intervals). A systematic study on the effect of these processing conditions on the size distribution of NFC particles was conducted using an analytical centrifuge (Lumisizer). A prevalence of particles with equivalent hydrodynamic diameters between ~250 nm and ~300 nm was observed regardless of the processing conditions. Notably, in the context of large-scale NFC production, our approach demonstrated a 70% reduction in specific energy consumption by either increasing the processing volume from 15 L to 25 L and increasing the initial cellulose concentration from 1 wt% to 2 wt%. Additionally, we explored the application of produced NFC as nanofillers in nanocomposite packaging materials. Specifically, NFC particles processed at different grinding times were incorporated into a glycerol-plasticized carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) matrix to form bio-nanocomposite films. We have found that particles obtained with longer grinding time did not lead to increased mechanical performance.

The mid-polar 624 GC stationary phase (6% cyanopropylphenyl/94% dimethylpolysiloxane) is becoming a common choice for bioanalysis and metabolomics. However, referenceable RI data for compounds separated on the 624 stationary phase are limited, hindering the ability to identify unknowns. Comparing 624 retention indices for 252 compounds to their corresponding nonpolar and polar retention indices in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) GC RI database, we identified a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.99) between the 624 and nonpolar values and an equation to interconvert between them. Thus, retention indices obtained on a 624 stationary phase can now be compared to the NIST GC RI database; however, there are no standardized criteria for determining whether an observed RI and a database RI value are a match. To develop RI match criteria, we evaluated the variability of the RI values in NIST for each of the 252 compounds in this study. Based on our findings, we suggest defining an observed nonpolar RI that is within one standard deviation of the median value in NIST as a strong match (i.e., within 12 units for a nonpolar RI match or 14 units for a polar RI match), and defining a weak match using looser criteria, e.g., within three standard deviations of the median RI value in NIST. Lastly, we provide an example for how to use strong and weak RI matches as part of the workflow for compound identification in a gas chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry analysis, with the goal of assigning Metabolomics Standards Initiative confidence levels to each identification.", "date": "2024-09-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this area, the impact of the Eu(II)-cation on their structures and optical properties has not been well explored.  Synthetic investigations of the Eu-Ag-IV-Ch (IV = Sn or Ge; Ch = S or Se) systems have unveiled four Eu(II)-based quaternary chalcogenides exhibiting very large mid-IR SHG responses within the chemically-rich systems II-I2-IV-Ch4 and II3-I2-IV2-Ch8 (Ch = S or Se; I, II, and IV = monovalent, divalent and tetravalent cations, respectively). Their structures were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) methods to crystallize in noncentrosymmetric space groups, I4 \u03052m for EuAg2GeS4 (1) and I4 \u03053d for Eu3Ag2Ge2Se8 (2) Eu3Ag2Sn2Se8 (3) and Eu3Ag2Sn2S8 (4). The structures consist of body-centered arrangements of (Ge/Sn)Ch4 tetrahedra that are fully oriented and bridged by flattened AgCh4 tetrahedra into 3D networks and charge-balanced by Eu(II) cations. Their crystalline powders exhibit mid-IR (2.09 \u00b5m) SHG responses among the largest reported to date, ranging from a large ~1.9 \u00d7 AGS (AgGaS2) for1, to remarkably high activities of ~1.9 for 3, ~4.7 for 2, and ~7.0 for 4 \u00d7 AGS. Spin-polarized band structure calculations showed the valence and conduction band edge states stem from interactions of the Ag-to-S/Se and Ge/Sn-to-S/Se based states, respectively, with increasing contributions of the Eu(II) 4f7-based in the order of 1 < 3 < 2 < 4.  Interestingly, this trend correlates with the SHG activity, suggesting a potential new relationship for understanding and attaining cutting-edge SHG properties within Eu(II)-based chalcogenides.

Here, kinetic data and density functional theory calculations are combined to elucidate the mechanism of toluene hydrogenation on Pt nanoparticles at temperatures where turnover rates decrease with increasing temperature (> 490 K), a behavior typical of arene hydrogenations. Concurrent measurements of site-time-yields to methylcyclohexane (MCH), the final product, and the pressures of methylcyclohexene isomers (MCHE), intermediates, reveal that partial toluene hydrogenation to MCHE isomers reaches equilibrium, with the subsequent hydrogenation of MCHE limiting MCH formation rates. MCHE concentrations decrease with increasing temperature due to their exothermic formation, resulting in a concomitant decrease in hydrogenation rates. The transitions states that mediate MCHE hydrogenation are found to form exothermically from gaseous MCHE and H2 reactants (-20 \u00b1 20 kJ mol-1), leading to lower hydrogenation rates as temperatures increase. Kinetic barriers exist, despite the negative enthalpic barrier, due to the entropic penalties for binding and reacting MCHE isomers (-210 \u00b1 40 J mol-1 K-1). These hydrogenation processes occur on surfaces saturated by H-adatoms and by bound methylenebenzene, which forms by abstracting benzylic H from toluene. These species bind to different Pt atom ensembles (1 and 6 Pt atoms for H and methylenebenzene, respectively), which differ from those which mediate hydrogenation (5.3 \u00b1 0.4 Pt atoms). Multi-site kinetic models, developed using lattice statistics to rigorously account for these site requirements, are essential for interpreting reactant pressure and temperature effects.

Recently, the concomitant organocatalyzed aminolysis and S-alkylation of the cyclic carbonates of PHU formulations offered a facile way to produce CO2 self-blown PHU foams. However, this process was limited to the production of foams of rather low Tg (commonly up to room temperature) and suffered from a slow foaming (i.e. 30 min.) at 120 \u00b0C, thus still far away from the foaming timeframes (1-10 min) and room temperature (r.T.) needed for adaptation on industrial foaming equipment\u2019s. In this work, we elaborate strategies to accelerate the thiol-assisted NIPU foaming in order to be complete in 5 to 10 minutes from r.T. reactive formulations under catalyst-free conditions. This is achieved by substituting aliphatic thiols by more acidic aromatic ones, and by adding epoxides as heat release promotors that will accelerate both the foaming and curing rates. Moreover, flexible, semi-rigid and rigid foams are easily accessible by the choice of the amine comonomer and epoxide additive.

In cement research, it has become indispensable for quantifying the heat release during cement hydration.  It is used to study the reactivity of cementitious binders and the effect of admixture chemistry and dosage. Most isothermal calorimetry data on cementitious materials is analyzed qualitatively, i.e., by graphical comparison of heat flow curves. This is a missed opportunity, as the method delivers precise quantitative data with clearly defined chemical meaning. This work presents a lightweight open-source toolchain for quantitative analysis of isothermal calorimetry data. Using this toolchain, we quantify the effect of three retarders, sucrose, etidronic acid, and racemic tartaric acid, on the hydration of Portland cement. In particular, we determine characteristic times and kinetic parameters such as the maximum heat flow, the duration of the dormant period, or the maximum acceleration and the corresponding time. The results reveal that the efficiency of the retarders ranks in the order sucrose > etidronic acid > DL-tartaric acid. Further, we find that the end of the dormant period of cement hydration is exponentially dependent on the dosage of etidronic acid. In contrast, sucrose and tartaric acid show a small deviation from an exponential relationship which indicates differences in the retardation mechanism. This is also reflected in the acceleration of the main silicate reaction. Increasing amounts of etidronic acid lead to a significantly more substantial reduction of the C3S hydration acceleration than sucrose.

Experimental optimization of the process conditions is time-consuming and expensive while accurate theoretical predictions still pose a major challenge. Current models of dialysis account for the Donnan equilibrium, acid-base properties and ion-protein interactions but they neglect the patchy distribution of ionizable groups on the proteins and its impact on the solution properties.

In this study, a powerful, yet straightforward, equivalent-circuit detail-balance modeling framework is developed and applied to evaluate the performance of photocatalytic systems featuring multiple light absorbers. Specifically, low bandgap iridium-doped strontium titanate is modeled a Z-scheme photocatalyst to effect desired hydrogen evolution and iron-based redox shuttle oxidation reactions. Our model has unique capabilities to simulate competing redox reactions and address mass-transfer limitations. In a significant departure from state-of-the-art circuit models, our study develops tools to perform load-line analyses by incorporating a net electrochemical load curve that includes both desired and competing redox reactions. Consequently, reaction selectivity is predicted from equivalent circuit models for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems. Our investigation into ensembles comprised of multiple, semi-transparent light absorbers reveals their potential to outperform a single, optically thick light absorber, particularly when operated under mass-transfer-limited conditions. However, this outcome hinges on minimizing mass-transfer rates of select redox species to prevent undesired reactions of hydrogen oxidation and/or redox shuttle reduction. Our findings demonstrate that reaction selectivity can be achieved by tuning asymmetry in redox species mass-transfer even with perfectly symmetric electrocatalytic charge-transfer coefficients.

In this work, we develop a novel algorithm, the Memory kErnel Minimization based Neural Networks (MEMnets), that accurately identifies the slow CVs of biomolecular dynamics. MEMnets is distinct from popular deep-learning approaches (such as VAMPnets or SRVs) that assume Markovian dynamics. Instead, MEMnets is built on the integrative generalized master equation (IGME) theory, which incorporates non-Markovian dynamics by encoding them in a memory kernel for continuous CVs. The key innovation of MEMnets is to identify optimal CVs by minimizing time-integrated memory kernels. To accomplish this, MEMnets process time sequences of molecular dynamics (MD) conformations by using parallel encoder neural networks that project high-dimensional MD data into a low-dimensional latent space. The time-integrated memory kernels, derived from IGME theory, are then computed in the latent space as the objective function. We demonstrate that our MEMnets algorithm can effectively identify the slow CVs involved in the folding of FIP35 WW-domain with high accuracy, and successfully reveal two parallel folding pathways. Furthermore, we test MEMnets\u2019 on the clamp opening of a bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), a much more complex conformational change (a system containing over 540K atoms), where sampling from all-atom MD simulations is limited.

A foundation language model can in principle address not only a variety of those subtasks but also a range of domains without the need of generating costly large-scale annotated datasets for each downstream task. While the materials science domain, which is adversely affected by data scarcity, would strongly benefit from this, foundation language models struggle with information extraction subtasks in domain-specific settings. This applies also to the so-called named entity recognition (NER) subtask which aims to detect relevant entity types in natural language.\n\nThis work aims to assess whether foundation large language models (LLMs) can successfully perform NER in the materials mechanics and fatigue domain to alleviate the data annotation burden. Specifically, we compare the few-shot prompting of foundation LLMs with the current state-of-the-art, fine-tuned task-specific NER models. The study is performed on two materials fatigue datasets which contain annotations at a comparatively fine-grained level. Both datasets cover adjacent domains to assess how well both NER methodologies generalize when presented with typical domain shifts. Task-specific models are shown to significantly outperform general foundation models. However, the GPT-4 foundation model attains promising F1-scores with the proposed two-stage prompting strategy despite being provided with only ten demonstrations. Under those circumstances, it outperformed task-specific models for some rather general entity types. Different ways onwards to improve foundation LLM-based NER are discussed.

Yet detailed theoretical studies of surface geometry in the presence of adsorbates are relatively sparse and many applications focus upon ensemble average surface geometric characteristics. Here we demonstrate that different interpretations of surface geometry emerge when considering the distributions of the geometric descriptors of surface curvature and orientation as a function of adsorbed surfactant concentration and sterics. At low surface coverage, the tributyl phosphate (TBP) sorbed water/vapor surface has an increased presence of ridges that are defined by principle curvatures $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$ of opposite signs yet close in magnitude. As the TBP surface coverage increases, the difference in principle curvatures slowly increases. However there is a distinct transition of the surface geometry, where the ridge-like features become much more pronounced, having sides whose orientation is normal to a flat interfacial plane. Thus as the TBP surfactant is added to the surface, the surface curvatures become significantly anisotropic in terms of the difference in magnitude of $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2.$  We label this an \\textit{isotropic $\\rightarrow$ anisotropic} geometric transition.  Comparing the surface geometry as a function of carbon tail length of the alkyl phosphate surfactant reveals that smaller surfactants also anisotropically enhance surface curvatures on the surface, and that adsorbed alkyl tails to the surface stabilize and increase the symmetry of surface waves along the two principle curvature axes.

Typical HTMs are organic semiconductors; therefore, dopants are required to enhance the hole collection properties of PSCs. One typical set of dopants used is lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) combined with 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). The primary role of TBP is to dissolve Li-TFSI, yet the effects of TBP independent of those of Li-TFSI remain elusive, especially when combined with poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), a promising HTM possessing the advantage of thermal stability. To investigate the effects of TBP, we employed n-octylammonium TFSI (OA-TFSI) room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) additive for PTAA with a calibrated TBP concentration. The recently emerged OA-TFSI additive functions as a spontaneous perovskite passivator; during the deposition of the HTM solution containing the OA-TFSI additive, the OA cations spontaneously passivate the perovskite, effectively suppressing defects on the perovskite surface. As OA-TFSI is an RTIL, the necessity of TBP for dissolving OA-TFSI in the HTM solution is potentially negated, unlike Li-TFSI. Indeed, the OA-TFSI without TBP exhibited relatively high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in PTAA-based n\u2013i-p-structured PSCs of up to 22.0%, exploiting the effective spontaneous perovskite passivation. However, TBP addition to the HTM solution resulted in compensational effects on the photovoltaic (PV) performance. TBP addition improved the uniformity of the PTAA HTM layer, contributing to an increased fill factor, and TBP addition presumably hampered spontaneous perovskite passivation and caused energy loss between the perovskite and PTAA, which decreased the open-circuit voltage. Consequently, the PSCs with optimal TBP addition exhibited a PV performance similar to that without TBP addition (e.g., highest PCE of 21.6%). The obtained insights provide valuable guidance regarding the use of additives for PTAA HTMs, which can be a bottleneck for PTAA-based PSC development, thus contributing to the further development of PSCs.

Hyperpolarization by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) provides a route to enhancing 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sensitivity by more than five orders of magnitude for a wide range of small molecules on a benchtop NMR system. We show here how ligands can be secondarily labeled with 13C tags and hyperpolarized with conventional dDNP methods.

The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) represents a technique to simplify EIS data by deconvolution with a suitable kernel, while with equivalent circuit modelling (ECM) a user-selected function is fitted to characterize the investigated system. Ideally, the residuals of a DRT fit should represent random white noise without systematic residuals, hence no useful data is lost by this analysis step. Thereby DRT can provide the number of distinguishable features based solely on the EIS data, without a priori knowledge of the response of the investigated system. It is demonstrated that such a 'lossless' DRT inversion is possible if the local noise amplitude is considered, which requires a weighted DRT procedure and a method to estimate the frequency dependent noise amplitude. A noise estimate to determine the necessary weights was obtained using multiple EIS acquisitions of the same battery at identical state-of-charge. Alternatively, it is shown that Gaussian process regression (GPR) is capable of estimating an equivalent weighting matrix from a single data set as a prerequisite for automatized weighted DRT inversion without user intervention. The obtained DRT spectrum is then used for the selection of an equivalent circuit model, its initial parametrization, and setting of constraints. The robustness and reliability of this technique is tested numerically using a simple digital twin model. Eventually, by means of the investigated battery it is discussed that using a combination of DRT and ECM, a more physically relevant description of processes in an electrochemical system can be achieved.", "date": "2024-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We investigated the deformation of PNIPAM microgels induced by diffractively excited plasmons, chosen for their high controllability.

Here we describe the deposition of optically transparent, permanently porous thin films comprised of a peripherally carboxylated free-base porphyrin and a cationic porous molecular cage. The films are assembled via layer-by-layer growth controlled by Coulombic charge pairing, which allows for systematic control over the thickness of the obtained films.

Here, atomic scale simulations of surface energies and reaction pathway kinetics supported by experimental evidence unveil that CO2RR does not take place on perfect planar Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces but rather on steps or kinks defects, and that these planar surfaces tend to restructure in reaction conditions to the active stepped surfaces. By combining basin hopping global sampling and grand canonical density functional theory, we show that the extremely low CO coverage on (111) and (100) surfaces, originating from sluggish CO2 conversion and unfavorable CO binding, limits the ability of these surfaces to reduce CO2 to multi-carbon products. Steps and kinks at surfaces, despite the lack of decrease in C-C coupling barriers on these sites, exhibit a significant increase in activity arising from beneficial CO2 activation and higher CO coverage. Notably, the square motifs adjacent to defects, not the defects themselves, are the active sites for CO2RR via synergistic effect. In addition, the strong binding of CO on defective sites acts as a thermodynamic driving force for the restructuring of planar surfaces to active stepped terminations under reactive conditions. We evaluate these mechanisms against experiments of CO2RR on UHV-prepared ultraclean Cu surfaces. Overall, our findings highlight the structural sensitivity in steering CO2RR and elucidate the origin of in situ restructuring of Cu catalysts during the reaction.

Etalon filters produce narrowband (picosecond) pulses with an asymmetric temporal profile that is ideal for stimulated resonance Raman excitation. However, etalon filters with high finesse are typically only useful at the laser fundamental and harmonic frequencies due to very low throughput and limited tunability. Here, we show that a single etalon filter with low finesse (15 cm\u20131 bandwidth, 172 cm\u20131 free spectral range) provides an efficient and tunable option for generating Raman pump pulses over a wide range of wavelengths when used in combination with an optical parametric amplifier and a second harmonic generation (SHG) crystal that has an appropriate phase-matching bandwidth. Tuning the SHG wavelength to match individual transmission lines of the etalon filter gives asymmetric picosecond pump pulses over a range of 460-650 nm. The SHG crystal length determines the temporal rise time of the pulse, which is an important property for reducing background and increasing Raman signals compared with symmetric pulses having the same total energy. This approach provides a relatively simple and efficient method to generate optimally shaped picosecond pump pulses for resonance-enhanced FSRS measurements across the visible region of the spectrum.", "date": "2024-09-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Optics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here we demonstrate that a combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR) spectroscopies, detecting distances in the angstrom to nanometre range, can probe distinct regions of conformational flexibility in this riboswitch.

In many recent studies, this has been attributed to the presence of internal friction within the system. Previously, we showed that memory-dependent friction arising from the non-equilibrium solvation of a single particle crossing a smooth one-dimensional barrier can also cause such a deviation and be misinterpreted as internal friction. Here we introduce a simple diatom model and show that even in the absence of explicit solvent, internal memory effects arise due to coupling of the reaction coordinate motion with frictionally orthogonal degrees of freedom. This results in a fractional viscosity dependence and a deviation from Kramers\u2019 theory, typically attributed to the presence of internal friction. This model therefore mimics several biological processes where a local conformational change of a biomolecule is often influenced by its surroundings. This gives rise to an apparent \u201cinternal friction\u201d commonly measured in terms of empirical fitting parameters \u03b1 and \u03c3. We propose a microscopic measure of this internal friction using Grote-Hynes theory which employs memory-dependent friction.

In this work, several UiO66-polymer composites (where polymer is either PEG, PVDF, PS, PIM-1, PP or PMMA) are examined using molecular simulations. Our contribution highlights the interface's impact on thermal conductivity, observing an overall increasing trend attributable to the synergistic effect of MOF enhancing polymer thermal conductivity. Flexible polymers like PEG and PVDF exhibit increased compatibility with the MOF, facilitating their integration with the MOF lattice. However, this integration leads to a moderated enhancement in thermal conductivity compared to polymers that remain separate from the MOF structure, such as PS or PP. This effect can be attributed to alterations in phonon transport pathways and shifts in interfacial interactions between the polymer and MOF. Specifically, the infiltration of the polymer like PEG and PVDF into the MOF disrupted the MOF\u2019s ordered network, introducing defects or barriers that hindered phonon propagation. In contrast, non-polar and rigid polymers like PP, PMMA, PS, and PIM-1 exhibited greater improvements in thermal conductivity when combined with MOFs compared to the flexible polymers PVDF and PEG.

Specifically, the [An(arene)(BH4)3] complexes (AnMe6 , An = Np, Pu, U, arene C6Me6) are studied. Density functional theory (DFT) shows that, when the complexes are neutral, the interaction between the metal ions and the soft-donor ligands is governed by electrostatic interactions. Molecular orbital analysis, with both the DFT and the complete active space (CASSCF) method, shows that as one moves from U to Pu, the energy gap between the 5f orbitals of the metal ion and the ligand \u03c0\u2217 orbitals gradually increases, leading to a weaker metal-ligand interaction. Upon reduction to AnMe6\u2212, the An\u2013arene distances contract by 0.1-0.2   \u030aA compared to the neutral complex, leading stronger metal-ligand interactions with varying degrees of \u03b4-bonding depending on the actinide.

In the lower-spin states, these bonding orbitals become even more delocalized and the population of the \u03b4\u2217 orbital increases from U to Pu.

Motivated by the need for environmentally-friendly and effective separation methods, we address the challenge of selecting solvent systems that balance separation efficiency, selectivity, and environmental impact, while also tackling the difficulty of separating multiple bioproducts using complex solvent systems. Our approach specifically seeks to predict product partition coefficients as thermodynamic parameters underlying solvent selection. The iterative approach integrates Bayesian optimization with experimental measurements to guide solvent selection, and leverages COSMO-RS simulations to enhance high-throughput experimentation. Using the design of solvent systems for the separation of lignin-derived aromatic products via centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) as a case study, we show that within seven iterations/cycles of the methodology, we can identify new mixtures of green solvents that align with CPC design principles.

Upon excitation to the 1\u03c0\u03c0* state by 4.66 eV UV photons, both molecules exhibited rapid relaxation into lower-lying electronic states followed by decay to the S0 ground state.

A key to enabling this technology is the development of solid-state electrolytes with the elusive combination of high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability and the ability to form a conductive and stable interface with Li metal. Presently, oxide and sulfide-based materials, particularly garnet and argyrodite-type structures, have proved most promising for this application. However, these still suffer from a number of challenges, including resistive lithium metal interfaces, poor lithium dendrite suppression (at high current density) and low voltage stability. Here we report the first application of lithium imide, an antifluorite-structured material, as a solid electrolyte in a Li-metal battery. Low-temperature synthesis of lithium imide produces promising Li-ion conductivity, reaching > 1 mS cm-1 at 30 \u02daC using a modest post-synthetic mechanochemical treatment, as well as displaying at least 5 V stability vs Li+/Li. In situ electrochemical operation of lithium imide with Li-metal electrodes reveals a 1000-fold increase in its measured ionic conductivity, whilst appearing to remain an electronic insulator. It is postulated that stoichiometry variation at the grain boundary leads to a highly disordered quasi-liquid state, facilitating this conductivity improvement. Furthermore, the material is shown to possess impressive stability under high current density conditions (70 mA cm-2) as well as the ability to operate in Li-metal battery cells. These results not only highlight the promising performance of lithium imide, but also its potential to be the basis for a new family of antifluorite based solid electrolytes.

Yet, to keep up with conventional technologies or even reduce the cost of capture associated with them, a hydrate-based technology must have (1) a short induction time, (2) fast formation kinetics, and (3) moderate process conditions. To date, these requirements can only be met by adding promoters to the system, which comes at its own cost and disadvantages. Here, we show that the requirements can also be met without promoters by forming mixed gas hydrates in a packed bed of ice stabilized by fumed silica. While the high specific surface area of the packed bed warrants short induction times and fast kinetics, low temperatures ensure both moderate formation pressures and a high CO2 selectivity. The favorable properties can be maintained and even improved upon over many capture/regeneration cycles when operated at temperatures lower than 253 K, as this ensures a continuous formation of pores in the ice. We demonstrate the advantages of this route for carbon capture on a bench scale through batch, semi-batch, and continuous experiments. In semi-batch operation at 233 K and 40 bar, the mole fraction of CO2 in a synthetic flue gas is reduced from 15 mol% to 2.5 mol%. At the same thermodynamic conditions, a split fraction of 70% and a specific energy consumption below 3.0 GJ/tCO2 are achieved in continuous operation. The inherent advantages and simplicity of this process, a specific energy consumption comparable with the state of the art even though entirely based on the bench-scale experiment, as well as environmental harmlessness, emphasize the potential of this hydrate-based process to meet the demands of the industry at a minimal cost of capture.", "date": "2024-09-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Herein, thermo-responsive liposomes were developed to permit precise control over the teriparatide release rate through modulation of temperature. Entrapment of hydrophilic molecules, including peptides within liposomes remains challenging due to the large volume of hydration. In this work, hydrophobic ion pairing was employed for the first time to enhance peptide entrapment within liposomes. The method resulted in a hydrophobic complex that achieved high teriparatide entrapment (>75%) in sub-200 nm, monodispersed liposomes. Hydrophobic ion pairing outperformed other entrapment approaches. Several liposomal formulations with transition temperatures between 38 \u2013 50 \u00b0C were obtained by modulation of the phospholipid composition. In vitro release assays demonstrated temperature-dependent release kinetics with faster rates of release observed at/above the transition temperature. The maintenance of biological activity of released teriparatide was demonstrated in a cell-based assay utilising the PTH1R receptor. Overall, this provides the first proof-of-concept of the suitability of thermo-responsive systems for pulsatile delivery of teriparatide and similar peptides.

Here, we introduce a workflow aimed at efficiently training neural network potentials (NNPs) to explore energy barriers in solution at the hybrid density functional theory level. The computational burden associated with training at the PBE0-D3(BJ) level is bypassed through the use of active and transfer learning techniques, whereas extensive sampling of the transition state region is accelerated by well-tempered metadynamics simulations using multiple time-step integration. These NNPs serve to explore a puzzling solute--solvent reactivity route involving the ring opening of N-enoxyphthalimide experimentally observed in methanol but not in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). This reaction represents a challenging example characterized by intricate hydrogen bonding networks and structurally ambiguous solvent-sensitive transition states. The methodology successfully delivers detailed free energy surfaces and relative energy barriers in quantitative agreement with experiment. These barriers are associated with an ensemble of transition states involving direct participation of up to five solvent molecules. While this picture contrasts with the single transition state structure assumed by current static models, no drastic qualitative difference is observed between the formed hydrogen bonding networks and the number of participating solvent molecules in methanol or TFE. The dichotomy between the two solvents thus essentially arises from an electronic effect (i.e., distinct nucleophilicity) and from the larger conformational entropy contributions in methanol.

RAS proteins are important cancer drug targets, and are useful systems for evaluating docking methods, including accounting for solvation effects and covalent small molecule binding. Water often plays a key role in small molecule binding to RAS proteins, and many inhibitors, including approved drugs, covalently bind to oncogenic RAS proteins. We assembled a RAS test set, consisting of 138 RAS protein structures and 2 structures of KRAS DNA in complex with ligands. In DOCK 6, we have implemented a receptor desolvation scoring function and a covalent docking algorithm. These new features were evaluated using the test set, with pose reproduction, cross-docking, and enrichment calculations. We tested two solvation methods for generating receptor desolvation scoring grids: GIST, and 3D-RISM. Using grids from GIST or 3D-RISM, water displacements are precomputed with Gaussian-weighting, and trilinear interpolation is used to speed up this scoring calculation. To test receptor desolvation scoring, we prepared GIST and 3D-RISM grids for all KRAS systems in the test set, and we compare enrichment performance with and without receptor desolvation. Accounting for receptor desolvation using GIST improves enrichment for 51% of systems, while using 3D-RISM improves enrichment for 44% of systems. To more rigorously test accounting for receptor desolvation using 3D-RISM, we compare pose reproduction with and without 3D-RISM receptor desolvation. Pose reproduction docking with 3D-RISM yields a 5.5% increase in success rate compared to docking without 3D-RISM. Accounting for receptor desolvation provides a small, but significant, improvement in both enrichment and pose reproduction for this set. We tested the covalent attach-and-grow algorithm on 70 KRAS systems containing covalent ligands, obtaining similar pose reproduction success rates between covalent and noncovalent docking. Comparing covalent docking to noncovalent docking, there is a 7.2% increase and a 2.9% decline in success rate when docking with experimental and SMILES-generated ligand conformations, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we performed covalent virtual screens with and without receptor desolvation scoring, targeting the switch II pocket of KRAS, using 3.4 million make-on-demand acrylamide compounds from the Enamine REAL database.

Thus far, salts based on bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) have been developed as additives for perovskite photoabsorbers and have improved the quality of the perovskite layers. However, the effects of TFSI anions require clarification because most TFSI-based additives are multifunctional; both the counter cation and TFSI anion improve the quality of the perovskite layers. Therefore, we synthesized a novel methylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (MATFSI) and revealed the chemical capping effects of TFSI-based additives on the perovskite layer. MATFSI includes the same cation as the co-additive MA chloride, which is used to create narrow-bandgap perovskite layers. Hence, the use of the MATFSI additive can reveal the effect of the TFSI anion, independent of its counter cation. MATFSI addition resulted in the spontaneous coating of the TFSI moiety on the perovskite layer during its deposition process, and facilitated the crystal growth of the perovskite layer; thus, TFSI chemical capping effectively hampered defect formation in the perovskite layer. Hence, the optimal MATFSI addition improved the photovoltaic (PV) performance of the PSCs. Notably, the resulting perovskite surface that was chemically capped with TFSI displayed high wettability to water droplets, yet exhibited improved PV performance stability against humidity, which contradicts the overarching opinion in this research field. Parameter-differentiated contact angle (PDCA) measurements indicated that the high wettability of water droplets was attributed to the formation of active hydrogen bonds derived from the TFSI capping on the outer perovskite surface; moreover, the improvement in stability against humidity could be attributed to the low dispersion energy of the CF3 moiety in the TFSI capping. The insights obtained in this study could assist in improving perovskite additives and highlight the effectiveness of the simple PDCA method, which offers insights that conventional contact angle measurements cannot provide.", "date": "2024-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is a vertebrate-specific miRNA known for its high expression in the liver, where it plays a role in hepatic metabolism, liver development and cellular differentiation. Dysregulation of miR-122 has been found in pathological conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma or drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Currently, miRNA detection faces challenges such as improving point-of-care efficiency, obtaining direct results and accurately identifying miRNA isoforms. Overcoming these challenges is essential to improve the clinical efficacy of miR-122 detection as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in liver-related diseases. In this study, we present a click chemistry driven dual nanosystem designed for single-base specific miR-122 detection using a flow cytometer as the reading platform. Using the dual nanosystem, we analysed miR-122 expression in various tumour cell lines with specificity and robustness, showing a high correlation with results obtained from a TaqMan assay. We also detected miR-122 using a serum matrix and identified four single nucleotide variations at a specific position within the miR-122 sequence. Our approach involves a fully bioorthogonal strategy and includes signal amplification using two types of different nanoparticles together with the high affinity of peptide nucleic acid probes. The chemistry used in this dual nanosystem offers remarkable versatility and provides a promising opportunity to pioneer enzyme-free nanoparticle-based strategies based on click chemistry and bioorthogonality miRNA detection and isomiR studies, thus advancing the field of molecular diagnostics.", "date": "2024-09-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Here we attempt to explain this behavior with composite Ni/Ni-3S2. First, simulated annealing of a previously generated Ni/Ni3S2 heterostructure uncovered S-diffusion to the Ni surface. GCDFT calculations show that pristine Ni is likely to be lightly modified by adsorbed OH at alkaline conditions, in contrast to other metals, and reveal that the OH- and S-modified surfaces are mutually exclusive. These light modifications did not significantly change the activity of the Ni surface. Seeing no effect on the static Volmer step (the RDS of alkaline HER), we performed dynamic calculations of the alkaline Volmer barrier. Using metadynamics to sample the reaction along our defined collective variable (CV), we first estimate the barrier on Ni and Pt, obtaining a similar gap between static and dynamic barriers. Low temperature (100K) sampling on Ni found a significantly lower barrier relating to the more consistent hydrogen-bondng at low temperatures. Our characterization of the Ni and Pt interfaces from unbiased AIMD showed similar solvent structures, further supporting this line of thinking. Finally, calculations on OH- and S-modified Ni surfaces found that the former surface had a greater Volmer barrier by 0.16 eV. This OH-modified surface had a significantly less consistent solvation environment, with an average hydrogen bond lifetime 14 fs less than that of the S-modified surface. From these results, we contend that the enhanced activity of composite Ni/Ni3S2 catalysts originates from adsorbed S on Ni preventing OH-binding and the associated decline in interfacial solvation. Our calculations emphasize the importance of interface dynamics on electrochemical reaction barriers.", "date": "2024-09-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While, catalytic and co-catalytic contributions in them have predominantly been attributed to the metal centre and active site residues, The significance of auxiliary residues coordinated to the metal ion has often been underemphasized, and traditionally viewed as passive elements confined to the role of stabilizing the metal ion. Herein, we present the detailed reaction mechanism of Terephthalate 1,2-cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (TphB), the only known Zinc-dependent oxidative decarboxylase and the role of zinc coordinated histidine residues in catalysis. Over 30 X-ray crystallographic structures of active site variants revealed a notable trend in the N\u03b5-Zn-N\u03b5 angles during the course of catalytic transitions. Initially the H159N\u03b52-Zn-N\u03b52H203, H255N\u03b52-Zn-N\u03b52H203, H159N\u03b52-Zn-N\u03b52H255 angles in the native state were 60\u00b0, 59.2\u00b0, and 55.5\u00b0. The angles significantly increased in transition state analogues, by 39.4\u00b0, 45.05\u00b0, and 42\u00b0, then again decrease in the product state by 16.7\u00b0, 17.7\u00b0, and 17.7\u00b0, respectively. This trend aligns with the Jencks \"Circe effect,\" where these angular adjustments introduce a conformational restriction, thereby elevating the system's free energy through entropic loss. These fluxional changes, akin to Berry pseudorotation and the Bartell mechanism, accompanied by continuous cycles of entropic loss and gain, facilitate substrate accommodation, catalytic transitions, transition state stabilization/destabilization, product release, and ultimately, reversion to the enzyme\u2019s initial state.

Here, oxygen (O2) in zinc-air (O2) battery (ZAB) is shown to impact the anodic process adversely, leading to early cell failure, though its amount limiting can affect the cathodic reaction kinetics. An unexplored chemical reduction process of dissolved O2 on metallic zinc in alkaline medium leading to peroxide radical (O2\u02d9\u00af) species generation is proven, by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and hydrodynamic voltammetry studies, followed by the formation of ZnO passivation layer on the Zn surface causing cell death. Keeping similar discharge times, early ZnO passivation occurred on the ZAB with its anode kept in an O2 rich environment than in the other one of O2 free environment. A slight modification in the cell design ensuring the limited availability of O2 at anode provided ~5 times extended cyclability (~7 hours to ~35 hours) than the ZAB with no such control leading to enhanced specific capacity. Presence of O2 in the anodic compartment leads to early cell failure from passivating ZnO formation impeding charge transfer. Limiting the O2 transfer from the cathodic side to anodic compartment can extend the cell cyclability and enhance discharge capacity. As alkaline ZABs are proposed for applications ranging from portable hearing aids to mini-grids, with self-discharge from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on metallic Zn as a major roadblock, this study unravels predominant parasitic chemical process by O2 on the Zn surface, highlighting the importance of cathodic O2 crossover inhibition in the alkaline ZAB. \n", "date": "2024-09-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In the case of the structural properties, our simulations accurately reproduce the structural changes occurring in locally ordered units, reported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements when the catalyst films are activated by exposition to a positive potential. We have highlighted the crucial role in this process of a series of proton- coupled electron transfer events in the reversible oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III). Once assessed structural models of NiCat and Fe:NiCat in close agreement with experimental results, we used them to investigate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) atomistic mechanism, activated when the applied potential exceeds the overpotential required to oxidize water and produce molecular oxygen. We have quantitatively compared seven different pathways for the OER enrolled on both the proposed families of reaction mechanisms, namely the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice-oxygen mediate mechanism (LOM), and we have rationalized the effect of iron in the huge enhancement of catalytic activity of Fe:NiCat with respect to NiCat. Regarding the competition between AEM and LOM mechanisms, our results support the idea that simple metal- oxygen-metal atomistic motifs, ubiquitous on the surface of all kinds of crystalline and amorphous metal (oxy)hydroxide catalyst films, are able to promote different mechanisms of both types, all compatible with the application of an external positive potential in the range of those used in real electrochemical devices performing the OER. Finally, our results suggest that the elusive role of iron is related to the significant difference between Ni(IV)-O and Fe(IV)-O bonds in two crucial reaction intermediates immediately preceding the formation of the O-O bond, with Fe ions able to lower the potential required to form such intermediates along most of the investigated reaction paths.", "date": "2024-09-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite their significance, the structural analysis of these polymorphisms, particularly conformational polymorphisms, remains challenging due to the limited methodology that provides sufficient resolution for microcrystalline variants of polymorphs. Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) is an emerging technique with significant potential for elucidating the microcrystal structures of functional organic molecules, pharmaceuticals, and biomolecules. Despite this potential, there are limited instances of 3D ED structures for small molecules exhibiting the lowest crystallographic symmetry with a preferred orientation, and possibly conformational variations of constituent molecules. A novel organic semi-conductor, Ph-anti-benzothieno[5,6-b]benzothieno[3,2-b]thiophene-C10 (antiC10) is one of such examples. We have successfully determined the 3D ED structure of this challenging molecule for the first time. The antiC10 crystal exhibited the lowest symmetry (space group P1), and the preferred orientations against the grid resulted in a missing cone. These challenges were surmounted by employing a sequential molecular replacement approach with an ab initio generated search model. The resulting octameric antiC10 structure reveals a two-monolayer architecture and an antiparallel alkyl-interdigitated herringbone configuration, in contrast to the all-parallel associations observed in its previously reported isomer. Concurrently, the alkyl chains intricately interdigitated with each other, positioned between the adjacent \u03c0-core strata. Detailed analysis has elucidated the conformational polymorphism in herringbone packing between the two monolayers, as well as in intramolecular conformations among monomers. The structure with conformational polymorphism is presumably in a metastable intermediate state stabilized by twinning. These findings may provide critical insights into the crystallization mechanisms and rational design of organic semiconductors.

The amount of phosphate ester and thiol was varied and its influence on material properties and frontal polymerization kinetics were analyzed. The reaction kinetics were studied with FTIR and photo-DSC measurements, showing a trend towards lower reactivity and higher conversions with an increased thiol content. The obtained networks exhibited tunable bond exchange rates by varying either the amount of thiol or of the catalyst. DMA measurements reveal a higher network homogeneity with increasing thiol content. Moreover, reprocessing, recycling as well as reshaping of the material was successfully demonstrated.

We find these anomalies are common in the D4 model, although observable consequences are rarer than in the D3 model for reasons we explain. Nevertheless we uncover instances of unphysical local minima and stationary points with the D4 scheme, and propose two solutions that yield smoother dispersion energy as a function of nuclear position.

In this work, a microfluidic device with precise and regular valve-automated droplet sampling, termed a microfluidic analog-to-digital converter (\u00b5ADC), was used to sample secretions from ~0.75 mm diameter adipose explants from mice, and on-chip salt water electrodes were used to merge sampled droplets with reagent droplets from two different fluorometric coupled enzyme assays. By integrating sampling and assays on-chip, either glycerol or non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), or both, were quantified optically within merged 12-nanoliter droplets using a fluorescence microscope with as high as 20-second temporal resolution. Limits of detection were 6 \u00b5M for glycerol (70 fmol) and 0.9 \u00b5M for NEFA (10 fmol). Multiple ex vivo adipose tissue explants were analyzed with this system, all showing clear increases in lipolytic function after switching from feeding to fasting conditions. Enabled by high temporal resolution, lipolytic oscillations of both glycerol and NEFA were observed for the first time in the range of 0.2 to 1.6 min-1. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) spectrograms and burst analyses (0.1 to 4.0 pmol bursts) revealed complex dynamics, with multiplexed assays (duplex for glycerol and NEFA) from the same explants showing mostly discordant bursts. These data support separate mechanisms of NEFA and glycerol release, although the connection to intracellular metabolic oscillations remains unknown. Overall, this device allowed automated and highly precise temporal sampling of tissue explants at high resolution and programmable downstream merging with multiple assay reagents, revealing unique biological information.  Such device features should be applicable to various other tissue or spheroid types and to other assay formats.

The concept of a secondary coordination sphere (SCS) has been widely adopted in designing molecular electrocatalysts to promote the aforementioned energy-conversion reactions. The impact of this supernumerary interaction through the SCS on the oxygen-tolerant properties of molecular electrocatalysts is less explored. A HER electrocatalyst, cobalt diimine-dioxime complex, is one of the metal complexes designed by the concept of SCS to facilitate HER and retain its reactivity in an oxygen environment. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying its oxygen tolerance remains unclear. In this study, mechanistic studies of how this complex undergoes HER under aerobic conditions were conducted. The results reveal that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) predominates in the presence of molecular oxygen. Further studies uncover the intramolecular proton transfer through SCS and intermolecular proton transfer from exogenous proton sources mutually dictate the product selectivity of ORR between H2O2 and H2O, thereby determining the stability of the complex under HER. In addition, the choice of labile ligands has emerged as a useful factor in enhancing oxygen tolerance. These findings provide valuable design principles for developing oxygen-tolerant molecular catalysts and shed light on how the interplay of proton transfer routes between the secondary coordination sphere and exogenous pathway can impact reactivity and product selectivity.", "date": "2024-09-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This creates a demand for 3D imaging techniques that dynamically image soil processes such as fluid and nutrient transport with high resolution. Microscale X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) delivers high-contrast and high-resolution (down to ~1 m) imaging of soil mineral phases. However it does not readily distinguish low-density aqueous and organic phases, nor image water transport. Here we have developed polymer-templated gold nanoparticles as a contrast agent to label the aqueous phase in soil, with gold selected for low toxicity. Nanoparticles are generated by templated synthesis within pre-assembled block copolymer micelles, poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)], poly(DEAEMA-b-PEGMA), to intrinsically exhibit a stabilizing PEG-bottlebrush corona. Block copolymers are generated by group transfer polymerization (GTP). Overall, this process generates gold nanoparticles at high concentrations and in large volumes for soil imaging. The nanoparticles show exceptional colloidal stability (to at least 4M ionic strength), and are stable in the challenging soil environment, showing no adsorption to the soil mineral phase. X-CT imaging within soil distinguished aqueous phase labelled with the nanoparticle contrast agent from unlabelled aqueous phase, at ~ 5 mg/ml Au. In a transport experiment, we determined the effective bulk diffusion constant of the nanoparticle system in water to be 1.1  0.3  10-10 m2s-1.

The quality of isotropic and anisotropic NMR parameters decreased as the result of faster relaxation due to size and dynamics, as well as the need for water suppression and buffer salts. Chemical shifts, scalar couplings, NOE derived distances, and simulated annealing suggested that the backbone conformation of both peptides remained mostly rigid, forming two \u03b2-turns, while the sidechains remain flexible in all environments. The difference between Lys or Arg did not change the backbone conformation, even though the two peptides have different MIC concentrations, indicating that amino acid composition is more important than conformation for antimicrobial activity. Theoretical structures in an explicit lipid bilayer were simulated showing similar structures.\nPilot experiments on SMA-QA nanodiscs indicated that they are viable as membrane model for investigating the interaction between AMPs and lipid membranes.

The structure of the diiron active site is unusual: a histidine-rich center that binds two iron ions without a bridging ligand. This finding makes it difficult to understand how the iron ions coordinate oxidation state changes to achieve the high-valent conditions presumed necessary to activate strong C-H bonds. To ensure that potential photoreduction and radiation damage are not responsible for the absence of a bridging ligand in the resting state cryo-EM structures, spectroscopic methods are needed. We present the results of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments collected under conditions where photodamage was avoided. Careful data analysis reveals an active site structure consistent with the cryo-EM structures in which the two iron ions are ligated by nine histidines and are separated by at least 5 \u00c5.

The MD simulations corroborate EXAFS observations that neither of the two key carboxylate-containing residues (E281 and D190) are likely candidates for metal ion bridging. To further explore the role of these carboxylate residues, we used mutagenesis experiments, spectroscopy, and additional MD simulations to understand the role of these residues. A variant in which a carboxylate containing residue (E281) was changed to a methyl residue (E281A) showed little change in pre-edge features, consistent with the observation that it is not essential for activity and hence unlikely to serve as a bridging ligand at any point in the catalytic cycle.

Previous work revealed that a primary hurdle for utilizing PKS modules to create diverse macrolactones hinges on the selectivity of the thioesterase (TE) domain. Herein, we generated novel hybrid 12-membered macrolactone/lactam ring systems employing unnatural amide-containing hexaketide intermediates in conjunction with an engineered TE S148C mutant from the pikromycin (Pik) biosynthetic pathway. Specifically, unnatural macrocycle (3) was initially formed in severely attenuated yields compared to the native product generated from the natural hexaketide substrate. A stepwise directed evolution campaign generated Pik TE variants with enhanced selectivity for macrocycle formation over hydrolysis. Over three rounds of evolution, a series of mutant Pik TE proteins were identified, and further combinations of beneficial mutations carried from each round produced a composite variant with six-fold enhanced isolated yield of the hybrid macrocycle compared to the parent TE S148C mutant enzyme.

However, the methods used to record and communicate scientific procedures have remained largely unchanged over the last century. Written text as the primary means for communicating scientific protocols poses notable limitations in human and machine information transfer. Therefore, successful replication and analysis of experimental protocols necessitates a new approach for high-fidelity communication. In this work, we present the Universal Workflow Language (UWL) and the open-source Universal Workflow Language interface (UWLi). UWL is a graph-based data architecture that can capture arbitrary scientific procedures through workflow representation of protocol steps and embedded procedure metadata. It is machine readable, discipline agnostic, and compatible with Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable reporting standards. UWLi is an accompanying software package for building and manipulating UWL files into tabular and plain text representations in a controlled, detailed, and multilingual environment. UWL transcription of protocols from three high-impact publications resulted in the identification of substantial deficiencies in the detail of the reported procedures. UWL transcription of these publications identified seventeen procedural ambiguities and thirty missing parameters for every one hundred words in published procedures. In addition to preventing and identifying procedural omission, UWL files were found to be compatible with geometric learning techniques for representing scientific protocols. In a surrogate function designed to represent an arbitrary multi-step experimental process, graph transformer networks were able to predict outcomes in approximately 6,000 fewer experiments than equivalent linear models. Implementation of UWL and UWLi into the scientific reporting process will result in higher reproducibility between both experimentalists and machines, thus proving an avenue to more effective modeling and control of complex systems.", "date": "2024-09-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Quality Control", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

All-atom molecular dynamics simulation has become an invaluable tool to probe lithium diffusion mechanisms and accelerate the discovery of promising polymer chemistries. Because of their low computational cost and despite their approximate nature, only classical interatomic potentials can access the time and length scales for appropriate statistics of polymer kinetics. Machine learning (ML) potentials trained end-to-end on ab initio data have proven more accurate but cannot be scaled to the necessary time- and length- scales yet. Historical approaches to parameterize classical force fields have been incremental, reliant on a manual combination of top-down and bottom-up fitting, and are often paywalled and hard to reproduce. We introduce a computational learning workflow to predict classical interatomic potential parameters using quantum mechanical computations as training data that combines the automation and end-to-end fitting of ML with traditional class 1 and class 2 functional forms. The fitting strategy produced potentials whose simulations improved the accuracy of lithium coordination environments, diffusivities, and conductivities relative to experimental approaches when compared to both naive and hand-tuned parameters for liquid and solid organic electrolyte systems. We show that chemistry-informed regularization is necessary to constrain predicted parameters in order to reproduce experimental solvation and kinetic properties. Finally, we explore the limitations of non-polarizable, fixed point-charge schemes in describing electrolyte anions and compare the effects of two alternative schemes to fit point-charge distributions.

While traditional synthesis methods often yield poorly defined materials, thus complicating structural elucidation, Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC) offers a solution, producing well-defined structures. Recent advances in SOMC precursor development have shown that amidinate-based precursors are a privileged class of precursors to generate supported metallic nanoparticles. In that context, this study investigates the grafting mechanism of a prototypical amidinate precursor, Ir(COD)(DIA) (1-Ir), onto SiO2. Unique to amidinate complexes, grafting is shown to occur without ligand release, creating a reversible covalent bond. Using tris(tert-butoxy)silanol as a molecular analogue for a silanol group on SiO2, the structure of the grafted species is elucidated by single X-Ray diffraction, and comparison of IR spectroscopy, and X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data. The reversibility of the reaction with O-H groups is demonstrated using variable-temperature NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and is supported by DFT calculations.

The main product of the amine hydrotreating was dodecane, but significant amounts of secondary amine were also formed as an intermediate during HDN of the primary and the tertiary amine. It was found that the primary amine is the only species for which direct HDN is possible; HDN of the secondary amine thus proceeds through a primary amine intermediate and HDN of the tertiary amine involves formation of secondary amine, which decomposes to primary amine. Consequently, HDN of the tertiary and secondary amines is slower than that of the primary amine. Kinetic modeling indicated that bimolecular condensation reactions of the primary amine, as well as potentially of the primary amine and the secondary amine, have a significant effect on the HDN process.

We first test the cis model on adiabatic spin-splitting energies of octahedral Fe(II) complexes, predicting DFT-calculated values of unseen binary complexes to within an average of 1.4 kcal/mol.

Complex 2 contains two pseudo-octahedrally coordinated and non-interacting high-spin cobalt(II) ions (S = 3/2) displaying a large easy-plane anisotropy (D ~ 70 cm-1), as consistently indicated by magnetic measurements, X-band EPR spectra, and complete active space self-consistent field/N-electron valence state perturbation theory (CASSCF/NEVPT2) calculations. At cryogenic temperatures and in an applied static magnetic field, the compound shows detectably slow magnetic relaxation, which occurs through direct and Raman mechanisms. Combined mass spectrometry, UV-Vis, and 1H/2H NMR data, including a determination of molecular weight by diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY), show that 2 loses its dimeric structure in dichloromethane solution and rearranges to monomeric high-spin [Co(bdhb)(py)x] species (x = 0, 1, or 2) with concomitant partial dissociation of the py ligands. The X-band EPR spectra in a frozen CH2Cl2/toluene matrix concurrently suggest a significant alteration of the coordination environment upon dissolution. These observations are fairly well reproduced by density functional theory (DFT) and CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations on the low-lying conformers of each species, as provided by an extensive conformational search based on meta-dynamics simulations and semiempirical tight-binding methods. After the vanadyl analogue, compound 2 provides the second example of polymerization isomerism in the 1:1 adducts of bdhb2- with divalent metal ions.", "date": "2024-09-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The most important of these effects are, insufficient charge carrier mobility in the organic material, accumulation of triplet excitons upon charge injection, and absorption from the electrodes in the device. While triplet state management can be achieved using molecules that recycle triplet states into emissive singlet states, these molecules only rarely support amplified emission. Pyrene derivatives not only show excellent charge transport properties, but their rigid \u03c0-conjugated structure also entails excellent electro- and photoluminescence efficiency. Pyrenes exhibit very low-lying first excited triplet states, rendering this class of molecules interesting for ultrafast upper-level reverse intersystem crossing. This process could be useful to counteract the triplet accumulation in organic lasers. Here, we functionalize pyrenes with electron-rich moieties of different donor strength. Through comprehensive spectroscopic and quantum chemical analysis, we correlate the nature of the excited state with the optical properties, excited state lifetimes, amplified spontaneous emission, and triplet recycling.

In particular, SWCNT fluorescence quenching induced by biopolymer dispersants facilitates flexible design of molecular nanosensors, yet challenges remain in analyte selectivity and lack of rational design strategies. A sought-after alternative to haphazard molecular modulation of SWCNT-based fluorescence is to couple the movement of a quencher to the SWCNT surface, enabling fluorescence energy transfer to modulate molecular recognition with high selectivity. This study presents the rational design of SWCNT-based nanosensors that leverages the unique properties of methylene blue (MB)-proximity mediated fluorescence quenching. MB-SWCNT based nanosensors exhibit 1- stability in redox environments and 2- analyte-specific displacement-driven fluorescence modulation. By designing hybridization-induced displacement of MB-conjugated ssDNA from the SWCNT surface, we calculate that SWCNT fluorescence modulation can occur within a 6.8 nm fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance from the SWCNT surface, and develop a robust and versatile platform to synthesize oligonucleotide nanosensors with tunable \u0394F/F0 of up to 150%. Building upon this strategy, we developed four distinct nanosensors capable of selectively detecting tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) viral RNA fragments, which successfully differentiated TMV-infected plants from mock controls. Finally, we demonstrate the potential expansion of our design to target a wider scope of biomolecules using the biotin-avidin system as a model.

While informative, detailed ensemble EXAFS/XANES, XPS, kinetic measurements, and DFT analysis alone cannot provide a full molecular picture of the reaction pathway. Here, using single-molecule atomic-resolution time-resolved electron microscopy (SMART-EM), we identify four key catalytic intermediates anchored to the CNHs and uncover a new reaction pathway involving alkoxide/hemiacetal equilibration and acetal oligomerization. These intermediates are identified solely by theory and SMART-EM, and this advance highlights the potential of SMART-EM to establish and verify mechanistic hypotheses in catalysis.", "date": "2024-09-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These methods are constrained by the underlying force computation regarding runtime and energy ranking accuracy, limiting their effectiveness for large-scale screening applications. To address these ranking limitations, we introduce ConfRank, a machine learning-based approach that enhances conformer ranking using pairwise training. We demonstrate its performance using GFN-FF-generated conformer ensembles, leveraging the DimeNet++ architecture trained on pairs of 159 760 uncharged organic compounds from the GEOM dataset with r2SCAN-3c reference level. Instead of predicting only on single molecules, this approach captures relative energy differences between conformers, leading to a significant improvement of the overall conformational ranking, outperforming GFN-FF and GFN2-xTB. Thereby, the pairwise RMSD of the relative energy difference of two conformers can be reduced from 5.65 kcal mol\u22121 to 0.71 kcal mol\u22121 on the test dataset, allowing to correctly identify up to 81 % of all lowest lying conformers correctly (GFN-FF: 10 %, GFN2- xTB: 47 %). The ConfRank approach is cost-effective, allowing for scalable deployment on both CPU and GPU, achieving runtime accelerations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to GFN2-xTB. Out-of-sample investigations on CREST-generated conformer ensembles from the QM9 dataset and conformers taken from an extended GMTKN55 dataset show promising results for the robustness of this approach. Thereby, ranking correlation coefficient such as Spearman can be improved to 0.90 (GFN-FF: 0.39, GFN2-xTB: 0.84) reducing the probability of an incorrect sign flip in pairwise energy comparison from 32 % to 7 %. On the extended GMTKN55 subsets the pairwise MAD (RMSD) could be reduced on almost all subsets by up to 62 % (58 %) with an average improvement of 30 % (29 %). \nFurthermore, we motivate the usage of the pairwise training approach from a theoretical perspective, highlighting that while pairwise training can lead to a decline in single sample prediction of absolute energies for ML models, it significantly enhances conformer ranking performance.\nThe data and models used in this study are available at https://github.com/grimme-lab/confrank.", "date": "2024-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Crossover operators play a crucial role in this context. Here, we describe a large class of these operators designed for searching over spaces of graphs. These operators are based on introducing small cuts into graphs and rejoining the resulting induced subgraphs of two parents. This form of cut-and-join crossover can be restricted in a consistent way to preserve local properties such as vertex-degrees (valency), or bond-orders, as well as global properties such as graph-theoretic planarity. In contrast to crossover on strings, cut-and-join crossover on graphs is powerful enough to ergodically explore chemical space even in the absence of mutation operators. Extensive benchmarking shows that the offspring of molecular graphs are again plausible molecules with high probability, while at the same time crossover drastically increases the diversity compared to initial molecule libraries. Moreover, desirable properties such as favorable indices of synthesizability are preserved with sufficient frequency that candidate offsprings can be filtered efficiently for such properties. As an application we utilized the cut-and-join crossover in REvoLd, a GA-based system for computer-aided drug design. In optimization runs searching for ligands binding to four different target proteins we consistently found candidate molecules with binding constants exceeding the best known binders as well as candidates found in make-on-demand libraries.

Starting from readily available alkenyl amines and alkenyl alcohols, this approach allows the formation of a wide range of heterocycles, including five to seven-membered azaheterocycles and oxaheterocycles with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The key to the realisation of this reaction is the use of 4-iodophenol or 2-iodophenol derivatives, where the phenolic hydroxyl group plays a critical role in controlling the direction of migration and the ring-size of the heterocycles through the formation of a quinone methide intermediate.

The RIXS spectra at both the nitrogen and oxygen K-edges were computed to resolve the electronic and atomic structural dynamics from both the proton donor and acceptor perspective.

Traditionally treated as separate processes, this study integrates TSD estimation into routine DNA profiling by analyzing typically discarded cell lysate (eluates) from spin-column-based DNA extractions. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to analyze eluates from bloodstains deposited up to 23 months (99 weeks). Two excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) were acquired for each sample and deconvoluted using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to identify individual fluorophores. We identified tryptophan and noted a time-dependent decrease in its corresponding fluorescence. An increase in fluorescence was observed between 400-500 nm as TSD progressed, attributed to an increase in fluorescent oxidation products (FOX) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Different chemometric models were then used to estimate TSD from EEM fluorescence data. Boruta feature selection coupled with random forest regression outperformed all other models and achieved high accuracy, with an R2 of 0.993 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2.83 weeks for the full 99-week period, and an R2 of 0.987 and RMSEP of 2.06 weeks for the 1-year timeframe. Comparisons were also made between anticoagulant-free (AC-free) and anticoagulant-treated (AC-treated) bloodstains deposited up to 3 months. We noted differences in fluorescence based on AC treatment, with AC-free blood exhibiting higher FOX and lower AGE fluorescence than AC-treated blood. A temperature study was also performed using bloodstains deposited at -18 \u00baC, 4 \u00baC and 21 \u00baC, with the strongest FOX and AGE fluorescence recorded at 21 \u00baC.

As a starting point, the ZPE-BOP1 model employs a Mulliken orbital populations via a minimal population localization from a B3LYP/6-311+G(3d2f,2df,2p) calculation and leverages an extended H\u00fcckel-type vibrational bond energy term with two atom-pairwise parameters that are fit to reproduce scaled ZPEs from B3LYP calculations.

J.

Despite their many advantages, CCD cameras have limitations. Particularly under bright light conditions, such as those encountered with coherent Raman spectroscopies, where the finite readout time of CCD chips is limiting. Furthermore, where weak signals need to be observed close to intense signals, blooming and smearing limit the signal to noise ratios achievable. Scientific complementary mixed oxide (sCMOS) based sensors are relatively new. Although they still show much higher readout noise than cooled CCDs, their application to spectroscopy is certainly of interest given the higher readout rates, and dynamic ranges possible. Here, we evaluate sCMOS sensors for specific spectroscopic applications, including multiplex (50 picosecond) CARS and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. We compare the performance of a sCMOS based camera to a state-of-the-art (EM)CCD detector for these applications. The EMCCD camera outperforms the sCMOS camera in terms of limits of detection, while the sCMOS camera performs better than the CCD in terms of dynamic range and readout rate. Importantly, sCMOS camera does not suffer from interference due to blooming and smearing seen with CCD cameras, which enables observation of weak bands (e.g., Raman overtones) close to much more intense signals. Here we show that, at moderate readout rates, the relative performances of the two detector types are not substantially different. We anticipate that sCMOS based cameras will find application for bright spectroscopies, such as multiplex CARS, as well as spontaneous Raman spectroscopy, and Raman spectral imaging.

Youssef; Alison B. Flynn", "abstract": "In chemistry, like other sciences, we rely on symbols and other representations to communicate abstract, small, and dynamic phenomena. These representations become part of that discipline\u2019s language; the electron-pushing formalism (EPF) is a central example in organic chemistry. Students can spend a large amount of time decoding chemistry\u2019s symbolic language, increasing their working memory load. We believe this increased cognitive load limits their abilities to learn new concepts and engage in scientific reasoning. We hypothesized that greater fluency would reduce cognitive load, thus freeing cognitive resources for more advanced scientific reasoning. Our previous work has demonstrated that students can quickly gain fluency using a learning module dedicated to that purpose (OrgMech101). In this study, we explored how EPF fluency relates to cognitive load and reasoning ability, in a sample of second-year organic chemistry student participants (N = 36). Using an experimental design, participants in two groups completed identical pre- and post-tests, with different learning phases: group 1 (treatment) focused on EPF skills, while group 2 (control) focused on acid\u2013base concepts. We assessed EPF fluency and reasoning ability while measuring cognitive load using eye-tracking technology to capture changes in participants\u2019 average and maximum pupil diameters. Eye-tracking data were analysed using a custom-made Python script, and participants\u2019 reasoning ability was analysed by categorizing their arguments based on complexity. The findings revealed a significant relationship between EPF fluency and cognitive load (\u03c1(31) = 0.322, p = 0.039), regardless of the assigned group\u2014the higher the fluency, the lower the participant\u2019s cognitive load. The treatment group participants also had significantly decreased cognitive load from the pre- to the post-test (Z = 2.098, p = 0.036). However, there was no significant difference in cognitive load between the groups when accounting for their initial cognitive load levels. Participants in the treatment group exhibited greater increases in reasoning ability compared to the control group, which may be due to more available cognitive resources upon becoming more fluent with the EPF (lower cognitive load), as seen by the increase in their post-test scores. The findings highlight the importance of helping students become fluent with respect to representations to facilitate effective information processing. Reducing cognitive load can be achieved by ensuring students develop a foundational understanding of the EPF and incorporating causal mechanistic reasoning questions to encourage chemical reasoning and improve organic chemistry education.", "date": "2024-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Co-crystals are particularly important in pharmaceutical development, where a suitable co-crystal can significantly improve the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, co-crystal discovery remains both practically challenging and resource intensive, requiring the extensive searching of complex experimental space. Herein, we demonstrate a high-throughput (HTP) nanoscale co-crystallisation method for the rapid screening of large areas of co-crystallisation space with minimal sample requirements, based on Encapsulated Nanodroplet Crystallisation (ENaCt). HTP co-crystallisation screening by ENaCt allowed rapid access to all 18 possible binary co-crystal combinations of 3 small molecules and 6 co-formers, through the use of 3,456 individual experiments exploring solvent, encapsulating oil and stoichiometry, resulting in 10 novel binary co-crystal structures by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). ENaCt co-crystallisation is also shown to be a powerful method for higher-order co-crystal (HOC) discovery, through its ability to efficiently address highly complex experimental landscapes. HTP ENaCt co-crystallisation screening of molecule/co-former/co-former and molecule/co-former/co-former/co-former combinations gave ready access to both ternary and quaternary HOCs, each containing three or four different molecular species respectively. In total, 12,288 individual ENaCt experiments are presented resulting in 50 co-crystal structures by SCXRD, including 17 novel binary co-crystals, 7 novel ternary co-crystals and 2 novel quaternary co-crystals.

As the saturation increases, nucleation begins, forming a scale that is detrimental to production. Inhibitor addition for scale prevention is a common practice with significant economic and environmental costs. Traditional experiments to determine induction times (tind) and evaluate inhibitor efficiency are performed under constant oversaturation. Similarly, constant oversaturation is used in both the empirical and the classical nucleation theory modeling schemes used for scale prediction. Subsequently, experiments and models do not address the dynamic nature of oversaturation increase during energy production. We developed an experimental system for quantitative investigation of nucleation kinetics under a regime of dynamic oversaturation and a simple algorithm for determining tind from laser measurements. Using our system, we studied the precipitation kinetics of CaCO3 minerals at a pH of ~6.76, ionic strength of I = 1m, temperature range of 50-90 oC, and varying rates of oversaturation increase. We quantified the effect of a potent inhibitor (Polyamino Polyether Methylene Phosphonate; PAPEMP) on the tind and the forming solid phase. Finally, we developed a numerical model that explicitly accounts for the dynamic nature of oversaturation.  Here, we present our experimental system, results, and modeling scheme. We show that for a given set of conditions, calcite induction occurs at a similar oversaturation, regardless of the rate at which oversaturation increases. Moreover, we show that PAPEMP retards CaCO3 nucleation at below ppm levels and that it has a temperature-dependent effect on polymorphism. Lastly, we suggest that expanding existing models such that: t_ind=f(\u2206SI)*f(static) Where f(\u0394SI) is a function of oversaturation with time and f(static) are existing modeling schemes, adequately describe the dynamic nature of oversaturation and show a form of f(\u0394SI) that provides an excellent fit with measured tind.

As part of nonclinical development of an oral formulation for a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, MEDI7219, toxicology studies revealed that one of the formulation excipients, propyl gallate (PG), when administered in enteric-coated tablets, led to nephrotoxicity in beagles. While PG has been widely used in food and cosmetics as an anti-oxidant, understanding of its toxicology, metabolism and disposition has been rarely discussed.  To elucidate the nephrotoxicity observed after administration of PG in an enteric coated tablet formulation, we employed dog and human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC). We observed greater cytotoxicity to PG in dog RPTEC compared to human cells. We also observed greater increases in response to PG treatment of glutathione in human cells compared to dog cells. Glutathione elevation is a common response to detoxify xenobiotics, especially ones that produce free radicals such as PG. Thus, we hypothesize that glutathione in human RPTECs was elevated to detoxify PG, but not in dog RPTECs, leading to greater cytotoxicity for dog RPTECs. Furthermore, to characterize disposition and metabolism of PG in both humans and dogs we developed a 10-plex, highly sensitive and robust LC-MS/MS-based quantification method of PG and its phase-I and phase-II metabolites in dog and human plasma.

FLIM combines the advantage of environmental sensitivity with high signal sensitivity (as sensitive as single molecules) and has the key ability to operate under synthetic conditions (e.g., high concentrations of reagents, in organic solvents, under ambient temperature and pressure, in opaque mixtures, and in multiphasic systems). Chemical reactions inherently induce changes in the reaction medium, neighboring compounds, surface compositions, and/or the bonding structure of the compounds involved, resulting in environmental changes. The FLIM methods recently developed harness and interpret these changes in ways that lead to characterizing compounds and enhancing mechanistic understanding. Here, current advantages and limitations of FLIM method are considered, common factors influencing fluorescence lifetime in chemical systems are discussed in a tutorial format, and seven research case studies are strategically analyzed\u2014chosen to highlight how FLIM provided complementary information to understand chemical reaction mechanisms, intermediates, product distributions, partitioning, roles of reagents, and catalyst behaviors. These data and insights obtained from FLIM assist the rational design and optimization of synthetic and catalytic methods.", "date": "2024-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, in density functional theory \u2014 the primary workhorse for quantum simulations\u2014using ML to address the limitations of human-designed density functional approximations (DFAs) remains elusive, as ML-based approximations suffer from severely limited transferability to unseen chemical systems. We apply real-space ML of DFAs to address this challenge, where energy is learned point-by-point in space through energy densities. Central to our real-space learning is the derivation and implementation of correlation energy densities from regularized perturbation theory. This allows us to pursue two directions for real-space ML of DFAs from these energy densities. First, we introduce the Local Energy Loss (LES), where model energy densities are trained against our implemented counterparts at every point in space. By expanding each system\u2019s single energy data point into thousands, LES dramatically enhances the transferability of ML DFAs compared to traditional global energy training. Second, we use spin-resolution of our correlation energy density to build a real-space, ML-based, and regularized extension of Spin-Component-Scaled second-order M\\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory. We then show how the resulting model opens up new avenues for the construction of transferable ML DFAs.\n", "date": "2024-09-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this paper, we introduce a chemical approach to map the temperature distribution around nanoparticles. Formulations that crosslink at specific temperatures are placed in contact with gold nanotriangles and irradiated under controlled power and polarization conditions. At moderate power, the polymerized regions, corresponding to the zones of maximum field, exhibit local temperatures exceeding the polymerization temperature. At higher power, anisotropic melting of the gold within the gold nanotriangles was observed. This new methodology reveals that, contrary to common assumptions, significant heat exchange occurs between the nanoparticle and the surrounding medium before temperature homogenization within the nanoparticle.

The range of molecular lengths studied, from 1.8 to 4.8 \u00c5, mark this as the most accurate determination of \u03b2 in polyynes to date (\u03b2 = 2.2 nm\u20131). We have applied a model based solely on the single and triple bond lengths to interpret these \u03b2-values, which predicts \u03b2 = 1.9 nm\u20131, consistent with the experimental value. This model also confirms that electronic coupling in polyynes is unaffected by the rotation about the single bonds. At all molecular lengths, we observe conductance in tunneling regime continues due to the long effective conjugation length of polyynes.", "date": "2024-09-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Physical Organic Chemistry; Nanodevices; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

State estimators are typically parametric models fitted from data, often from the broad toolbox of machine learning. Such models can be easily designed to have millions of tuneable parameters, which endows them with tremendous but often misinterpreted fitting ability. The real performance metric, commonly omitted in the battery literature, is a model\u2019s generalisation performance with respect to a population, which requires successful predictions to be made on data from one or more \u2018held out\u2019 cells. This study demonstrates that regression models based on neural networks can perform highly accurate state estimation on multiple cells; however, this is shown to be conditional on all cells being represented in the training dataset. Generalisation to the wider population is shown to be more challenging than other studies claim; a conclusion which follows from tests on multiple feature configurations and multiple model variants. It is hypothesized that success on multi-cell data in the absence of wider generalisation is due to the ability of models to learn cell-specific patterns implicitly,  which is a type of 'overfitting'. This hypothesis is tested in two ways. First, classifiers performing a matching operation between acoustic waveforms and their respective cells are used to show that cell-specific characteristics are present in the waveforms. Next, unsupervised learning methods are used to perform a projection of all acoustic signals to two-dimensional latent space. In the latent space it is found that datapoints cluster according to the cell identity, indicating that the distinctiveness of cells dominates over any state-related commonalities in the acoustic dataset. The study highlights the need for caution in how the generalisation of machine learning models (of any kind) is evaluated in battery research.", "date": "2024-09-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Quality Control; Energy Storage; Power", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, when NO2 groups are adjacent to the lactam moiety, the EDPP has negligible emission even in non-polar solvents. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the primary distinction between the two molecules lies in the structural planarity.

The calculations also suggest that the nitro group does not participate in the S0\u2192S1 excitation. Furthermore, for both compounds, the first two excited states (one bright and one dark) are found to be very close in energy. The change in molecular geometry affects the non-radiative deactivation of excited states, leading to the two distinct emission behaviors.

The principal difference between those peptides is in their C- and N-terminals. Since Huntington\u2019s disease is related to the aggregation of proteins containing consecutive polyglutamine in their amino acid chains, the aim was to investigate if smaller amounts of disaccharides could reduce aggregation of two peptides from the Htt protein. Computational results revealed that both sugars alter the secondary structures of peptides and decrease the total number of contacts (the sum of hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds) between these biomolecules. However, regarding only the number of hydrogen bonds, the disaccharides reduced this value for peptide-peptide interactions for 6N8C, while for 2LD2 sucrose and trehalose instead promoted an increase of this number. Such a difference in behaviors of peptides could be related to dissimilarities in their sequences, pointing out the importance to consider amino-acid residues in C- and N-terminal when developing drugs.

The PeT-dioxetane probe could effectively detect and image two model proteins labeled with strained cycloalkyne units (Myc-DBCO and Max-DBCO) through either NHS or maleimide conjugations. Comparative analysis shows that our PeT-based chemiluminescent probe significantly outperforms a commercially available fluorescent analog. We anticipate that the insights gained from this study will facilitate the development of additional chemiluminescent probes utilizing various PeT-quenching pathways.", "date": "2024-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The motor proteins move along one dimensional cytoskeletal tracks, with their motion characterised by high association of the enzyme to the biopolymer combined with highly dynamic motion along the track.  Efforts to mimic this dynamic association and control translational motion in fully synthetic systems have been dominated by rotaxane-based systems, where the properties of the mechanical bond ensure complete association between the moving component (the macrocycle) and the track it encircles, while allowing high rates of translation through shuttling of the moving component under Brownian motion. In addition to the dynamic association displayed by many rotaxane systems, by careful design of the track and macrocyclic component, elegant strategies have been employed to further control the motion in these mechanically interlocked systems, with both energy and information ratchet mechanisms allowing directional translational motion to be achieved. Other than mechanical bonds, alternative platforms for achieving controlled translational motion in fully synthetic systems have had more limited success, with bipedal walker systems that exhibit dynamic association lacking mechanisms to achieve inherent directionality, and bipedal systems that do display high levels of directionality requiring stepwise intervention of an experimentalist (i.e., they lack the dynamic autonomous behaviour that underpins nature\u2019s walkers). Here we introduce carbon-to-carbon metal migration as a new platform for dynamic association and show how such migrations, in combination with the incorporation of a simple hydrocarbon fuel, can be harnessed to achieve autonomous directional translational motion of a metal centre along the length of a polyaromatic thread.

To address this problem, we propose an integration of two different rare-event sampling philosophies: biased enhanced sampling and unbiased path sampling. Enhanced sampling methods e.g. metadynamics can facilitate enthalpic barrier crossing by applying an external bias potential. On the contrary, path sampling methods like weighted ensemble (WE) lack explicit mechanisms to overcome energetic barriers. However, they can accelerate the exploration of rugged free energy surfaces through trajectory resampling. We show that a judicious combination of the weighted ensemble with a metadynamics-like algorithm, can synergize the strengths and mitigate the deficiencies of path sampling and enhanced sampling approaches. The resulting integrated sampling (IS) algorithm improves the computational efficiency of calculating the kinetics of peptide conformational transitions, protein unfolding, and the dissociation of a ligand-receptor complex. Furthermore, the IS approach can direct sampling along the minimum free energy pathway even when the collective variable used for biasing is suboptimal. These advantages make the integrated sampling algorithm suitable for studying the kinetics of complex molecular systems of biological and pharmaceutical relevance.", "date": "2024-09-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biophysical Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Metal\u2212organic frameworks (MOFs) offer promising solid-state platforms to host lanthanide ions because their bottom-up synthesis enables rational optimization of both spin coherence and luminescence. Here, we incorporated Nd3+ and Gd3+ into a La3+-based MOF with various doping levels and examined their qubit performance including the spin relaxation time (T1) and phase memory time (Tm). Both Nd3+ and Gd3+ behave as spin qubits with T1 exceeding 1 ms and Tm approaching 2 \u03bcs at 3.2 K under low doping levels. Variable-temperature spin dynamic studies unveiled spin relaxation and decoherence mechanisms, highlighting critical roles of spin-phonon coupling and spin-spin dipolar coupling. Accordingly, reducing the spin concentration, spin-orbit coupling strength, and ground spin state improves the qubit performance of lanthanide-based MOFs.

By decoupling the O2 potential response into contributions of different physical origin, we explain this contrast through the inherently different reactivity of the two metals. We finally discuss an indirect effect of potential through the surface coverage that can promote a dissociative-type mechanism at Pt(111) by breaking the O-O bond already during the first step of the ORR mechanism.

Three weaves, consisting of the same molecular strands, are produced by adjusting the connections of the enantiomers of an inherently chiral 2\u00d72 interwoven grid. Among the tested patterns, the plain weave exhibits superior stability, minimal structural deformation, and the most consistent pore size compared to others. The maintenance of the weaves in kinetically stable high-energy states is attributed to both aromatic stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions between warp and weft strands, while the alteration of weaving patterns leads to variations in the type and strength of these weak interactions. Despite the differences on the weaving pattern, the mechanical stress tends to localize at the contact field. Further analysis on impact resistance and in-plane stretchability highlights how weaving architectures influence the energy dissipation pathways and reinforce the mechanical properties of individual molecular chains.

They are often detected with hydronium, ammonium, or nitrate chemical ionization sources, which are generally soft ionization sources but may cause fragmentation.  Here we explore the reactivity of adipic acid, an analogue to the alpha-pinene oxidation product pinic acid, upon complexation with ammonium.  Mass spectra and mass-selective vibrational spectra show that even mild activation, consistent with normal operation of an electrospray ionization source, yields (adipic acid)H+ and neutral ammonia.  This is traced to a specific structural motif in which both protonated carboxylic acid carbonyl groups combine to form a site that is locally more basic than ammonia.  Further mild collisional activation yields sequential loss of two water molecules, the known behavior of carboxylic acids in superacids, necessitating abstraction of at least one hydrogen from a CH group.  Deuterium labeling experiments confirm that the second step indeed involves CH hydrogen atoms.  Comparison of vibrational spectra and quantum chemical calculations allows us to assign structures for each step, identifying several ring structures but notably not forming the minimum energy structure upon the first loss of water.

Using spatially resolved anisotropic spectra, we demonstrate the critical role of the volume over which the spectral response is integrated when reporting spatially averaged electric susceptibilities. To analyze the spectra, we introduce a unique decomposition into bulk, interfacial, and confinement contributions, which reveals that confinement effects on the spectra occur only for systems with graphene separation  below 1.4 nm, for all frequencies. Based on this decomposition, we discuss the molecular origin of the main absorption features of nanoconfined water from the GHz to the IR regime. We show that, at low frequencies, the 15 GHz Debye peak of interfacial water is red-shifted due to a slowdown of collective water reorientations. At high frequencies the OH stretch at 100 THz blue shifts and a signature of free OH groups emerges, while the HOH bend mode at 50 Thz is red-shifted. Strikingly, in nanoconfinement, the 20 THz libration band shifts to below 15 THz and broadens drastically, spanning two orders of magnitude in frequency.

To understand the impact of memory time on these approaches, we demonstrate that non-Markovian dynamics can be represented as a linear map within the Nakajima-Zwanzig generalized quantum master equation framework.

A great deal of work has focused on dialing in reaction conditions (e.g., time, temperature, acid concentration, etc.) that are amenable to isolating an uncondensed lignin product that could be converted into high value aromatic platform molecules. Pretreatment severity emerged as a term that combines time, temperature, and acid concentration into a single value that can be used to compare various pretreatment technologies. However, combining the effects of these conditions into a single term, while convenient, confounds the effects that these conditions have on lignin quality, both individually and when combined with each other. Moreover, pretreatment and fractionation reactors do not have a severity \u201cknob,\u201d and several different sets of conditions could mathematically achieve the same severity but have different effects on the resulting lignin product slate. In this study, we set out to model the effects of time (10-30 min), temperature (140-180 \u00b0C), and acid concentration (0.025-0.1 M H2SO4) on lignin yield (up to quantitative), molecular weight (Mw = 700-2000 g/mol), and hydroxyl group content (3.55-6.06 mmol OH/g) using the co-solvent enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation (CELF) process on switchgrass. Our results show that lignin yield is most sensitive to acid concentration, with an additional 4.96% yield per 10 mM of acid. In addition, molecular weight is sensitive to acid concentration and temperature, with a decrease of 77.9 g/mol per 10 mM of acid and a decrease of 19.3 g/mol per \u00b0C. Moreover, total hydroxyl group content decreases at a rate of 89 \u03bcmol total OH per g lignin per min at short time (t = 12 min, T = 160 \u00b0C) and is increases at a rate of 125 \u03bcmol total OH per g lignin per min at long time (t = 28 min, T = 160 \u00b0C). Finally, our results demonstrate that residence time does not have a statistically significant effect on yield or molecular weight within the studied ranges, which could have implications for continuous and flow-through processes, where short residence times could lead to substantial cost savings. Overall, these results demonstrate that practitioners can design a process that maximizes one or more of industrially relevant lignin properties by exerting careful control of fractionation conditions, which could ultimately lead to greater utilization of lignin for fuels, chemicals, and other products.

However, this work has discovered an unusual Li2O sublimation that occurs at high temperatures of 800-1000 \u00b0C, even under 1 atm pressure. Utilizing Li2O vapor sublimed directly from solids, we propose and validate a fundamentally new reaction mechanism that may find broad applications. This mechanism enables the synthesis of single crystals such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) or LiNi0.9Mn0.05Co0.05O2 (NMC90) without direct contact with Li2O salts. Moreover, Li2O vapor successfully converts spent polycrystalline NMC811 into well-segregated single crystals without any milling or post-treatment, further confirming the proposed Li2O sublimation mechanism. Li2O vapor, derived from Li2O solids, diffuses rapidly and reacts with other precursors, mimicking a molten salt environment without actual melting, which facilitates single crystal growth. The chemical lithiation process continuously drives Li2O to sublime, sintering crystals, as confirmed experimentally and theoretically. Single crystals derived from Li2O salts, using either fresh precursors or spent polycrystals, demonstrate outstanding cycling stability after 1000 cycles in full cells. The discovery of the Li2O sublimation phenomenon and its universal role in promoting single crystal growth provides a novel direction for broad single crystal synthesis, scale-up, and recycling.

Feedstock solutions were placed in contact with a hydrogel loaded with potassium hydroxide and/or dibutyl phosphate, resulting in complex precipitation patterns as the various metal ions diffused into the reaction medium.

To probe the effects of ligand end architecture on ligand-lipid interactions, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how ligand alkyl chain branching modulates thermodynamics and mechanisms of nanoparticle adsorption to lipid membranes. We designed four pairs of 2 nm diameter gold nanoparticles where each pair had ligand end groups with similar lipophilicity but varying alkyl chain architecture (e.g., one long alkyl chain vs two short chains) to isolate branching effects from lipophilicity. Free energy calculations and mechanistic insight revealed that alkyl end group branching can decrease free energy barriers for adsorption by disrupting ligand monolayer packing, increasing end group protrusions that lead to favorable ligand intercalation with minimal membrane disruption. Furthermore, increased end group branching promotes adsorption by increasing the exposure of nonpolar surface area to water, which results in a greater reduction of free energy upon exposure to the nonpolar core of the lipid bilayer. These results show that ligand chain architecture can modulate nano\u2013bio interactions, limiting the exclusive use of lipophilicity as a sole descriptor to predict cellular uptake of surface-functionalized nanoparticles.

However, due to the blood-brain barrier, drugs do not easily reach the target area in the brain. Although conventional screening methods for drug discovery involve the measurement of (unbound fraction of drug) brain-to-plasma partition coefficients, it is difficult to consider non-equilibrium between plasma and brain compound concentration-time profiles. To truly understand the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of CNS drugs, compound concentration-time profiles in the brain are necessary; however, such analyses are costly, time consuming, and require a significant number of animals. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to develop an in silico prediction method that does not require a large amount of experimental data by combining modeling and simulation (M&S) with machine learning (ML). First, we constructed a hybrid model linking plasma concentration-time profile to the brain compartment that takes into account the transit time and brain distribution of each compound. Using mouse plasma and brain time experimental values for 103 compounds, we determined the brain kinetic parameters of the hybrid model for each compound; this case was defined as scenario I (a positive control experiment) and included the full brain concentration-time profile data. Next, we built an ML model using chemical structure descriptors as explanatory variables and rate parameters as the target variable, and we then input the predicted values from 5-fold cross-validation (CV) into the hybrid model; this case was defined as scenario II, in which no brain compound concentration-time profile data exist. Finally, for scenario III, assuming that the brain concentration is obtained at only one time point, we used the brain kinetic parameters from the result of the 5-fold CV in scenario II as the initial values for the hybrid model and performed parameter re-fitting against the observed brain concentration at that time point. As a result, the RMSE/R2-values of the brain compound concentration-time profiles over time were 0.445/0.517 in scenario II and 0.246/0.805 in scenario III, indicating the method provides high accuracy and suggesting that it is a practical method for predicting brain compound concentration-time profiles.", "date": "2024-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, their recycling rates are markedly low, and, though the cross-linking of PE enhances its properties through the creation of a networked architecture, the resulting thermoset known as PEX is rendered completely unrecyclable. Incorporating associative or dissociative dynamic covalent bonds as cross-links into plastics like PE is a promising route both to make use of spent plastics (via \u201cupcycling\u201d them) and to generate recyclable alternatives to unrecyclable thermosets like PEX. Such materials are known as covalent adaptable networks or CANs (also called vitrimers if the cross-links are exclusively associative).

Radical-based reactive processing of PE and ethylene/1-octene-based copolymers with 1 wt% dicumyl peroxide and 5 wt% bis(4-methacryloyloxyphenyl) disulfide (BiPheS methacrylate or BPMA) successfully resulted in CANs which fully recovered their cross-link densities and associated thermomechanical properties after multiple reprocessing cycles.

BiPheS-based cross-links in PE and ethylene-based copolymer CANs also enable their (re)processability via extrusion at elevated temperatures, with property recovery demonstrated with extrusion temperatures as high as 260 \u00b0C, thereby indicating the feasibility of extending our approach to industrial scales and processes as well as other rigorous applications.", "date": "2024-09-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Elastic Materials; Materials Processing; Polymer chains", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the chirality of the carbon atom in glycerol phosphate differs among the three kingdoms: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. It is commonly assumed that archaea, as well as bacteria and eukaryotes, produce only one isomer of PG. Archaeal membranes consist of phospholipids with glycerol-1-phosphate in the S configuration, while the phospholipids of the other two kingdoms contain glycerol-3-phosphate with R stereochemistry. Another chiral atom is found in glycerol with non-esterified hydroxy groups.

LPMOs require external electrons for the activations of either O2 or H2O2, which can be supplied by enzymatic electron donors or small molecule reductants.  As quite abundant reductants in nature, phenolic compounds can serve as efficient reducing agents for reactions of LPMOs. Despite extensive studies, how phenolic compounds fuel the reactions of LPMOs is enigmatic. In this study, we report a novel mechanism for the reduction of LPMO-Cu(II) by the phenol reductants. Among various mechanisms investigated, we found the most favorable one involves the coordination re-placement of water by the phenol reductant. The coordination of pyrogallol (Pyr) to LPMO-Cu(II) can remarkably facilitate both the electron transfer from Pyr to Cu(II) and the proton transfer from the ligated OH group to the adjacent Glu148, thereby enhancing proton-coupled electron transfer process for the reduction of LPMO-Cu(II). Detailed comparisons and analysis have shown that the different ligand effects between LPMOs and the copper-dependent pMMO can result in the divergent mecha-nisms for Cu(II) reduction in two enzymes.

This study focuses on developing and characterizing bio-based polyester UV-curable resins with tunable mechanical properties optimized for DLP 3D printing. Bio-based polyester resins were synthesized by direct esterification polycondensation reaction of itaconic and/or succinic acids with 1,2-propane-, 1,4-butane-, and/or 1,8-octanediols followed by blending with triethylene glycol dimethacrylate. The bio-renewable nature of the resin components provides several advantages over traditional petroleum-derived resins. The diacid and diol monomers come from renewable feedstocks such as corn, soybean, and vegetable oils rather than finite fossil fuel reserves. Furthermore, bio-renewable materials lower dependence on petrochemicals and increase the sustainability of 3D printing. The effects of diacid structure and diol chain length on resin properties were systematically investigated. Chemical characteristics were investigated by NMR and FTIR and suggested successful synthesis of the desired bio-based polyesters. By varying the molecular design, diacid, and diol building blocks, the molecular weight, crosslink density, and mechanical performance were tailored. The liquid resins were characterized by gel permeation chromatography and rheological measurements, and solid UV-cured objects were characterized by static and dynamic tensile testing. Rheological studies confirmed all resin formulations displayed shear-thinning behavior ideal for DLP printing. Mechanical testing revealed that varying diacid and diol components could modulate tensile elastic modulus and elongation at break from 0.1-1.0 GPa and 3.5-8.5%, respectively. Printability was assessed by printing a resolution test structure on a DLP 3D printer equipped with a 405 nm LED source.

TetR family repressors (TFRs) are important for Mtb's adaptation to the human host environment. Our study focuses on one notable Mtb repressor, Mce3R, composed of an unusual double TFR motif. Mce3R-regulated genes encode enzymes implicated in cholesterol metabolism, resistance against reactive oxygen species, lipid transport activities important for Mtb survival and persistence in the host, and for the cellular activity of a 6-azasteroid derivative. Here, we present the structure of Mce3R bound to its DNA operator, unveiling a unique asymmetric assembly previously unreported. We obtained a candidate DNA binding motif through MEME motif analysis, comparing intergenic regions of mce3R orthologues and identifying non-palindromic regions conserved between orthologues. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we confirmed that Mce3R binds to a 123 bp sequence that includes the predicted motif. Using scrambled DNA and DNA oligonucleotides of varying lengths with sequences from the upstream region of the yrbE3A (mce3) operon, we elucidated the operator region to be composed of two Mce3R binding sites, each a 25 bp asymmetric sequence separated by 53 bp. Mce3R binds with higher affinity to the downstream site with a Kd of 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 nM. The cryo-EM structure of Mce3R bound to the 123 bp sequence was refined to a resolution of 2.51 \u00c5.

For example, open-source tools do not support the easy setup and simulation of metalloproteins, particularly when ligands directly coordinate to the metal site. Here, we evaluate the performance of RBFE methods for KPC-2, a serine-\u03b2-lactamase (SBL), and two non-bonded metal parameter setups for VIM-2, a metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) with two active site zinc ions. We tested two different ways of modeling the ligand-zinc interactions. First, a restraint-based approach, in which FF14SB zinc parameters are combined with harmonic restraints between the zincs and their coordinating residues. The second approach uses an upgraded Amber force field (UAFF) for zinc-metalloproteins with adjusted partial charges and non-bonded terms of zinc-coordinating residues. Molecular mechanics (MM) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations show that the crystallographically observed zinc coordination is not retained in MM simulations with either zinc parameter set for a series of known phosphonic acid-based inhibitors bound to VIM-2. These phosphonic acid-based inhibitors exhibit known cross-class affinity for SBLs and MBLs and serve as a benchmark for RBFE calculations for VIM-2, after validation with KPC-2. The KPC-2 free energy of binding estimates are within expected literature accuracies for the lig- and series with a mean absolute error of 0.43 (0.25, 0.66) kcal/mol and a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of 0.93 (0.86, 0.98).

These results support the feasibility of incorporating BactVue into diagnostic near-infrared fluorescence imaging methods that visualize the location of infected bladder cells during active UTI.

However, their practical application in Li-ion batteries is limited by the active metal (e.g., Mn) dissolution, which irreversibly compromises the graphite anode of a Li-ion battery. In this work, lithium nonafluoro-tert-butoxyborate (LiONFtb) has been tested as an additive in LNMO-graphite system. The electrochemical stability analysis of the LiONFtb salt on the aluminium current collector revealed a new passivation mechanism, without the formation of cracks and pits, which are otherwise commonly observed in the case of LiPF6-containing electrolytes. Adding 1 wt% LiONFtb to the commercial LiPF6-based electrolyte is demonstrated to improve the high voltage stability of the electrolyte in LNMO-Li half-cell. The LiONFtb additive was also found to promote better Li+ de-/intercalation behaviour in graphite-Li half-cell. The long-term cycling of the LNMO-graphite full cell with the 1% LiONFtb additive electrolyte demonstrated higher initial discharge capacity (121 mAh/g) and higher capacity retention (62%) than the LiPF6 containing electrolyte (105 mAh/g and 9.2%, respectively) after 100 cycles. The post-cycling analysis reveals that the LiONFtb additive helps to retain the morphology of the LNMO particles and reduces the Mn dissolution during cycling. The positive influence of the LiONFtb additive on reducing the cathode particle cracking and active metal dissolution makes it a viable electrolyte additive candidate for next-generation high-voltage Li-ion batteries.", "date": "2024-09-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As a free nucleoside, ABN exhibits \u03b5442 nm = 20,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 and \u03a6em = 0.39 in 1\u00d7 PBS buffer at pH 7.4 and its high brightness is retained when base-paired and stacked in duplex DNA. The ABN nucleoside\u2019s time-resolved fluorescence shows that it emits primarily from a thymine-like tautomeric form T1 that matches its ground state, but is photo-tautomerized to a cytosine-like form T2 that contributes ~ 20% to the emission intensity, with a shorter lifetime. In duplex DNA when base-paired with adenine, fluorescent emission is again dominated by T1, with ~ 20% of the intensity deriving from photo-induced double proton transfer to form a Watson\u2013Crick-like base pair between T2 and the imino tautomer of adenine. When base-paired with guanine, ABN adopts predominantly the T2 tautomer form to enable Watson\u2013Crick base pairing and this tautomer exhibits red-shifted absorption and blue-shifted emission; around 20% of ABN remains in the T1 tautomeric form and engages in a wobble base pair with G, contributing to the bulk fluorescent properties. The high brightness of ABN and its relatively long absorption and emission wavelengths position it uniquely among fluorescent nucleobase analogues (FBAs) for applications in single-molecule fluorescence. We immobilized ABN using strand hybridization and biotin pull-down on a PLL-PEG\u2013streptavidin surface and imaged it using a 488 nm laser and an smTIRF microscope. The brightness and photostability of ABN in this context are enhanced by the use of the GO/CAT oxygen scavenging system and triplet depopulation using Trolox. Under these conditions, ABN-containing oligos are readily observed as bright spots with time traces of up to 9 seconds and single-step photobleaching.

This knowledge gap limits fundamental understanding of CO2RR while also hindering efforts to enhance CO2RR selectivity and activity. In this work, we investigate this knowledge gap using a tunable system featuring hierarchical Cu nanowire arrays that possess adjustable microgroove dimensions. Adjusting the NAM structure tunes multiple synergistic effects in the microenvironment, which include stabilization of the microwetting state, confinement of CO*, improvement to local CO2 concentration, and modulation of the local pH.

This modelling approach, named EM-HyChem, was developed with the inspiration of the original hybrid chemistry (HyChem) model, in which the reaction mechanism is divided into two submodels: pyrolysis and oxidation. In EM-HyChem, the key pyrolysis products and reaction mechanism are identified from the perspective of molecular fragments via geometry analysis, which is validated via neural network potential-enabled molecular dynamic simulations. A chemical reaction neural network (CRNN) model is applied to extract the rate parameters for the pyrolysis step from the reproduction of thermogravimetric experiments. An EM-HyChem model is later constructed by combining the pyrolysis step together with the oxidation models for the pyrolysis products. Two representative EMs, i.e., 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX), are considered here to evaluate the performance of the EM-HyChem model. The predicted burning rates across a wide range of pressure conditions (1\u2013100 atm) are in good agreement with the experimental measurements and the results of other models.

The conver-sion of CO2 into valuable and useful products like carbon monoxide, methane, and methanol offers significant economic benefits. However, due to the low reactivity of CO2, the incorporation of CO2 adsorbents alongside catalytic materials has been pivotal in increasing the concentration of CO2 molecules around the catalytic sites. This strategy frequently relies on the precise deposition of the catalyst onto the adsorbent material. In this work, we explore NU-1000, a zirconium-based metal-organic framework originally designed as a CO2 adsorbent, to act as a selective photocatalyst for gas-phase CO2 reduction to CH4. NU-1000 contains UVA light-absorbing chromophore linkers, endowing it with the dual functionality of CO2 adsorbent and photocatalyst, which is crucial for efficient CO2 reutilization. Our research showcases an easily reproducible, and greener synthesis method for NU-1000 using micro-waves. We study the activity of NU-1000, including a functionalised variant, in the gas-phase photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with electrons and protons derived from water. Remarkably, both the native and functionalised MOFs exhibit a rate of 170 and 800 \u03bcmol\u2219g-1\u2219h-1, respectively, alongside an exceptional selectivity of over 99%.

In this study, we developed ToxSTK, a multi-target toxicity assessment using stacking ensemble learning. We aimed to create an ML tool that facilitates toxicity assessments more affordably with reduced reliance on animal models. We focused on four key targets generally assessed in early-stage drug development: cardiotoxicity, immunotoxicity, white blood cell toxicity, and mutagenicity. Our model integrated twelve molecular fingerprints with four ML algorithms, generating 36 novel predictive features (PF). These PFs were then combined to construct the final meta-decision model. Our results demonstrated that the ToxSTK model surpasses standard regression and classification metrics, ensuring it is highly reliable and accurate in predicting chemical toxicities within its application domain. This model passed the y-randomization test, confirming that the identified QSTR is robust and not due to random chance.

Competitive ABPP, which involves treatment of the active proteome with an analyte of interest, is especially powerful for profiling how small molecules impact specific protein activities. Advances in higher throughput workflows have made it possible to generate extensive competitive ABPP data across various biological systems and treatments, making this approach highly appealing for characterizing shared and unique proteins affected by perturbations such as drug or chemical exposures. To use the competitive ABPP approach effectively to understand potential adverse effects of chemicals of concern, a wide range of concentrations may be needed, particularly for chemicals that may lack toxicity data. In this work, we present an integral competitive ABPP method that enables target sensitivity differentiation across a wide range of concentrations for the model organophosphate (OP), paraoxon. Using previously developed OP-ABPs, we optimized conditions for tandem mass tag (TMT) multiplexing of ABPP samples and compared conventional competitive ABPP involving discrete samples at various paraoxon concentrations with pooling of samples across that same concentration range. The results show that small vs. large differences in integral intensities for the competitive sample can be used to distinguish low vs. high sensitivity proteins, respectively, without increasing the overall number of samples.

In this study, we explore ferromanganese nodules from the Oacoma Site in South Dakota as a viable feedstock for sourcing manganese, a critical element used in the production of battery cathodes, consumer electronics, and steel. The nodules are readily accessible from the surface site and primarily consist of rhombohedral metal carbonates, including manganese at 3.5\u20135.4 at% (9.2\u2013 14.1 wt%) relative to all the elements present in the nodules. Based on titration experiments and an equilibrium speciation model, we developed a strategy for extracting the manganese by selectively dissolving carbonate phases in acidic conditions, followed by selectively re-precipitating manganese oxide in alkaline conditions. Specifically, exposing the samples to pH 1.5\u20132 dissolved almost all the calcium and manganese ions, while retaining a significant portion of the iron and magnesium in the residual nodule powders. Subsequently, increasing the pH of the leachate to 5.7 resulted in the selective re-precipitation of predominantly iron hydroxide.

This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method for the assessment of chemical alternatives (ACA) that takes the criteria of Article 57 of REACH into account.

This work illustrates the utility of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) in analyzing HEAs, offering detailed chemical information about the top layers of a sample. Ru-Pt-Pd-Ir-Rh based porous HEAs with different mixing characteristics were analyzed alongside seven simpler alloys. An automatic quantification process was developed to effectively deal with the large data sets obtained from ToF-SIMS spectra of HEAs, allowing for accurate and reliable data interpretation. The complex chemical fingerprint obtained from the alloys surface was translated into a matrix showing the individual isotopic mass distributions of each poly atomic chemical species. From this, we introduce two key metrics: the Cluster Ratio (CR) and the Oxide Ratio (OR), to quantify respectively the degree of atomic-level mixing and the surface oxidation. With such data processing framework in hands, ToF-SIMS becomes a highly effective tool for assessing the properties of HEAs. Our findings reveal that increasing elemental complexity (number of different elements in the alloy) enhances atomic mixing.

Phenomena such as phase separation into nanodomains have been reported, but their effect on analyte binding remains uncertain. Here, nano-IR spectroscopy is used together with complementary macroscopic spectroscopic methods to study the nano-structural variations during the fabrication of an aptasensor consisting of a mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of sensing aptamers and inert polyethylene glycol. The investigated sensor was recently developed and optimized for the detection of the spike protein of the omega variant of SARS-CoV-2.

However, many pathologies result from the absence of critical cell surface proteins.1\u20134 Restoring deficient cell-surface proteins without genetic intervention remains a formidable challenge. We sought to address this problem by exploiting a natural process for cell-to-cell transfer of membrane proteins known as trogocytosis. Here we report the development of Trogocytosis-TArgeting Chimeras (TrogoTACs), bispecific molecules capable of inducing protein transfer between distinct cells. We designed TrogoTACs that bind the B cell receptor CD22 through a synthetic small molecule ligand chemically linked to an antibody that recognizes a cell surface molecule expressed on a target cell. These CD22-targeted TrogoTACs induce cell surface protein transfer from the target cell to B cells by redirecting trogocytosis in a targeted fashion. We show that the process depends on cell-cell contact, expression of CD22, and requires high-affinity CD22 binding.

In contrast to plasmon-driven polymerization, it relies on plasmonically enhanced multiphoton crosslinking (MPC) of polymer chains carrying photoactive moieties. When attached to metallic nanostructures and irradiated with a femtosecond near-infrared beam resonantly coupled with LSPs, the enhanced field intensity locally exceeds the threshold and initiates MPC at plasmonic hotspots. This concept is demonstrated using gold nanoparticle arrays coated with two specifically designed polymers. Local MPC of a poly(N,N-dimethyl acrylamide)-based copolymer with an anthraquinone crosslinker is shown via atomic force microscopy. Additionally, MPC is tested with a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)-based terpolymer.

By directly measuring the charge states of individual ions, CD-MS can measure the masses from spectra where conventional deconvolution approaches fail due to the lack of isotopic resolution or distinguishable charge states. However, CD-MS is inherently slow because hundreds or thousands of spectra need to be collected to produce adequate ion statistics. The slower speed of CD-MS complicates efforts to couple it with online separation techniques, which limit the number of spectra that can be acquired during a chromatographic peak. Here, we present the application of Hadamard transform multiplexing to online size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with Orbitrap CD-MS, with a goal of using SEC for separating complex mixtures prior to CD-MS analysis. We developed a microcontroller to deliver pulsed injections from a large sample loop onto a SEC for online CD-MS analysis. Data showed a series of peaks spaced according to the pseudo-random injection sequence, which were demultiplexed with a Hadamard transform algorithm. The demultiplexed data revealed improved CD-MS signals while preserving retention time information. This multiplexing approach provides a general solution to the inherent incompatibilities of online separations and CD-MS detection that will enable a range of applications.", "date": "2024-09-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Biochemical Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, most of the previous methods for synthesizing polymers from LGO lacked precise control over regio- and stereochemistry, making stereoselective polymerization from LGO a persistent challenge. Although the ketone moiety in LGO is typically reduced before polymerization, a new LGO polymer was designed, containing a C=N bond obtained by condensation with dicarboxylic dihydrazide. NMR measurements revealed that condensation occurred with high stereoselectivity to produce the E-isomer. This selectivity extended from the model compound to polymer synthesis, achieving high E / Z selectivity. The resulting polymer exhibited optical rotation (up to +89), indicating its potential as a chiral polymer.

Consequently, C3A significantly influences the early rheological properties of OPC-based materials, thereby linking rheology with C3A reactivity. The reactivity of C3A is affected by temperature, calcium sulfates, admixtures, and ionic strength. Calcium sulfate phases such as gypsum, bassanite, or anhydrite are used in technical Portland cement to control the early reactivity of C3A.  This work investigates the impact of three sodium salts - sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) - on the hydration of C3A.  We study model suspensions composed of 10% cubic C3A and 90% quartz by weight with in-situ isothermal calorimetry.   The C3A suspensions were mixed inside the calorimeter with a water-to-solid ratio of 0.8.  Increasing concentrations, i.e.,  400, 1000, and 2000 micromol per g, of the sodium salts mentioned above lead to characteristically decreased C3A reactivities. Combined with small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) rheology experiments, we show that the addition of Na2SO4 significantly reduces the heat flow and the initial storage modulus.  In contrast, NaNO3 and NaCl had less pronounced effects on both storage modulus and reaction heat.  The differences in structure development are attributed to the formation of different hydrate phases. Specifically, Na2SO4 leads to ettringite formation, whereas the presence of nitrate and chloride ions favors the precipitation of AFm phases. The study concludes that introducing various sodium salts can modulate the kinetics of C3A hydration and alter the reaction pathway, forming different hydrate phases.", "date": "2024-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The limit of detection and limit of quantification were found to be 1.43 \u00b5M and 4.7 \u03bcM, respectively. We showed that the biosensor maintains function in a complex serum sample matrix, suggesting potential utility in clinical applications.

Fortunately, successful anti-cancer drugs, such as cisplatin, are promising to treat cancer. Despite its clinical success, cisplatin presents several issues, including neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and drug resistance. These limitations of the successful anti-cancer cisplatin can be overcome with the help of novel supramolecular drug delivery systems. This research aims to optimise novel supramolecular drug delivery systems \u2013 metallacage (M2L4}(M = metal, L = ligand) \u2013 that can be used to encapsulate cisplatin to protect it from metabolism. Specifically, we investigated the shape and stability of ten metallacages using different metals: Pt2+, Pd2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Au3+ using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods to encapsulate one or two cisplatin molecules. Thus, we applied WebMo running PBE0 and Hartree Fock as theories, with LanL2DZ as a basis set. The results demonstrate that PBE0/LanL2DZ is the best method to describe the cages. The results show that Endo-N Ni2L4 and Endo-N Cu2L4 cages are the best option to encapsulate one and two cisplatin, while the least suitable system is Endo-C Pt2L4 and Endo-C Au2L4 for cisplatin encapsulation. Furthermore, endo-C cages are farther from ground state energy because of their higher energy than endo-N cages. Therefore, endo-N cages are superior to endo-C cages for the encapsulation of cisplatin.

FeMo-cofactor (FeMoco), the key active site of this conversion in the Mo-based nitrogenase, is one of the most complicated metalloenzyme molecules. The synthesis of FeMoco cluster holds the key to elucidating the mechanism of nitrogen fixation, but the complex framework with a unique sextuply-bridged carbide in FeMoco cluster dictates its synthesis to be an extreme challenge that remains unsolved for several decades. In this work, two cluster models have been synthesized as the first highly analogous mimics of FeMoco using a precisely-designed cluster-coupling strategy. A carbide ligand has been introduced into M-Fe-S (M = Mo or W) clusters and the characteristic triangular prismatic [Fe6(\u00b56-C)] moiety of FeMoco has been synthesized for the first time. The structural parameters of the two mimics match well with those of FeMoco identified in natural nitrogenase. Quantum chemical studies reveal that the electronic ground states of the mimics resemble those observed for FeMoco, with maximized antiferromagnetic coupling among the iron centers. The clusters synthesized in this work represent the only highly analogous synthetic mimics of FeMoco. The cluster-coupling reaction is a versatile strategy that allows the synthesis of more analogous mimics of FeMoco. These mimics and the cluster-coupling strategy provide an excellent platform for studying the function and behavior of FeMoco, and also pave the way for elucidating the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase.", "date": "2024-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Bioorganometallic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

BPEA exhibits a greater diffusivity-confinement effect than a larger dye, decacyclene, in terms of both the length scale at which confinement effects become evident and the percentage reduction in diffusivity. For both BPEA and decacyclene, the diffusivity-confinement effect in PS films occurs at a length scale much larger than that for the glass transition temperature (Tg)-confinement effect and somewhat larger than that for the fragility-confinement effect. This difference in confinement-effect length scales can be rationalized as follows: small-molecule dye diffusivity relates predominantly to short times in the \u03b1-relaxation distribution, whereas Tg relates to long times in the \u03b1-relaxation distribution, and fragility reflects the overall breadth of this relaxation time distribution. If confinement results in a narrower relaxation time distribution in PS with the short-time relaxations being shifted to higher times and the longest-time relaxation regimes being shifted to lower times, then Tg, diffusivity, and fragility all decrease at sufficient levels of confinement. If the narrowing with confinement begins with the shortest relaxation time regimes, then fragility and small-molecule dye diffusivity are influenced by confinement at larger length scales than Tg.", "date": "2024-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Coating Materials; Dyes and Chromophores; Thin Films", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Increasing the shear rate at ambient pressure produces SDAs with densities ranging from LDA to HDA, revealing shear rate as a new thermodynamic variable in the non-equilibrium phase diagram of water.

Crystalline seeds are used for both purposes. While it has been proposed that zeolite seeds induce interzeolite transformation by dissolving into structural units that promote nucleation of the daugh-ter crystal, the seed's structural elements do not always match those of the target zeolite. This discrepancy raises the question of how the seed promotes the daughter phase. Here, we present the first molecularly resolved investigation of seed-assisted zeolite synthesis. Using molecular simulations, we demonstrate that a parent zeo-lite can promote nucleation of a daughter zeolite even when they lack common composite building units (CBUs) or crystal planes. Modeling the seed-assisted synthesis of an AFI-type zeolite using zeolite CHA, our simulations indicate that stand-alone CBUs from the parent seed do not facilitate daughter crystal formation. However, in-troducing the intact seed significantly reduces synthesis time, supporting that seed integrity is key to increased efficiency. This reduction arises from cross-nucleation of the AFI-type zeolite on the CHA (001) face. We find that parent and daughter zeolites are connected by an inter-facial transition layer with order distinct from both zeo-lites. Simulations reveal that cross-nucleation occurs over a broad range of synthesis conditions. Based on nuclea-tion theory, we argue that if cross-nucleation occurs be-tween frameworks without common planes, as in our study, it could be even more favorable for zeolite pairs that share crystalline planes, such as those forming inter-growths.", "date": "2024-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This pincer ligand in the critical intermedi-ate (PBP)IrCO (4) contains a three-coordinate boron bound to Ir that retains some Lewis acidity in the perpendicular direc-tion.  Coordination of the pyridine to this boron center in 4 leads to fast insertion of Ir into the 2-CH bond of pyridine, providing a different topology of direction than the conventional directed C-H activation where both the directing group coordination and C-H activation happen at the same metal center.  Beyond this critical sequence, the system possesses sig-nificant complexity in terms of possible isomers and pathways, which have been thoroughly explored via theoretical and experimental means.  Kinetic and thermodynamic preferences for the activation of differently substituted pyridines were also investigated.  In experimental work, the key intermediate 4 is accessed via elimination of benzene from a phe-nyl/hydride containing precursor (PBPhP)IrHCO (3).  DFT investigations of the mechanism of benzene loss from 3 revealed the possibility of a genuinely new type of mechanism, whereby the Ph-H bond is made in a concerted process that is best described as C-H reductive elimination from boron, assisted by the transition metal (TMARE).  For Ir, this pathway was pre-dicted to be competitive with the more conventional pathways involving C-H reductive elimination from Ir, but still higher in energy barrier.  However, for the Rh analog 3-Rh, TMARE was calculated to be the preferred pathway for benzene loss and this prediction was experimentally corroborated through the study of reaction rates and the kinetic isotope effect", "date": "2024-09-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Theory - Organometallic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A common belief regarding these complex oxides is that the pure single-phase is a prerequisite for their outstanding electrochemical performance. Deviation from a pure single-phase is thought to harm their electrochemical performance. Here, we prepare and characterize the cobalt-free analogs of (Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O using a traditional solid-state synthesis method by replacing cobalt with iron and manganese to give (Mg0.2Fe0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O and (Mg0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O respectively. These analogs were prepared in an air and an argon atmosphere to yield several compositions with different mixtures of crystalline secondary phases. The electrochemical performance of the pure single-phase (Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O is used as a benchmark to compare the performance of the cobalt-free multi-phase analogs. The results indicate that although these cobalt-free analogs are not pure single-phase materials, their electrochemical performance is similar to that observed with (Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O, suggesting that a pure single-phase might not be a prerequisite for an excellent electrochemical performance for these complex multi-metal oxides.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to train automatically, avoiding the incredibly tedious process of constructing and extending traditional property estimation schemes. However, DNNs require large amounts of training data, are challenging to interpret, require large amounts of memory to load even during inference, and have severe difficulties incorporating qualitative chemical knowledge, which are often desired for molecular property prediction tasks. Here we present PySIDT (https://github.com/zadorlab/PySIDT) a software for training and running inference on Subgraph Isomorphic Decision Trees (SIDTs). SIDTs are graph-based decision trees made of nodes associated with molecular substructures. Inference is done by descending target molecular structures down the decision tree to nodes with matching subgraph isomorphic substructures and making predictions based on the final (most specific) node matched. SIDTs scale down well to dataset sizes much smaller than is feasible for DNNs. As trees of molecular substructures, SIDTs are inherently readable and easy to visualize making them easy to analyze. They are also straightforward to extend and retrain, facilitate uncertainty estimation, and enable easy integration of expert knowledge. We demonstrate the SIDT approach applying PySIDT to a diverse range of molecular prediction tasks: rate coefficient estimation, diffusion coefficient estimation, thermochemistry estimation, transition state bond stretch prediction, pKa prediction, stability of molecular structures, stability of surface structures, and prediction of surface lateral interactions.", "date": "2024-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A particle source was introduced at four different points within the room to simulate varying pollution scenarios. The results revealed that the wall-mounted sensor exhibited delays of up to 200 seconds in detecting peak pollutant concentrations compared to the sensor near the air purifier.

In this study, analysis of variance (ANOVA) simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) paired with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used as an easy-to-implement and environmentally friendly tool for this purpose. The capabilities of combining NIRS with ASCA were demonstrated by studying the effects of sampling site and year on the quality of 180 Austrian wheat samples across four sites over three years. It was found that the year, sample site, and their combination significantly (p < 0.001) affect the NIR spectra of wheat. NIR spectral pre-processing tools, usually employed in chemometric workflows, notably influence the results obtained by ASCA, particularly in terms of the variance attributed to annual and regional effects. The influence of the year was identified as the dominant factor, followed by region and the combined effect of year and sampling site. Interpretation of the loading plots obtained by ASCA demonstrates that wheat components such as proteins, carbohydrates, moisture, or fat contribute to annual and regional differences. Additionally, the protein, starch, moisture, fat, fiber, and ash content of wheat samples obtained using a NIR-based calibration were found to be significantly influenced by year, sampling site, or their combination using ANOVA.

In lithium ion or sodium ion-based materials, the alkali cations diffuse through three-dimensional channels consisting of interconnected tetrahedral or octahedral sites with low free energy barriers between them. Fluoride ion conductors stand out in this landscape since the materials with the highest conductivities belong to the MSnF4 family (in which M2+ is a divalent cation), which structure is layered and characterized by double-layers of Sn2+ and M2+ cations along a given direction. Importantly, these materials display stereoactive electron lone pairs (LPs) that seemingly play an important role not only in stabilizing of the Sn-Sn layer but also in modulating the fluoride ion diffusive behavior. However, despite previous experimental and simulation studies, the involvement of the LPs in the fluoride ions conduction mechanism remains to be quantitatively understood. In this work, we simulate the BaSnF4  tetragonal structure using machine learning-based molecular dynamics, in which the interaction potential is trained on density functional theory data. We investigate the role of the Sn-LP-Sn layer in lowering the diffusion energy landscape. In particular, we show how the F- ions jump across this layer occur much more frequently than in the Ba-F-Ba one, resulting in the formation of vacancies in the Ba-Sn layers. Concurrently, the LPs stereochemical activity fluctuates to accommodate the F ions jumping. In addition, the presence of the LP layer enhances the flexibility of the Sn ions, which leads to an increase of the two-dimensional diffusion by several orders of magnitude. These results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between LPs and ionic diffusion, helping to explain the good performance of the material in fluoride-ion batteries.", "date": "2024-09-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We have previously introduced a new family of solid electrolytes based on thiophosphates with inherent stability against metallic Li anode and high conductivity [JACS REF]. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) together with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the diffusion mechanisms and underlying factors contributing to the high ionic conductivity of these novel Li-P-S ternary electrolytes, including Li7PS2, Li5PS, Li8P2S, and Li11P3S. Our findings reveal that these materials exhibit ionic conductivities comparable to the well-known superionic conductor, Li7P3S11, positioning them as promising candidates for solid-state battery applications. Additionally, we assess the thermodynamic stability of these ternaries in contact with lithium metal anodes, a critical consideration for practical battery use. Unlike Li7P3S11, which forms a solid-electrolyte interphase, the novel Li-P-S ternaries exhibit remarkable stability against Li metal anode due to their unique Li2S-like structural framework. The absence of a solid-electrolyte interphase layer is particularly significant, as it eliminates additional resistance at the electrolyte-anode interface, a common challenge in many solid-state battery systems. Our study not only highlights the suitability of these novel ternaries, particularly Li5PS, as high-performance solid electrolytes but also underscores the importance of structural design in developing next-generation battery materials.

Computational tools have become integral to these campaigns and provide a route to library design, virtual screening, the identification of putative small molecule binding sites, the elucidation of binding geometries, and the prediction of accurate binding affinities. Molecular dynamics-based simulations have become increasingly popular, but are often limited by sampling issues related to the simulation timescales obtainable. Here, we expand the use of grand canonical nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (GCNCMC) to overcome these limitations and accurately predict the binding sites, modes, and affinities of fragment-like molecules. GCNCMC has been used previously to accurately predict the location of water molecules in protein-ligand systems, by attempting the insertion and deletion of water to, or from, a region of interest; each proposed move is subject to a rigorous acceptance test based on the thermodynamic properties of the system. Here, we demonstrate the ability of fragment-based GCNCMC to rapidly and reliably find occluded experimental fragment binding sites. We also show that the method can accurately sample multiple fragment binding modes without any prior knowledge of their existence. Finally, we calculate the binding affinities for fragment molecules to three systems. We find that our results are in agreement with a more established method, namely absolute binding free energy calculations. Notably, GCNCMC does not require the use of complex restraints, the handling of multiple binding modes, or post-hoc symmetry corrections. Rather, binding sites, geometries and affinities all arise naturally from a series of GCNCMC simulations.", "date": "2024-09-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Therefore, we have developed a dual-colour printing approach where rapid radical curing of a soft, wide-meshed polymer network facilitates fast and easy 3D structuring of the subsequently slow curing step growth formulation at an orthogonal initiation-wavelength regime. Thereby the methacrylate system acts as a scaffold for an uncured epoxide alcohol system during the printing process, which is then cured with UV light post-printing.

In this study, we have utilized readily available thermodynamic properties obtained from first-principle atomistic simulations to calculate the intercalation potential of zinc in numerous potential candidate cathode materials. We confined our chemical space to simple transition metal oxides (MxOy, where M is a transition metal). While some materials in this class were previously experimentally studied (e.g., MnO2, V2O5, MoO3), a literature survey revealed multiple oxides for which no prior investigation on their use as cathodes for RZIBs had been performed. We considered previously reported structures with similar atomic arrangements for the charged and discharged phases, the feasibility of experimental realization of the materials, the electrochemical stability of the charged cathode in an aqueous environment, and the potential degradation of aqueous electrolytes in our analysis. We mapped the zinc intercalation potential for over 50 redox pairs involving oxides of 12 different elements. These calculated theoretical potentials were then compared to previously obtained experimental results, with the relatively small difference between them (mean absolute error of 0.11 V) demonstrating the predictive capabilities of the utilized methodology. The failure mechanism for the experimentally observed capacity fade was determined from the electrochemical stability analysis to be related to the dissolution of the transition metal during battery cycling. Fully stable transition metals in the RZIBs potential and pH operating conditions were discovered and proposed for use as alloying elements in RZIBs cathodes to improve the capacity retention. Previously overlooked materials with high intercalation potential (above 1.6 V vs Zn/Zn2+) were then proposed as cathode materials for RZIBs.

The phonon transport properties of two-dimensional carbon-based allotropes are poorly understood in terms of their NTE properties. This work with a specific focus on carbon-based allotropes, explores the underlying mechanisms of the thermal conductivity (TC) and NTE of graphene, haeckelite, pentahexoctite, s-graphene, 6.6.12 and delta Graphynes (Gys). High TC is imperative for efficiently dissipating heat in electronic devices, whereas thermoelectric devices need to be thermally resistive with low TC. Delta-Gy shows highest NTE as well as lowest TC and vice versa is true for graphene. Graphene displays a lower degree of anisotropic TC, while s-graphene exhibits the highest level of anisotropic TC. The behaviour of their TC are understood on the basis of soft-phonon modes, phonon group velocity (vg), phonon lifetime (\u03c4) and mean free path (MFP). The acoustic and optical phonon branches play a key role in determining both TC and NTE of the materials. Out-of-plane buckling of a two-dimensional materials can suppress heat conductivity by increasing the phonon scattering. Buckling is also shown to increase the NTE.

Using a recently developed multisite Ca2+ model, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of Ca2+ on the properties of membranes composed of POPC and POPS and observed that both the structure and fluidity of the membranes were significantly affected. In particular, we examined the influence of asymmetrically distributed Ca2+ on asymmetric lipid bilayers and found that imbalanced stress in the two leaflets was generated, with the negatively charged leaflet on the Ca2+-rich side becoming more condensed, which in turn induced membrane curvature that bent the membrane away from the Ca2+-rich side. We employed continuum mechanics to study the large-scale deformations of a spherical vesicle and found that the vesicle can go through vesiculation to form a multi-spherical shape in which a number of spheres are connected with infinitesimal necks, depending on the specific Ca2+ distributions.

Though widely used in large-scale protein quantification, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic strategies still face great challenges in protein biomarker discovery in the blood, due to the particularly large dynamic range of proteins and the strong suppression effect by high-abundant proteins in the blood. As a promising alternative, nanomaterials enrichment-based protein corona strategy is highly efficient in increasing proteome coverage, but with the drawback of potentially disrupting the original protein concentration in the blood. Therefore, we proposed an ultrasensitive strategy that capable of enhancing mass spectrometry signals of the low abundant proteins/peptide to promote quantification of more than 2000 proteins at 288 SPD or 5000 plasma proteins at 36 SPD throughput from neat plasma without enrichment. Our strategy leverages the unique multiplexing properties of TMT labeling to sum the \u201ctotal\u201d MS1 signal of the same peptide from a boosting channel using nanomaterials enriched protein digests and the study channels using digests of neat plasma to trigger MS/MS fragmentation more efficiently and sensitively for low abundant protein identification, while the reporter ions provide quantitative information. In this way, in depth coverage of low abundant protein in neat plasma can be achieved without the risk of disrupting their original quantification. Accurate and reproducible quantification of plasma proteins with concentration down to low ng/L range was achieved, which is still rate in the field.

However, there is a gap in timescale of these simulations and that of real-world experiments. To address this problem, various enhanced simulation methods have been developed. Additionally, there has been a significant advancement of the force fields used for simulations associated with the explicit treatment of electronic polarizability. In this study, we apply oscillating chemical potential grand canonical Monte Carlo and machine learning methods to determine reaction coordinates combined with metadynamics simulations to explore the role of Mg2+ distribution and electronic polarizability in the context of the classical Drude oscillator polarizable force field on the stability of the Twister ribozyme. The introduction of electronic polarizability along with details of the distribution of Mg2+ significantly stabilize the simulations with respect to sampling the crystallographic conformation.  The introduction of electronic polarizability leads to increased stability over that obtained with the additive CHARMM36 FF reported in a previous study, allowing for a wider range of ions distribution to stabilize Twister. Specific interactions contributing to stabilization are identified included both those observed in the crystal structures and additional experimentally unobserved interactions. Interactions of Mg2+ with the bases are indicated to make important contributions to stabilization. Notably, the presence of specific interactions between the Mg2+ ions and bases or the non-bridging phosphate oxygens (NBPO), lead to enhanced dipole moments of all three moieties. Mg2+-NPBO interactions led to enhanced dipoles of the phosphates but, interestingly, not in all of the participating ions. The present results further indicate the importance of electronic polarizability in stabilizing RNA in molecular simulations and the complicated nature of the relationship of Mg2+-RNA interactions with polarization response of the bases and phosphates.

This work maps the evolution of the saturation profile characteristics in lateral high-aspect-ratio (LHAR) channels through simulations using a diffusion-reaction model for various diffusion regimes with a wide range of Knudsen numbers (10^6 to 10^{-6}), from free molecular flow (Knudsen diffusion) through the transition regime to continuum flow conditions (molecular diffusion). Simulations are run for ALD reactant partial pressures spanning several orders of magnitude with the exposure time kept constant (by varying the total exposure) and with the total exposure kept constant (by varying the exposure time). In a free molecular flow, for a constant total exposure, the saturation profile characteristics are identical regardless of the LHAR channel height and the partial pressure of the reactant. Under transition regime and continuum conditions, the penetration depth decreases and the steepness of the adsorption front increases with decreasing Knudsen number. The effect of varying individual parameters on the saturation profile characteristics in some cases depends on the diffusion regime.

Light-powered strategies are starting to emerge, given that they have the potential to use directly the abundant and sustainable solar irradiation, but are ineffective. Here we report an efficient, >99.9% selective, visible-light powered, catalytic conversion of acetylene to ethylene.

The reaction proceeds through a cobalt-hydride intermediate with nearly 100% conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co-feed) conditions after only 50 minutes, and with no evolution of H2 or over-hydrogenation to ethane. We further incorporate the cobaloxime as linker in a metal-organic framework; the result is a heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co-feed) conditions that can be recycled up to six times and remains catalytically active for 48 hours, before significant loss of performance is observed.", "date": "2024-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Homogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

By designing DNA-based input strands that can specifically sequester DNA monomers, we can control the size of the reaction network and thus fine-tune the yield of each DNA dimer output in a predictable manner.

Despite the recognized role of nutrition in modulating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying aging, there is a lack of comprehensive exploration into potential interventions that can effectively mitigate these effects. In this study, we investigated the potential anti-aging properties of vitamin D by examining its interactions with key molecular targets involved in aging-related pathways. By using molecular docking and dynamics techniques, we evaluate the interactions and stability of vitamin D2 and D3 with key proteins involved in aging pathways, such as SIRT1, mTOR, AMPK, Klotho, AhR, and MAPK. Our results reveal promising binding affinities between vitamin D and SIRT1 forms, with energy values of -48.33 kJ/mol and -45.94 kJ/mol for vitamin D2 and D3, respectively, in aqueous environments. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the vitamin D3-SIRT1 complex exhibits greater stability compared to the vitamin D2-SIRT1 complex. The study calculated the solvation-free energy to compare the solubility of vitamins D2 and D3 in water and various organic solvents. Despite their strong interactions with water, both vitamins exhibit low solubility, primarily due to the high energy cost associated with cavity formation in the aqueous environment. Compared to other solvents, water demonstrated particularly low solubility for both vitamins. This suggests that vitamins D2 and D3 prefer binding to aging receptors over dissolving in bulk aqueous environments, supporting their strong therapeutic interactions with these receptors. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying vitamin D's potential anti-aging effects and lay the groundwork for developing nutraceuticals targeting aging and associated diseases.

Lateral flow immunoassay-based xylazine test strips (XTS) have emerged as a potential harm reduction tool for quick, easy, and field-based drug checking but their effectiveness remains underexplored. Although commercial XTS from multiple vendors are available, the absence of regulatory standards raises concerns regarding their accuracy and effectiveness.\nMethod This study evaluated the performance of commonly used commercially available XTS from different vendors to investigate the inter-product comparison of sensitivity, precision (reproducibility and robustness), cross-reactivity, and stability over changes in pH and extended storage under ambient and extreme temperature conditions. \nResults All test strips demonstrated effective sensitivity, and reproducibility and maintained their efficacy despite changes in urinary pH and storage temperatures over six weeks.

While XTS can detect xylazine in low concentrations, the potential for false positives due to cross-reactivity with other drugs necessitates caution in their interpretation. Hence, xylazine test strips may serve as a viable harm reduction tool, provided that their cross-reactivity limitations are thoroughly documented and they are incorporated as part of a broader harm reduction strategy.\n", "date": "2024-10-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Education; Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Biochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, MAFLD often goes undiagnosed due to the lack of reliable clinical indicators and effective screening methods. The current gold standard for diagnosing and assessing MAFLD is through invasive liver biopsy, which is impractical for widespread screening or frequent monitoring. MASLD typically manifests as \u201cmacrovesicular steatosis,\u201d characterized by a single large fat vacuole (30-50 \u00b5m) in each hepatocyte, representing a more benign and indolent form. However, approximately 20% of MASLD cases exhibit hepatocytes with numerous smaller fat vacuoles (1-15 \u00b5m), known as \u201cmicrovesicular steatosis,\u201d which is linked to a higher risk of steatohepatitis and progression to cirrhosis and cancer. Although ultrasound (US) imaging shows promise as a non-invasive method to assess liver fat content, traditional grayscale features are not sensitive enough to detect mild liver fat or small changes over time. Novel quantitative US-liver fat quantification (QUS-LFQ) tools that analyze acoustic attenuation and backscatter are emerging, with several techniques now available on the market. However, the sensitivity of current QUS-LFQ methods to variations in fat vacuole size remains unknown. While imaging phantoms can help validate these quantitative tools, there is currently no phantom model available that can link US measurements to the severity of steatosis. Existing techniques for modifying material properties such as attenuation, backscatter, and speed of sound do not account for the macro-structure of steatosis, where the size and distribution of scatterers (such as lipid vacuoles) likely influence acoustic wave interactions and thus affect quantitative US liver fat quantification (QUS-LFQ). We developed agar-based phantoms to simulate the excessive fat accumulation and presence of lipid droplets seen in steatotic hepatocytes, using stable micron-sized peanut oil droplets as stand-ins for these lipid vacuoles. Oil microparticles in the 5-20 \u00b5m and 20-60 \u00b5m size ranges were successfully produced and their stability confirmed. Microscopy and US imaging revealed a uniform distribution of phantom constituents, including oil microparticles, throughout the agar. US-LFQ measurements were accurate, with fat content closely matching theoretical values and those obtained by MRI. Spectral CT measurements demonstrated the expected linear decrease in X-ray attenuation as the lipid content in the phantoms increased.

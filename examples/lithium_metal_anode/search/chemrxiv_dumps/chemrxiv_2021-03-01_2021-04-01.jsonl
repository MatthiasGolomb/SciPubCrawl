Many current models, however,\nuse molecular descriptors or ligand-based predictive methods to guide molecule\ngeneration towards a desirable property space. This restricts their application\nto relatively data-rich targets, neglecting those where little data is\navailable to sufficiently train a predictor. Moreover, ligand-based models often\nbias molecule generation towards previously established chemical space, thereby\nlimiting their ability to identify truly novel chemotypes. In this work, we assess\nthe ability of using molecular docking <i>via </i>Glide \u2013 a structure-based\napproach \u2013 as a scoring function to guide the deep generative model REINVENT\nand compare model performance and behaviour to a ligand-based scoring function.\nAdditionally, we modify the previously published MOSES benchmarking dataset to\nremove any induced bias towards non-protonatable groups.

Changes in the drug scaffold via contraction or expansion of rings, the breaking of rings and the introduction of cyclic structures from acyclic structures are commonly applied by medicinal chemists to improve binding affinity and enhance favorable properties of candidate compounds. These processes, commonly referred to as scaffold hopping, are challenging to model computationally. Although relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations have shown success in predicting binding affinity changes caused by perturbing R-groups attached to a common scaffold, applications of RBFE calculations to modeling scaffold hopping are relatively limited. Scaffold hopping inevitably involves breaking and forming bond interactions of quadratic functional forms, which is highly challenging. A novel method for handling ring opening/closure/contraction/expansion and linker contraction/expansion is presented here. To the best of our knowledge, RBFE calculations on linker contraction/expansion have not been previously reported. The method uses auxiliary restraints to hold the atoms at the ends of a bond in place during the breaking and forming of the bonds. The broad applicability of the method was demonstrated by examining perturbations involving small molecule macrocycles and mutations of proline in proteins. High accuracy was obtained using the method for most of the perturbations studied. Unlike other methods that rely on \u03bb-dependent functional forms for bond interactions, the method presented here can be employed using modern MD software without modification of codes or force field functions.", "date": "2021-03-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Quinazolinones are studiedly widely as effective EGFR-TK inhibitor because of their higher affinity to bind with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of receptor tyrosine kinases. However, their toxicity due to non-specific binding to tyrosine kinase in non-cancerous normally dividing cells of the body limits its applicability as a cancer therapeutics. In the present investigation a series of thirty-four novel synthesized thiazolo- [2, 3-b] quinazolinones were studied in silico as EGFR-TK inhibitors. All the thirty-four compounds were screened against EGFR-TK domain using multiple software\u2019s (AutoDock Vina, Argus Lab, YASARA, and MOE). The interactions of the ligands with amino acid residues, namely, Lys721, Met769 and Asp831 of the active site were through the functional groups on aryl substituents at position 3 and 5 of the thiazolo- [2, 3-b] quinazolinone scaffold. The methyl substituents at position 8 of the ligands had prominent hydrophobic interactions in the active site cavity of EGFR-TK domain. The compounds 5ab, 5aq, and 5bq were predicted to be non-toxic and drug-like by in silico ADMET investigations. These compounds were considered for further investigation due to their non-toxicity and higher docking score ranking in different docking methods. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 ns of docked complexes revealed the stability of these compounds. The binding free energy determined using Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Model and Solvent Accessibility (MM-GBSA) method indicate that thiazolo- [2, 3-b] quinazolinone has high inhibitory efficacy similar to the standard drug, erlotinib (5ab - 22.45, 5aq -22.23, 5bq -20.76, and erlotinib -24.11 kcal/mol). In silico studies and MD simulations indicated that compounds (5ab, 5aq and 5bq) could be potential EGFR-TK inhibitors and require further validation as cancer therapeutics using carcinoma cell lines.<br /><p></p>", "date": "2021-03-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, for reported RTP materials, low photoluminescence quantum\nyields (PLQYs) in thin film state seriously impede their applications in OLEDs. On the other hand, how\nusing normal organic fluorescence materials to fabricate OLEDs with an internal quantum efficiency\n(IQE) over 25% remains a great unaddressed issue beyond the thermally activated delayed fluorescence\n(TADF) sensitization approach. Here, we establish a strategy to construct highly efficient OLEDs based\non pure organic RTP material sensitized fluorescence emitter. The key point for our strategy is that\nbenzimidazole-triazine molecules (PIM-TRZ), 2,6-di(phenothiazinyl)naphthalene (\u03b2-DPTZN) and\n5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) were screened as host, phosphor sensitizer and fluorescent\nemitter, respectively. Detail photophysical characterizations demonstrate that the host material PIMTRZ with unique RTP nature is critical for achieving phosphor sensitizing process. As an organic RTP\ncompound, the singlet and triplet state energy levels of \u03b2-DPTZN perfectly match with those of PIMTRZ, resulting in the formation and lasting existence of phosphor\u2019s excitons in emitting layer. The large\noverlap between the absorption spectrum of rubrene and PL spectrum of PIM-TRZ:10% \u03b2-DPTZN film\ncan facilitate the F\u00f6rster energy transfer from the triplet \u03b2-DPTZN to the singlet rubrene and the finally\ndisplayed fluorescence is derived from singlet excited states of rubrene.

To this end, electronic and structural properties of the defect are analyzed. Band structure calculations reveal a higher-lying valence band which would suggest increased reactivity. However, the opposite is found when organic molecules for interface formation (acetylene, ethylene and cyclooctyne) are adsorbed at the defect. Significant reaction barriers have to be overcome in order to form bonds with defect atoms, while adsorption on the pristine surface is mostly direct. This suggests the presence of a, rather weak, Si-Si bond across the defect which must be dissociated before organic adsorbates can react. A rich adsorption and reaction network is found in addition to the structures known from the pristine surface. All three investigated adsorbates show different bonding characteristics. For acetylene and ethylene, the preferred thermodynamic sink is the insertion into the defect, with the latter molecule even dissociating. Bulky cyclooctyne on the other hand avoids reaction with the defect due to steric demands imposed by the small defect cavity. The DV has no effect on reactivity of neighboring dimers. A combination of defect creation and hydrogen-precoverage could be a promising approach for selective surface functionalization. We thus show the influence of a non-ideal surface on organic functionalization and interface build-up reactions for a prototypical interface. <br />", "date": "2021-03-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Moreover, the present RPMD calculations predicted the rate coe?cient of 3:95?10\udbc0\udc0011cm3 molecule\udbc0\udc001s\udbc0\udc001 at the room temperature (namely 298 K), agreeing with the previously reported experimental values. Finally, based on the present calculations, a probable dynamics mechanism was discussed, where the produced HCHO molecule was proposed to be in a vibrationally excited state. This needs further experimental and theoretical observation in the future.<br />", "date": "2021-03-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Quantum Computing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Recently, all-inorganic lead-free Cs3Sb2I9 emerges as a promising lead-free absorber, with its optoelectronic properties being further controllable by manipulating its structural dimensionality (0D or 2D) via composition engineering. In particular,  superior photoconversion efficiency (up to 5 %) under indoor illumination with high photostabilities have been demonstrated experimentally in 2D Cs3Sb2ClyI9-y}. To gain a more thorough understanding on how the properties of this family of materials are controlled by their chemistry and dimensionality, here, we employ density functional theory calculations to explore the phase stability, structural and electronic dynamics of Cs3Sb2X9 (X=Br and Cl) across 74 different combinations of composition/dimensionality. The results show that Cs3Sb2X9 solid solutions are predominantly stabilised by configurational entropy rather than enthalpy. In stark contrast to cubic inorganic lead/tin halides perovskites, Cs3Sb2X9 are dynamically more stable  at 300 K, as reflected by their low vibrational anharmonicities, the values of which also exhibit weak compositional dependency. This consequentially reduces the strength of electron-phonon couplings, thus enhancing the photoexcited carrier lifetime in these materials, which further demonstrates their promising potential to be integrated into indoor photovoltaic devices.", "date": "2021-03-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we investigate how thermal pretreatment increases electrode surface area and the effect this added surface area has on electrode performance. Specifically, we rigorously analyze the surface area of Freudenberg H23 carbon paper electrodes, a binder-free model material, by systematically varying pretreatment temperature (400, 450, and 500 \u00b0C) and time (0 to 24 h) and evaluating changes in the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. We compare physical surface area, measured by a combination of gas adsorption techniques, to surface area measured via electrochemical double layer capacitance. We find good agreement between the two at shorter treatment times (0-3 h); however, at longer treatment times (6-24 h), the surface area measured electrochemically is an underestimate of the physical surface area. Further, we use gas adsorption to measure a pore size distribution and find that the majority of pores are in the micropore range (< 2 nm), and ca. 60% of the added surface area are in the sub-nanometer (< 1 nm) pore size range. We postulate that the solvated radii and imperfect wetting of electrochemical species may hinder active species transport into these recessed regions, explaining the discrepancy between electrochemical and physical surface area. These results are supported with in situ flow cell testing, where single-electrolyte polarization measurements show little improvement with increasing surface area. Further, using a simple convection-reaction model to simulate electrode overpotential as a function of surface area, we find that increasing surface area improves the performance to a point, but the mass transport to and the catalytic activity of the reaction sites offer greater comparative impact. Ultimately, this work aims to inform the design of electrodes that offer maximal accessible surface area to redox species.", "date": "2021-03-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Carbon-based Materials; Electrochemical Analysis; Electrochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The efficiency of SOCT-ISC in BODIPY donor-acceptor dyads, so far the most thoroughly investigated class of such sensitizers, can be finely tuned by structural modification. However, predicting the triplet state yields and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation quantum yields for such compounds in a particular solvent is still very challenging due to a lack of established quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Herein, we analyzed the available data on singlet oxygen generation quantum yields (F?) for a dataset containing > 70 heavy-atom-free BODIPY in three different solvents (toluene, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran). In order to build reliable QSPR model, we synthesized a series of new BODIPYs containing different electron donating aryl groups in the meso position, studied their optical and structural properties along with the solvent dependence of singlet oxygen generation, which confirmed the formation of triplet states via the SOCT-ISC mechanism. For the combined dataset of BODIPY structures, a total of more than 5000 quantum-chemical descriptors was calculated including quantum-chemical descriptors using Density Functional Theory (DFT), namely M06-2X functional. QSPR models predicting F? values were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), which perform significantly better than other machine learning methods and show sufficient statistical parameters (R = 0.88 ? 0.91 and q2 = 0.62 ? 0.69) for all three solvents. A small root mean squared error of 8.2% was obtained for F? values predicted using MLR model in toluene.

Different types of zeolites have been synthesized at the laboratory scale with this method using mostly pestle and mortar. However, such an approach hinders both the systematic comprehension of the effects of the input variables of the milling process and its further scale-up towards the synthesis of the zeolites and their catalytic application. This work investigates the influence of key factors involved in the ball milling stage of the mechanochemical route for the synthesis of MFI done with the assistance of a commercial MFI seed and in the absence of solvents over the most salient physicochemical properties of this type of materials, i.e. the recovery percentage, production cost, morphology, surface area and porosity, crystallinity, acidity of the protonated MFI and catalytic performance. The synthesis of the materials was planned and executed following a full 24 factorial experiment whose input variables were the Na2O/SiO2 and H2O/SiO2 molar ratios and the milling time and speed. The effects of both main and interaction factors over key physicochemical properties, and catalytic behavior of the synthesized materials on the alkylation of phenol with tert-butyl alcohol were established within the explored sampling space. Results showed that the Na2O/SiO2 molar ratio plays a key role for the mechanochemical synthesis of MFI, since this variable may direct the synthesis to the preferential production of MOR instead of MFI. On the other hand, it was found that the milling time and speed and their interactions markedly impact the textural properties of MFI. Furthermore, the triple interaction between the input variables affected the concentration of Lewis acid sites of the produced materials. These effects were rationalized by considering that sodium can act as a structure directing agent during the mechanochemical synthesis of MFI and also can promote the incorporation of aluminum to its structure. On the other hand, the milling time and speed are non-linearly correlated to the milling energy required for forming the aluminosilicate precursor that crystallizes during the hydrothermal stage of the process. Overall, all the zeolites synthesized by the mechanochemical route were less crystalline than both the MFI used as seed and an MFI synthesized by sol-gel. This was associated to the formation of amorphous agglomerates around the zeolitic crystals. Finally, the catalytic behavior of the mechanochemical MFI zeolites in the studied reaction was found to be linearly and positively correlated with both the concentration of Br\u00d8nsted of sites and with the density of acid sites. The catalytic tendencies were consistent with the proposal of a stepwise Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism for the alkylation of phenol with tert-butyl alcohol.", "date": "2021-03-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Utilizing the simple and known CoCl<sub>2</sub>(TMEDA) (TMEDA = N,N,N\u2019,N\u2019-tetramethylethylenediamine) precursor in combination with the intramolecularly stabilized Zn aminoalkyl compound Zn(DMP)<sub>2</sub> (DMP = dimethylaminopropyl) as auxiliary reducing agent, a thermal ALD process is developed that enables the deposition of Zn free Co thin films. ALD studies demonstrate the saturation behavior of both precursors, linearity in dependency of the applied number of cycles as well as investigations of the temperature dependency of film growth in a regime of 140 - 215 \u00b0C. While the process optimization is carried out on Si with native oxide, additional growth studies are conducted on Au and Pt substrates. This study is complemented by initial reactivity and suitability tests of several potential Zn alkyl reducing agents. For the CoCl<sub>2</sub>(TMEDA) - Zn(DMP)<sub>2</sub> combination, these findings allow to propose a series of elemental reaction steps hypothetically leading to pure Co film formation in the ALD process whose feasibility are probed by a set of DFT calculations. The DFT results show that for reactions of the precursors in the gas phase and on Co(111) substrate surfaces, a pathway involving C-C coupling and diamine formation through reductive elimination of an intermediate Co(II) alkyl species is preferred.

Hinges are particularly useful, as they provide the minimum flexibility needed for a simple and pronounced conformational change. Compounds with multiple stable conformers are common, but molecular hinges almost exclusively operate via dihedral rotations rather than truly hinge-like clamping mechanisms. An ideal molecular hinge would better reproduce the behavior of hinged devices, such as gates and tweezers, while remaining soluble, scalable and synthetically versatile. Herein, we describe two isomeric macrocycles with clamp-like open and closed geometries, which crystallize as separate polymorphs but interconvert freely in solution. An unusual one-pot addition cyclization reaction was used to produce the macrocycles on a multigram scale from inexpensive reagents, without supramolecular templating or high-dilution conditions. Using mechanistic information from NMR kinetic studies and at-line mass spectrometry, we developed a semi-continuous flow synthesis with maximum conversions of 85-93% and over 80% selectivity for a single isomer. The macrocycles feature voids that are sterically protected from guests, including reactive species such as fluoride ions, and could therefore serve as chemically inert hinges for adaptive supramolecular receptors and flexible porous materials.", "date": "2021-03-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Stereochemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Reaction Engineering; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Organic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A full molecular orbital analysis of a transition metal species is not always feasible or desirable, and crystal field theory, while generally useful, is often too simplistic and limited. It would be helpful to give students of organometallic  chemistry an additional toolkit that helps them to understand d-block compounds, in particular highly covalent ones. It is well known in the research literature in organometallic chemistry that hybridization arguments involving s and d orbitals (such as sd and sd2 hybridization for d8 and d6 systems, respectively) provides useful insight. However, this knowledge is much underused in undergraduate teaching and not taught in undergraduate textbooks. The purpose of this article is to make descriptions  of bonding that are based on s,d-hybridized orbitals more accessible in a way that is directly useful for undergraduate teaching. Geometries of unusual low-coordinate structures can be successfully predicted. An in-depth physical explanation for the trans-influence, the weakening of a bond due to a strong bond trans to it, is provided. A clear explanation is given for why the cis isomer normally more stable than the trans isomer in square-planar d8 complexes of the type MR2L2 (R = alkyl/aryl, L = relatively weakly bonded neutral ligand). Similarly, the relative stability of fac versus mer isomers in octahedral d6 complexes of the type MR3L3 is explained. Relevant to catalysis, the method explains why strongly donating ligands do not always facilitate oxidative addition and why 12-electron and 14-electron Pd(0) species are thermodynamically much more accessible than one might expect. The method capitalizes on 1st year knowledge such as the ability to write Lewis structures and to use hybridization arguments. It also ties into the upper-year experience, including graduate school, where covalent d-block complexes may be encountered in research and where the hybridization schemes described here naturally emerge from using the NBO formalism. It is discussed where the method might fit into the inorganic curriculum.<br />", "date": "2021-03-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Education - General", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nevertheless, computational methods are now capable of describing the ladder of electronic energy levels of the simpler trivalent lanthanide ions, as well as the lowest energy term of most of the series. The electronic energy levels result from electron configurations that are first split by spin-orbit coupling into groups of energy levels denoted by the corresponding Russel-Saunders terms. Each of these groups are then split by the ligand field into the actual electronic energy levels known as microstates or sometimes mJ levels. The ligand field splitting directly informs on coordination geometry, and is a valuable tool for determining structure and thus correlating the structure and properties of metal complexes in solution. The issue with lanthanide complexes is that the determination of complex structures from ligand field splitting remains a very challenging task.

This paper uses first-principles-informed energy span and microkinetic analysis to explore the reaction free energy landscapes and kinetic limitations of competing reaction pathways on a MgO (100) step-edge. Previous studies suggested mechanisms proceeding via both dehydrogenation and dehydration of ethanol, and highlighted sensitivity to conditions and catalyst composition. Here, we use the energy span concept to characterize the theoretical maximum turnover and degree of turnover frequency control for states in each reaction pathway, finding the dehydration route to be less active for 1,3-butadiene, and suggesting rate-determining states in the dehydrogenation, dehydration, and condensation steps. The influence of temperature on the relative rate contribution of each state is quantified and explained through the varying temperature sensitivity of the free energy landscape. A microkinetic model is developed to explore competition between pathways, interaction with gas-phase species, and surface coverage limitations. This suggests that the turnover may be significantly lower than predicted solely based on energetics. Turnover frequency determining states found to have high surface coverage include adsorbed ethanol and two longer, oxygenated hydrocarbons. The combined energy span and microkinetic analysis permits investigation of a complex system from two perspectives and helps elucidate conflicting observations of rate determining steps and product distribution by considering both energetic and kinetic limitations. The impact of uncertainty in the energy landscape is quantified using a correlated error model.

As spin-dependent kinetics exist in OER, the\nspin alignment in active OER catalysts is critical for reducing the kinetic\nbarriers in OER. It is effective to facilitate the spin polarization in\nferromagnetic catalysts by applying external magnetic field, which increases\nthe OER efficiency. However, more active OER catalysts tend to have dynamic\nopen-shell orbital configurations with disordered magnetic moments, without\nshowing an apparent long-range interatomic ferromagnetism; thus controlling the\nspin alignment of these active catalysts is challenging. In this work, we\nreport a strategy with spin pinning effect to make the spins in active\noxyhydroxides more aligned for higher intrinsic OER activity. Such strategy bases\non a controllable reconstruction: ferromagnetic oxides with controlled\nsulfurization can evolve into stable oxide<sub>FM</sub>/oxyhydroxide\nconfigurations with a thin oxyhydroxide layer under operando condition. The\nspin pinning effect is found at the interface of oxide<sub>FM</sub>/oxyhydroxide.\nThe spin pinning\neffect can promote spin selective electron transfer on OER intermediates to\ngenerate oxygens with parallel spin alignment, which facilitates the production\nof triplet oxygen and increases the intrinsic activity of oxyhydroxide by ~ 1\norder of magnitude. Under spin pinning, the spins in oxyhydroxide can become\nmore aligned after magnetization as long-range ferromagnetic ordering is\nestablished on the magnetic domains in oxide<sub>FM</sub>. The OER kinetics are\nfacilitated accordingly after magnetization, implying that the spin pinning\neffect is involved in the rate-determining step and this step is spin\ndependent. The spin polarization process in OER under spin pinning is also\nbelieved to be sensitive to the existence of active oxygen ligand (O(-)) in\noxyhydroxide. When the O(-) is created in 1<sup>st</sup> deprotonation step under\nhigh pH, the spin polarization\nof ligand oxygens will be facilitated, which reduces the barrier for subsequent\nO-O coupling and promotes the O<sub>2</sub> turnover.", "date": "2021-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Magnetic Materials; Electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The organometallic catalyst [(neocuproine)PdOAc]<sub>2</sub>OTf<sub>2</sub>, that was previously shown to perform regioselective C3-oxidation of glucosides, was used in the scope of this work. The selectivity of the catalyst towards glucose and the sensitivity of specific amino acid residues to oxidation was explored by screening a select panel of glycopeptides in the oxidation reactions. We reveal that glucosylated peptides are more readily oxidized compared to galactosylated peptides, and Thr/Ser-oxidation is a concomitant side-reaction. The oxidation methodology was also applied to the complex mixture of tryptic glucopeptides that was generated from the fragment of <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> adhesin glycoprotein. The resulting keto-group of the glucose was further transformed into an oxime functionality, which allows introduction of various groups of interest. The methodology outlined in this work will allow to perfrom late-stage modification of glucopeptides as well as selective oxidation and functionalization of tryptic glucopeptides for proteomics analysis. </p>", "date": "2021-03-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioorganic Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

As a compartmental capsule is an essential artificial cell structure, many studies have focused on the lateral phase separation of artificial lipid vesicles. However, controlling phase separation using a molecular design approach remains challenging. Here, we present the lateral liquid-liquid phase separation of DNA nanostructures that leads to the formation of phase-separated capsule-like hydrogels. We designed three types of DNA nanostructures (two orthogonal and a linker nanostructure) that were adsorbed onto an interface of water-in-oil droplets via electrostatic interactions. The phase separation of DNA nanostructures led to the formation of hydrogels of bicontinuous, patch, and mix patterns, due to the immiscibility of liquid-like DNA during the self-assembly process. The frequency of appearance of these patterns was regulated by designing DNA sequences and altering the mixing ratio of the nanostructures. We constructed a phase diagram for the capsule-like DNA hydrogels by investigating pattern formation under various conditions. Our results provide a method for the design and control of phase-separated hydrogel capsules using sequence-designed DNAs. We envision that by incorporating various DNA nanodevices into DNA hydrogel capsules, the capsules will gain molecular sensing, chemical-information processing, and mechano-chemical actuating functions, allowing the construction of functional molecular systems.</p>", "date": "2021-03-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biopolymers; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Interfaces; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In addition, UV/Vis Abs and ESI-MS data for a second-sphere variant that favored the planar substrate conformation showed that this change altered the enzymatic mechanism resulting in an alpha-biliverdin product. Single-turnover kinetic analyses for three MhuD variants revealed that the rate of heme monooxygenation depends upon the population of the ruffled substrate conformation. These kinetic analyses also revealed that the rate of meso-hydroxyheme dioxygenation by MhuD depends upon the population of the planar substrate conformation. Thus, the ruffled haem conformation supports rapid heme monooxygenation by MhuD, but further oxygenation to the mycobilin product is inhibited. In contrast, the planar substrate conformation exhibits altered heme monooxygenation regiospecificity followed by rapid oxygenation of meso-hydroxyheme. Altogether, these data yielded a refined enzymatic mechanism for MhuD where access to both substrate conformations is needed for rapid incorporation of three oxygen atoms into heme yielding mycobilin.<br />", "date": "2021-03-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we show that the synthesis of Cu2O\nNCs by this method is limited by the catalytic ability of copper to drive esterification and thus\nproduce Cu+\n-OH monomers. However, inclusion of 1-15 mol% of a group 13 cation (Al3+, Ga3+\n,\nor In3+) results in increased yields for the consumption of copper ions toward Cu2O formation and\nexhibits size/morphology control based on the nature of M3+\n. Using a continuous-injection\nprocedure where the copper precursor (Cu2+\n-oleate) and catalyst (M3+\n-oleate) are injected into\noleyl alcohol at a controlled rate, we are able to monitor the reactivity of the precursor and M3+\ncatalyst using UV-visible and FTIR absorbance spectroscopies. These time-dependent\nmeasurements clearly show that M3+ catalysts drive esterification to produce M3+\n-OH species,\nwhich then undergo transmetallation of hydroxide ligands to generate Cu+\n-OH monomers required\nfor Cu2O condensation. Ga3+ is found to be the \u201cgoldilocks\u201d catalyst, producing NCs with the\nsmallest size and a distinct cubic morphology not observed for any other group 13 metal.

Thus, here the reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation isemployed to explore it by tuning the nanoparticle (NP) concentration, the polymer-NPinteraction and the NP size. The shear viscosity (\u03b7~-m) exhibits a power law with theshear rate where m varies from 0.42 to 0.53 at high shear rates. By adopting the Carreau-Yasuda model, the obtained zero-shear viscosity gradually rises with increasing the NPconcentration, polymer-NP interaction or reducing the NP size. This is attributed to thestrong adsorption of chains by NPs and the formed network, which leads to the retarded dynamics. In addition, both the first and second normal stress differences also show power laws on the shear rates. The chains are gradually extended as the increase of shear rates, which is characterized by the mean-square end-to-end distance and the mean square radius of gyration. Especially, the evolution process of the NP network and the polymer- NP network is analyzed to deeply understand the shear thinning behavior. The number ofthe direct contact structure of NPs increases while the number of polymer-NP bridgedstructure is reduced. This is further proved by the increase of the formation probability of the NP network and the decrease of the polymer-NP interaction energy. Finally, the chain dynamics is found to be enhanced due to the shear flow.

Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) is a relatively less energy intensive separation technique, widely used in separation of lanthanides, actinides, and platinum group metals (PGMs). In LLE, the distribution of an ion between an aqueous phase and an organic phase is determined by enthalpic (coordination interactions) and entropic (fluid reorganization) contributions. The molecular scale details of these contributions are not well understood. Preferential extraction of an ion from the aqueous phase is usually correlated with the resulting fluid organization in the organic phase, as the longer-range organization increases with metal loading. However, it is difficult to determine the extent to which organic phase fluid organization causes, or is caused by, metal loading. In this study, we demonstrate that two systems with the same metal loading may impart very different organic phase organization; and investigate the underlying molecular scale mechanism. Small angle X-ray scattering shows that the structure of a quaternary ammonium extractant solution in toluene is affected differently by the extraction of two metalates (octahedral PtCl<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> and square-planar PdCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), although both are completely transferred into the organic phase.

Vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy, and complimentary atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on model Langmuir monolayers, indicate that the two metalates affect the interfacial hydration structures differently.

The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, regardless of whether the simulation data are restricted to ions at the air/water interface or to those in bulk liquid water.  Although the computed VIEs are sensitive to ion-water hydrogen bonding,  we find that the short-range solvation structure is sufficiently similar in the bulk and interfacial environments that it proves impossible to discriminate between the two on the basis of the VIE, a conclusion that has important implications for the interpretation of liquid-phase photoelectron spectroscopy.  More generally, analysis of the simulation data suggests that partitioning of soft anions at the air/water interface is largely a second (or third) solvation shell effect, arising from disruption of water-water hydrogen bonds and not from significant changes in first-shell anion-water hydrogen bonding. <br />", "date": "2021-03-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Interfaces; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Retrieving the real space structure of lipid bilayers from the scattering intensity can be a challenging task, as their fluid nature results in a liquid-like scattering pattern which is hard to interpret. The standard approach to this problem is to describe the bilayer structure as a sum of density distributions of separate components of the lipid molecule and then to fit the parameters of the distributions against experimental data. The accuracy of the density-based analysis is partially limited by the choice of the functions used to describe component distributions, especially in the case of multi-component bilayers. The number of parameters in the model is balanced by the need for an accurate description of the underlying bilayer structure and the risk of overfitting the data. Here, we present an alternative method for the interpretation of small-angle scattering intensity data for lipid bilayers. The method is based on restrained ensemble molecular dynamics simulations that allow direct incorporation of the scattering data into the simulations in the form of a restraining potential. This approach combines the information implicitly contained in the simulation force field with structural data from the scattering intensity and is free from prior assumptions regarding the bilayer structure.<br />", "date": "2021-03-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Ideally such investigations are performed <i>operando</i>, i.e., during a catalytic reaction. An example of <i>operando </i>measurements is to observe the degradation of fuel cell catalysts during an accelerated stress test (AST). Fuel cell catalysts consist of Pt or Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported on a high surface area carbon. A key challenge of operando SAXS measurements is a proper background subtraction of the carbon support to extract the information of the size distribution of the Pt NPs as a function of the AST treatment. Typically, such operando studies require the use of synchrotron facilities. The background measurement can then be performed by anomalous SAXS (aSAXS) or in a grazing incidence con-figuration. In this work we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the use of a laboratory X-ray diffractometer for <i>operando </i>SAXS. Data acquisition of <i>operando </i>SAXS with a laboratory X-ray diffractometer is desirable due to the general challenging and limited accessibility of synchrotron facilities. They become even more crucial under the ongoing and foreseen restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, it is not the aim to completely replace synchrotron-based studies, it is shown that the background subtraction can be achieved by a simple experimental consideration in the setup that can ultimately facilitate <i>operando </i>SAXS measurements at a synchrotron facility. <br />", "date": "2021-03-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrochemical Analysis; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we use a novel workflow based on the detection of molecular features of interest by high-throughput untargeted LC-MS analysis of patient body fluids combined with targeted molecular identification of those features using infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS), effectively providing diagnostic IR fingerprints for mass-isolated targets. A significant advantage of this approach is that in silico predicted IR spectra of candidate chemical structures can be used to suggest the molecular structure of unknown features, thus mitigating the need for the synthesis of a broad range of physical reference standards. Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1) is an inborn error of lysine metabolism, resulting from a mutation in the ALDH7A1 gene that leads to an accumulation of toxic levels of \u03b1-aminoadipic semialdehyde (\u03b1-AASA), piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C), and pipecolic acid in body fluids. While \u03b1-AASA and P6C are known biomarkers for PDE in urine, their instability makes them poor candidates for diagnostic analysis from blood, which would be required for application in newborn screening protocols. Here, we use combined untargeted metabolomics-IRIS to identify several new biomarkers for PDE-ALDH7A1 that can be used for diagnostic analysis in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluids, and are compatible with analysis in dried blood spots for newborn screening.

Despite their\nhuge potential, thus far, only a few stable electrides have been produced because of the intricate\nsynthesis they entail. Due to the difficulty in assessing the presence of isolated electrons, the\ncharacterization of electrides also poses some serious challenges. In fact, their properties are\nexpected to depend on the arrangement of these electrons in the molecule. Among the criteria\nthat we can use to characterize electrides, the presence of a non-nuclear attractor (NNA) of the\nelectron density is both the rarest and the most salient feature. Therefore, a correct description\nof the NNA is crucial to determine the properties of electrides. In this paper, we analyze the NNA and the surrounding region of nine molecular electrides with the goal of determining\nthe number of isolated electrons that are held in the electride. We have seen that the correct\ndescription of a molecular electride hinges on the electronic structure method employed for the\nanalyses. In particular, one should employ a basis set with sufficient flexibility to describe the\nregion close to the NNA and a density functional approximation that does not suffer from large\ndelocalization errors. Finally, we have classified these nine molecular electrides according to\nthe most likely number of electrons that we can find in the NNA. We believe this classification\nhighlights the strength of the electride character and will prove useful in the design of new\nelectrides.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>", "date": "2021-03-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Due to the disparity in acid-site strength, P-zeosils catalyzed the probe chemistry of isopropanol dehydration slower than aluminosilicate zeolites by an order of magnitude on an active site basis. Propene selectivity during isopropanol dehydration remained 20-30% higher than that of aluminosilicates, illustrating the distinct nature of the weakly acidic phosphorus active sites that favored unimolecular dehydration routes. Regardless of the confining siliceous environment, the nature of phosphorous active sites was unchanged, indicated by identical apparent uni- and bi-molecular dehydration energy barriers. Kinetic isotope experiments with deuterated isopropanol feeds implicated an E2-type elimination to propene formation on phosphorus-containing materials. Comparison of KIEs between phosphorus-containing zeosils and aluminosilicates pointed to an unchanged isopropanol dehydration mechanism, with changes in apparent energetic barriers attributed to weaker binding on phosphorous-active sites that lead to a relatively destabilized alcohol dimer adsorbate.

In this context, one crucial point concerns the comparison of the performance and accuracy of classical force fields (FFs), which sometimes remains elusive. To date, the assessments performed on different classical potentials are mostly based on the comparison with experimental observables, which typically regard average properties. However, local differences of structure and dynamics, which are poorly captured by average measurements, can make a difference, but these are non-trivial to catch. Here we propose an agnostic way to compare different FFs at different resolutions (atomistic, united-atom, and coarse-grained), by means of a high-dimensional similarity metrics built on the framework of Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP). We compare and classify a set of 13 force fields, modeling 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers. Our SOAP kernels-based metrics allows us to compare, discriminate and correlate different force fields at different model resolutions in an unbiased, high-dimensional way. This also captures differences between FFs in modeling non-average events (originating from local transitions), such as for example the liquid-to-gel phase transition in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers, for which our metrics allows to identify nucleation centers for the phase transition, highlighting some intrinsic resolution limitations in implicit vs. explicit solvent force fields.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2021-03-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

At a NbO<sub>x</sub> thickness of 30 nm, the\ncells retained 80% of the initial capacity after 493 cycles at 10 C, more than\ndoubling the cycle life of the uncoated cathode film. At the same thickness, the\ncoating also showed a positive impact on the rate performance of the cathode: 47%\nof the initial capacity was accessible even at ultrahigh charge-discharge rates\nof 100 C. Using impedance spectroscopy measurements, we found that the enhanced\nperformance is due to suppressed interfacial resistance growth during cycling.\nElemental analysis using TOF-SIMS and XPS further revealed a bulk and surface\ncontribution of the NbO<sub>x</sub> coating.

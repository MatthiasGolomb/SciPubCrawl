Understanding the impact of ILs on living organisms, especially from the aquatic ecosystem, is urgent, since on one side large amounts of these substances are widely employed as solvents in industrial chemical processes, and on the other side evidences of toxic effects of ILs on microorganisms and single cells have been observed. To date, the toxicity of ILs have been investigated by means of macroscopic assays aimed at characterizing the effective concentrations (like the EC50) that cause the dead of a significant fraction of the population of microorganisms and cells. These studies allowed to identify the cell membrane as the first target of the IL interaction, whose effectiveness was correlated to the lipophilicity of the cation, i.e. to the length of the lateral alkyl chain. Our study aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of the toxicity of ILs. To this purpose, we carried out a combined topographic and mechanical analysis by Atomic Force Microscopy of living breast metastatic cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) upon interaction with imidazolium-based ILs. We showed that ILs are able to induce modifications of the overall rigidity (effective Young modulus) and morphology of the cells. Our results demonstrate that ILs act on the physical properties of the cell membrane, and possibly induce cytoskeletal reorganization, already at concentrations below the EC50. These potentially toxic effects are stronger at higher IL concentrations, as well as with longer lateral chains in the cation.<br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Cell and Molecular Biology; Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Processes; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), rare platinum metal catalyzes today the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while iron(cobalt)-nitrogen-carbon materials (Fe(Co)-N-C) are a promising alternative. Their active sites can be classified as atomically dispersed metal-ions coordinated to nitrogen atoms (MeNxCy moieties) or nitrogen functionalities (possibly influenced by sub-surface metallic particles). While their durability is a recognized challenge, its rational improvement is impeded by insufficient understanding of operando degradation mechanisms. Here, we show that FeNxCy moieties in a representative Fe-N-C catalyst are structurally stable but electrochemically unstable when exposed in acidic medium to H2O2, the main ORR byproduct. We reveal that exposure to H2O2 leaves iron-based catalytic sites untouched but decreases their turnover frequency (TOF) via oxidation of the carbon surface, leading to weakened O2 binding on iron-based sites. Their TOF is recovered upon electrochemical reduction of the carbon surface, demonstrating the proposed deactivation mechanism. Our results reveal a hitherto unsuspected deactivation mechanism during ORR in acidic medium. This study identifies the N-doped carbon surface as Achilles' heel during ORR catalysis in PEMFCs. Observed in acidic but not in alkaline electrolyte, these insights suggest that durable iron-nitrogen-carbon catalysts are within reach for PEMFCs if rational strategies minimizing the amount of H2O2 or reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during ORR are developed.", "date": "2018-05-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Electrocatalysis; Fuel Cells", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This technology is mainly developed towards solar fuels and its potential for negative emissions has been largely overlooked. With high efficiency and low sensitivity to high temperature and illumination conditions, it could, if developed towards a mature technology, present a viable approach to fill the gap in the negative emissions budget.<br />", "date": "2018-05-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Such separations, especially the removal of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from methane, are of great technological relevance in the context of the \u201cupgrade\u201d of natural gas, landfill gas, and biogas. While more than 50 zeolite frameworks have been synthesised in aluminophosphate composition or as heteroatom substituted AlPO derivatives, only a few of them have been characterised experimentally with regard to their adsorption and separation behaviour. In order to predict the potential of a variety of AlPO frameworks for applications in CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separations, atomistic grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed for 53 different structures. Building on previous work, which studied CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixture adsorption in AlPOs (M. Fischer, <i>Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.</i>, 2017, <b>19</b>, 22801\u201322812), force field parameters for methane adsorption in AlPOs were validated through a comparison to available experimental adsorption data. Afterwards, CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixture isotherms were computed for all 53 frameworks for room temperature and total pressures up to 1000 kPa (10 bar), allowing the prediction of selectivities and working capacities for conditions that are relevant for pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA). For CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>mixtures, the <b>GIS</b>, <b>SIV</b>, and <b>ATT</b> frameworks were found to have the highest selectivities and CO<sub>2 </sub>working capacities under VSA conditions, whereas several frameworks, among them <b>AFY</b>, <b>KFI</b>, <b>AEI</b>, and <b>LTA</b>, show higher working capacities under PSA conditions. For CH<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures, all frameworks are moderately selective for methane over nitrogen, with <b>ATV</b> exhibiting a significantly higher selectivity than all other frameworks. While some of the most promising topologies are either not available in pure-AlPO<sub>4</sub> composition or collapse upon calcination, others can be synthesised and activated, rendering them interesting candidates for future experimental studies. In addition to predictions of mixture adsorption isotherms, further simulations were performed for four selected systems in order to investigate the microscopic origins of the macroscopic adsorption behaviour, <i>e.g. </i>with regard to the very high CH<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity of <b>ATV</b> and the loading-dependent evolution of the heat of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivity of <b>AEI</b> and GME.</div>", "date": "2018-05-29", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}
